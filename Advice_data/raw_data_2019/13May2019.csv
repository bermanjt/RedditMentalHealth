2,"Hey Guys !
Well i am a 18 year old voluntary worker at a refugee help.
To be honest i never had a girlfriend and i didn't have my first kiss too.
Im kinda feeling lonely and empty sometimes, as i can see most of my friends being in happy relationships and nobody of them can really understand me and my struggles.
I kinda handled my mental stress about it but 3 weeks ago a girl, for which i had feelings over 3 years back in school and got declined by her 2 times, came back in my life and now old memories are coming back.
Memories of my one-sided feelings and heartbreaks back then.

I have no thought about these kind of things when im busy...thats why i am trying to work as long as i can and work out...play games etc. Everything which keeps me away of thinking
But those moments where i have nothing to do...just like rn i can't sleep ... My brain doesn't stop thinking about it.

I feel lonely and have the feeling that i never lived a proper youth life and that my time is running away.
I just wanted to share my thoughts here and maybe somebody in a similiar situation has an advice for me.
Thank you for reading it ‚úåüèæ and i hope you ignored some of my mistakes",13May2019,1

4,"I [f] go to a university in Germany. Since the new semester just stared I met some new people and I became friends with a guy in my age.
 We really get along well but I have no sexual interest in him. But I noticed that when we text he tends to write stuff like 'yaaaas, slay girl, werk' and other stuff. I only know these terms through drag or the lgbtq community. I really enjoy texting with him and I absolutely don't mind the way he texts but it kinda sparked the question in Me that he might be gay. I really appreciate him as a friend so I am afraid that if I straight out ask it might offend him since masculinity can be toxic sometimes. He also is Muslim so maybe he is not out of the closet or feels offended when I ask him.

I know that it's also not a necessary thing to know but.. Well I am a nosy bitch.
But I want to in no way hurt our relationship or offend him.

Question/TLDR: How do I ask my friend from Uni if he's gay without potentially  offending him?",13May2019,3
5,"I‚Äôm moving out of my house soon, and one thing that‚Äôs making me anxious is feeling like I won‚Äôt have a support system anymore. I‚Äôve suffered from mental illness, and when things get really rough I‚Äôve been able to talk with my mom about it. 

Now I feel like it‚Äôs time to grow up and become a man, but I‚Äôm also scared I won‚Äôt have that support system anymore if something really bad happens.

Note: none of it is life threatening. It is simply things that make me very anxious/scared and it helps to vent. I just don‚Äôt want my mom to be the person I‚Äôm always in need of help with.",13May2019,1
6,"Today my parents got onto me about how I don't trust or listen to Fox News or how I don't like the president. They say I'm being brainwashed and that they want to save me from all this ""propaganda"" that they say is any other news outlet except Fox News. Even tho I'm 18 they say me having my own differing opinion is arrogant in their eyes because according to them, why would they lie to me? I'm not sure what to do, as I want to communicate with them and not have them treat me differently because of my beliefs, but at the same time I just can't agree with their false ideas about the world.",13May2019,1

8,"Hi, I'm dating this wonderful girl, she's pretty, with good manners, she has a beautiful smile and always cheers me up. A couple of weeks ago I was telling her that I was a good student and my favorite school subject was Spanish. When I ask for hers She told me that she went to school just the first two years of primary (5 to 6 years old) and other two years of middle school (14-15). I ask her the reason behind this, and she told me something like ""my older brothers and sisters doesn't finished school either"" and ""it was because of economic problems on my family"" but it doesn't convince me. She also cut herself on the left wrist a couple of years ago (before our relationship) and sometimes she's very depressed. I find it kind of weird because it apparently has a good family (both parents are married, two older brothers and an older sister), another thing is that she is ""smart"" for that lack of school education, she hates the grammar mistakes and its very eloquent.

I just need to know the reason behind this, i though about many causes like bullying, home schooled, sexual abuse or learning problems, but I want your honest opinion about this.",13May2019,1
9,"I work at a restaurant and it was really rough last night. Everyone was just in a bad mood and moping. I thought it was just a bad day though and didn‚Äôt think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting‚Äù during my shift. Just a busy Saturday.

I was working a double yesterday, most of us were. Around 4 hours in we had to ask if we were getting a break. We weren‚Äôt pushy, just asking so we could get our breaks in order. I overheard my managers mocking us for asking. One said ‚Äúohhh! I‚Äôve been here for four hours and I need a break!!‚Äù And laughing. I was there for ten and a half hours yesterday. By law I‚Äôm required to have a 30 minute break and I got 25. 
I didn‚Äôt mind and I let it go.

A couple hours later a coworker went out of his way to embarrass me. I mean in front of coworkers and everything. I wasn‚Äôt even apart of what was going on, I was asked to do a favor and I tried to help out. He prevented it and was rude about it. 

Then after work, I gave a coworker a free ride home. He asked me to stop at a gas station to get him some beer. I did and he stole weed out of my car. I didn‚Äôt notice until I got home. 

I sobbed for about 45 minutes. I felt stupid. I had felt stupid all day long because it was my first day in a new position at work. I just kinda broke. 

This morning I went into work and see the guy who stole from me immediately. It‚Äôs before work starts and I just go at him. I‚Äôm not confrontational by any means and haven‚Äôt really stood up for myself, but I did today.

The conversation goes something like this:

Me: where‚Äôs the shit you stole from my car

Him: what? What shit? (His face said it all) 

Me: (getting louder) you stole shit out of my car last night while I gave you a ride 

Him: what shit 

Me: you know what you did 

Him: lol k 

Me: No, you stole shit from me. Fuck you dude. 

After the whole ‚Äúf u‚Äù thing I walked out the back door. This entire argument was in front of about 10 workers including the manager.

I keep my cool at work, I don‚Äôt bring my personal issues in normally. I don‚Äôt think it does me any good and it usually bothers me later so I‚Äôm good about controlling myself. I just broke today though. He stole from me while I was doing him multiple favors. 

I just want to know how other people view this. How big of a baby am I being? Am I being a baby? I know this wasn‚Äôt ideal or cool to do. I did it though and I‚Äôm just trying to process my actions. 

Thank you!",13May2019,2
10,I guess I should start from the beginning. A little close to 2 years ago I met the man of my dreams. He was/is amazing we get along in every way. Everything with us just meshes. Anyways fast forward a bit I start to see red flags of drug and alcohol abuse. He wants to get clean get his life back in order. I break up with him but we stayed close friends as I know he doesn‚Äôt have many friends to help support him in getting clean. I also know that a relationship wasn‚Äôt what he needed to get sober. He decides to go to detox the first night there he did good the next night when the full effects of detoxing take affect not so good. He ended up in the hospital his body started to shut down he stopped breathing. He had to have emergency surgery and ended up with a bad infection in his lungs and around the stitches. He was in icu for almost a week and now in a regular bed for a few days. I have been up to see him everyday and it hurts like hell to see him in a semi conscience state. I feel so helpless. I don‚Äôt want to lose him. He was a rock when I needed him and I‚Äôm trying hard to be his. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for here is words of encouragement,13May2019,1
12,"I (20F) have certain opinions that my family wouldn‚Äôt agree with, particularly the older family members since the family is Catholic. Some of them are more strict than others but a lot of them are closed minded about some topics.

I guess I‚Äôll just say my opinions are more ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúmodern‚Äù. I support whatever people believe in as long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone, am cool with the LGBT+ stuff (though I‚Äôm straight) and agree that mental health is a huge issue. Meanwhile, my family are the opposite and even have some crazy gender rules. 

As a kid I obviously kept this stuff to myself or with siblings and friends to avoid tension or conflict. But I think now as an adult, I should be able to talk about my own thoughts instead of just smiling and nodding as my parents talk about something I don‚Äôt agree with. I‚Äôd love to be able to talk about serious and important topics without a debate turning into an argument. 

So how do people cross that bridge and go from smiling and nodding to freely having their own opinions?",13May2019,1
13,"So, I have been with my job for quite a while. It makes me miserable, and I‚Äôm stressed all the time. But, I need the health insurance. I‚Äôve been awaiting a surgery to diagnose me with endometriosis officially, and my doctor says, it may be able to help me conceive a child (I‚Äôve been trying for 6 years, and it‚Äôs my dream). If I quit, I can‚Äôt have that surgery which is a month from now. 

Now, if I stay I can surely have the surgery. BUT I start graduate school tomorrow. Looking at the coursework, and my full time schedule, I will have NO time to complete the major assignments. The assignments consist of interviewing people in the community for hours on end. Summer semester is two and a half months long, assignments are due about a month and a half in (this doesn‚Äôt include other minor assignments), so right after my surgery. What I‚Äôm going to school for is also a dream of mine. 

I‚Äôve thought about getting heath insurance through Marketplace and pushing the surgery, but I don‚Äôt know if I can afford a decent plan to cover the surgery. It‚Äôs just one of the most difficult decisions I‚Äôve ever made. I‚Äôve asked friends, made a pros and cons list, and honestly I still cannot decide. What do you think? Any advice?",13May2019,1
14,"I've been with my gf for a couple months and asked her to come on a trip to my sisters graduation then spend the next week on a trip with my family and extended family. I just don't think we're at a point in our relationship to spend a full week on a trip with family. She said she'd love to go, but we haven't really talked about it more than that. I just don't want this to be uncomfortable for her to be surrounded by my family 24/7 - who will certainly be interested in what is going on with our relationship and be discouraged/judgy by it not being stronger given the amount of time we've been together.

&amp;#x200B;

Just need some advice on how to talk to her about this. She just had surgery and will be on the tail end of recovery by the time we leave, which also makes me concerned that she'll be uncomfortable being in very close living conditions with my family while she's dealing with that.

15,"I'm a white, 20 year old, full-time, Criminal Justice major at my local University. We have a very diverse campus, so seeing someone of the opposite color is never much of a surprise. And as far as I've always been aware, no one in my family has ever been racist. Never would I have thought my parent to be anything of the sort either.
I had just finished cooking dinner for my family. We were watching season 1 of Supernatural, I have it on dvd, and in one of the episodes Dean reconnects with an old flame on a case. She just so happens to be African-American, and during a time where the two ""laid"" together. My parent said, ""That's the only time they did something wrong.""
At first I assumed they meant giving Dean an old love. They has always been a very big Dean lover, and I assumed they were jokingly being jealous. But I asked anyway, ""What do you mean?""
""She's black. A white person should be with white person, and a black with a black. I'm not even racist, but, otherwise there's nothing but problems,"" they said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
I immediately went quiet, I wasn't sure how to react. I had heard a similar phrase from them when I was younger, but at the time I assumed it was a joke too... Hearing it again kind of informs me that it isn't...
My little sister, who is under 10 years of age automatically agrees with my parent. She's a child, so that isn't that out of the ordinary. Upon seeing the two, ""laying"" on the screen. (Nothing inappropriate shows, I've seen the episode a million times) She said, ""Yeah that's disgusting.""
Thankfully at that point I had finished eating, and immediately stood up from the couch and walked into the kitchen to start doing dishes.
I'm going to have a private conversation with my sister about why that is perfectly okay (opposite colors being together, not what my parent said). But I don't want to have this conversation and it be completely forgotten overtime, due to things she may hear from other people. Any advice or maybe even an explanation would be greatly appreciated.",13May2019,1

19,"It started on Friday at 7 PM, when my mom told me to clean my room and then take a shower. So i cleaned my room, but since I had something to do i waited to take a shower until about 8:30. When i was getting ready, my mom came upstairs and barged into the bathroom, demanding that she know why I waited for so long to do what she asked. I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal because i had already done my chores and just needed to shower, but apparently to her it was a very big deal. She screamed at me that I was such an asshole for not listening, and started slapping me and trying to kick me. So i took a shower and went downstairs, and later my mom, having calmed down, warned me to listen to what she says instead of ignoring her. Then she happened to get a cold, and she blamed me for making her mad and consequently getting her sick, which doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. Fast forward to this morning, I didn‚Äôt wish her a happy mother‚Äôs day because I was still apprehensive about approaching her after her fit, and out of nowhere she calls me a shitty son. I tried to apologize to her for not listening (even though i felt that i didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve that much rage), but she said that she doesn‚Äôt care what I have to say. Now she‚Äôs refusing to talk to me or acknowledge me at all. She even told me to stop calling her ‚Äúmom‚Äù because i don‚Äôt deserve it. And she also told my dad that when she was yelling at me i was laughing (which i definitely wasn‚Äôt), and made it seem as if I didn‚Äôt clean my room when she yelled at me (which I did).

I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety really badly for the past 2 years as well as working almost full time just to keep myself afloat. I recently got accepted into a pretty good university (I‚Äôm at a community college rn) and I got accepted for advertising.

I am just now getting my grades and honestly this semester was the worst out of all of them. I‚Äôm talking 3 C‚Äôs and a B.

28,"When I was a kid I had aspirations of being a rescue swimmer for the coast guard. It was an unrealistic goal as I stopped playing sports after freshman year of high schooland got out of shape. I only played video games and literally didn't do anything with my life for years. I failed a basic pool lifeguard class. I couldn't even get in. I couldn't swim 50 yards. Fast forward to a couple months after graduating high school. I have nothing going for me. I had been dumped, started selling weed, arrested, lost 2 family members suddenly, lost my job, my friends where leaving me, got in a car accident, failed out of community college and a bunch of other shit- all in less than 6 months. When it rains it pours. Naturally thoughts entered my head about ending it but I have little sisters and I decided can't do that to them. So that meant I was going to stick around. I decided in whatever direction I was going to go I was going to need to get in shape. Started swimming every day. It was a process. It was the most frustrating thing I've done in my life. I hated being in the water early on. I would stick my face in the water and scream out of frustration while swimming laps bc it was annoying and mundane and boring.  But I forced myself to continue. Took a lifeguard class did well. Decided I was going to send it with the rescue swimmer thing. Fear of failure isn't really an obstacle when you're ok with dying. Signed up with the coast guard. About 5 months later I got a beach lifeguard job at the busiest most competitive beaches in my state. Did that gig for 2 months before bootcamp. Pulled out 14 people. Didn't get a lot of respect from the other guards bc I wasn't good at sports and had pretty shitty social skills. But I still pulled out 14 people. I go to boot camp and it was 200x more intense that I anticipated. Apprenlty the coast guard prides itself on how tough they make their boot camp. I didn't have a good time. While I'm in boot camp I find out my name is the name of a coast guard hero considered to be the greatest life saver in history. Kinda weird right? My parents didn't know. Just a happy coincidence. Then I got the best possible orders to prepare for rescue swimmer school. 

Now that leads me to the point- iv been here for more than 6 months. Im just not taking it seriously enough. I'm enjoying my life, making really good friends. Rescue swimmers do 20 years typically. I only ever planned on 4. It would probably take 4 years just to become a qualified rescue swimmer assuming I pass A school (80% failure rate) the first time. I'm still not good at sports however I'm fit as hell and fast in the water. I was considering going to rescue swimmer A school just to see how far I get. Was also also considering a more chill rate(BM) that also does search and rescue. Alot of BMs get out after 4 years. My life's got better and my burning desire to just fucking send it into the hell hole that is that A school has diminished. I still might do it just to give the story a good ending, pass or fail. Is that a good reason? There's alot of other opertunitys and a lot of things I could do on the outside too. I'm so close I  never followed through with anything in my life. I told myself I was going to see this through until the end. Prove people wrong. But also who cares. Who gives a shit what people think? Why should I live my life trying to impress people who don't think about me at all? The people that really care for me and matter the most will be there if I go rescue swimmer or BM. But at the same time I'm literally right here. I just have to execute. But at the same time I'm the happiest I've ever been with some really good people. Is my mind just trying to talk me out of going to water logged hell or have I out grown my childish dream ??? I'm conflicted your thoughts and takes would be appreciated.",13May2019,1

I recently moved into a new apartment in a new town but am completely alone. I broke up with my girlfriend and have lost contact with most of my friends through college and highschool due to heavy work load from my colleges and previous job. I'm trying to get out more make friends and find new girlfriend but really don't no where to start. For background information I'm 22, and living in Winston-Salem NC, not very religious and exciting.

Also Work is a main issue as I am part of management in a large plant so I have been told not to make friends with production employee and have been instructed to have limited contact on floor. ( I have to stay in my designed office area). The employees in my office are nice but significantly older than I am so not likely to be good friends.

I have several interest but none serious enough to get involved with online, I'm also not really into the subjects that much so the super serious groups turn me off. I'm also not the best looking so Tinder or other dating services has never been helpful.

The choices I think are best so far are

1) get a part time job in a restaurant ( I'm a pretty good/ experienced waiter and prep cook and try for my bartending licence later

2) start looking for groups in the area, ( like hiking clubs, volunteer, things like that to interact with.)

31,"To make a long story short, I (f) have caught real deep feelings for my friends with benefits (m) who was my very close friend for quite a long while before we started getting affectionate and became more than just friends with each other. The problem is that he‚Äôs made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship, not with me, not with anyone. Not only that but over time I‚Äôve started to realize that he‚Äôs an extreme narcissist and although he makes me feel like I‚Äôm on cloud 9, he too knows how to make me feel the absolute worst I have ever felt. I am so hooked onto the feeling that he gives me when he‚Äôs not being harsh or manipulative that I overlook the nasty moments. I know that‚Äôs stupid of me but anyone who‚Äôs ever been involved with a narcissist knows how good they can make you feel after they make you feel like garbage. It‚Äôs this constant toying of your emotions and you allow it because you‚Äôre in love with the feeling they give to you even though it doesn‚Äôt outweigh all the bad. 
They know exactly how to have power over your emotions and it‚Äôs insanity. 

 I spoke to him last night as we hung out just talking in my car, and I asked him jokingly (but secretly not jokingly) why he wouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship with me, and he told me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm untrustworthy and he doesn‚Äôt trust me.

I‚Äôm in very bad denial and it‚Äôs driving me insane how wrapped around his finger I am. 
I‚Äôm heartbroken because I know that this is the type of person that‚Äôll just destroy me but I am so afraid to lose the feeling that I have when I‚Äôm around him, I never feel this way about anyone ever and I don‚Äôt want to let it go in fear that I won‚Äôt find it again.

36,"My housemate and I are both gay men, I‚Äôm 21 and he (I‚Äôll call him Theo) is 24. 

When I started university three years ago I was in an abusive relationship. Theo was not my housemate but we studied the same subject and had the same group of friends. At the house parties we attended he often saw my boyfriend shouting at me to the point where I was crying. Theo responded to these instances by hitting on me and then getting very upset when I rejected him and told him I didn‚Äôt want to be him even if my boyfriend and I broke up. Theo was always very drunk during these instances. On one occasion he said he had been locked out of his house in order to get me to let him stay in my room. 

Soon after my relationship ended, I was drugged and sexually assaulted by a stranger. Theo was aware of this and yet continued to hit on me and get upset when I rejected him. Once I thought we had finally come to an understanding after a discussion on the subject. Feeling like he understood, I began being less uncomfortable around him, only for him to interpret this as me being attracted to him. I‚Äôm autistic and often interpreted as quite a cold person, so I‚Äôd be surprised if me being ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù came across to anyone as me being interested in them. I began to avoid social occasions to avoid Theo. 

I soon took a leave of absence from university due to the stress (Theo was a part of it but there were many other elements). I returned the next year, developed a new circle of friends, and would just talk to Theo on occasion. Theo entered a long term relationship, and, trusting in the long time since we had met and his commitment to his partner, I made the decision to live with Theo and three of our friends for my third academic year. My other friends and family members warned me against this, but I naively thought things wouldn‚Äôt be at all like first year.

Theo and I moved in together in July last year, and things went very well. I soon began to consider him one of my best friends. 

Perhaps due to my autism and/or a long history of sexual assault, I find all forms of touching to be quite intimate, and, aside from the occasional brief hug, do not make physical contact with anyone, not my parents or grandparents, not my closest friends. I only make skin contact with people I‚Äôm in relationships with, and that is how I like it. I feel uncomfortable telling people this and usually trust in people picking up on my reactions to being touched. Fortunately, most people pick up on this well; my friends ask if they can hug me before attempting to do so, and with most good friends and close family, we just do a routine hug when parting ways, which I am fine with. 

Theo is not like most people. He‚Äôs naturally a touchy feely person, and seems unable to pick up hints. I trusted it wasn‚Äôt sexual as he does it to the women we live with too. There was an occasion several months ago where I mentioned in conversation that I had some naked pictures of myself to send to a guy. He insisted on seeing them and began to attempt to steal my phone from me, which ended up in what he interpreted as playful wrestling. I got upset and he apologised, which I accepted. Lately, he has started blocking my way in the communal areas and play fighting me when I try and get past. I can‚Äôt really push him away or get away because I‚Äôm considerably weaker than him and have more of a flopping or freezing instinct when people do things to me that I don‚Äôt like.

Several weeks ago I finally told Theo that I don‚Äôt like being touched, but he has continued to do so and told me that I should‚Äôve told him earlier, as if that invalidated what I now said. I have started regularly pushing him away and telling him to stop whenever he touches me, but sometimes it starts in the middle of a conversation and I feel unable to bring it up. The touching usually involves sitting beside me on the sofa, and then putting his arm around me, resting his hand on my leg, or putting his head on my shoulder. Even if I make a point to sit at the very edge of the three person sofa he will sit very close to me. He has insisted on seeing my sex toys on numerous occasions, forcing me to lock my bedroom door. 

We both drink frequently, but Theo drinks at home alone whereas I drink with friends. I came home from my friend Charlie‚Äôs house this afternoon, as we had gone out the night before. Theo was inebriated (I didn‚Äôt realise at first) and proceeded to inspect my neck for love bites, pulling back my collar. He made sexualising comments about my shirt being undone (I had the top button undone, whereas I typically button it to my throat). He then proceeded to sit on my lap while talking to me, despite me to telling him to get off. He then started trying to block my path and pull me away while I was trying to make a sandwich. Finally he sat down and told me he‚Äôd been very upset at my friendship with Charlie. He had seen how close Charlie and I had become and he was feeling jealous. 

Theo told me he was feeling very sexually attracted towards me, but had no desire to be in a relationship with me, going on to criticise my personality. 
I gather from people‚Äôs reactions towards me that I am generally considered a ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù or ‚Äúcute‚Äù guy. I understand that while many find my honesty, intelligence and deadpan humour charming, many more are put off by my lack of warmth, my specific interests, and my bluntness. In my worst moments I‚Äôve been called ‚Äúmanipulative,‚Äù ‚Äúcruel‚Äù and ‚Äútwisted.‚Äù 
Being considered sexually attractive yet emotionally unpleasant is a particular sore point for me, as it is had fed into the abuse I have suffered, has tainted my relationships, and has even led my relatives to advance me as a pride to the family while privately disliking me as a human being. 

Theo is still in his long term relationship, and has no intention of ending it. Nonetheless, his sexual attraction towards me is something he describes as overwhelming (something I do not understand as my attraction to someone is intrinsically connected to their personality and is inherently romantic). He seems almost frightened of cheating on his boyfriend, as if I have no agency in the decision. He recently told me that when I visit my grandparents (typically for one night) he misses me more than his boyfriend, who he doesn‚Äôt see for up to five days at a time. On occasion, I have seen Theo rolling his eyes when his boyfriend attempts to converse with him while he talking to me, and he will even make contact with me despite my wishes while his boyfriend is in the room. 

Theo and I are living together next year, with no other house mates. I struggle with my mental health a lot, and now I am very upset and anxious about what the coming year will be like. Theo‚Äôs behaviour is making me repulsed by him. He has no respect for my privacy or my wishes to not be touched. He sees me as an annoying sexual object. I have very little choice other than to live with him next year, but I‚Äôm concerned about the sexual harassment I may endure. With our bedrooms on the same floor (rather than my own being two floors above his as it is now), I‚Äôm more worried about him violating my privacy. Despite being in a relationship for two years, he has demonstrated that he is easily made jealous of my relationships with other men. 

Charlie and I are nothing more than close friends, yet Theo talks about him distastefully, mistrusts him for no good reason, and gets annoyed when we see each other. I recently went on a date with a guy who had a foreign name, and Theo would continuously pronounce it incorrectly. I want to be in a relationship soon and I‚Äôm worried that this will only feed into Theo‚Äôs unpleasant behaviour, rather than making his take a step back as I had once hoped. 

I have considered compelling him to leave our new property (my mother is our guarantor) but I fear for the social repercussions, as he would never be able to tell his boyfriend or our friends the reason why, which would only paint me as an unpleasant person. Nor do I wish to cause him the stress. There is a reasonable chance I may be able to find somewhere else to live, but I lack the money to do so, and it would also leave my mother as the guarantor to a property occupied by people she doesn‚Äôt know or trust. 

I think it will be easier to be live with Theo as planned, but I‚Äôm having a difficult time at university as it is and I‚Äôm scared for what the coming year may entail. I‚Äôm open to any advice on how I should handle the situation. I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôve not always communicated with him as well I could have. Thank you for reading this long post and hopefully responding! 

TL;DR
My housemate, who I will be living with for the next twelve+ months, has told me he strongly desires to have sex with me. He has a history of violating my wishes for physical contact, has demonstrated jealousy towards my friends and partners, and I am concerned for my safety and mental wellbeing.",13May2019,1
38,"So my PSU died and I ordered some new components to build a PC as I use it literally everyday (studying computer engineering). This couldn‚Äôt have happened at a worse time as I‚Äôm taking 3 online classes this summer, so I ordered off amazon with 1-2 day shipping. Items were to arrive today, they usually arrive around 5pm my time. So I‚Äôm just waiting patiently and checking amazon every 10 minutes to see if my packages have arrived or listening for the doorbell or knock on door. It‚Äôs 6:30pm and Amazon updated. Now based off the items and sizes I suppose, there were supposed to be 3 packages. One of them said it was delivered at 5:30pm on my front porch, the second one says it was unable to be delivered at 5:49pm, and the third says it was also delivered on my front porch at 5:50pm. I go outside to check for my packages and nothing. None of the 3 packages are there. This is very strange because the times of the packages being delivered are different although they are all being delivered by USPS as it is Sunday and they deliver the vast majority of my packages. It is also strange that one package was unable to be delivered and there was no note left by USPS as they usually do when they can‚Äôt deliver something or when they attempt delivery but owner isn‚Äôt there, as they usually only leave packages with the owner after knocking and not just leave it there on the floor outside. I called amazon only to be redirected to USPS and now I have 2 cases open. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what to do from here. I‚Äôve had a case before when a graphic card did not arrive and USPS never did anything about it, the case went for over a month and nothing. Now when I really need my PC for my online classes I can‚Äôt deal with another delay and I just literally spent $750 on these items. I don‚Äôt know what to do because last time I got shafted and nothing happened, this time I really need a computer and I can‚Äôt afford to just buy new pieces like I did last time. I‚Äôm 22 and currently unemployed (quit my job at restaurant recently because of their terrible management and my work schedule was interrupting my classes). Parents can‚Äôt help me because we just bought a house and literally have no pocket change also I‚Äôm paying for my own classes with my own money I‚Äôve saved up.

46,"So about seven ears ago I beat the battle of anger management, but three years later I started feeling really upset all the time, not mad... more sad. Now anger management taught me how to deal with anger so I started using that same technique on my other feelings. And I‚Äôve trapped myself. I listen to music to calm myself down, and make me less sad. But now I wonder through life doing the same things everyday carrying on with my ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù that I‚Äôm not really sure if I even enjoy for the fun of it or for the fact that it keeps me busy.

A couple years ago my now best friend asked if I was depressed or needed help. I said no. Boy do I wish I hadn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve gone the past 3 years of my life like this. I feel nothing, except my anger and rage. I‚Äôm starting to lash out and my normal coping plans aren‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll hurt my friends if I flip out.

My bf and I were having a lack of communication and some other issues, and I wasnt getting treated how I felt I deserved so I ended it.

I live in a house with my mom and sister and my moms half disabled and me and my sister don't get along,i don't really like any of my family to be honest as they shout loads so i don't talk to them.

That was a giant chunk of context but i have one question answered from people other than my friends ,there's a girl in my history who sits next to me on my row (my friends also sit to the other side) she used to drive us crazy but ever since year 10 started she has been alot more calm .i haven't talked to here much before but recently she has been talking to me more in lesson and i realised i really like her; i got this idea from her asking if i skate a couple weeks ago ,i said a little bit  and she proceeded with ""i like skater boys ,they are hot"" and then last week she asked to draw on my hand ,i said yes and she drew a rahwr meme on it ,(this was on my scared hand) she said i have nice hands and i said thank you ,the next day she kept asking how i got the scar and she followed with how she got a scar of hers after i told her.
I couldn't stop thinking about her on that Friday and i dreamt about it that night ,yesterday i woke up and i felt like i had expierinced something amazing,i told my close friend how i feel and he said it seems like she's interested in me,i think this as well but i barely know her and i asked how do i start to know her as im not good at all at talking ,he said i should ask her what to watch on nextflix but i don't know if to or not ,i lve thought about it alot and i asked them if they were out of my league as my mother is on benefits and i don't go out as i live a while away from my school.

56,"I'm sorry for my grammar, english is not my first language.

So a bit of context, my mom hated her youngest brother and his family. It's probably due to their behavior and entitledness. To make matters worse my grandfather (mom's dad) broke his hip bone which needed operation. We are not a rich family, no one in my mother's relatives were. So when my grandfather's hospital bills came up the siblings (my mom and 2 uncles) had to split it. The youngest brother would always say they don't have enough money to give and always went the cheap route when contributing to my grandfather's well being for example: he would buy the cheapest stuff and medicine/pain killers and did not contribute the same amount his siblings gave, instead my mom being the oldest of the 3 took the responsibility to pay for most of the expense. Which is hard considering I was still at uni and my brother in law school (idk how she does it). She was always pissed at her brother and his wife for their poor life choices and apathy towards their father. 

Now for the issue:
My family and our relatives are close, we even live on the same compound and our houses literally just a few meters apart. Yesterday, I was invited by my aunt, wife of said entitled uncle, to go to gym. I told her I had no extra money for pass, so she gladly said she would pay for me. I never had a chance to experience gym, so I gladly took the offer. We had an instructor who taught me how to use gym stuff etc. Fast forward when we got home- my mom was  a n g r y. At first she was angry at my aunt because she said she didn't have money, but here we were wasting money on luxury, which is gym. Now she's angry at me for supposedly taking side with my aunt and was angry that I was using my aunt as a role model. Nope I do not. She has been taking out her anger to me since yesterday, throwing hurtful words, going as far as saying that I should just kill her or myself, and that she was no longer my mother, my aunt was. It fucking hurt and I reached my tipping point at dinner last night when I tried to share to her my perspective. She had cut me off all throughout and I was just so mad I was crying. She mocked me for crying and said I don't have the right to cry because I was the one wrong. I mean sure, maybe going to the gym was a bad thing to do considering we were saving money, but it wasn't my money, it was my aunt's. Why is she always transferring her anger to my aunt to me? 

I need advice guys, I have no idea what to do, I think I did nothing wrong and I don't want to apologize to her. How do I show or let her know that she's angry at the wrong person? Also my graduation is near and I need money to pay for my toga rent. I'm afraid to ask mom, what should I do? I cant ask dad because all of his money goes to her because she's the one handling all the finances. I'm really tired of having issue's like this with her, I no longer want to engage with her but she's still my mom and I still love and respect her. I'm just really tired. I'm not capable of going independent yet so I have no option but to try and have an agreeable relationship with her. But I'm tired if bending my knee to her, I want her to see my side without further fracturing our relationship. I'm tired of this, should I just bite my pride and apologize?",13May2019,1

But my family again have doubts and questions and they say they do not know him well enough and that i should reconsider or delay it more. But its been 4 years! how will i know the absolute truth unless he moves here and we live together and we spend time together in person??? I told them i will have him sign a prenup and also not have sex with him yet as i am a virgin/. I explained to him yes he will live here but we really need to take time and test this relationship out for good and if things go terribly we both need to understand we can leave . But we need to give our relationship a real chance in person. My family knows this and they are still very iffy.

&amp;#x200B;

So then the other day ...we get into a fight and i ignore him. Then he runs to my sister, calls her up and asks her oh where am i? And he curses me...calls me a cunt ? My sister tries to find out why he said that and hes like...oh hes pissed off! My sister tells him she doesn't know where i am and hangs up. But she is offended as hell and angry at him for slandering my name. Ofc she goes to my mother and my other sisters and tells them the whole story. And they want to have an intervention with me and convince me to leave him and discuss everything ...and ""they want me to see reason"". My sister says she does not support us and she gives me back the wedding invitation as she cannot participate in a wedding between two people who shouldn't be together.

&amp;#x200B;

But here is the other part that they do not know........ he left a job he enjoyed and loved for me because i told him that he needed atleast 35k saved before he could move to Canada. So now he works 12 hours a day Mon- Fri and 5 hours on Saturdays . All for me. Also, hes works out every day for an hour because i told him what i like physically in a man and he wants to try and get it for me. Also, he is leaving his family, his home, his friends, behind all for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the thing with my family is...they love me but they dont see me for me. I always feel like i live in my families shadow. I am present but never included. I am the middle child and always feel neglected, and ignored, and not considered. However, i do  everything  for them i have the utmost respect for my mother and i do whatever she asks ( and she asks me for everything and never asks my 3 other sisters for anything) but i dont care i lover her and i all i want to do is please her. I am a people pleaser...whenever someone i love is unsatisfied because of me i always blame and hate myself for it cause i just want everyone to be happy. It hurts knowing that i am causing my family discomfort and they worry about me .

&amp;#x200B;

I am upset that my bf and my family dont get along. I feel like i am constantly at war trying to defend both sides to the other. I feel torn apart... like i am being pulled in 2 different directions constantly ..everyday. My heart is getting worn out and I am not sure what to do here.

&amp;#x200B;

Do i stay with him or call the wedding off? Please help me... i need all the advise i can get.",13May2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

My dad recently told me that he had found my grandma on the floor of the bathroom unable to get up. All 3 of us live separately--my grandma stays with my aunt (who is out working \~10 hour days M-F), my dad lives about 10 minutes away from my aunt (he works in the evenings) and I live about an hour away from both of them.

I was wondering if there is any device that my grandma could have on her at all times (like Life Alert) but instead of dialing 911, it would dial either me or my dad so that we can take appropriate action. He is afraid that if we have a device that calls 911 directly, she won't know what to do and they won't know who to contact immediately.

I apologize if this is the wrong approach--I am not sure what steps to take and this is what my dad proposed we find for now.

68,"So, I am a senior at my high school and have been a part of a club for all four years of high school. I was the club's President last year but go demoted to a lower position because of stigma in our club with having a two term President. I lost a lot of motivation over my senior not only in this club, but all of my school work due to serious mental health issues (depression/suicide). We have a morning class (a class before regular school starts) that I was a part of last semester that is required for all club officers, but I dropped it at my guidance counselor's recommendation. It was agreed that I would at least attend the weekly club office meeting during that class, but not have to come for the rest of the week. I kept a pretty good routine going and regularly attended these meetings, but I started to relapse with mental health issues. I stopped going for a while without giving my fellow officers any notice neither my teacher. When my mental health got a little better I honestly just got lazy and started prioritizing my AP classes and friends not in the club. I know a lot of what I have missed was planning our end of year banquet (a pretty big deal for our chapter) which requires a lot of work. I also need to mention that we have a total of two officers of six quit and another in the same boat of being no help at all so a lot of this work has been handed to two people. 

So after ghosting my club for so long I finally went to an event where we volunteered at a local greenhouse to raise money for the non profit that runs it. Another officer was there as well and was noticeably upset with me (ignored me, glared, etc.). So, I finally got the courage to apologize to her but was met with really harsh words. She thanked me for the apology but explained that the damage had been done and that the banquet is a mess and it is partly my fault. 

So, I am asking whether I should even bother going to this banquet. I haven't done a single thing for it, never seen the script we need to follow, or anything that will be happening. I feel like a huge asshole for ghosting them and leaving them to hang dry, and in no way are my actions acceptable since I signed up for the position and its responsibilities. If I go to the banquet completely unprepared I feel like I will further this shit show that has been brewing. I also know I will be met with a lot of blatant verbal criticism by the other officers and members of the club if I go, and I am not sure if my overall self esteem and mental health could deal with that.

I had a child a couple years after high school with my first serious girlfriend, we got engaged shortly after our daughter was born.

She cheated on me and got pregnant, with my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù, a month after we got engaged. I broke. The next four years I spiraled into a pattern of bouncing from one dead end job to the next, drugs and alcohol, toxic relationships, depression, and general poor life choices.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to confront the girl (let's call her Mary) and apologize to her. I figured she deserved an honest explanation regarding what happened at practice. So I got to the dining hall early today and waited for her. My plan was to time my exit with her's and just casually bump into her and initiate the conversation. Unfortunately, she never showed up. 

So the Snapchat app has a feature where you can check someone's location on a map. Most people have location sharing turned off, but lucky for me Mary didn't. I caught up to her outside the dorms. She didn't see me at first, so I called out to her. She turned around, saw me, and continued walking as if I wasn't there. I said her name again, but she still ignored me. 

This is where things went south. I jogged the last couple yards to close the distance between us, and reached out to grab her arm. I just wanted to stop her and get her to turn around for a second so we could talk. Well, as soon as I touched her arm she WHIPPED around, caught me on the side of the head, and sped off. I was kind of shocked so I just stood there and didn't follow her. She ran almost all the way to her dorm and slammed the door behind her.

I didn't know what to do, but I really didn't want to leave the matter unresolved. I walked up to her door and knocked, but got no response. I knocked again and waited. After a couple minutes I pulled out my phone to text her to let me in. Just then, a pair of campus police officers turned the corner. One of them pointed at me, and they walked up to me and asked to see my student ID. They started grilling me, asking me what I was doing, and I explained to them that I was trying to talk to a friend. They told me they had received a call about a stalker and told me to leave the premises immediately. Needless to say I got the fuck out of there after that.

My dad has this pattern it seems where he will find one person to become a bit of a ""scapegoat"" (I'm not sure if I'm using that right) but he will focus all his stress and anger into this one person. He will often make up delusions about this person. This person used to be my uncle from my mom's side who used to live with us, up until we found out about all the anger my dad focuses on him. He left for the Philippines once, and when he came back, my dad wanted to fight him. My dad's brother was on the phone with him trying to calm him down and my sister was at our house trying to distract and calm him down as well. Neither of them were successful. My dad put on his old steel toe boots, ready to fight and was at the door when my uncle from my mothers side came home.

So yeah, that is how much his anger towards him built up. But now that his old ""scapegoat"" (my uncle) moved out, his focus has turned towards my boyfriend. I am a bit young (younger than 18) so I understand some tension he feels towards my boyfriend. But it has gotten to the point where my dad threatens to hit him behind his back and he makes delusions to himself that my boyfriend leaves trash around the house.

89,"I'm still fairly young (22) so this is the first time anyone I know is getting married, so it already was quite the shock, but it turned out to be my first love too. I know in the end, this is a decision I should take myself, but I don't know if I should go or not. 

To summarize our relationship quickly, she was basically the first and only girl I actually loved in my life. We were best friend for a while and she rejected me, leading into us losing contact overtime. To be honest I never really moved on, I've had relationships since then but I've never really opened myself up to anyone again. 

And here we are, I got invited to her marriage. I feel like going would be kind of like admitting defeat in a way but I also feel like that's immature and I should be happy for her. I just really don't know what to do. Would it be a ""cuck"" move to go ? And at the same time, I feel like going might be a pretty devastating blow to me, seeing her getting married could actually be traumatizing in a way.

109,"We are both autistic. This woman never said she likes me as a boyfriend and explicitly said she only likes me as a friend and ever will, after I had told her that I like her as a girlfriend. However, her brother and our therapist told me she likes me as a boyfriend and was wary of dating anyone only because her previous ex inappropriately touched her. Our therapist also told me her mom told her she likes me as a boyfriend, and she and my mom told me that we are going on dates and she will later want to be my girlfriend if I am friends with her and do not call them dates now. Going forward, I never mentioned that I intend to be her boyfriend. She dropped obvious hints like initiating to hug and hold my hand, asking ‚ÄúAre you nervous?‚Äù on a date, a vibe, saying ‚Äúafter we are just friends‚Äù she can drive me around and asked what if we are an actual dating couple in the future.

After 2 months and before our 10th date, my mom called her my girlfriend, so I asked her to kiss me because I wanted to get my first kiss, and she said yes and kissed me with tongue. I asked her in person so she would not change her mind or get advice, and a break-up would be worth my first kiss. My therapist suggested I tell the group against my gut instinct and that we are official, and put me on the spot, so I did, but her brother said he will not tell. This should not distract judgment (not arguing, but it is insignificant context in the broad scheme). 2 days later, worried, I asked her if she is upset. She sent me a text saying ‚ÄúWe are still friends and we will see each other tomorrow. It is not like we are boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. I just have a different agenda than yours.‚Äù. I asked her what I did that made her think I thought we were more than friends, and she said she was sorry she said that, but the damage had been done and was unable to take it back. I repeated the question and asked if we can still be friends ‚Äùlike we were before we kissed‚Äù, digging myself deeper in the hole of agony and despair, and I told her that I will give her some time to decide if she truly wants to be friends with me. I showed my mom the convo, who advised me to apologize and say that I value the friendship and I did and then she apologized too. Ok, fair enough. I later realized that as often when not told something, people think of the worst case scenario, and it was not because I told the group, because she read the text and was already ignoring me before her brother could have told her.

The next day, she rested her head on my shoulder and said the kiss felt good, but gradually withdrew more distant in the next 7 weeks. She did not hug nor sit by me in the car because she feared it will lead me on. My mom talked to her mom who said she only wants to be friends. I ended the friendship because I did not want a friend who was uncomfortable around me, and at our therapists‚Äô office I confronted her in the hall about our text conversation.

TL;DR: While I respect that she said that she only wants to be friends, **she made it very clear to me that she KNEW that I wanted more, and yet she still did not tell me what I said or did that implied that I wanted more, and said she is sorry for saying it which seemed like taking it back and contradicting it, and rested her head on my shoulder the next day, and then got mad when I continued doing whatever I did that upset her.**",13May2019,1

Background: The girl of this topic has always been the most important person to me in and outside of the friend group. Even though I deeply care for my other friends I feel as if I can‚Äôt live with out my best friend. 

First semester was great, we all kept in contact and hung out when we were all home. However second semester she became very distant with everyone from our high-school friend-group. She was in a fresh relationship and I was happy for her. Everyone else in our friend group wrote her off and decided to cut ties completely (if she wasn‚Äôt going to put in the effort then they were not either) but I held on to my best friend cause I know I can‚Äôt live without her. She has helped me through more than I can express. 

Now it‚Äôs the beginning of summer and we are all home, I have hung out with my best friend 3 times in the month I‚Äôve been back from uni. She made friends while I was at school and I‚Äôm so happy for her because she has people here for her but not I feel like I‚Äôve just been replaced through and through.

We would always tell each other everything and now she doesn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt tell me she got accepted into a program in the city for a career she didn‚Äôt even mention before. She didn‚Äôt tell me or come to me when her and her bd broke up, I only found out when I asked about him. And when we hang out she just talks about her new friends and everything they do and how they make her feel. And it‚Äôs emotionally painful to hang out with her because of this. 

I can‚Äôt stress enough how I‚Äôm happy for her and that she is getting her life together. However I can‚Äôt help but feel replaced and alone. I feel like I have lost everyone now. And now I‚Äôm stuck in a dead beat town for almost 4 months and have no one.

I have a small Instagram page where I post cosplay and voice snippets here and there you know, normal crap. A few days ago I recorded my voice with the Snake meme, and I got offered a sponsorship. Clearly I was excited and extremely happy but I felt off... firstly I don't have more than 100 followers one. And two, this was a ""gaming company"" clothing store. MK gaming or what not. They asked for basic information and sent me a link with a ""10% off"" code which... also confused me? They have a handful of pictures on their page. 6 or 7? And there isnt really anything about them online. I dunno what to do. Do ambassadors usually have to pay? Am I just being a choosing beggar in this? 

To make a few things clear:

1.My page is very small. I in no way have enough following in my opinion. 

2. I didn't approach them first. They approached me. I didn't ask for free merch but I thought that maybe this is normal and you... do have to pay to be a merch ambassador? 

3. There's nothing about this clothing brand anywhere. I've done extensive research and came up with next to nothing.

113,"*contains mild sexual stuff, nothing too explicit*
I (21M) have been going through a mental funk for awhile.I'm going through college and trying to be more active in my social life, dating, meeting new people,learning new skills, everything you see college brochure. But I have alot of negative thoughts that keep recurring in my head.  In the beginning of college, I kinda went through a mild porn addiction, it wasn't insane, I just didn't have much of a hobby and was living in a apartment of campus at a college that had very few dorm. I became isolated and I wasn't the best at making friends, so I had free time on my hands. I wasn't going crazy with it, no 3 to 6 hours of looking at porn a day but probs more than I should have.

From this I gained a liking to faux-incest porn. It started with this older sister talking to a younger brother and them leading into having sex. I feel into looking at it from time to time, gifs vids and even one or two sex stories. I'm not sure if was actually into incest, cause often I would still get uncomfortable when using brother/sister or mother in the dialogue, but I still liked enjoyed the idea or a slightly more mature women, kinda showing you sex, and even being impressed by your skills (probably from my own sexual insecurities). I even looked up "" real incest porn "" once (don't do that) and found one video where I thought the girl was pretty hot, thought it was probs fake not sure. I remember even starting to JO but I don't think I finish cause the idea that it might be real got into my head and just really weirded me out. But if I ever thought to my self , hes having sex with his mom/sister, I'd get really uncomfortable and have to put it away. About 70% of the stuff I looked at creeped me out.Maybe part of me liked the taboo, never in real life, but being with in porn I could atleast push it out my real thoughts on incest out.

About a year passd and the porn starts to weird me out so I stop looking at it, even almost wanting to throw up when thinking back on some. I'm tried moving  on and building my life, but this nagging itch keeps comming back to me  like""you liked a video of a dude having sex with his mom"" and stuff like that and it drowns me with anxiety. Conjuring up situations in my head like what if I get a girlfriend and she finds out and dumps me, and situations that I know most likely will not happen. Just it getting out there somehow and I don't know how to help with this fear. I have an older sister ( who I've never thought of that way just incase you were worried lol) and I can't imagine what that'd do to our relationship

I've considered possibly  talking to a therapist later in life cause of this ( no money and live semi with my parents still), but till then I've considered different forms meditation, creating a workout routine or really getting into some of my new hobbies, but I fear this fear will always exist in me and I'm just not sure how to deal with it, any advice would be great that you.",13May2019,0

My girlfriend has problems with low self-esteem, major depression, and possibly bi-polar disorder (it runs in her family). She is also 2 years younger than me (I'm 18 M and she is 16) so this could cause some things to be harder to help.

No matter what I do to help she tells me that I don't care yet she comes to me for her problems still. I know its hard for her but she overloads me. I've told her before that our relationship isn't therapist and customer its boyfriend and girlfriend but she always says that I don't care and that I hate her or something of that nature.

I love her with all of my heart and I make it known to her and everyone around me 24/7. I spend all of my time with her and make her laugh at every occasion that I can.

I also struggle with major anxiety but as of right now I'm seeing a psychiatrist/therapist. She however hasn't seen her therapist in ~6 months.

Her parents are not caring and give her no attention, so she seeks it where she can find it (which is 100% understandable) but I can't always guver her attention so she thinks I don't lover her and that she is worthless.

I've never once told her that she is worthless, in fact, I make it a goal to tell her good things about her everyday and to compliment her any chance I get.

Back to her parents. They are extremely lazy and abisive to her and eachother. The three of them are always getting in screaming matches and they always ask me for my opinion (which I believe I shouldn't have to give because its not my argument). I've had to get on to her mother for not calling and setting up appointments with her therapist and my psychiatrist which fairly she has finally done (after me telling her for ~4 months).

She also has no motivation and is struggling to keep up in school. She leaves old food and dirty clothes in her room for weeks on end (and I try to help clean up what I can).

She also expects a lot from me, I have to help her with everything and do wverything she wants me to do. If I fonnt then she will accuse me of not loving her or caring for her enough.

I know where this mentality comes from (her apathetic parents) and I can't help but feel sorry for her. I love her with all of my heart and she has gone down the deep end. I want nothing more than to reatore our relationship. It was good for a while but for some reason she has gone down. Any time she is upset I ask her whats wrong but she won't tell me. But at the same time if I don't pry it out of her she accuses me of all those things again.

I've depressed since I was 7 years old, and suicidal since I was 10 (I turned 16 in March). Every morning I wake up and am disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. I'm not sure if I either just want the pain to stop or if I actually want to die. I used to know for sure that I would never kill myself, but now I have no idea. 

Everytime I go into my kitchen or see a weapon my first thought is using it against myself, but when I tell my therapist this (I've been with her since September), she writes it off as me being depressed and moves on. I know she's a professional and I'm not even done high school yet, but I have this feeling like this is something that shouldn't be written off like some joke. 


I feel like I'm an actual threat to myself, and I'm scared that I might unwillingly do something to hurt myself. I don't know if I can properly control myself for long. I can't risk getting hospitalized because of my parents finding out or missing schoolwork. I don't know what to do. 

If I tell my therapist that I feel it's gone too far, she'll hospitalize me, and if she does that I'll be there for a long time and miss schoolwork, not to mention my parents would be so sad and amgry with themselves that they let me slip this far. If I don't say amything, though, I could really hurt myself and end up even more depressed than I am now (which doesn't seem possible at the moment).

118,"Hi all, I'm currently wrapping up my junior year at a prestigious  high school in the DC area. I took the ACT back in February and ended up getting a 12 on the writing (the best possible score). However, I was talking to my proctor recently (I have extra time so he works at my school) and he told me that he spell checked my essay. This really freaked me out. I consider myself an honorable person, and the last thing I want to do is take part in a fraudulent system that allows the wealthy to achieve access to elite schools. I'm in kind of a crappy situation. I can't tell any potential colleges or I'll get immediately denied because of the last few months events Because I got a 12, I basically cannot retake the test. My proctor has been really good to me and helped me make my way through school so I don't want to expose him and get him fired. I brought up the idea to my mom of asking my proctor if he can say that there was some kind of error with the writing, and ask the ACT organization to scrap my score and allow me to retake the writing segment. However, my mom got really worried because she thinks that the ACT would scrap my 34 as well, and that would be really bad for me (I've had some mood problems this year and it would be really detrimental to my health if I had to extent that level of energy again). My question is: what do I do? Do I tell my school and expose my proctor, who has petitioned for me and helped make accommodations for me in literally all of my classes? Do I ask the ACT board if I can just take the writing? Do I do nothing and just live with it? Need help.",13May2019,3

120,"I graduated last year with my Master‚Äôs degree and got a great job 4 hours from my boyfriend of &lt;1 year. We decided to try long distance because he was in a community college trade school at the time and there was a possibility of him moving to me after school. 

Fast forward to February and he was getting a lot of job offers that paid way more in his area for what he wanted to do. So he decided it was best for his job prospects to stay where he was. Our relationship is great, we never fight. We even worked well long distance. But we mutually broke up because of the unknown timeline of when long distance would end.

This breakup lasted 3-4 weeks before we got back together. Again, our relationship is great. We never fight, we have a really good time together. We talk about how we will ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù if we are long distance for a few years. 

Now, I‚Äôm starting to dislike my job and there aren‚Äôt other jobs in the area I live now. There is a job I‚Äôm interviewing for that is only 1.5 hours from him, and would be mainly remote so we‚Äôve decided that if I get it and if I take it, to live together where he is and I would have a small apartment to stay at the 3 days I need to work. 

This new job is similar to what I do now, but def a step up. Money wise and job title wise. It‚Äôs a larger company so there is also more room to grow.

My boyfriend added me to a group chat with 2 of his friends a while a go, so i have their numbers. 

Tonight while i was asleep, i accidentally called one of his friends. I fell asleep watching a TV show on my phone, my phone is set to never lock unless i physically lock it myself. 

I accidentally called him, whether i was half asleep and thought i was calling my boyfriend or maybe my hand just went over my phone, i don‚Äôt know - i don‚Äôt remember anything - i was completely out of it. 

When i woke up, the friends number was up on my screen so i checked my call list and i saw it had called him. 

I immediately told my boyfriend i called his friend by accident. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety, and i felt really embarrassed. So for a few minutes i was repetitively saying sorry and omg I‚Äôm so embarrassed.  

I text his friend, my text is:

‚ÄúHey dude its ____, i woke up and saw i accidentally called you in my sleep lmfao i‚Äôm sooo sorry üò© hope you‚Äôre well‚Äù

I still felt really embarrassed and anxious. So i was talking to my boyfriend about it. He started to say it was weird that i called him in the first place. He then said ‚ÄúHow would it be if i accidentally called your friend‚Äù.  I‚Äôm confused as to what i did that was wrong. 
He then said ‚Äúwhat if he and his girlfriend are arguing because some random girl called him‚Äù. 

I started crying because now i feel like i have fucked up. He told me if i was going to cry then to mute my phone so he couldn‚Äôt hear. 

Like i said, i struggle with anxiety and depression and now i feel like ‚Äúman i even fuck up when I‚Äôm asleep‚Äù lol. 

I just need to know if i actually did something wrong here, because i feel embarrassed and i don‚Äôt want me and my boyfriend to argue over an accident. 

It was just an accident, i don‚Äôt know what to do now",13May2019,3
123,"So basically im planning to move out in a couple months to another city. I still havent told anyone this because of the hirricane i know im going to cause. To do this im basically pulling out of college but im planning to continue over in my other city later on. As well as some big and hopefully successful life plans. 

My problem is that i know if i told my parents, there eventually going to tell my extended family which i hate! I dont like them knowing anything about me. I dont know if i should tell my parents my life plans cause i know they deserve to know and it would make them more relaxed about me pulling out of school. At the same time i dont want my extended family knowing my life.

124,"Alright so my identical twin brother and I have a strange relationship, we get along 90% of the time, but the other 10% of the time we are arguing. Earlier tonight, we had one of the worst arguments we've ever had. It had kinda been building up over the last few months, as we both have a tendency to rage very quickly at video games but continue to play them regardless. His rages consist of telling the thing that killed/beat him (in the video game) to ""fuck off 'thing that just killed him'"", and I tend to build up over time then explode at once and rage quit from the game. 

We have both been home from college for about two weeks now and we are both situated in the basement so we can be wired in to the router for the best internet. The way we are positioned, I can see him but he can't see me because he is in front of me. This has led to me noticing his rages very frequently, as I can see them in action. Notably, he has broken a chair in the past over rages by hitting the armrests until they broke. I have put two holes in the walls though, so I'm not really better.

So tonight, we had been playing a more tame game when we decided to join some friends who were playing a MOBA. So we play a few ""meme"" matches before we actually play a real match. My brother gets his best role and I get my worst role and the game goes on. He loses a lot of fights to his enemy laner and someone who comes to his lane kills him a lot. He does the ""fuck off \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" thing a lot during this match. The end of the match is now near, and it does not look like we are going to win. At this point, I'll be honest that I don't really know what happened but he said ""fuck off \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" about either us losing the game entirely or just him dying, and at that point I had had enough.

It's important though to have some more background info about how our friends feel about cussing in general. We all generally don't cuss, and we tend to not appreciate it when people do. So when myself or my brother cuss in anger over a game, that makes everything really awkward. One more thing to note: I had been trying to control myself after seeing my brother in person during his ""rages"", so at the time of this event, I hadn't cussed in a while (I think).

So my brother does that last cuss, and I decide to call him out over it. He flips out. He claims that I shouldn't have called him out because that would just make it worse. I say that I was sick and tired of his constant raging and wanted to finally call him out. We argue a lot, loud shouting is involved, my throat actually still hurts from shouting, he comes up to me 2 or 3 times and hits me fairly hard, and as far as I remember, I didn't hit him ever.

So what exactly do I need advice with? Well, it's a bit complicated. It involves my suspicion that my brother and I both have serious anger issues which are getting out of control. I honestly don't really know what to do at this point. Was I right in calling him out? Should I have just said nothing? Honestly, I'm a little dazed after that argument and just want to hear some other opinions.

125,"Some background: I've had my(18) license for a while now. I'm still in high school and go to places with my friends. One of them (17) doesn't have her license and probably won't for a while since her mom refuses to let her. Because of this, I offer to drop her off most places we go to. Sometimes I'll drive her home from work as well since we work shifts together often. 
Incident: After our shift today we went to target then and I drove her home on a route that passes by my house. When I got home I was told by my dad, who pays for my gas, that because I drive her home (a little out of the way) so often, she should pay for a tank or so of gas. I can get wanting to be compensated for something kind of expensive, but I thought it was unfair of him to ask of this because (1) he knows I offer to drive her and has never asked me to stop or asked her for compensation before now (which if he did I would have reluctantly stopped or at least hid the fact that I drive her home) and (2) I only offer to drive her so she can avoid spending $ on uber when she has to use that money for things like laundry, saving for college, and basic needs since her mom won't support her at all once she's 18 (which my dad is aware of).

I feel conflicted. If he asks about it again I plan on telling him that if he cares so much, I'll pay for a tank of gas with my own money (but he probably won't want to accept it if it's mine). His car gets great mileage so an extra mile or so out of the way is almost nothing to his cost of gas. It would make me feel much better to have a second opinion on this.",13May2019,2

131,"~Here because literally nobody is on r/sexuality

I think of myself as a somewhat effeminate guy, I have a big heart, I enjoy nurturing, I have a big soft spot for animals, I adore lame teenage romance movies, I like doing some girly things like help my friends pick makeup or dresses. I sometimes feel left out of trying makeup/dresses though.

I've lived my entire life acting as a boy, in first grade I remember wearing just the hood of my sweater and in my head pretending it was long hair, and I liked it like that, but I lived under a massive rock until ~9th grade so I thought I was just being funny, I didn't *really* have any meaning behind it besides I liked it and I thought I was so funny. Through elementary school when kids still played those roleplay games, I'd always pick/make up a female character, and even today in games like Skyrim with a character designer I still play as a female character. If someone mentions it I just say ""it's been my thing for a while, It just stuck"" thinking about it, in reality it was my way of being a female.

Until around 9th grade I was a big hermit I didn't go outside very often and I was an outcast, a lot of the time through my life I've thought to myself ""what if I was a girl?"" And things like ""I really wish I could wear that dress/shirt etc"" ""boy clothes are lame, I want this pink shirt instead, it's pretty"" I've always hated getting my haircut, when I was younger it was because it took too long, now it's more because I want to grow my hair out but my mom always forces me to get it cut, and I just accept because I don't want to get into ""do you want to look like a girl"" yet I always think it's way too short and getting it cut makes me feel shitty.

Around 5-6th grade, I overheard my mother talking to my brother about how one of her students' fathers transitioned to a female ""because he felt like a woman stuck in a man's body"" and that phrase really resonated with me, I immediately thought ""I feel like that describes me"" but I didn't know anything more, I didn't know about LGBT or anything else other than what I was gonna do in my game later, so it didn't really spark anything else in me. 

In 6th grade I wore these colorful pink tennis shoes and bought the sparkly gym shirt as opposed to the solid color one, I told everyone who asked that it was for a joke but in reality I enjoyed the way I felt wearing them.

I never really pay much attention to what my body looks like, I more don't care because there isn't much to look at but when I go to the pool I keep my shirt on because I really don't like showing my chest, it feels wrong to do so. I feel like I'd be more comfortable in a bikini bathing suit than some shorts and a shirt.

I have somewhat masculine interests, I've been taught to be a gentleman, I act, speak and naturally move like a guy. Usually this dysphoria pops up after a vacation more specifically a day at an amusement park, I don't know why but the entire time I'm at an amusement park all I can think about is ""I wish I was a girl"" and usually it causes a huge spike in these thoughts well after the visit.

I try to speak a bit softer, I focus on moving more femininely, I have a bigger interest in things like feminine fashion, makeup etc but after a while, max of a few weeks the whole thing starts to dissipate and I start not caring about what I look like again, what I'm called, the fact that I look like a Scion xB rather than a Nissan Cube in terms of curves vs angles and I just kinda live life not focused on much.

I tried to come out to my mother in private with a desire to transition in 7th grade but I really didn't know how to explain myself because I didn't have too much knowledge on transitioning or even knew how I actually felt. (Note: my family is really accepting of this stuff) Then in 9th grade after Disney World I tried again, getting a bit more out of my mouth, but I still didn't know exactly how I felt, since it ended up being a massive spike in dysphoria again and I ended up being all upside-down, flipped around and all over the walls.

After this second time I was ""boy"" again and generally didn't think about my desire to be a girl apart from occasionally thinking ""I wish I had boobs..."" Maybe a year or so later I got my first girlfriend, she's bisexual and I was fine by that, she liked me, I was her first, so in a way I thought of her as straight. Through the relationship and underlying abuse she kept putting me through, I was still ""boy"" and didn't think at all about being ""girl"".

After the relationship ended finally, I spent time looking for other people to date, no luck as of yet but at my school it's got around 80 people and a big majority of them are *quite* out about their sexuality. I never knew why but I always ended up clicking with these groups, I used to think it was just the unnecessary and overabundance of dick jokes but idk now. I'm straight, I like girls only, I wouldn't be out about my sexuality at all, if I did transition I'd end up being a lesbian transgirl. The thing is I couldn't care less about the LGBT community, I'll just live my life the way I want nobody else needs to be involved unless it's my family or a potential relationship partner.

Of course I'm writing this so the 3rd spike happened and this time it was a school trip to an amusement park and yet again, I was thinking about being a girl and everything, i feel like I'd be much happier as a girl, and things would just be... Better for me. I had a whole lot of fun with my friends though.

It's been about three days and I've had a busy weekend so dysphoria hasn't been too big in my mind, I've been stressed with school lately, friends, since the trip trying to be more feminine but feeling a bit stuck/confused on where to start/what to do, family, the fact that I fucked up washing my car windows and now there's sunspots everywhere.

I usually really enjoy thinking of myself as a female, the thing is I've kinda just kept it inside all this time so I've spent 17 years acting almost strictly masculine and trying to change to be more feminine is taking up a lot of mental capacity with thinking ""do this more girly thing rather than this guy thing you always do"" and focusing on smoothing my movements takes a lot of effort, it doesn't feel natural at all and it's a bit discouraging to be fair.

I've been taught to be masculine and I've taught myself to be masculine and trying to change that is a very steep slope at the moment, I feel like the ""boy"" appearance along with the aforementioned is hindering my confidence to be more girly. I really want to do something like a more feminine ""thank you"" but I feel like I physically cannot do so. I bought some cheap 98¬¢ nail polish because I'm super broke, I want to use it when I go out with my lady friend in a few days and I'm excited about that.

Sometimes I feel comfortable as a boy usually I just don't care, and much more often than feeling comfortable as a boy I think about how life would be different and even better as a girl. I don't know if it's just me being moody and stressed with a lot of things but I'm still not 100% convinced that I want to commit to a transition.

I'd love some feedback and advice, I don't have too many people to talk with about this so reddit is my best shot atm.",13May2019,1
132,"At the end of highschool I felt I was pushed into going to college for something STEM related (Even though my math and science scores were some of my lowest in highschool).

So I like the idiot I was (still am) decided that a good way for me to do something STEM related without having to take difficult math courses would be to skip going to a normal college and go into a two year technical school focused on game development instead. I lied that I was doing well and liking it at first to make my parents (whom I still live with) happy, but now the only reason I'm still attending is to keep from wasting the thousands of dollars my parents spent sending me here.

135,"I have been with my husband for over 10 years and we have been married for just under three. I am not a new fixture in his family's existence. However, my husband's stepmother is constantly calling me by my husband's brother's wife's name. My husband's brother's name is (fake) Steve. Steve is married to Suzie. Suzie is the bee's freaking knees and everyone in the family loves her. My name is nothing even remotely similar to Suzie's and we look nothing alike yet, somehow, my mother in law calls me Suzie all the time. Even when Suzie is in the room.

Today, when we were over for Mother's Day, my husband's grandfather, who has also met me many times and who was at our wedding, looked me in the face and said ""Hi Suzie, how are ya?"". He immediately realized his mistake and said ""Oh I'm sorry, I called you Suzie!"" I got red in the face and said that it happens more often that you might think. At this point, husband's stepmother chimed in that ""it's okay, I call her Suzie all the time!"" He then proceeded to joke and say ""Oh I know your name! It's Rachael... right?"" He said my actual name as a question. He wasn't even sure. My point is this: Am I overreacting by feeling devalued and unimportant to my husband's family that no one can seem to stop calling me my sister in law's name?

139,"I just moved into this apartment two weeks ago, and before moving in my husband had asked the leasing office if there was assigned parking. They told us there wasn‚Äôt but that we can only have one car per unit in one parking space so we‚Äôve respected and followed their rules since we moved in. We park wherever there is parking available but ever since we moved in, our downstairs neighbors have tried telling us that we‚Äôve been parking in their spaces and if we could move them. To avoid problems we‚Äôve always just said okay and went along with it and moved our car for them. Last week, our leasing office sent out reminders that there is no assigned parking because they‚Äôve been getting a lot of complaints about parking lately. Again, the letter said there is no assigned parking and only one car and one space and they posted it on everyone‚Äôs door in the complex. So my husband and I started parking where ever there‚Äôs parking available again and our neighbors honk loudly on their horns to get our attention but we ignore them, then they come knock on our door and ask us to move and if none of that works, they just park their car behind ours and block us in. They also have more than one car and they park them in the complex while my husband and I park our second car across the street on the curb. Today, we got into an explosive argument and I finally told them that I‚Äôve just been doing what the office says and that they told us there is no assigned parking. Our neighbors are mostly Hispanic and only speak Spanish, and the letters and emails were in English so I don‚Äôt think they really understand what the letter says. That, or they‚Äôre just acting dumb and are trying to make up their own rules despite. They tried telling us that the office is wrong and that they‚Äôre just saying that on purpose because they want to make money off towing our cars if they‚Äôre in the wrong space, and that the people in the office don‚Äôt live here therefore they don‚Äôt know or care about the parking issue and that it‚Äôs best for everyone if we just park in the space that corresponds to our unit. They told me they would talk to the office  tomorrow morning to clarify and ask them to put numbers on all the spaces so that we can all park in our assigned spaces. I already sent an email to the office after the incident. I don‚Äôt want to have any problems or tensions with our neighbors so I just went along with what they said but I‚Äôm hoping when they talk to the office tomorrow, the office tells them once again that there is no assigned parking and we can continue to park wherever we want. I explained to my husband what happened and he‚Äôs super pissed about it and said he‚Äôs going to continue to park where he wants, whether they like it or not but I really don‚Äôt want problems with these people. But I also don‚Äôt want them to push us around just because we‚Äôre the new tenants and they think they can tell us what to do and get their way.

As well, I‚Äôm planning to become an Air Force pilot when eligible.

Seeing as I‚Äôm planning to pick up a couple sports, plus for me to be more confident in my body, I decided I wanted to join a gym. Obviously, I‚Äôd need to bulk up big time. The only problem is, my parents don‚Äôt see it this way. They say I have a perfectly fit body. To an extent, they‚Äôre right. I have no health problems, and I‚Äôm physically active.  But still, wearing a swimsuit isn‚Äôt exactly pleasant, especially when you have visible ribs. Whenever I try to say that I‚Äôm planning to bulk up, my dad says he doesn‚Äôt want me to do anything I‚Äôll regret later.

I have no plans becoming a model on a steroid bottle. I just want to instill a bit of confidence in myself. I honestly don‚Äôt think either of us are completely wrong in our argument.

142,"Okay this is going to be a long, but I (f20) was recently approached by a guy (25) at the gym. Let‚Äôs call him Greg. Greg hit on me and we flirted for a bit and he asked me for my number.

A week later, he invited me over but when I asked for his address he said he fell asleep and he was sorry and he still really wants to hang with me. Okay, I get it, give him another chance. 

Another week of texting and lots of flirting from both sides, I mention us hanging out (he still has said he wants to see me), so he says sure, I‚Äôm at the gym but I‚Äôm leaving soon. He ends up not answering me for 3 hours and says his close friend just got back from rehab and he rushed to go see him. Obviously I was like no no don‚Äôt apologize that‚Äôs much more important! Then he says he‚Äôll make time for me this weekend. I tell him the hours I work that weekend and he doesn‚Äôt respond. I figured he fell asleep so I brush it off. The next day, he reads the messages and never answers. I thought it was strange since he‚Äôs never done that before, so I left it alone. 

Next day I was going to the gym and I ran into him as he was walking out. He asked me what I was up to and what I was doing later that night. I said nothing, he said I‚Äôll text you. Cool, I think all is good! Wrong. He didn‚Äôt text, so I messaged him first saying‚Äùhey, lmk if you still wanted to hang tonight! If not, no biggie, just lmk when you can so I can make other plans!‚Äù. No response. 

He read it the next day (today) at 7:30pm. Not really sure what‚Äôs going on or what to do, I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong and he seemed so interested and he just flipped.

But I know that is not the case I know that school is important so I keep studying, but every single time that I need to do a very hard project or something that mindset always comes back to me like every time I can't help my brain to think that mindset,  so as my brain thinks that mindset my body just does what my mind say is fun and not boring like watching YouTube or something

(Can give examples if asked) A work friend also teases me that i flirt with everybody but really i am very uncomfortable with the thought of being in a relationship and have no interest in any of my collegues. Most conversations i have at work are started by the other person and are usually teasing me jokingly. I feel like i cant have a normal day-to-day conversation with anyone.

149,"Hello all, so I apologize if my title is weird or this post is somewhat of a rant. I dont usually post anything like this but I'm not sure where else to turn to.

So I love to create worlds and write stories in those worlds and haved loved doing so ever since I was a child. Back then I dreamed of being the next Tolkien or Rowling and everything seemed so clear cut on what I needed to do. I just needed to go to college, get a degree in writing or something under that umbrella of study, and work my craft until I made it like my idols. I remember thinking if Rowling could do it after being a homeless mother for five years I could surely do it, right?

Well I fucked everything up.

Over these five years since I graduated high school I've done nothing but make mistake after mistake. I flunked out of two colleges because I couldnt focus and fucked around instead of working, got an apartment and ran myself ragged doing graveyard shift jobs I hated because I didnt want my parents to think I was useless, until I lost my apartment because I couldnt manage my money and resorted to stealing and scamming which ended up with my parents having to bail me out again. Ive lost important people in my life because I was stubborn and proud and too distracted with my own self-created problems to help them, and since my parents have bailed me out I havent been able to get any sort of job besides delivering food which pays pennies while stuck at home basically living off my parents like some gross leech. 

Since then I've been trying to pick up the pieces and make something good out of them, but I have no idea what to do and I'm terrified of just destroying whatever little good things I have left by dedicating myself to some grand life plan that ends up running me back into the ground. I want to do what I love, to write and create, and there's a story burning inside me that I just want to show the world but when I try to see how I could write a book or a screenplay or try and design a game or anything else I just see myself failing again. It kills my motivation and I can't even write more than a page before deleting it because I cant stand how bad it is. I get caught in a cycle of worldbuilding and motivation only to freeze when I try to put actual words on paper. Its like I'm choking on my story whenever I want to finally start it for who knows how many times now.

I know I'm only 23, and that I still have a long life ahead of me to get out of this pit but it feels like I've already made enough mistakes to last a lifetime. I've lost my way and now I can't even see the way back anymore.",13May2019,1
150,"So I‚Äôm a bit confused as to what to do. My friends say go hard on my dad, I am reluctant to do so because of what is possibly at stake (our relationship)

It goes like this. This past fall I say I want a car, off handedly. Oh, how it would be nice not to have to ride the bus. A little back and forth and he offers to ‚Äúhelp me out‚Äù. I say, ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs really nice of you, you don‚Äôt need to do that‚Äù he goes into, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what dads are for,‚Äù and, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really lucky, momsfriendlisa.‚Äù So I take it as it‚Äôs a gift, he doesn‚Äôt get me a Christmas gift and says that the car is the gift. 

I was under the impression that he was gifting money to me. So here I am, I pay $1700 for the car. He pays $2300. I am zipping around in it for about 6 months and now the time comes around for him to contact his lawyers to claim royalties which I am legally entitled to all of since 2014. I have been receiving them annually, which usually amount to between $2500-$5500, depending. 

He says to me today, after I asked him to contact his lawyer for the royalties, ‚Äúand you still owe me $2300.‚Äù 

We have *never* discussed this before, he‚Äôs never brought up about how I will owe him money, how long it will take, etc.  He has literally ***never*** said anything about me paying it back. I took it as a gift. 

I understand if this was a misunderstanding. But he has, and I repeat, ***never*** said anything about me paying it back, being a loan, etc. I didn‚Äôt enter into the buying the car thinking it was a loan. He ***NEVER*** said it was. 

I am totally willing to give him the $2300 because I don‚Äôt want to look greedy. I don‚Äôt want to look like that to my own dad. I am fully capable of giving him the money. It‚Äôs extra money, I don‚Äôt count on it to pay bills or anything, but I do use it for savings, and lately mine are running low. So I am getting a little defensive about it. 

He says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúhis money he earned‚Äù. This whole, momsfriendlisa gets royalties from his former profession setup has nothing to do with me. It is between him and my mom, his ex-wife. It was part of their divorce decree. 

I feel like he takes out his frustrations about him not getting those royalties out on me, even though I was 13 when they divorced and obviously wasn‚Äôt a part of the who-gets-what committee. 

TL;DR: I am owed money via royalties from one of my dad‚Äôs previous jobs as stated in legal documents. He pays for part of my car, suddenly tells me I owe him the money, didn‚Äôt say it was a loan in the first place.",13May2019,2

things are most likely fine; she says hi to me and has told me she knows I‚Äôm respectful etc...

i then texted her a number of times to where it got annoying; just clearing up potential misunderstandings, apologizing etc.. NOT me asking her to hang out after she already said no.

I sent her a few texts just clearing things up... she did say to stop in the text a few times.. she kinda thought I was not accepting her decline to hang out, which i totally did, so I cleared that up and told her thoroughly that I respect her and her decision to not hang out with me...

She then replied that she knows I""m respectful, and I apologized if I made her uncomfortable..

then a couple weeks later I sent her a few more texts, because this coworker played some love song on break, and I didn't want her to think it was me that asked him to play it...

far fetched i know, but I wanted her to know I didn't do that because it would be disrespectful and rude ya know.. so I texted her and she said she never thought it was me..

then a few days later i apologized for making things awkward by texting her that, explaining how it wasn't like me to be this thorough and go overboard with the clearing up misunderstandings/illustrating my respect for her etc.. because it's probably annoying ya know..

I kinda went overboard with the clearing up potential misunderstandings and apologizing for going overboard etc.. 

i just really wanted her to feel respected and it was during a tough time and my worry got the best of me, which i told her and she understood and said things are all good.

we still work together all the time.. she said hi to me yesterday in the break room, probably just to have things be casual and normal again between us and not awkward..

other times last week or so she approached me casually to look for a product in the store, and was very comfortable around me it seemed.

154,"I want to start by saying that I'm not involved in either of these relationships, I'm just looking for advice on how to act as a friend to both of these people. If this isn't the right sub for this type of question, please feel free to redirect me to a different sub.

I have a friend that I go to school with, we'll call him Dave. Dave is a cool guy and fun to talk to, and we seem to get along well. We're also both friends with a girl who we'll call Laura.

Dave and Laura have been spending a lot of time together lately, but I assumed it was just as friends. However, Dave and I both got drunk the other night, and he told me that he had a crush on her. I know Dave's current relationship isn't great and he's mentioned possibly breaking it off, but this kinda surprised me.

However, Dave didn't stop there. He continued to tell me that he's really good at getting women to be in relationships with him, regardless of their current relation status. He then said he was planning on trying to date Laura.

This is the part I'm having an issue with. I'm also friends with Laura... I'll admit I don't know much about her relationship, but whether it's a healthy or unhealthy relationship, I still feel like what Dave said is wrong. I respect Laura as a person, and for this reason I want to tell her what Dave said.

Would it be overstepping if I told her this? I don't want her to think it's weird that I'm telling her this, but I don't want to see her or Dave get hurt either. If I should tell her, how should I go about it?

I never even had an orgasm or knew how one felt. I‚Äôve been taking Prozac for a few months and my doc gradually bumped my dose to 40mg. My depression and anxiety diminished, and I knew one of the side effects would affect sexuality but I didn‚Äôt think it would apply to me because at the time I wasn‚Äôt even sexually active or have sexual desires. However, I recently became sexually active with my new boyfriend and I‚Äôm worried if I can satisfy myself and partner well. He has a very high sex drive and he‚Äôs always in the mood.

160,"I have a place at Oxford to study biochemistry and I'm not sure if I should take it. I applied last year on the advice of a teacher and chose the subject on based on what I was doing well in at school. I went for my interview and there were both things I liked and did not like, for instance I saw first hand from the start how intensive the atmosphere was there and felt intimidated. It was also around this time I thought perhaps I didn't like biochemistry that much. Regardless my first interview went very well and I got offered a place. I wanted to get in, but mainly just for me, not that I wanted to study there. 

At uni, I want to be able to perhaps work part time and enjoy myself a little bit. If I go to a local uni I would like a car. If I were to go to Oxford I would be unable to do this (theres a restriction on the hours of part time work you can do and they heavily disourage you). I've been so indecisive over it and its driving me mad. I have a place at a local university that isn't ranked at high, but I feel like if I went there I would be throwing away a massive opportunity. I would like to try it and see how it works out but I can't go in with that mindset or I'll drop out. I need to give it my 100%. If I stay at the local uni, I could stay at home and see my family significantly more than what I would when at Oxford. The local uni also offers a year abroad or in industry which seems like it would be very enjoyable.

There's another factor in this too. My girlfriend. We have been together a year. She is going to the same local uni. She hasn't really been a factor in my decision to not to go. However she has helped me find a lot of the flaws with Oxford and what I want out of uni. However I'm not entirely sure if I see a future with her and worried that if I go to the local uni based on her advice and we breakup, I will feel very bad. She told me to go where I feel happy and that it doesn't sound like Oxford is for me. However she told me if I go to Oxford, she will break up with me as she does not want long distance. I'm not sure if I'm letting this be a factor and I don't want it to be. She's gotten a little sick of me talking about it and says that if I end up going she'll be very confused as it really doesn't sound like what I want.

What I want to have advice for is that, my bestfriend gets extremely high grades. I never compare myself to her because I understand that we are so different. But sometimes when she openly worries about a test or says she did bad on a test (she gets like an 80) it makes me feel so angry and unsympathetic. There is a part of me thats hates this bc i feel that she shouldnt complain or call an 80 a bad mark because shes never really failed anything in years. She told me the last time she failed a test was in elementary. Whereas the last test I failed was a couple months ago. She also sometimes (in a joking way) says ""im so dumb lol"" and even if she says this about herself it pisses me off because she really isn't.

162,"TL;DR: Started hanging out with work crush and kissed. Now she makes constant jokes about the size of my penis.


Story for context:

Earlier this year I started hanging out with a work colleague that I'd had a crush on for several years.

We started chatting on Skype at work for about 6 months, which progressed to getting coffee, which soon turned into drinks after work.

On the third occasion of drinks, we got drunk and kissed, and both confessed to having a mutual crush.

The next day she revealed there was ""someone"" in her life, and should have mentioned it sooner (she'd never mentioned being in a relationship before, despite chatting and hanging out for over 6 months). She also told me her partner had suspected her of cheating and that she'd spent the entire night convincing him otherwise. Her relationship is her business, but from stories she told me, she's put herself in similar situations with other guys (other colleagues, people she's met on vacation) while in her current relationship.

Despite this, we continued to hang out often - coffee, after-work drinks, even sneaking out during work time to go for walks or get drinks at a wine bar, and ashamedly, kissed several more times. The conversation was often sexually-charged, with her saying she'd 'bang' me (we never did) and wished I could be her f*ck boy, and revealing her sexual history, kinks and fantasies. By this time I'd developed an unhealthy infatuation for her.

I would re-read our Skype conversation history, looking for hidden meaning in her messages, and spend hours thinking about how unfair it was that we couldn't be together.

I felt powerless over my feelings and realised I needed to put some distance between us to regain control. Around this time she started calling me ""puppy"", which I took to be an insult. After a few days of no contact she asked me out for after-work drinks and I told her I was going to the gym instead, and that I couldn't sneak out for walks, coffees or drinks during work time any more. She responded that I'd changed, was no fun any more, and that she'd have to replace me with a new drinking partner.

Sometime after the first kiss, she started making jokes about/references to me having a small penis. The first couple of times I laughed it off, but it got to the point where she was doing it several times a day, and she continues to do it almost every time we talk.

Why is she doing this? Is she just immature? Is it a power move? Is she trying to push me away, or maybe she enjoys trying to wield power over me or humiliate me? It seems like strange behaviour and I'd like to try and understand her motive.",13May2019,1
163,"So days ago, not knowing how a temp agency worked, I walked in dumbfounded about how stupidly easy it was to get a job from here. Although, the temp agency were hiring from only two places- a pork and a perfume warehouse that was full time. Seeing as there was a long line behind me, I hesistantly accepted their offer of working at the perfume factory, refusing to ask any questions about the actual job and such.
 Not at all what I wanted. 
Went to the (paid) orientation yesterday (basically a presentation tour for the facility), and I realized this job was definitely not for me. Not trying to be rude to the speaker, I filled out a couple of papers about my info and even got a uniform. 
Long story short, I'm in a dilemma. 
On Monday morning, is the start of this job. However, I have other jobs that I want to have (and applied to). How do I go about quitting my current job? The temp service is closed until 9am ish and the job starts at 5. The service never answers their phone when their open either since their either busy or ignoring calls. Also, will me not showing up on the first day of work have any effect whatsoever?

TL;DR: I accepted a job I don't want from a temp agency. Went to the orientation only for money and to see how the job in a factory was; got a uniform and even got a badge which came out of my paycheck. Hated what I saw, i wanted something else.

174,"TLDR: I'm a calm, normal person when I'm not playing video games. As soon as I turn on the game, something will eventually trigger me and I'll turn into a curse-word yelling freak who throws things. But hey, once I turn off the game and get back to something away from video games, I'm perfectly fine and not angry. Why is this?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I'm 19 and I'm in college, but I still live with my parents. I'm currently searching for a job. I can't think of anything major that is stressing me out either. So, I'll be playing a game (any game single player OR multiplayer) and I'll be having fun. My kind of fun is always winning and being top of the leaderboards, who isn't. Even when I don't win, I still have fun most of the time as I should. Usually it will be one small thing that just flips a switch. I'll yell, i'll bang on my desk or even throw my headset or controller at times. People that I play with tend to think that I'm just an irritable person and I get angry easily. That's not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

In real life, or outside of the video games, I'm friendly to most people. I'm just fairly normal to be honest. I play basketball and workout a lot and I honestly can say that I have NEVER gotten angry doing those things. (Well besides this one time when I was 15, but I'll leave that out). I've had people bully me when I was in high school and I can honestly say that I just brushed it off. I truly didn't care and I'm proud to be that way. If I'm having a bad day, usually turning on a song (any song) will make me feel 10x better. And yes, I've tried listening to music while playing games, it doesn't work.

177,"My partner and I are on the hunt for apartments and found one we absolutely adore, minus the fact that every single room uses electric baseboard heaters as the main (only) source of heat. Cooling is also done by window unit.

The building is very charming, but extremely old, and I'm not entirely sure how well insulated it is. For reference, it was once a large home, but has been divided up into five separate apartments.

I've only ever lived in homes that used wood stove or central air (which this unit does not have) and have no experience with the efficiency or cost of baseboards. However, I've read online that it can be outrageously expensive while simultaneously ineffective. Can anyone confirm or deny? We're very conflicted.",13May2019,1

181,"My bf left his old phone at my house and said I could use it. I opened it and looked through his photos expecting to see pictures of us, but I found pictures of his friend's breasts and a snap of her saying ""I want to worship your cock"". I freaked out and called him immediately but he had no idea what I was talking about. I sent him the images and he still claimed be didn't recognize the photos. 

He said that the only thing he can think of is that he screenshot them so he could show them to me. They were timestamped about a month after we started dating two years ago and I found these recently. I asked him to go through our old messages to see if he had mentioned them to me via messenger. On that day we had gotten into a fight because a man at the party I was at touched my hips and tried to be inappropriate and I didn't leave. I was the DD for a friend so I couldn't just abandon him there. Anyway, I believe that my bf saved these to show me her bring inappropriate with him. He had done that a day prior when she had sent snaps of her being sexually suggestive with him. He told her he had a gf now and she stopped. Or so I thought. 

I sent this girl a really really nasty message. I shouldn't have, but I did. I called her a lot of names, used personal info that he wasn't supposed to have told me as insults, and told her that her boobs were ugly and disgusting. I am ashamed that I responded that way. She messaged my bf and asked what was going on, he had a calm conversation with her about it. 

Basically, he said ""she's really mad at me. I'm sorry"" and she said at one point ""super cool that she's taking it out on me, I guess"" and he continued to apologize to her and told her that his life was over because of this, but never once scolded her, nor did he defend me. Why *wouldn't* I take it out on the person who sent my bf sexual pictures even though they knew he was with someone? He blocked her without me asking him to and assured me that it meant nothing and he doesn't remember it. I am not skiing for advice about my bf cheating on me and please don't tell me to leave him because that's not what I'm here for. I believe him. I have known this man for other a decade, he is kind and thoughtful. I believe him. 

However, I have a hard time getting past this. It's been a few months and my mean bedtime brains keeps me up often. I keep thinking about his conversation with her. She sees nothing wrong with what she did and it's verified by him not defending me. I have begun getting very jealous of people I wouldn't have normally. I'm not usually a jealous person but lately I've been having a lot of issues. 

A friend of my bf was rude to me on a few occasions and he didn't defend me. This was before this incident happened, but now I HATE this woman with all of my being. I am definitely projecting my resentment and my feeling of unresolve of this issue with this unrelated woman. I don't really know what you do. Any advice would be appreciated.

184,"Hello everyone, 

This is my first post here, please bear with me.

For two weeks now my bathroom has been smelling of weed and cigarettes several times a day, it‚Äôs been bad enough that it makes me sick and I avoid using it. 

I‚Äôve complained to the building management several times because it‚Äôs a non smoking community per the lease. They‚Äôve come to my apartment to investigate and haven‚Äôt been able to find who is doing it, the smell comes from the vent which is connected to the apartment next door and the apartment below mine. At this point I have to decide to renew my lease for another year, and management is tired of me emailing them about this saying there‚Äôs nothing they can do anymore because they don‚Äôt know who is doing it. I‚Äôm scared they won‚Äôt want to renew the lease anymore because of this, that if I do sign I‚Äôll be stuck for another year in an apartment that smells terrible, that I might need to get corporate or lawyers involved, and the only other option they reluctantly offer is to move to another unit, but I don‚Äôt want to deal with the moving costs. I don‚Äôt want to end up homeless because of this. 

Up until today I was in disbelief that my next door neighbor could be the culprit. I‚Äôve spent the last four hours trying to find out where the smell is coming from, since I can hear an exhaust fan going on in an adjacent apartment every time the smell happens.  Turns out that the fan is coming from his apartment. After this and some digging about my neighbor, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs him now. 

Should I leave him a note in his door asking him to stop? Should I buy him a vape pen? Or should I contact management tomorrow to let them know and let them deal with it?",13May2019,1

the following week i then texted her a about 5-10 times to where it got annoying; just clearing up potential misunderstandings, apologizing etc.. NOT me asking her to hang out after she already said no.

I sent her a few texts sharing how her rejection caught me off guard, but I do respect her decision etc.. it was kinda awkward and she did say to stop in the text a few times.. she kinda thought I was not accepting her decline to hang out, which i totally did, so I responded and cleared that up and told her thoroughly that I respect her and her decision..

She then replied that she knows I""m respectful, and I apologized if I made her uncomfortable, she replied and things we were cool!

then a couple weeks later I sent her a few more texts, because this coworker played some love song on break, and I didn't want her to think it was me that asked him to play it...

far fetched i know, but I wanted her to know I didn't do that because it would be disrespectful and rude ya know.. so I texted her and she said she never thought it was me..

then a few days later i apologized for making things awkward by texting her that, explaining how it wasn't like me to be this thorough and go overboard with the clearing up misunderstandings/illustrating my respect for her etc.. because it's probably annoying ya know..

I kinda went overboard with the clearing up potential misunderstandings and then apologizing for going overboard etc.. i just really wanted her to feel respected and it was during a tough time and my worry got the best of me, which i told her and she understood and said things are all good once again.

we still work together all the time.. she's approached me a couple times to ask about products in my dept (something she's never done in the previous 8 months before I asked her to hang out)... she also said hi to me yesterday in the break room, probably just to have things be casual and normal again between us and not awkward..

she seemed very comfortable around me... but just to be certain, if there were any issue and she was concerned, wouldn‚Äôt hr and/or management have contacted me?

how does this situation sound? to me it seems like she knows i'm respectful, I've made that abundantly clear, she doesn't feel i'm a threat (i'm a very gentle/respectful person... she's seen how I am with customers, coworkers etc for over six months *before* i even began to talk to her/ask her out etc..",13May2019,1

216,"So the other night I met a guy on a ‚Äúmeet people‚Äù app. He seemed pretty nice. He asked if I would be interested in meeting and maybe doing stuff (you know) and I, being a dumb teen wanting to ‚Äúexperience things other teens do‚Äù said sure. He asked if we could meet that night. I hesitantly agreed. He asked for my address. I gave him my neighbors address (just to be safe. In hindsight I shouldn‚Äôt have done that). He showed up about 20 minutes later. My mom was pissing me off, so I decided I‚Äôd do it. I‚Äôd meet him. I snuck out and let him into my yard. I couldn‚Äôt even talk to him. I‚Äôd never even thought of doing anything with a guy. He asked if I wanted to go to his car. I tried changing the subject. I tried talking about my dogs or asking him how he was. All he wanted was to go to his car and he kept pushing it. Eventually I gave in. I slowly and hesitantly walked to his car. We got in the back and I kept stalling. Babbling on about random things because the second I got on his car, I knew I didn‚Äôt want this. I wanted to go back inside. So I kept stalling and not taking about it hoping he‚Äôd get my hint and let me leave. But all of the sudden, he was pretty much on top of me. He was touching my legs and pulled my pants down. I froze. I couldn‚Äôt do anything. I couldn‚Äôt say no. I just froze. He didn‚Äôt use protection either, so that‚Äôs a whole different story. After he got on top of me, I just blanked. I couldn‚Äôt do anything. All I could do is lay there. But I also blame myself because I let him in my yard. I snuck out. I got in his car. I led him on when we were texting. But I also didn‚Äôt tell him yes. He never asked. I‚Äôve googled it and it says as long as I didn‚Äôt say no, it‚Äôs not rape. But I‚Äôm just so traumatized. I can‚Äôt walk in my yard without freaking out. I can‚Äôt see a man without thinking he‚Äôs gonna come at me. But like I can‚Äôt do anything because it wasn‚Äôt rape.

217,"So I just started my new job last Thursday (5/9). The position I applied for is to be receptionist and the job description they placed described receptionist duties. So, I‚Äôve only worked there two days ( it‚Äôs a M-F) and the boss emailed me saying he wants to talk to me about what they envision me doing there, I thought this was kinda weird since being a receptionist is pretty self explanatory,  and wants me to discuss some improvements I think the company can work on.  An other employee mentioned to me that even though they hired two receptionist they see me working on the business end eventually unlike the other. 

Now I‚Äôm a business major so this sounds like a great opportunity for me! My only issue is if they are going to be giving me more duties other than a receptionist do I bring up a pay raise? Or do I wait? Should I even ask for more $? And is it a bit sketchy on their end to hire me onboard as a receptionist then switch it up?",13May2019,1

She texted him this: 
Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you‚Äôre very happy with your relationship status with your lady and you want something strictly platonic here?

He said: 
Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation. 

She said: 
Thanks for being upfront. 
So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I‚Äôm assuming that it‚Äôs tainted to the point of no return, correct?

He said: 
I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth. 

She said: That‚Äôs fine. I won‚Äôt pressure you to articulate any more feelings right now.
I always think of you and your family because y‚Äôall made me who I am. Sorry that I reach out and pester so often. I just am trying to grow and better myself and find myself reflecting on lessons y‚Äôall taught me to do so. So naturally I end up thinking of y‚Äôall. Have a good night.

Him: Those are very kind words and sentiments. That means a lot to me. Thank you. I share similar feelings for you and your family too. The more time passes, the more I appreciate things like that and the more thankful I am. It's amazing. You have a good night too. When I get on vacation, we could talk.

Her: if you don‚Äôt wanna talk and are just trying to be nice I understand. Sleep well. 

Him: I would though! Thank you and it's go time at the school! Going to finish strong. I hope you keep killing it like you always do till then and that's an understatement too!",13May2019,0

I've always been nice to her but she'll ignore me, roll her eyes at me, never ask me questions about me, get snarky, you get the gist. I'm supposed to go to a lake house that's a six hour drive away with ten of her other friends (who I don't know) for a weekend for her bachelorette party. 

One of my brother's friend is a groomsman and has always had a crush on me, and recently he broke up with his girlfriend who's close friends with my brother's fiance. She's always been catty towards me ever since the first night we've met, pretty much tagging along with my brother's fiance with her snarky attitude towards me, and she'll be going to the lakehouse.

231,"I'm not sure this is right subreddit, but here goes. Also fair warning, this is a very long post.

So me and my aunt have been feeding and sheltering a family of strays (not the best idea but she's a cat fanatic and wanted to anyway). One had a litter of four kittens in one of the two shelters we put out for them.

The problem is: she might have stopped caring for them. Today, we went outside to feed the cats and heard the kittens making a lot of noise. They'd gotten out of the shelter and wandered around the yard, it's important to note they're not even old enough to open their eyes and it was a fairly long way away, for such young kittens anyway.

We gathered them up and put them back. We also found out one had died, and one was very weak, it wasn't making as much noise or moving around as much.

My aunt said she hadn't seen the mom around today, and she usually hangs around most of the time. The first thing we did was take the deceased one away. Then, we put tried to feed them a bit of milk, but they didn't want much.

Afraid they'd fall out of the shelter again, it's a small drop but I'm worried it's too far for them, we put them in a box with a towel for warmth and put them back.

Eventually, after they kept falling out, we moved them to the shelter right next to it. Basically, its a giant plastic box with a hole cut higher up, too high for the kittens to get through. I know it's not reccomended to move kittens, but it was ""right next door"" and they'd wander the open yard if not. Our neighborhoods a bad place for kittens (birds, dogs, ect.), even though there is a gate.

They were still crying and, thinking they were cold, we put a towel down with a hot water bottle underneath. They eventually stopped crying. They were so quiet I checked to see if they were still alive.

Through all this, a few hours, no sign of the mother. She showed up later.

However, we did not see her engage with the kittens. My aunt sat outside nearby to watch, but the most she did was sit a few feet from both shelters. They did cry while she was there, but we didn't see her go to them.

Now my aunt is freaking out, and I am too. We went inside and are trying to see if the mom was waiting for us to go before going to them. But we don't know. We're worried they will starve if we wait too long to try to feed them again ourselves.

My aunt wants to bring them inside as soon as possible and feed them ourselves, but I'm worried we'll just put them at more risk taking them away. We have to wait until the morning before we call any shelters and such.

Are they abandoned? Are we freaking out over nothing? What should we do?",13May2019,1

235,"This is a long one boys so let's get buckled in for this messy adventure.
So to preface this, I'm 22 and I come from a very religious conservative middle eastern family and I was born and raised in America in a decently liberal area. I've done my share (and still do) of drinking and partying and I'm defiantly not anything my parents want me to be. I was raised really sheltered from most of western media, for example most channels including things like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network were blocked on the TV. The only games I could really play were ""educational"" PC games. It wasn't until highschool that I got kind of a miniature culture shock because that's when my parents stopped limiting my internet exposure and I finally got a smartphone. Funny enough that's actually around the time I joined Reddit.
I'm engaged now to a white American girl which is a big no no in the middle eastern community, they went absolutely hysterical when they learned I was even interested in her saying she's probably slept with hundreds of guys and she's just going to divorce me and take everything. Also my dad wanted me to get a prenuptial agreement because he was so sure she'd leave me. They don't even know we're engaged because that's another problem I don't want to deal with. Her family is absolutely delightful though, no problems on her side. Granted my parents are still relatively good parents. They raised me well, made sure they were involved in my schooling, for the most part generally decent parents. There were a few questionable instances of child abuse, but that's a different issue.
Over the past year I've been gradually moving out The ol' ball and chain and I got an apartment together with a friend and I'd just stay at my parents house on the weekends. That also upset them to no end and they couldn't understand why their sweet son was deciding to distance himself from the family. It wasn't until a few months ago that I decided I didn't want to be there any more because any time I was there I felt like I didn't belong there, and any conversation I'd have with my parents would be about why I don't want to be there anymore. Almost like I can't hold a regular conversation with them for more than 5 minutes before it gets turned against me. So I said enough is enough and I moved out officially.
Obviously it angred them and upset them, including my brothers and now I feel like my relationship with them will never be the same. I don't really know what to do at this point other than what I'm currently doing which is just talking to my mom every once in a while updating her on my life and what I'm doing. I feel like I owe them that much. I also feel like if I go back there then I'm not going to be able to leave for days and/or all they're going to do is yell at me for what I'm doing. I don't know how to get them to understand that I feel like this is what I need right now in my life because they definitely wouldn't understand if I worded it like that.

So; I had a baby boy 9 months ago. Before getting pregnant I was overweight at a size 14 dress being 5ft3in tall. But, I carried my weight quite well and was rather happy and healthy.

When I got pregnant, I had horrific morning sickness for the first 18 weeks. After that, I literally just expanded. By the end of my pregnancy, I couldn‚Äôt fit in any of my clothes, but that was not because of my gorgeous bump.

Now, I‚Äôve got myself back down to an 18 but I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to get rid of the weight. I hate it, I feel so unattractive and my husband always says I‚Äôm beautiful but I just don‚Äôt feel it. 

I‚Äôm fully aware that I eat too much and I eat the wrong stuff but I do walk everywhere with my little one in his pram. I love walking and we do around 16miles a week on average.

I just want some advice on how I can break these bad eating habits and find the motivation to actually push for a better and healthier life.

244,"Long story short, I have a man who comes into my workplace every week and follows me around or sits and watches me work for several hours. I've gone through the chain of command and management knows about him, but his actions as of yet are not enough to have him banned from the building. My coworkers try to get between me and him whenever he comes in, but he always comes back around as soon as he sees I am alone. My managers have been sympathetic, and have allowed my schedule to be shifted, I've been given permission to park closer to the building, everything like that. When he comes in, I am usually told to just go work in the ""back area"" of our department. The problem with this is that the back area, while separated from the rest of the building via a barrier, is that that barrier is half glass. And I can see him, walking back and forth around the ""fishbowl"" as we call it, watching me. Unfortunately, they told me that until he basically harms me (he's already cornered me and touched my arm/shoulder a few times, which they know about) or becomes obviously intrusive, there is nothing we can do. I've told him I'm not interested and I've told him I'm not giving him my phone number. I am incredibly, thoroughly unsettled by him, and despite all of the steps management has taken, I still spend all my days looking over my shoulder and worrying that he'll be waiting around every shelf and every corner.

250,"I want to kill myself.

Before you start asking questions and making assumptions let me clear it out for you.

I have been suicidal in the past and I did try to kill myself but I ended up alive and started working on myself, but this time I'm not suicidal - I simply don't want to live anymore.

I'm attending the college of my dreams, I have an amazing family and great friends, basically all environmental factors of my life are A+ but I don't have the wish to live. I have lived for 20 years, I've been thru good and bad, seen my lowest of the low and highest of the high and I'm content with it - I'm fine with it ending now. 

Before you start to talk me out of it or comfort me - no need to. I'm not gonna do it because I think in my case it is pure selfishness (ONLY IN MY CASE, THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO THE REST! so dont shoot saying that I think suicide is a cowards act - cuz I don't) and it's just my everyday thought.

Reason why I'm posting this is to simply see if anyone else ever had a similar or the exact same situation like me and which conclusion did they come to.

tl;dr: I want to die but I'm not suicidal",13May2019,2

252,"Am I The Asshole: for abandoning my ex-best friend to her child groomer step-father?

For those of you who don't know, a child groomer is a man or woman who slowly coerces an underage child into entering a physical relationship with them. Think Woody Allen if you believe the rumors. Some of them wait until they are of legal age. Some of them don't, either way, it's disgusting and there should be a law against having sex with someone you raised from the age of three. Which is exactly what happened, my ex bestie's stepfather has been her legal father and caretaker since she was three years old when he married her mother. Their relationship has always been questionable up to that point but as soon as she turns eighteen her younger brother who sleeps in the basement messages me that he can hear them having sex upstairs while her mom is at work. This happened after I end our friendship mind you but that doesn't really make it better.

Basically, me and Bestie were friends throughout high school. She was weird and annoying but I tolerated her because she was fun to talk to. She was kind of a deadbeat though as she had stopped trying in all of her classes and barely scraped by with all ""C's"" Now a ""C"" is nothing to sneeze at and I would have been fine with this grade, if she had actually earned it. We lived in a small town so not wanting to fail her and have to deal with the complaints from her um . . .""overprotective"" dad the school just put her in the special needs program, she was not special needs. We would hang out over her house after school every day and I would help her study, try and get her grades up and was generally a positive influence on her life. Which wasn't hard because she barely did anything when she was at school and outside of school she just looked up I Funnies on her school computer and watched Law and Order. She started getting better grades and even got put into some normal classes. Once that happened I encouraged her to get her own job so she could be more independent. Back then I was kind of a fixer-upper friend. I would usually find friends that had things wrong with them or their lives and try to fix it. I had low self-esteem at the time so it made me feel good about myself. Bestie was probably one of the easier ones I had tried to ""fix"". She was fun to be around but had some behavioral problems and was kind of lazy. After some hard work though I had gotten her in all normal classes, a job, and she was talking about how excited she was about going to college next year. This was all over the span of three years so it was about time for her to start thinking about moving out. She wanted to go to school for forensic science since for some reason the college in our town offered that but she wasn't too bright so I had talked her down to a simple creative writing major and a possible switch in the future. She agreed and seemed genuinely ok with the idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things started getting bad when her father entered the mix however as he claimed he couldn't complete the FAFSA online as it was too hard. She needed the FAFSA to pay for her tuition. I offered to show them both how to do it as it's really very easy while her father, who usually pretended to be the smartest guy in the room, pretended he already knew how to do it and instead printed the seventeen-page document out just to mail it to the wrong place! So she didn't have her tuition in but the school was nice enough to let her attend anyway until he could manage to fill the form out.

&amp;#x200B;

 It was no secret to her or to him that I did not like her father. He was an idiot who would try to mansplain things that didn't need to be explained at all to underaged girls. I have vivid memories of him explaining things like different types of porn to me, different types of sex positions to me, talking about how lesbians were only lesbians because they ""hadn't been shown how to do it right"". He encouraged lesbianism in is own daughter even though she was obviously straight, encouraged his kids to masturbate frequently, and to have sex with other kids, he would eavesdrop on me and bestie's conversations just so he could make a sex joke out of whatever we said, he was always very sexual words us. All while we were only thirteen years old. The most alarming of all was when he came up behind me and rubbed my shoulders for a solid minute. I tensed up my arms and neck until he finally let go rubbing my back a little as he left. At the time I had awkwardly laughed all of it off as Bestie had constantly told me that ""not a lot of people understood his humor, and felt uncomfortable around him"" and ""not to worry because it's all just a joke"" Needless to say I tried very hard not to hang out over her house after that.

So yeah, Bestie's dad was a Creep!  What was worse Bestie had looked up to him as the father she never had. Her real father had been abusive to her from a young age and thereafter so when he walked in she worship the very ground he walked on. No matter how stupid something he said was she would just accept it as fact and go along with it. Which made talking her out of bad behavior harder and harder the closer they got. Next thing I knew Bestie had dropped out of school, quit her job, and spent all day mooching off her parents. Her dad pretty much ran the show as her mom had no backbone and gave him her paycheck every month. I watched helplessly as the relationship between the two became more and more messed up. They had always had an unnatural relationship tbh. Bestie letting her stepfather touch her ass, sleep in her bed, convince her to dress slutty, and eventually to wear no bra at all.  He completely controlled her life. And whenever Bestie got a boyfriend dad would be right there to break them up and talk about how abusive her current bf was being and how clingy he acted. Occasionally I would get through to her that her dad was a manipulative prick that was just trying to use her but other times it seemed like she didn't care what I had to say and sitting there living off of her parents was more important. 

Things started to get really disturbing when she started talking about how her ideal man was basically her father and whether or not I thought it would be illegal for them to get married. I tried over and over again to tell her that her father was not a good person as years prior he had tried and failed to groom other little girls and she was just someone he had easy access to.  I mean he had even tried to groom me at one point. None of this mattered to her as she got closer and closer to him. Eventually, he announced that he and her mother were getting a divorce but not before he moved into Bestie's room. Bestie excitedly called it ""their little apartment"" and kept going on about what her dad was planning to buy for the room. I told her that no dad ever has slept in the same bed as their seventeen-year-old daughter and that seemed to get her to understand that this wasn't normal. She kicked him out and surprise surprise there was no more talk of divorce between her parents. I can't count the times on both of my fingers that I had caught him laying next to her in her bed ""on top"" of the blankets to make it legal even though Bestie still wasn't wearing any pants and was in her underwear. Bestie, acted and talked like a child when she was around him. It was clear that she saw this as she did when she was a little girl. A man she could trust who had raised her to believe so but in reality, he was a predator using his closeness with a child who wasn't his own to get sex.

&amp;#x200B;

  It slowly became a tug of war between me and her stepfather. I would convince Bestie to get a job, he would convince her to quit and rely on him. I would convince her to go to college, he would drag his feet on the paperwork knowing we couldn't complete it without his signature. It was constantly back and forth all the while Bestie was becoming nastier towards me because of all the lies and bad behavior her father was encouraging in her. Eventually, she started to resent me for trying to make her change. She didn't want to work, she didn't want to go to school, she just wanted to be taken care of by her father which meant I was the enemy. She would constantly talk down to me and treat me like dirt when we hung out, she became selfish and lazy, only wanting to hang out with me if I had something to give her like food and stuff to buy her and would complain to immediately go home right after. What was worse her stepfather put her above everyone in her family all in an attempt to win her over. Whenever I was over her house she would screech at and abuse her younger brothers and mother. I really didn't like the person she had become. She listened to me less and less and only using me for whatever money I had. At one point I had to get heart surgery in a town over and Bestie insisted on coming despite how sick I would be afterward because her favorite restaurant was there and she expected my mom to pay for her to eat. When I told her I would probably not be able to go because I would be recovering she said I could wait in the car while her and my mom ate. I began to hate being around her. Her dad had turned her into a spoiled brat and Bestie seemed happy to be so. In my eyes, at that point, they were both equally awful.  Despite this, I knew my friendship was the only thing keeping Bestie form entering a physical relationship with her father. Despite all her trash talk she still cared what I thought as her only friend. She would relentlessly ask me probing questions about what I thought if she entered a relationship with her father. I would always say the same thing. "" He's your dad blood or not. You were forced to trust him from a young age, he should not take advantage of that trust by asking you to be in a physical relationship with him"" At least that's the gist of the rant I would go on every time she asked me. But seriously he is the biological father to your youngest brother!? imagine having to explain to your son that his uncle is also his brother! 

&amp;#x200B;

So this went on until one night we had a falling out of epic proportion. She was going on again about how much smarter her dad was than me and how I was basically autistic compared to him. Which made me extremely mad since I was pretty sure he really was autistic. I mean the guy was an ass hat on wheels and she was constantly telling me how smart he is. 

I'm not even super smart he is just dumb as fuck, I cannot stress this enough. Dude does adult Karate in a class made for all kids and he only has his green belt. They spend 600$ a month on that btw but can't keep their lights on because he is a literal child and has his wife convinced that women shouldn't handle money. Just the worst kind of guy! A Hypocrite, a liar, and a Pedo, and she had the gall to try and talk about how stupid I was compared to him. I just felt done at that point. I didn't even like her really I had grown to hate her and her father. The only ones I had sympathy for was her brothers and their mom. And he mom was kind of the reason any of this was allowed to happen so idk. A week after that her younger brother texts me on social media saying he can hear them having sex upstairs. It was so shocking that I felt like my whole world was falling. I mean I had never had solid confirmation that it was happening till now and I'm not even really happy I found out. I mostly feel bad for her younger brother who has to live with them. Your biological sister who is sleeping with your biological dad while your mother either doesn't know or is in denial about it. Either way that's a hard thing to live with I imagine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel personally responsible sometimes for this happening. If I had just hung in there maybe this would have never happened? I still feel for Bestie even though she wasn't always nice to me. I still remember when she was and what a kind of cool person she was before her dad started messing with her. And with manipulation that deeply enbeded, it's had to think of what I could have done differently to stop it. She did always talk about us moving in together during her good days. She seemed kind of desperate to get away from him but I always said no because knowing her she would just mooch off of me and refuse to move out when she didn't cover her side of the rent. But maybe being away from him would have helped her get better and start working again. I just didn't want the trouble plus she was always mean to me then. I just don't think it's right that it ended that way. I sacrificed a lot of my teenage years meddling in things I was too young to understand trying to save my friend from a groomer who lived inside of her house. I often give myself ""what ifs"" ""what if I had called the police about him rubbing my shoulders that one time"", ""what if I had called them about them being in the same bed together"" I tried looking up laws and finding rules he broke. He is still legally her father, I figured being a legal guardian and sleeping with the person you are supposed to be taking care of must be illegal! But no it's not where we're from and in a lot of other states. Which I really think is wrong considering the fact that young girls tend to mix up being attracted to someone with feeling platonic love towards someone, also groomers who use the law to raise their perfect girlfriend or to prey on children. 

I'm I the asshole for abandoning my friend to her abusive step-dad just because I didn't want her as a friend anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

ps:

\- Anyway sorry, this was so long. Please refrain from gross comments as whenever I tell this story I get a lot of guys treating it like it's some sort of fetish porn, it's not. This guy's a pedo who prays on little girls and so are you if you think it's cool to groom kids into loving you. That's all I'm saying. . .

\- I feel like guys may see it differently than girls tho. A lot of the guys who I tell this story to act like it's not a big deal or teat it like a sex story for them to get off to. but the women generally understand the type of unconditional love a child gives a parent and how badly that can mess a kid up if it's taken advantage of like that. I just can't fathom raising any child and seeing them that way. Like they really can't see past their own libido to see the baby that they raised.

\-Again this is not to say all men see this story like this it's just been my experience thus far

258,"So- let me start by saying I‚Äôm a 16 (17 on June 2nd) female with a years worth of experience on babysitting.
I‚Äôve never learned CPR from a professional but took a small health class that taught me how to do it, and though I‚Äôm not professionally licensed to do it, I do know how to do it.
In the past year I‚Äôve babysat 47 kids, all under the age of 10 but all above the age of 3. I have 10 siblings all younger than me, which gives me experience with changing diapers, preparing bottles and feeding, and other different things for babies and toddlers.
I decided about two months ago that I would set up prices, and with the help of a friend of mine (who also babysits), set up these prices:

$10.00 per hour for 1 child
$12.00 per hour for 2 children
$13.00 per hour for 3 children
$14.00 per hour for 4 children
[+$1.00 for every child]

And it worked. I‚Äôve babysat 3 kids in that span, two of them were twins from the same lady and she needed me to watched them for 7 hours, therefor I made 84 dollars. The other one was a little boy that lived a few streets away, and I watched him for 9 hours while his  mother was away visiting her mother in hospital, I made 90 dollars. Those two people didn‚Äôt have a problem.

Though now I‚Äôm wondering if the prices are too high, and here‚Äôs the reason why.
I got a message from my father saying that my grandma (his mom) needed someone to babysit her (adopted) daughter from Monday through Friday, all summer long.
My grandma works from 5 am to 5pm, 12 hours a day, for 5 days of the week.
That‚Äôs 120 dollars a day-
Which equals up to 600 a week
For two months.
Now if you do that math,
That‚Äôs a lot of damn money-
Of course my grandma said that was too much, but let me add, this child is the most spoiled rotten kid-
She broke my headphones (Beats Pro-about 400 USD) and when I got upset, she said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt yell at me, I‚Äôm sick‚Äù, fake coughed on my face, then ran and told my grandma that I was yelling at her (I did slightly raise my voice but didn‚Äôt yell)  when she was sick, which lead to my grandma lecturing me on how not to treat her ‚Äòsick angel‚Äô.
I know watching her for my entire summer is gonna he a damn hassle, and I know the prices seem- pretty high, but are they reasonable in this situation?? Should I lower them or leave them as is?? 
I only have 2 weeks to decide, but I wanna get it done and out of the way so I can focus on my finals and such.",13May2019,1

My dad's an alcoholic, I live with him full-time thanks to some shit that went down with my step-dad, I'm almost never assertive with him, and he loves to guilt trip me and my brother with some shit like ""yOu oBviOuSly dOn'T LoVE mE"". Basically, my dad is Jerry from Rick and Morty.   


**The issues:**

There are many, many, many fucking issues with my dad, but the one I'll tell you is the one that went down tonight.  
He's only a little drunk (by that I mean he's not completely tits up passed out on the couch yet).   
Basically, I walked into the bathroom to take a piss and found massive puddles of piss, the size of (Insert large coin name). I wiped it up and walked out to the lounge and said: ""I don't piss on the floor, so I'd prefer if you could offer me the same kindness"".  
I felt assertive. Just dropped a toxic friend today so I had a confidence boost. That's a story for another day though.   
Anyway, I walked back to the bathroom to take the aforementioned piss, whipped my pp out to take said piss, and then I hear a voice coming from the lounge.   
Dad: *""Oi, \[Dank Substance\]!""*  
Zip up my pants, walk out to the lounge and say ""What is it?"".

  
Dad:*""How dare you talk to me with such fucking disrespect?""*  
Me:""Well someone pissed on the floor and no one else but you has been out of their room in the past three hours.  
Dad:*""Where's the fucking piss?""*  
Me: ""Bathroom floor, I wiped it up""  
Dad:*""Why would I piss on my own floor?... Why would I miss?...Etc""* (Things that could easily be answered with; ""You're drunk"", but I didn't wanna get beaten. Never happened to me, but I've seen how drunk people act.  
*\*Continue bickering about floor piss for the next 5 minutes\**

I go back to my room and suddenly he swings open the door to tell me the argument is over. Ironic.  
Then he tells me he's gonna have a talk with me tomorrow. Double irony.  
Then he tells me it's over again. Triple irony?

He then proceeds to say some bullshit like ""I guess if you think that low of me""  
Fuck off with this shit, Jerry Smith headass.  


**Tl;dr:**

Alcoholic dad being a dick, blames me for pissing on the floor (As an example), dad tries to guilt trip me and fails because I know his bullshit by now.   


**Question:**  
Should I move to my mum's full time instead? What should I do if so/if not so.

In the end of May later I found out I was expecting. I know for sure it was his because I haven‚Äôt had sex for a year. And i never did it with anybody else. He would only hit me up when it was for sex.... after that I didn‚Äôt know he had a girlfriend. I‚Äôm not sure when they started dating. I was so devastated.

My big brother already stopped smoking in the past because he was also caught smoking when he posted doing vape tricks on Instagram.

I managed to get my brother out of the situation.

After yelling and arguing,

My dad came...

We then quickly changed the subject to "" I just lost my not so cheap bracelets "" So dad wouldn't make the situation hell.

Then I just left without a single word, In Silence.

More recently, I've gotten an obvious infection in what I believe is #14. It's quite sore, pretty loose, and has a constant blood line between tooth and gum. I'm around Durham, NC.

267,"I've (24/f) been seeing this guy(24/m) recently who from what I can tell would be a great match for me in almost every way. He's intelligent, driven, ambitious, kind, and seems to similar goals as me. However, he doesn't talk much and he strikes me as someone that is relatively socially inept. When we hang out I feel like I'm interviewing and entertaining him as I answer my own questions. I've brought up the whole communication thing to him, and he apologized and said that he can be shy then continued on to say that he wants to see me again and has been enjoying getting to know me. However he is being cautious as his last relationship ended up being messy and he doesn't want to rush into anything. I feel like maybe he's stringing me along? The past times we've gone out he didn't even hug to greet me (nor initiate any sort of physical affection), didn't offer to pay (I don't want him to pay, but the offer to pay signals to me that he is interested in more than a friendship), when we talk he doesn't even turn his body towards me (he kinda just looks at me when he talks), he's always up to go and do things (but doesn't initiate plans or conversations). What should I do?",13May2019,2
268,"So, I'm not really sure what to title this but it's a pretty bad one for me. This started in November.

~~~~~~~~

I used to live with my brother, everything seemed alright for the first month. I broke down on the second month because lack of privacy and respect for me. Got kicked out on the fourth month. 

During this time period as well, I gotten us internet (will be important later)

Fast forward to now. Two days ago (May 11th), we throw a mothers day party at my mom house. Enter my brother and his girlfriend. They sit on the couch with me, (I did still harbor some hatred and disliking to him after what occurred but learned to let it go) and then speak of the internet. I was told a week ago I would have to pay half of it even though i dont live there and dont use it anymore. 

Fair enough. I decided to get it for us. 

I told them I'll cancel it. It wont cost me much. What I didnt know is that my brother didnt actually pay for this months bill on purpose even though he did stated ""he paid"". I have to now pay an addition $110 plus cancellation fees. Furious about that, but whatever I'll just pay it. 

Enter cousins and one aunt who bring me another dilemma. 

I am just chatting with bro, gf and cousins casually. Cousin asks where I live. My brother says home with my mom (which is true, mom knows what occurred and told me to not let my brother's actions affect my relationship with him. I respect her wishes) but also states I wasnt ready. 

This causes her to full on insult me in front of my cousins and his gf. My brother fled ahead of time. I felt mortified and embarrassed, unable to understand what just occurred. She told others, I had one other cousin and aunt also come to be condescending and insulting. 

My problem with that is that I wasnt ready, my brother just didn't like how I never had time to spend for him because I was always working. 

So I tell my mom how furious I am after the party and how much stress I feel. My mom tells me to let it go and dont let it affect you. I try to but I cant. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~

I dont know what to do or how to react to this situation. I told my cousins that I'm closest with everything. They said fuck him because that was an asshole shit to do and that he is using me and robbing me of my money. Hurts but yeah. Apparently, one of them also got insulted by my brother when he said fuck you to him for no apparent reason. 

My name has been painted in black to my whole family and I just dont want to be insulted anymore cause I had a horrible time trying to enjoy that party. I got the decorations and everything set up and everyone loved it (according to my mom but idk). I dont want to forgive my brother for what he did to me. But I dont want to blackmail him either for his actions. I dont know what to really do with my relationship with him and if I should avoid any other family besides my close cousins. 

TL;DR - brother causes me a lot of problems and it causes me to get insulted by family.",13May2019,1

270,"Hey how's it going everyone. Last time I posted here I got fired from my first job and last week i got fired from my second job. Now I'm nervous to join anywhere. I worked for 3 months and 4 months respectively. I feel like i wasted whole year because i didn't get any experience that is worth mentioning in my CV. I have to join again as a fresher.
I worked as a sales person, now I'm considering to try in some other profile but just don't wanna get out my home",13May2019,1
271,"Hey there. I am a 25yr old female and I have zero people I can turn to for advice besides my mom so here I am. I am breaking up with my 32 year old boyfriend of two years. I didn‚Äôt want to at first but I have to. I‚Äôm not attracted to him anymore and I think I‚Äôm just overall scared of commitment. If I don‚Äôt do it now it will be years down the road and will be even worse. We  live together and have two dogs. 


Where it gets messy is that I don‚Äôt want to live here anymore (St. Louis area). I have no family, no friends, no real connection to anything, and I hate the cold. I have a job that pays very very well but the hours are the worst so it‚Äôs not enough to keep me here. My mom and brother live in Dallas and I want to move down there with them. I know I can find a job, I love the area, and it will give me a fresh start. But now I am stuck between two different options. I need some help before I go insane trying to think of what is best. 


First option: breakup in about a month and move to an apartment in the same town. I would be able to stay at my job a while longer and start really saving money. It would be easier on the dogs (they would have to be split up) because they could have play dates and we can co parent for a while. Ease the transition a little bit and help each other out since our schedules are rough. I would have some time to build my own possessions back up since I am going to leave most of our stuff for him. But, I would have to sign a year lease with the plan to move yet again after that year and go down to Texas. I would also still be close to all of his family and I would inevitably run into them and make everything awkward. 


Second option: breakup in 3-4 months and move to Dallas when I have the money, a job lined up, and a place to move to. It prolongs the inevitable but it‚Äôs less times moving, less time wasted in a place that I don‚Äôt want to be in, and I can get on with my life by finally making friends and being with my family. I would only be able to take one dog so we would have to separate them and it would be really rough on all parties involved. Dogs and humans. I really want to just move and get it over with but the logistics of moving across the country and starting my life over scares the shit out of me. Plus, why string my bf along for that long when I already know I am going to end it? 


The house is his so either way I have to have an exit plan when it happens. He makes just enough to support himself if he is careful with money but I can‚Äôt worry about his finances or I will never leave. I am absolutely awful at breakups. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to and I don‚Äôt want to make the wrong decision. I know a bunch of random people on the internet is not the best source of advice but I have to get some ideas. I‚Äôm lost.

273,"I made this account for this question in general ,first id like to say im 15 and nearly entering my last year in highschool,im not the most popular person and not the least but most people at my school apparently think im wierd because i don't talk much and i guess you could say socially awkward,its like when im talking to someone i need them to engage the conversation and carry it ,if it pauses i lose track of what to say and in my mind i look really cold to them ,im not like this when im comfortable with people but in general that's like 6-10 people.
I live in a house with my mom and sister and my moms half disabled and me and my sister don't get along,i don't really like any of my family to be honest as they shout loads so i don't talk to them.

That was a giant chunk of context but i have one question answered from people other than my friends ,there's a girl in my history who sits next to me on my row (my friends also sit to the other side) she used to drive us crazy but ever since year 10 started she has been alot more calm .i haven't talked to here much before but recently she has been talking to me more in lesson and i realised i really like her; i got this idea from her asking if i skate a couple weeks ago ,i said a little bit  and she proceeded with ""i like skater boys ,they are hot"" and then last week she asked to draw on my hand ,i said yes and she drew a rahwr meme on it ,(this was on my scared hand) she said i have nice hands and i said thank you ,the next day she kept asking how i got the scar and she followed with how she got a scar of hers after i told her.
I couldn't stop thinking about her on that Friday and i dreamt about it that night ,yesterday i woke up and i felt like i had expierinced something amazing,i told my close friend how i feel and he said it seems like she's interested in me,i think this as well but i barely know her and i asked how do i start to know her as im not good at all at talking ,he said i should ask her what to watch on nextflix but i don't know if to or not ,i lve thought about it alot and i asked them if they were out of my league as my mother is on benefits and i don't go out as i live a while away from my school.

277,"When we first sat down I was mainly focused on my GF but about halfway through the meal I realized the child beside us had been consistently whining and had gotten choked on his food several times. I looked over and saw the toddler was trying to eat half of the moms hamburger. I can‚Äôt really say how old the kid was but he definitely looked too young to be eating an uncut hamburger without assistance. It explained the constant choking but I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it at the time.

A few minutes later the child spilled a full glass of ice-water all over itself and the mom just left it. She put paper towels down on the table but just left the baby sitting in the damp clothes. The father didn‚Äôt even really acknowledge anything had happened. Once again, weird but nothing to make me think twice.

Lastly, and this is what makes me think I should call CPS, the waitstaff were having trouble getting the computers to work so the family beside us were stuck waiting on their ticket. They were extremely impatient and the child was getting restless. The kid started screaming bloody murder so the mom picked him up and started gently rocking him.

My GF and I tried to ignore it and eat our food but after about 2 or 3 minutes it was getting on my nerves. Out of nowhere the mom screams ‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù directly into the child‚Äôs ear so loudly that it caused me to jump in my seat. The whole restaurant goes dead silent for a second until the child starts wailing even louder. I look over and saw the mother holding the child by one hand and one leg as he dangled in front of her stomach. 

Finally the check comes so they pay and head toward the door. All I could think about is if this is how they treat their child in public, how bad is it at home? I followed them discretely to their car and got their license plate number just in case.

I know calling CPS is a big deal and I don‚Äôt want to overreact which is why I haven‚Äôt reported it yet. I just don‚Äôt want the kid to be in a bad home when I could have done something.

Last Friday was the last we spoke. I asked if she wanted to hang around after class for a bit with me. She went ""Hmm"", thought about it, then decided to get going.

She showed up to the class we shared today, didn't sit next to me, and when it was over just quickly walked out without saying a word or looking in my direction.

283," 

Alright, reddit. First....... I'm stupid I admit it.

I got scammed by a girl who I met online. We talked for a few weeks. Eventually it got to the point where she claimed she needed some financial help. Her mom had died, and she had recently been laid off work. I was uncomfortable with the request. You see I'm rather successful financially speaking. And she knew that I had money. I was very cautious with this, and we had only known each other for a few weeks. However I also sympathized with her, because I was well off, and knew that I could go without the money.

I was torn at first

I told her I would send her a few hundred dollars, but she had to send me a picture of her photo ID, and a few other things. We friended on Facebook, and she was very clearly who she said she was (her account was years old, and went back to high school).

She agreed

However.... Eventually through further talks, talking with other people, and internet sleuthing, I would realize she had lied about a significant amount of her life. Her mom was alive, and she had never worked a day in her life.

Fortunately our scammer was stupid. As I said she gave me her real name with photos as proof, and even her home address. (she is withing driving distance albeit it's a long drive.)

As I said... I feel stupid for falling for such a scam. I was so skeptical to begin with

But how do I go from here?

And how can I get my money back?

She doesn't realize I've figured her out yet. And she has started asking for more money. Right now I'm just playing along, but eventually I got to do something.

How can I confront her in a way, that also guarantees I get my money back?",13May2019,0

Now here's the actual part I need advice on. I texted her a week ago asking how things were going and how she was doing. She didn't respond for a week, then texted Sunday at about 10:00 pm her time and said ""hey, sorry I didn't respond. It's finals season.""

291,"Hi, 

So my girlfriend (whom I've been with for 5 years) recently found out that her friend/ex-friend (We'll call her Karen) has been cheating on her boyfriend for months and he has no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know Karen and she's just a downright horrible person, she lies, manipulates and is totally selfish. This is often hard for people close to her to see. My girlfriend has just realised all this about her and no longer wants to be in contact with her any more. But she still has a couple of other friends that do hang out with Karen which makes the situation slightly difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Karen lives with her boyfriend and has done for a couple of years now, I met him only the once and he's a nice guy. He uprooted his life to move across the country and live with Karen. Karen has been sleeping with another guy now for months and her boyfriend has no idea/thinks everything is fine. He splashed some serious cash on a present for her recently and I feel awful for this guy. I don't understand how Karen can continue to live her life guilt free whilst living this lie, surely her boyfriend deserves to know?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a way of contacting Karen's boyfriend anonymously and I'm debating whether to send him a message with the truth about his girlfriend, if I was in his place I would want to know. But at the same time, it's not my life and is it my place to get involved? Ethically, surely I should let him know, but obviously it's not that simple.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‚Äòexcuse me....excuse me‚Äô and then asked me ‚Äòhow do you get a job in here‚Äô and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‚Äòyea we don‚Äôt know her that well‚Äô and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‚Äòawww no don‚Äôt say that‚Äô then the brunette said ‚Äòwell not weird just a bit...you know...‚Äô and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you‚Äô quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn‚Äôt in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‚Äòhave you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he‚Äôs dead cute‚Äô and then ‚Äòhe probably has‚Äô (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‚Äòhave you, have yet got a gf?‚Äô ‚Äô I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde said bye on their way out to me smiling. I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",13May2019,0
302,"I am really confused. I have a few days off work, so I had been home while my gf was working. Was pretty hungry for breakfast, and since we didn't really have much food at home and I have some experience in gutting animals, I prepared a lasagna using meat off this dog my gf brought with her when she moved in. When she came home she was absolutely freaking out, screaming and throwing shit at me and stuff, then she left. I really don't get what I have done to deserve this kind of behaviour. Like, I could understand if she was like a vegetarian or against eating meat or stuff. But she eats cows, chickens and other animals all of the time. Now I am really kinda confused. Should I tell her I am sorry? Then again, I don't really see how I made a mistake. Would really like some advice. Thanks a lot!",13May2019,0
303,"The past five years I've been having these weird dream anxiety attacks at night. I'll wake up fully aware that I'm awake, but my mind is still thinking about weird dream shit. I'll see images and hear stuff in my head. Not like sleep paralysis where you think it's actually there. For me It's literally just the same feeling as deep thinking. I'm not actually hearing or seeing stuff. It's like I'm imagining it even though I don't want to. I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the dreams I had before I woke or if all this bull crap is simply based off of my bed or pillows. It only really happens at my mom's house. I wake up kinda in the witching hour and think about this weird random stuff. I'll try to close my eyes and imagine something else to help me rest, but no. The thought melts away and I'm right back to dream thinking. It's like my dream is still happening deep within my mind, but I'm awake so I don't feel like I'm actually in it. It's still playing out. People are still talking and doing stuff. It's a truly horrible feeling. It makes me feel trapped like it's impossible for me to stop thinking about this thing. Always when it's happening my head hurts. Not in an injured way, but in a kinda heavy drugged out feeling way. It just happened to me about an hour ago. It was so overwhelming that I got out of bed and turned on the kitchen and living room light. I wandered around trying to find the remote to our TV hoping to be distracted from my own anxiety and thoughts. I couldn't find it though and I started to get a panic attack. When my step dad came out and asked me what was going on I could barely talk and I felt like I might cry. My mom then came out and sat by me on the couch. We talked about it. She made a couple observations. 1. Five years ago when these began I had just let my little brothers sleep in my room, something that's been happening ever since. 2. Five years ago I got my phone. I don't think it's phone or brother related, but I don't know. I did listen to asmr before I fell asleep, something I hadn't done in a while. The thoughts this time we're really weird. Something about my little brothers making stuff from metal and crafts. Something about them presenting stuff to me. I don't really remember to well. What's interesting to note is that I had watched a show about forging and presenting blades to judges that day. They aren't about the Same thing every time though. The one I had a couple weeks ago was about some kinda kid who was made out of wires and metal tubes like Akira kinda.  one of the earlier ones I ever remember having was about a little man sitting on my pillow and talking to me. Going even farther then that I remember after watching the fist dalek based Dr. who episode of the newer series, waking up and seeing constant shots of the daleks within my thinking. I know this stuff doesn't sound that frightening, but trust me... It really sucks. I can't find anything about this kinda thing on the internet so I thought this might be the next best thing. I want to know if anyone else experiences this and if so how do they deal with it?",13May2019,1
304,"Okay, so, sorry but this may be a long read! I‚Äôll put a TLDR at the bottom! I‚Äôll try and keep it as short as possible 

I moved into a flat 3 years ago with 2 girls that I didn‚Äôt know before, 1 of which became a great friend of mine, a year ago she got a new boyfriend, i don‚Äôt know him very well, as he never really came round our flat very much, and she started spending less and less time at ours and more at his, they decided to move in together and she left our contract early, which is fine. 

We have to pay for a professional clean once a year and also an end of tenancy clean when we move out, as she was moving out we left her to arrange for this. 

So she arranged for the clean to happen and she said that she would let the cleaners in (it was arranged during a work day), the clean was only for the communal areas of the flat so it was only actually 3 rooms, we booked in for 4 hours which should have been plenty. On the day of the clean my flatmate messaged saying the cleaners have asked for more money because they‚Äôve been there for 7 hours! I said okay but .. what have they been doing for 7 hours as our flat is not that big and it shouldn‚Äôt take that long, she got very defensive about it saying the flat was filthy before (it wasn‚Äôt and 4 hours should have been more than enough) I said how do you know theyv been cleaning the whole time and she said because theyv just called me to come and pick the keys up (which implies she left them in the flat on their own as well) 

When I got home, the flat was clean but it wasn‚Äôt as I‚Äôd expect, for example parts were still dusty, litter had been left outside and the floors had clearly not been cleaned. Also our furniture was left all over the place and nothing had been put back, I said to her that I think we should contest the extra time because of this and try and get some money back, she got incredibly defensive about it and we ended up having an argument over it, which I thought was strange. I asked her I send over a copy of the invoice and she did. 

I emailed the email address that was on the invoice to complain but I never heard anything back, I then found the company she booked through from the logo that was on the invoice and left a bad review on trust pilot, they came back saying they didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about, so I gave them my details, address etc and they had no record of my address, I gave them my flat mates name and they had no record of that either.. I sent them the invoice and they said it wasnt them and someone is fraudulently using their logo etc. I told my flatmate this and her reply was ‚Äòmy boyfriend booked it through his work (he works for a property company) so that will be why there‚Äôs no record of it (doesn‚Äôt make sense??) if there‚Äôs a problem I‚Äôll get him to contact them‚Äô so I said oh okay, could you let me know the contact details? And she said yes and then changed he subject.. 

I messaged again saying did you manage to get the contact details yet and she said that her boyfriend had sent an email to them on Friday and she‚Äôd let me know the response... so I said okay but Iv already tried that do you not have a number? And she said she didn‚Äôt know because he boyfriend sorted everything out for it ... 

I just have a really bad feeling about the whole thing, the fact that she got defensive when I said it wasn‚Äôt good enough, she said that the cleaners called her when they were done to come and pick the keys up but now she‚Äôs saying she doesn‚Äôt know anything because her boyfriend arranged it all... and why won‚Äôt she just give me the contact details to sort it out? And she doesn‚Äôt seem at all bothered that this company aren‚Äôt who they say they are? It‚Äôs bizarre! 

TLDR: my friend arranged a clean of our flat which I paid a third of, the clean wasn‚Äôt good so I complained, turns out the company are using another companies logo and details, my friend is being shady and won‚Äôt give me the details that she used to book the service",13May2019,1
305,"So I hear you guys don‚Äôt like mobile formatting, sorry about that. 
So like the title says, I have a friend that has been building a database with multiple backups of everything that anyone has ever sent him via any means. I found out about a year ago that not only was he saving texts, which I thought was a bit strange, but also every Facebook dm, Snapchat video, and just about every other thing that his other friends use. Now for a long time I considered him my best friend and told him many things (over social media as I moved away) that normally I would never say. Especially, when I went through a few depressed spells and just needed to say anything just to feel that someone was listening. 
Knowing that he continues to do this, makes me uncomfortable around him and now I just keep him at arms length. Which is awkward when we do talk, as we still run in the same social circles and live relatively close again. I still think he is a good person and that he would never use any of this stuff against other people. He brings up some of the funnier stuff when we are together which makes me think he doesn‚Äôt do this with malice. Sorry if the title is misleading but didn‚Äôt know what else to call it. 
Now the obvious thing to do is to ask him to just delete all the stuff about me, but he has always been overprotective of his stuff and data. I‚Äôm not a confrontational person and normally just let things go but seeing how similar things are ruining careers make me more on edge. So good people of Reddit, how should I go about this?",13May2019,1
307,"My partner and I had a time off a couple months ago. We started talking to other people (in a romantic way) but got back together about a week later. I cut off contact with all the people I started talking during the time, but they wanted to keep a friendship with some of them. It's no big deal, I am friends with my previous relationship and he knows it. But today I saw him texting one of the ""friends"" (not that he ever say what they are talking about or that.they even talk time to time) and the context was like this:
*Previous talk about how we'be been arguing a little*
3 (third person): so your boyfriend is asleep?
P (partner): no, he isn't getting much sleep lately
3: you're so nice, I would had been nice to meet you, too bad, I think we would work well
P: yes you , we didn't hook up but I would have liked to meet you, I think your smile is beautifull

308,"So to sum up myself before I continue. I'm 19, I'm relatively successful. I'm not necessarily the smartest, but I'd like to think I'm alright. I'm OK looking, fit, 6 foot, blonde hair, blue eyes, and well trimmed beard. But I'm having zero luck. 

I've tried everything it seems, being really relaxed and chilled out, being the general dude bro with major confidence. Nothing works. No one matches online, and when they do... It just seems that women are too nervous. I'm fairly shy, but it'd be nice to actually talk to the person I'm on a date with.

I'm not picky, I try to make myself laugh along with others when I can. But I'm frustrated... I know this might not be the right place to ask what to do.

Also, as a side note. I had a long term relationship in high-school for 2 1/2 years, but she cheated and broke off. It's been a year since then, and I try to not let it affect me.",13May2019,3

310,"Hello reddit, I've found myself in a very tricky situation and I need help and advice please. This is a very serious issue for me and I've written in great detail so be warned, this post is long. 

Background info: I am 23F and I graduated from university in 2017 2 years ago. I studied Spanish and Linguistics and got a first class in it, which was an amazing result. My plan during my final year was to apply for teaching courses so I could become a Spanish high school teacher. The plan did not work out well, as 2 of the places I applied to did not feel I had sufficient teaching experience (at this point I'd never done any kind of work experience in a high school, but since then in the past year I've been volunteering).

I had to get myself a full time retail job as I was desperately seeking employment and needed money, so since October 2017 till now, that's what I've been doing. I've also volunteered in high schools and done a little Spanish tutoring so my CV doesn't just have a crappy retail job on it.

This year I've applied for a job as an English teacher in Colombia and I got the job which I am thrilled about. The organisation that I have applied with offer these schemes in which young people aged 20-35 can go to various countries to teach English for a year, earn a reasonable wage and travel. I've worked with this organisation before in 2015 when I went to Mexico to teach English for my year abroad. It was a fantastic experience and definitely something you should do when you're young and don't have responsibilities.

I am really grateful to have the opportunity to go abroad again and leave retail to use my skills and do something rewarding and mentally stimulating. And when I finish the job after a year, I will have much more teaching experience and I'd be in a good place to apply to train to become a high school teacher. There is one person in particular who REALLY REALLY doesn't want me to go, my mom.

We live in a 3 bedroom house and one of the rooms is unoccupied as my brother moved out 2 years ago. My mom used to work as a teacher but left her job because it was becoming very stressful for her and to top it all off, my brother has been in and out of hospital with mental health problems. My mum also has a health condition that gives her aches and pains but she gets around just fine. 

As a student, I gave my mum nearly a third of my student loan money as she demanded it from me for living expenses as I was living at home whilst studying (I dont begrudge giving her money as a student, but I think its unfair that she made me give her such a large chunk of the little money I had whilst at university). So I left university with a ¬£1700 overdraft. If it wasn't for me giving her money, I'd have left university with a small amount of savings.

Since working, she has made me give her ¬£560 a month, which is nearly half of my wages (I work full time and earn approximately ¬£1300 a month). She even complains and says that this is not enough money.

It takes me ages to save money due to the amount I have to give her. I wouldn't sacrifice buying myself things I need just because of her, so it just takes a long time for me to save up what other people my age would save in 1-2 months. I do think its fair I pay my way of course, as I am working full time. But the amount she demands from me is ridiculous. She is on benefits (welfare) and pays half the bills from this.

Upon telling her I got the job in Colombia, she said ""you make me sick"". Then the rest of the day she was shouting at me, being very verbally abusive towards me, and following me up to my room shouting in my face. Every bad thing a mother could say was said yesterday when I told her about the job abroad. She then got every birthday / mother's day card I've ever gotten her and scribbled inside them with swear words and then ripped them up before coming to my room and chucking them on the floor in front of me.

She says that I'm selfish for leaving her on her own with no financial support for a year. She wants me to train to be a teacher here in London, but she doesn't understand that professionally speaking, it would be better for me to apply to train as a teacher after having done a year of teaching abroad as I will have a wealth of experience thereafter. The chances of me getting onto a teaching course from stacking shelves in a supermarket is slim, as they will ask me what I've been doing with my time since graduation.

She says that she will lose the house because she won't be able to pay the bills herself. She then had the audacity to demand I give her ¬£2000+ so that when I'm away for the year, she can pay the bills. She said that if she can't find a smaller home from now until I leave (the job starts at the end kf July), she will stop me from going. I've had to hide my passport so she can't take it away, and I will give it to my best friend so she can look after it for me.

My mom even said she'd ring the organisation that offered me the job and shout at them over the phone, telling them how I shouldn't go. I've had to call them to warn them of this, and also to warn them that she might try and call them pretending to be me, saying that I withdraw from my position.

I've even had to hide my bank details as I worry my mom will steal my money so I can't travel.

I would feel awful if my mom became homeless because of me. Am I selfish for wanting to work abroad? I need advice on what to do.",13May2019,1
311,"First of all. I'm 28. She is almost 18. There's a 10 year gap. Our friendship started a few years ago because I was added into a Skype call where some dudes were really abusive to this 15 year old girl. I reached out to her, and asked if she wanted to talk, and we started playing some Smash Bros online, and apparently she knew my cousin and lived close by. 

Randomly met her at a birthday 2 year ago, and we had fun. Played games. She added me on social medias, and she opened up about herself and I recognized many of her mental issues in myself. Anxiety, etc. 

We meet up every now and then, and talk, play games etc but lately we've really seen each other a lot, and in one case she stayed and slept on my couch. People are starting to wonder what she's doing at my house till 4am, and I am working in a profession with kids. I have never touched her or done anything. But i sense some red flags tho its innocent.

But lately, I have shown affection for her, and it's affecting my day to day life. I think about her a lot. I hope that she want to come over or hit me up on discord. When she's not, I feel sad. I am not in love with her(i hope not), that would never work, but she is affecting to a point where i loss sleep, i dont eat etc.

312,"I have been playing with this guys for 3 years now. The point is that since January I started to realize that their attitude is quite toxic in some games.

For me this is a bit stressful because I am quite calm and it affects me the way I play and I just want to play and have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I feel that they belive we are better than other teams, when this is not true and they feel like we should be playing at a higher level. In addition to that, they get quite cocky when we finally end up winning despite having played a really bad game. Its like they are playing with their head rather than expressing it with the movements or the gameplay.

318,"Hi everyone.

I need some opinions on what I should do, or what you should do. I‚Äôve been thinking about this for literally several years but I can‚Äôt seem to commit to either option, I‚Äôm constantly changing my mind about what to do. I know this isn‚Äôt a huge problem to have, but it‚Äôs pretty critical for me right now. 

TLDR: I live in an amazing place that I love more than just about anything else, but it‚Äôs 3,000 miles away from my family which is the most important thing to me. 

I‚Äôve been living in the Pacific Northwest for the last six years and doing really well... a stable career with lots of connections and an easy ability to move up. Lots of friends. A really nice apartment. Financially stable. The biggest piece is that I‚Äôm an avid hiker, and this is the best place to live for that. Mountains galore. I‚Äôm out there several times a month typically, except for in the winter. This is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever seen and it just feels like the place I‚Äôm meant to be. I love everything about it. 

...But it‚Äôs 3,000 miles away from my family who lives in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. We are extremely close - my mom and sister are my best friends. So they understandably have been asking me to move back east. Either home to Michigan, or to Pittsburgh with my sister. I‚Äôve missed out on so much since being away - holidays, vacations, birthdays, everything really. It would be amazing to live in the same city as my family again. But it means taking a massive pay cut, starting over in my career, being potentially financially unstable, leaving all my friends, and living in a city I know very little about and don‚Äôt love. 

The kicker is that I only moved west for my ex-husband, who is now out of my life but still living nearby. We don‚Äôt talk, but his presence feels like a shadow. I stayed here after the divorce because I love the area so much. 

I just need to make a decision and commit, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been trying to make this decision for years. In the meantime, I‚Äôm living my life on hold, not making any other major life decisions because I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll be living in a year or two. Which is a problem and I need to stop doing that.

So the question is - do I continue living in my dream city, all alone and missing my family? Or do I give up the place I love and move to a place I‚Äôm not that excited about, solely to be close to my family?",13May2019,1
320,"TLDR; I'm so lonely, my best friend ignores my problems, no one to talk to, how do i deal with emotions alone?


As the title says, no one is ever there for me, i feel like i'm so alone in this life.

I'll start by talking about my friends, I don't have many, i have like 2 good ones, which is pretty nice and chill.

One of them, we don't really connect emotionally, we just play games together and call it a day (he's an amazing dude) but I can't talk to him about emotions and problems because his listening skills are not what I want them to be, he doesn't do well with emotions. So he isn't an option.

Then theres my best friend (We live in different countries), she rants to me and I'm there for her every moment she needs it (she may rant to me maybe once a week, and I love it because it shows she wants me included in her emotions), she expects me to reply, give her my opinion, give her advice, but when I even try to let my emotions out, she's never there.. she may tell me ""Okay I'll just get the dishes done and I'll message you back! Just keep typing"".. so I type and type, she wouldn't come back, FOR DAYS. And when she does come back she brushes it off as if I never ranted.. this happened maybe 4 times now, where I ask if she would hear me out and help, she says yes, then gets busy and doesn't reply for days.. She's a good friend but it's hurting me.. I don't send her messages like ""hey where'd you go?"" Or ""reply!"" I just let her be, I rant and go.. it feels like she doesn't truly care, she just says she does...

Side note: I ranted to her 3 days ago but she still hasn't replied after she said she would, which is why I feel even worse while typing this.

Next, my wonderful girlfriend, she cares about me a lot but I'm just unsure on what to do, she has classes throughout the day, when she gets home she studies, has a few short convos with me throughout the day then shes back to working. she sleeps very early (like 7-8pm) too, normally my emotions start acting up after she falls asleep, which rules her out as someone to talk to, since she's either busy working, studying, or sleeping. 
I feel like I would be selfish if I took time out of her day to rant about how I'm feeling bad that day, or waste her time while I rant about emotions that won't be important in a year. So I try not to rant to her, but this brings a consequence, she doesn't truly know how sad I am some nights.

I don't know how to find time to talk to my girlfriend about my problems, I know she'll care but I can't have her drop her important work just to talk about these things.. my best friend makes me feel so ignored but I'm not going to start shit with her I'm just being patient and letting her be. And the first friend I mentioned isn't really an option, I play games with him when I'm in a good mood but I just can't when I'm sad.

This brings me to my final point, I'm feeling so alone.. when I get sad, I have no one to talk to, and it makes me even more sad :/ today was the first time I've ever thought of harming myself (not by cutting, just by pulling my hair or smth) I just am not feeling too good and I'm not sure what to do, any advice on how to deal with problems alone?

Current situation: it's 10pm, my best friends just ignoring me, and my girlfriend's asleep, my family is super closed minded so they'll never be an option, i just want someone's company, i dont know where to get that company, what do I do :(( I can't sleep because I sleep at around midnight usually, I'm not in the mood to play games, I'm purely in the mood to cry :/",13May2019,17

322,I spoke to this guy years ago who was a friend of my ex and we became friends through texting but then it developed into something more. Unfortunately silly me sent him some faceless nudes and he kept pressuring me to send them. I think at the time I had really low self esteem and wanted a confidence boost.  After all this happened I cut contact with him because he was becoming abusive. So after a year or so I contacted him because I was bored. Then he started to treat me really badly so I cut contact for good. A few months later he started to try and contact me again. I ignored him. I think he is a sociopath because he hates being ignored. Then in my town and college I started to notice people whispering and looking at me and saying this and that and I realized he may have been telling his friends shit about me because he used to live in this town. So after I graduated I decided to head off to Canada to travel and work and see new places.

So while I was away he was staging some smear campaign because he tried to contact me twice while I was. In Canada even trying to get my friend to message me and then I blocked him my ex and I guess now I have to deal with this shit until I can leave again....,13May2019,1

At work my job is to listen to people, mostly the elderly, and I‚Äôm always so concerned with time and what all I have to do. I‚Äôll sometimes catch myself talking too fast or chiming in between sentences. I‚Äôm good at my job and have been successful because of my tendencies but I think I could be better, especially if I learn to relax. 



It‚Äôs not just at work either, even if I‚Äôm hanging out with friends or family my mind is always somewhere else. Yesterday as I was spending time with my mom for mother‚Äôs day I kept thinking of all I had to do at home-laundry, cleaning, etc. the thing is I always get things done. 



I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever not gotten my work done. But I still worry about it. I‚Äôm one of those people who‚Äôs always worried about running late but gets to places super early. I‚Äôm just exhausted and want to find ways to enjoy the moment more if anyone has any advice.",13May2019,2

331,"When I get into a confrontation with someone, at the end of the day it's always me who felt the burden of being guilty. It's not that I feel wrongly accused. If I realized that I'm guilty, I wouldn't think too much into it, right? But every time people are mad at me, I would feel guilty. At first it's just that feeling of guilty, but then it grows into a very whole-eating-self kind of feeling, makes me feel worthless, not needed, a loser, etc. I know it sucks to feel that way. Instead of feeling so, I should have tried to be more cheerful and try to mend it. But no, when people went mad or disappointed at me, I always ran away from them. Keep my distance.

Or is it, just the world works? Some of us, no matter what we do, would be always be on the right side. And there's also some of us who will always be at fault, no matter what we do? Maybe because we do it differently than what's expected from society?

It just started with a couple strays a year or so ago. Think one Tom cat knocked up a female, but now I guess the kittens have grown and started inbreeding all over the place.

All my neighbors feed them, and take in their favorite kittens. They don‚Äôt seem to care there‚Äôs like 15 stray cats wandering around, boggles my mind.

But I‚Äôm allergic, so don‚Äôt like cats. I still don‚Äôt want the things homeless though, especially through another winter in a few months.

I don‚Äôt know if animal control would do anything- especially since the closest is about 30-45 minutes away.

335,"   I was born with a cleft palate and lip, it has affected my face and also my speech. Through the years of growing up, I have experienced verbal bullying from strangers and classmates. My family (esp. parents) has made some insensitive comments, but they are unaware that it hurts me. For example, when I wanted to join something that involves me talking, they would comment ""are you sure you want to do that?"" That really blew what little confidence I have in myself. 

    I may sound like a brat, but the reason why I hate my parents is because my condition is genetic (Although my parents doesn't a cleft lip or palate). I know that hating them for something they cant control is wrong and blinded. I tried telling that to myself over and over, but the feeling won't go away. At times, I refuse to talk to my family when they would come over and that enstranged our relationship. I'll be stressed whenever I would come home from school (bullying and studies) and when they would ask me what is wrong. In my mind I wanted to tell them what happened, but without even thinking about it, I would just slam the door on them even though I didn't want to. That really shocked me and them when I did that. Then, I would be too guilty to go out and talk to them.

   Earlier today, I was listening to my mom talking about her trip in Japan when suddenly I felt a sudden rush of anger towards her, her voice and face started to get annoying. At that moment, all I was thinking was stabbing my mom with any object closest to me. That scared me so I walked away and went to my bedroom to lock myself. She was confused and ask me what is wrong since I was visibly stressed, I just told her that I ate something bad last night. 

  This is just one of the many instances that occured. Over the years, the hatred has progressed from just feeling annnoyed to thinking about stabbing them. I'm scared that one day I might hurt them and I dont want that.

 I figured that before I can talk to them about how I feel, I have to take care of this uncontrollable anger first. I need some advice on how to calm myself down and qualm the anger, I really appreciate it.

336,"  

I've planned this trip (New york, Austin, Cancun) with a friend and I really wanted to get some advice on the options i have as a tourist in terms of shooting guns in Austin. In Europe we don't really have shooting ranges or other options so I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to finally try this. 

My grandfather used to take me hunting in Romania back when I was a kid so I kind of always wanted to shoot a rifle or other guns, just to see what it feels like (in a safe and protected environment of course). 

   
 

So what do you guys think would be the safest bet? shooting range? Is it even allowed for tourists? If yes, what would be my options? What about cost?

Can you go wild (shooting with automatic rifles at car wrecks in the desert)?

339,"Tl;dr Apartment complex is suddenly telling me I owe an additional 30 on my rent due to a pet fee. They knew I had a pet when I signed my lease renewal. Do I have a right to fight this since it was there mess up?

The apartments I‚Äôm currently renting used to be fine. I paid my rent on time and had minimal problems other then not having hot water in the morning and cheap drawers. 

Now problems have escalated. They haven‚Äôt sprayed for bugs all year and no matter how much I clean I have them. The entrance to the stairwell closest to my apartment has been closed off for over three weeks due to pipe work. My AC wasn‚Äôt working for weeks after they turned it on and only reason I found out it was a pipe leak was because I asked. They didn‚Äôt notify anyone.

On top of that start of the new year I had called to confirm that my rent price was the same. They told me yes. I paid three months of that amount before I got a notice claiming I owed almost 200 in back rent plus overdue fees. I went down and told them what happened. I said I would pay but was frustrated by the lack of communication because I‚Äôd specifically asked. I was told if I signed another 6 month they‚Äôd take care of everything. I wasn‚Äôt ready to move yet so stupidly agreed. Confirmed again before I left that I didn‚Äôt need to write a check and was told I was good. A week or so later I got an eviction notice. Went down and ended up having to write the check after all and just got a shrug and sorry. A month or so later I get another notice on my door, at the end of the month, claiming a check bounced. I had plenty of money at the time and have no idea why I wasn‚Äôt notified till the 24th of the month. The even more ridiculous thing was that it had two papers stapled together and each had a different amount owed. When I called to clarify I was told a third amount before getting a confused response when I pointed that fact out and being told to just come in that afternoon and they‚Äôll have ‚Äúfigured it out.‚Äù Did so and paid both that ‚Äúbounced‚Äù amount and the next months rent.

Fast forward to now after I‚Äôve been paying my new agreed upon rent amount for a three ish months. I got a notice on my door saying I owed an additional 30 of rent. I called and said that was incorrect because when I signed my lease I was told x amount and agreed on it. Woman says oh yeah that‚Äôs the pet fee. To which I said you guys knew I had a pet when I signed the new lease because I‚Äôd been paying for her all during my last lease and this was the amount I was told. To which she responded, yeah there was some communication issues, the manager will be in Monday so come in then.

My question is do I have a right to fight this extra 30 they are tacking on now since it wasn‚Äôt given to me when I signed the lease? Honestly, I might have let it slide if not for all the other stuff that happened around February. I‚Äôm super frustrated and would move out now but my lease isn‚Äôt up till September. And yes I know I was dumb to sign another 6 month and then not to go over it with a fine tooth comb.",13May2019,1

344,"Throughout my undergrad, I commuted to school because it was about 30min drive one way. After graduated from undergrad, I went for my Masters, which was about an hr away. I decided that I would try living away from home for the first time since I thought it would be easier than commuting an hr everyday. I ended up renting a place for a year. The first couple weeks in I was having a hard time eating and sleeping (I can't even really cook, all of my food was preped for a week at a time by my mom). I was basically anxious everyday when I've never experienced this before. I didn't want to deal with that anymore, so I decided to take a hit and sublet my place for the remaining 11ish months and lose some money.

After graduating my Masters last August, I got a job opportunity in my city. So the pay is lower than someone with my degree should be making, but I decided that since I'm living at home, and only have a 10ish minute commute, might as well take it and pay off all my loans in a year.

I've been in my current role for 7ish months, contract is for 12 months. I'm sure the company would offer me a full-time position, but I about 90% sure, it would be for the same pay, which is way too low. I know this because there was another contract employee before me and when his contract was over they offered him the same offer except full time (the reason Im not 100% sure if because he didnt have a masters).

Now I've started to look for new jobs in the surrounding cities. Furthest Im willing to commute is an hr, I feel anything more than that would be pretty hard. I'm also looking at federal jobs in the capital city which is about 6hrs away. Now I have a potential job to work there. The pay is double what I currently make. I feel the pay is a bit higher than what I'd make if I work in a close by city and would take me 1yr to match the federal job 6 hrs away.

Now, obviously the job would be great. In my field, a lot more money, great benefits, etc. The only disadvantage would be living away from home and probably not having the skills to live alone, ie cooking. I kind of screwed myself by commuting in my undergrad because if I did I would have learned all the necessary skills needed to live alone.

I know it's kind of a dumb situation and may be a obvious decision for some, but I'm not sure. Any advice appreciated",13May2019,1

351,"I‚Äôll try and keep this as brief as I can. 

When I was 18, I started at a non-profit at the bottom level (employer A). Several years later, I had climbed up to a mid-level position. Unfortunately, it still wasn‚Äôt full-time. A coworker of mine put in a good word for me to get into another similar facility full-time several states away (employer B). Growing frustrated, I took the job. Things are going just ok here but I don‚Äôt love it; it‚Äôs just work. Recently, a full-time position has opened up with employer A and nearly every person I used to work with has reached out to me encouraging me to apply. At this point, I‚Äôm sure to be a front runner. It is important to note that turnover is extremely low. There MIGHT be one (maybe two) more shot(s) in the next 5 years. 

This is where it gets tricky. I met my now girlfriend in June of last year while she completed a brief internship with employer A in a different department. Upon completing her internship, she returned to school several states away. In March, she moved several states to be with me (her schooling was able to be completed away from campus). An existing business is planning on opening new locations in the vicinity of employer B and they want her to run it. This is contingent on whether or not they can accrue a business for sale. At this point, the odds seem good but it may not happen. She is dead-set on staying here for at least 3 years as it is a good opportunity for her. She has supported me in leaving but can‚Äôt promise where her career will take her. 

My options are to: 
A: apply with employer A, take the position, live apart for minimum 3 years with the hopes that she can open her own business near me by the end of those years. 
B: stay here and hope she gets the job while being unsatisfied with my work all while hoping I have a shot at another rare opportunity with employer A. 
C: apply for the position with employer A, use the job offer (which I know has a higher starting wage) to leverage for better pay and at least improve my life where I currently am. (I have added considerable value to my workplace)

I understand option B is risky because it could breed resentment. Ultimately, we would both like to live closer to home which is near employer A. Employer A is one of a kind and if I hope to end up closer to home, I feel that I should take every chance I get to make it back there or otherwise be stuck somewhere else forever.",13May2019,2

354,"An event happened a while back, like a few years so, where my mother went off on a rant cursing the hell out of me. It was during a period where she had a boyfriend that made her miserable. 

I slowly became more reserved more and more towards her. It reached the point where I couldn't even joke around her. She kicked him out a few years after so he isn't back home any more.

A side effect of this, besides me treating my mother like a stranger, is that anytime she goes into a rant my ears basically shut off. For example I was going to wash the dishes she handed me a news paper to go through with scholarships I opened it up to just look and not five minutes later she starts complaining about the kitchen.

I was going to clean it up but then she started going on and on and doing her usual thing where she throws some bs claims like *what if I was bringing a guest home* at 7am and she's coming from work. She started cleaning up the kitchen and simultaneously ranting. The more she wanted was the less I cared. I just sat there with the paper barely really skimming and just looking at the clock so I didn't waste time when i had to leave for work.

I left for work and started contemplating that maybe it isn't the best that I zone her out entirely when she's like that. 

BTW let me provide some context as to why I zone out most of her bullshit. I was lying down in bed kind of sick I had to help her with some yard work. I didn't mind THAT much because she's asked me to before when I'm sick and I was okay. The excuse she attempted to use to get me out of bed was something along the lines of ""you think lying in bed is gonna help you get better"" which is the most fucking retarded thing I've heard her utter out her mouth. She wants help, I get that. But when you tell me bullshit like that I will fucking ignore that noise. I got up because it made me so angry I really couldn't stay in bed either way.

I don't want to get the police involved, I believe he used it to start selling drugs and what not.

I‚Äôve worked there for 4 years and I get along really well with everybody including the boss and I‚Äôm trying to keep it that way. 
The problem is that a coworker, who is kind of the unofficial manager, is an hour late to work every morning. She is the first and only one here so there are no repercussions. The reason I know this is because on the one day that I open, I always have multiple customers come thru and tell me we are never open when they come other mornings, and also she herself has told me that she is never on time. 
Lately our owner seems to be struggling with money because minimum wage has gone up. Our espresso machine and hot water have both not been working for months and he‚Äôs struggling to get the money to fix those things. He is really kind and hardworking and would lose his mind if he knew that my coworker was always late and that he was paying her for 5+ hours a week that she‚Äôs not there.
On top of it, my tips are affected for the first hour of the shift because nobody knows that we‚Äôre open at that time.

I have lost about 70 pounds over the past two years (mostly in a healthy way). I also have PCOS (I know it causes some weight gain so I was not sure if this was important to know) and I am also on birth control.

383,"So ive liked this girl for a few months. I met her around august from class and we seriously hit it off. We clicked- we had alot in common. We talked alot, eventually becoming closer and closer. So one day i bit the bullet and asked her out on a date. She said yes, though she had to cancel a few times due to other commitments. No big deal. We ended up going and it was great, like *reeeaally* great. We've been out to parties and stuff and we're usually together during them, if thats pertinent.

Eventually i asked the question about whether we were officially dating yet.  We held hands everywhere, went out a bunch- yknow that sort of thing so i dont think it was a random question lol She said she really liked me and that she thought of it, but she wasnt sure she wanted to be in a relationship since her last one ended badly, and she wasnt sure she wanted to get into another so soon. 

She wanted me to stay in her life, and that one day we probably can get in one, but that day would be awhile, since for now she just wasnt sure she should be in one. She'd prefer to club and stuff and if things were to ""happen"" while clubbing she wouldnt have to worry about it later. I kinda understood, but that didnt make it much better. 

She asked if we could still stay together as friends until she thinks shes ready. But i thought at first no, we shouldn't be. She seemed really distraught by this and i kinda felt bad, but at the same time i thought it'd be best. Eventually i relented, saying that we could. She gets me to help her with alot of things, mostly heavy lifting (shes not the strongest girl, not to be rude lol) and we hang out alot outside of school, but she says we can do this only as friends for now. We went to get things for her house the other day. I kept asking myself why i was there if i knew we weren't anything atm and may not ever be anything. I came to the conclusion that i may just be in love with her and that this isnt just some stupid crush anymore. But knowing we cant be more than that, at least for the time being hurts alot. 

I fell for her hard. I think she did too. We talked about meeting each other's parents (which we arent doing for awhile) we hug and hold each other alot and we plan new date ideas, but she seems incredibly indecisive about this.

Anyways, something has been eating me up and I can‚Äôt get over it. Any advice appreciated.

Background:
My girlfriend (we‚Äôll call her B) of five years parents are narcissists they have always put her in the middle of their problems. Oftentimes reducing her to tears and causing distress. She struggles with anxiety and depression and I try my best to educate myself and be there for her. 

Her parents are going through a time and she is wholly on her mom‚Äôs side even though her mom has done things to her that have affected me emotionally in turn since the last thing I want to do is see B sad. 

One particular event being that B‚Äôs mom reduced her to tears on the bathroom floor because she called B crazy even though B was right in what they were talking about. The way she looked up at me as I held her close and assured her she was not crazy will always stick with me.

Our relationship has taken sort of a backseat to the separation and I feel as though I am the last priority in most situations. Like no matter what I do I am wrong. Sometimes I think that B‚Äôs mom is super critical of me and how I react to things so I feel as though I will never be good enough in her eyes.

My main problem is that I can‚Äôt push past these events and situations when I see B‚Äôs mom. I guess I can‚Äôt hide my feelings in my face and my demeanor but I can‚Äôt bring myself to be ‚Äúfake‚Äù to someone who has hurt B.  So now her mom feels unwelcomed in our home because of me.

I‚Äôve tried a few things to improve my mindset and to motivate myself but nothing seems to be working.

I feel so bad for my parents because they‚Äôre financing me through this qualification and I keep on failing or delaying my exams.  At the same time due to the procrastination, I feel even more pressured to do well and my fear of failure kicks in and makes me feel so bad. 

I‚Äôm so confused about if I even have self esteem because I carry myself in an outgoing way but just can‚Äôt seem to feel good about anything I do- I end up thinking about if I‚Äôll ever feel happy in the future. I‚Äôve barely lived my life and I‚Äôm already regretting what I‚Äôve done.

391,"I feel like I'm too old to get upset over this, I'm almost 21. But I still live with my parents, I'll hopefully be leaving for university in just over 3 months so this might not matter then but this still really bothers me. This started when I was 17, I had a really good relationship with my parents before then, could talk to them like they were my friends all the time.

 But since the Brexit vote all they fucking do ALL day when they're not working is sit on their phones and argue about politics. Whenever I'm watching a movie with them, I look over and I just see their faces illuminated by their phone screens reading facebook comments. Whenever I ask them anything like ""what time is it?"" or ""what time are your work shifts today?"" They won't acknowledge that I've said anything for a solid minute and then respond. If I'm having a conversation with them it's like I'm waiting for a video to buffer because in between responses I'm waiting for them to finish posting on facebook or replying to a friend. Sometimes I'll get annoyed when I'm trying to have a conversation with them and go ""why are you on your phone?"" and my mum will say ""well I was on the phone before you started talking to me, you can't expect me to drop what I'm doing just to talk to you"". And yeah, I would get that if she was ever not on her phone, but she always is. And she's never doing something important, just scrolling through facebook posts looking to pick arguments with anyone who didn't vote the same way she did. 

I don't know if they understand how it feels because I was never the type of teenager that would sit on their smartphone all the time and ignore their parents. I didn't have one until I was 18 and even then I never brought it outside my bedroom. But my parents always have them out, they're permanently on them at the dinner table, so a family meal is just me sat awkwardly in silence while they scroll through facebook. If they do start a conversation, it's only between the two of them, and it's only about arguments that they've had on facebook. I should mention, my mum has about 5 accounts, she's banned on 3 or 4 right now because she's constantly calling people names. She says she argues against brexit because ""all brexiters are sexist and racist"", yet she got banned once for attacking this random guy's wife for being Chinese, called her a ""ladyboy"". She's just a virtue signaler that's a closet racist.

It's ironic because when my older sister was a teenager, she'd always be talking to her boyfriend on facebook at the dinner table and they would go mad because neither of them had smartphones at the time. 

I don't know if I sound pathetic, because I'm an adult, but I want a good relationship with my parents but I can't have a conversation with them anymore. It's gotten to the point that if I don't ask them a direct question, they will just completely ignore that I said. Like, if I come home and tell them about my day they'll ignore me, won't look at me and if i seem annoyed they'll go ""I don't know what to respond to that"" or ""what am I supposed to say?"" just completely shut me off.  It makes me feel stupid, boring, unlikable. Imagine having to converse with someone with just questions? And guess what, if I ask them more than one question at a time they go ""I feel like I'm being interrogated"". 

When I hang out with my friends I find myself apologizing for being a bore to be around because that's just how I see myself now. They insist that I'm not, but when your own parents can't even look at you when you say something, that's how you start to feel.

But what annoys me the most is that, if I give up on them and decide that I don't want to watch a film with them and would rather watch one on my own in my room they get really annoyed and offended. And I tell them,"" I don't see the point in agreeing on a film to watch with you when you're not going to watch it and go on facebook the whole time"" and they say I'm being dramatic. They'll spend ages saying no to every film that I want to watch, so my mum ends up picking. I sit and watch it while they're on facebook and every 5 minutes one of them will go ""sorry can you rewind that"" or ""what just happened?"" it's infuriating. Especially if I show them a film that I love and they don't pay attention. 

My parents are in their mid 50s, they don't take care of themselves so they might only have a couple decades left, and I'm not gonna be at home much anymore. But how am I supposed to appreciate the time I have with them if they ignore me all the time?",13May2019,1

I'm trying my best to be nice to her and say no but she doesn't take no for an answer. She keeps saying that I need to move in with her and i said no and she keeps telling everyone we will when anyone talks to her. She also harasses me into doing shit for her all the time. I went for weeks ignoring her and she will have my fiance let her hang out with me. She is so fucking annoying and I'm trying to be nice and not hurt her feelings but no matter what I do she is always there.

395,"Apologies in advance as i‚Äôve never actually posted on reddit and I dont know how to do anything like formatting.

 I really need some advice on what to do about this situation because im starting to get really tired about it and I can‚Äôt seem to figure out the best way to solve it.

The problem is a girl who hated me a lot in school, still won‚Äôt leave me alone... 5 years later. When she sees me ANYWHERE she will call me names and make comments to my friends about me. We live in one of those towns where you go outside and see at least 7 people you know from school so its quite hard to just avoid her. Its starting to really get to me as its not exactly a great feeling to walk into the shops or a pub without being called a bitch as you walk past.

Now the reason she hates me so much is because I went out with her ex boyfriend when we were 14 (2014)..thats the ONLY reason. We argued a fair bit in school after that but i‚Äôd assumed after we left school (2016) and became adults we could just very easily ignore each other or maybe even laugh it off as silly school behaviour like i‚Äôve done with lots of people in the past. I never bullied her nor did she bully me and we were never friends at school so it was just very equal and I‚Äôve never done anything to justify how she treats me now.  She disliked a lot of my friends from school who she now seems to be completely okay with, except me? I stayed in sixth form and she left after we finished school, I hadn‚Äôt really seen her for 2 years until we both turned 18 and then we started to see each other again when we‚Äôre both out to drink locally which is now where the problem has picked back up again. (I would still hear things she said about me, however this was never to my face.)

I really have no idea what to do at this point as it doesn‚Äôt seem like its going to end? I would happily message her however i‚Äôve had her blocked/unfollowed since school days on all forms of social media and she is the type of person who will happily just start a full on physical fight with me if I talked to her in real life and if I messaged her she‚Äôd just tell me to fuck off.",13May2019,2

The short version of the story is, she and I were in the same friend group and started dating. She broke up with me because she met someone else and that sucked but we remained friends...even when I found out she had been sleeping with this dude before we broke up. Then about a year later we reconnected / i had forgiven her...so started getting closer again and it seemed like she wanted to pursue something romantic again, and I found out she was still with that same dude from the year before and had been keeping it from me.

Maybe with my own self published comic on the side for when I had the free time. And the way I always imaged I'd do that is through a fancy art school. But... let's just say its not looking good. Between the expensive tuition of schools like SCAD or Calarts, and their high requirements and the way in which my grades have kind of taken a nose dive these past couple years, I think I'm being realistic to give up on those particular schools.

My other younger sibling (20, M) told him to scold my sister bc that's her job as a mom. My mom sees her on the computer but never scold her anyway unless she feels like it. She then told my brother not to question how she raise us, etc. And I told her that my sister will follow whatever you want her to do if you just tell her, example, when you wake up I want you to do this and do that.

My younger siblings will follow my orders (I'm the eldest) but not my mom. I told my mom calmly that things on their time and the present is different. My mom's mother died giving birth to her and her father left them with their grandparents. So she basically does everything as a child. I'm not a psychologist or something but I think she wants us to do the same thing as she did. To do things without to be told.

So I told my mom that things are different. WE HAVE HER, A MOM. I understand that she does not know the feeling of having a mom but she should have not said that to any of us. She always compares us to other kids then, until now, and it kinda sucks. She never appreciates the little things that we do to her, she only sees us as a problem children and even say that to our neighbors.

408,"A throwaway account.

Me and my bf do see each other 3-5 times a week.

When we first met and we confessed that we liked each other and wanted a relationship, I told him of some boundaries I have as a Catholic. I made it clear to him that I do not want a sexual relation with him until we are married and he agreed.

We hold hands, hug each other and give kisses on the cheeks and forehead but that's about it.

It's been 6 months we are together. Twice we did kiss passionately and we haven't done anything sexual after that, because I told him I don't want to. He agreed. He is trying his best to keep to my boundaries. However, the two times we kissed passionately I could tell he sort of lured me into it. He came close to me in a different way, held me differently, ran his hands over me softly and was just breathing into my face, blowing softly over my face and lips and it made me want to kiss him and we did.

Anyway, so this one day we met up at his house where I do visit him regularly if we decide we want to stay in and not go out. One discussion lead to another and we talked about how it's like for a girl to be frustrated and how it's like for a guy.

We were in his room- not for the first time, btw. Usually we watch movies in his room when his family is home. That day his family wasn't home. He then asked me gently to sit with him on his bed and I did. Not something new either. He then asked me if I masturbate, I said no. He asked why and I told him it's not for me, I'm not comfortable with it. Also, I had never masturbated before, so didn't know how to do it. My bf however, has had sex before and knows quite a lot about it for both guys and girls. I've never had sex before, so it's sort of a dark area for me.

Anyway, he suggested that I learn how to masturbate and that this might help me with my frustration and that it's healthy for me. I made it clear that I don't want to and I won't pursue it and also that I don't know how to. He then told me he will help me and teach me. I said no. He asked me again, I said no. He then told me ""come on"". He stopped asking me and more pushed it... but I also eventually agreed. I did agree.

So, he was telling me what to do with my breasts, then with my vagina. I thought that would be it, because he said he's helping me. Then he starts touching me too. I didn't say anything, I was sort of enjoying myself but at the same time didn't want what was happening.

This next thing he did really hurt me later on. He pulled down my trousers and saw me. He saw my front and back. He didn't ask me if he could pull my trousers down. The thing is that when he did that, I also didn't react and didn't say no. I let him continue because I enjoyed what he was doing to me down there.

This last thing he did really made me feel like it was all so planned out. It was never to help me, but to make me do something for him. He asked me if he could 'cum'. I froze. I couldn't think straight or say anything. It was really a moment that felt like I owed him. The entire situation I was in summed up that I did owe him. And because of this feeling I said yes.

Him helping me lasted only for a few seconds in the beginning, very soon he started to touch me everywhere himself, which escalated to taking my trousers off. I didn't say no to any of it and I'm aware, but the final draw of asking me if he could 'cum' almost certainly ripped my eyes open to the truth in front of me about what he really wanted. It really did feel like that.

There I was trying to make him cum because I felt like I owed him- he was telling me what to do since I didn't know what exactly to do. I wanted to cry throughout the whole thing. He didn't go into me. We didn't have sex. But he also dry humped me and he came on me. He saw I wasn't happy. I know he saw how I felt throughout the whole thing after he asked me if he could cum.

I think because of my inability to perform well sexually, he still couldn't cum. So he got away from me, told me I didn't have to do it as he knew I was feeling bad. However, I think he got away from me because I couldn't make him cum. I think he felt bad for himself, not for me. Because he kept going for a long time ignoring my feelings until it didn't work out for him. And then used my emotions as an excuse to get away from me and make himself look good.

Edit: when he got away from me, I left the room and went into the garden for some air. I felt like shit and betrayed. It took a while until he came to me. I could see he had cried. He stood next to me, asked if I was okay, said he really cares for me, cried and said please not to leave him. He clearly knew he had done something wrong. I don't know if he had planned it so perfectly, but still he put me in a vulnerable situation that made me feel helpless. I just quietly told him that I won't leave him and left it there.

The truth is that I feel betrayed.

I haven't dumped him. It's been 2 days since the incident.

I genuinely want insight and advice on this situation please.

Edit2: When I told him about my boundary in the beginning, I asked him if he's okay with it and made it clear that of he isn't, we can't be together. He really insisted that he wants me and loves me. He said he's okay with it. Several times after that I've asked him and every time he says he wants me and doesn't mind keeping to the boundaries I set.",13May2019,0

1) how can I ensure I am not bringing rodents or bugs with me? My plan is to bring everything from the shed out back to the driveway where the pickup truck will be and put it in the flatbed back without going through it first (because there's no room in the driveway), then going to a parking lot where I can empty everything, go through it one by one and put it all into fresh sealed contractor bags and then driving to the storage unit to put it in the unit. Is this enough to ensure I'm not bringing anything or is there something else I should do? Do I run the risk of bringing rodents into the truck by putting it first in the flatbed without checking it first?

The worst part, though, is that there are some glaringly obvious semen stains on one of the walls by my bed, and on the blinds directly above the wall. 
On top of that, my room was JUST entirely repainted, so one of the perfectly pristine walls is now irreparably stained and I doubt anyone will want to repaint it. Not only is it disgusting, it‚Äôs also so inconsiderate that he just left it there to rot. I‚Äôm angry and feel like my privacy has been violated, but I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up without making things extremely awkward. My mom is far too much of a pushover to force him to clean it up, and he definitely won‚Äôt listen to me. Help!",13May2019,2

Usually I would visit for a month over the summer, as her whole family is over there. I stopped visiting my senior year of high school, and went for a Christmas break since. She came for graduation and that was the last time I've seen her. Neither of us had ever really called each other for years, unless it was a special occasion. I lost my grandfather at the end of my freshman year of college and it put a lot of things into perspective. I've never had strong family ties and somewhat wanted to mend that. I started to call every now and then, but she didn't really call me, including on my birthday. I tried calling a few times for mothers day yesterday but she didn't answer.

436,"Been unemployed for the past 5 months because of anxiety.


A few things I think are important. I'm 22 and I'm a very withdrawn person in general. I don't have too much trouble talking to people, but I try to avoid it if I can help it.

Anyway, about a year ago I started working for Amazon. The work conditions weren't what was described in the media, I didn't have to pee in bottles or anything like that. 

The first few months were decent since the pay was more than I'd ever gotten, the work was simple enough, though you'd get fired if you didn't meet their quality and quantity standards.

While employed however, I was still living in a sharehouse. 
I ran on about 6 hours of bad sleep for the entire duration of my employment (8 months), I felt like shit any time I went to work, though the fact that my colleagues were alright people cushioned it a bit.

About 5 months in, they raised the salary. Things got a bit more demanding past that point. The pressure had started getting to me, the bright lights shining in my face all night along with sound coming from pretty much every direction resulted in me leaving with a massive headache every day.

I honestly wished I would die on my way to work. I realized that I was sacrificing my wellbeing to fill the pockets of some guy I don't even know. This has been an ongoing theme with literally every job I've worked so far, all of which are warehouses. Now you might say ""then just work something else"", but I don't really have a choice. I'm a foreigner with no proof of education. I had to leave my home country on short notice as I had nowhere to stay and I couldn't pick up my diploma, even though I graduated.

Afterwards I started distracting myself, telling myself that I'll ""learn programming"" or ""make money from art"", though both of those things would be impossible to achieve in a few months with me lacking connections and confidence.

So, a few months later, here I am. Still no direction and each time I look at a job board I'm hit with a wave of anxiety because I need to work, but I know I'm going to have to kill myself doing it.

I feel lost. What would you guys do in my shoes?",13May2019,1
437,"Hi Reddit! So, this is kind of awkward, but I sweat a lot. As in, I don't even need to move around, and I'm already sweating! (I wanted to add that I live in Majorca, so it's hot 70% of the year here)

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that with most of the clothes whenever I sweat an unpleasant spot will appear (be it under my arms, on my back, or sometimes on the side of my clothes if I've had my arms there for a long time!). I started doing little stuff like, when being at University sitting with my back totally straight so it won't touch the back of my chair (so a "" sweat spot"" won't appear on my back), use deodorant that makes my skin dried, or even have a secondary t-shirt in my bag when I'm wearing a t-shirt to change into it (as all my t-shirts are black with logos or designs, so I guess (or at least hope) it's not too noticeable when I change them!), but summer is coming again, and this is reaching a point where I just know that ""sweat spots"" will come more often.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do to avoid them (or at least make them less noticeable?) Is there any kind of material that makes them less noticeable (thanks to a recent change of weight I need to buy new clothes!).

The project consist of working in team and creating events and making digital content for the Facebook page.
Before I left, to commit to the project I had to sign an agreement which I obviously read and convinced of what I was doing, I signed it.

Well after this 4 months I realized that I don't want to be involved anymore in this project... Most of the things I see are either stuck or I don't like them... For example we organise these events but nobody comes and I don't like the ""aggressive"" promoting part where we have to try to invite people on Facebook or just saying our events to everybody we meet... The digital content is even worse were we have sometimes to make silly things and we have no training about how to create good quality content.

The fact is that I am living this experience very badly in the last 2/3 weeks... I am constantly depressed and I also affect my team of 2 people and I just would like to quit this situation, but it's not easy:

It's not easy because in the agreement there is written that if the volunteer abandons the project because of his negligence or without giving any valid reason, he has to refund all the grant that was funded for his project... (260‚Ç¨ monthly+ travel expenses+ insurance) while if he abandons for something out of his control/ force majeure causes, he doesn't have to.

*Took out her name for privacy

So, here‚Äôs the back story:

Last year for Mother‚Äôs Day, we couldn‚Äôt afford to get either of my fianc√©‚Äôs moms a gift. This caused a lot of drama, so this year we made a real effort to make everyone happy.

We had brunch plans with his mom‚Äôs side of the family yesterday, in which we stayed for 4 hours (we were there from noon to a little after 4pm). We socialized with them and their friends, and played a game with everyone.

Once an adequate amount of time had passed (in our eyes), we said goodbye to everyone so we could go make a surprise flower delivery to his step-mom who lives 10 minutes down the street.

We did NOT get his mom and step-mom the same exact gift, they were slightly different.

For his biological mom, we bought her a dozen red roses and Starbucks.

For his step-mom, we bought her sunflowers.

And yes, we have a 9-week-old puppy that we had to get back to. She isn‚Äôt potty trained, and she had been cooped up for over 5 hours at this point.

We felt like we really tried to make everyone feel loved, and I feel like it‚Äôs absolute B.S. to receive this text message.

For one thing, I think it‚Äôs unhealthy to pin your son in a bad situation where he has to play favorites with parents - even if they aren‚Äôt biological. Both sets of parents helped raise him with 50/50 custody and should be honored.

And on top of that, why wasn‚Äôt us being there and giving a gift not good enough? We feel absolutely defeated and upset by this situation.

I don‚Äôt want to respond until I calm down, because I won‚Äôt be nice about it.

Any advice on how to respond appropriately would be great.üíú",13May2019,1

454," Fair warning that this is going to be lengthy! To give some back story I was homeless for about 3 years (16-18) and had finally gotten my life together when I was around 20 years old(now 23). I was going to school and working and luckily able to afford rent because I shared with multiple people. I had saved up around 6k so I could move back to LA (where I had been homeless) to be with my friends and family. 

As soon as I moved back however my family used me as a personal bank account and has completely destroyed my savings. I also was fired from a good job because I had a panic attack at work from all the stress I was going through (family stress/money problems/etc). I‚Äôve developed a really bad case of depression and have gained about 50 pounds, my bank account is abysmal and though I‚Äôve found another job, the hours are minuscule and I‚Äôm making about 500 a month, in Los Angeles that‚Äôs absolutely nothing. 

I can‚Äôt afford rent so my boyfriend has been covering what I can‚Äôt and the guilt is destroying me. I‚Äôve been having a lot of panic attacks and can‚Äôt even buy groceries without freaking out. I have a constant fear I‚Äôll be homeless again and have several medical problems I haven‚Äôt been able to take care of because money is so tight.

456,"A bit of back story, my gf (been together almost 3 years, we are both almost 20) used to live interstate and grew up there for most of her younger years and has a few friends  and family who she still keeps in contact with down there. One of said friends is a guy who she has openly told me that she has had feelings for but tells me she doesn‚Äôt anymore. 
At the end of the year before last, my gf tells me she‚Äôs going back over interstate (I assume to just visit family so I don‚Äôt think much of it). We were going through a bit of a rough patch at the time and when she is about to hop on the plane to go, she messages me and tells me that she is going interstate so she can go to said guys prom/formal. I thought that she at least should have come to me before saying yes to said guy just to make sure that I was ok with it, I‚Äôm no control freak but I feel like that‚Äôs something you should do when you have a boyfriend and you are planning on going to another guys formal. Seeing as we were already going through a rough patch I put an end to things as I thought it was a bit ridiculous. 
We then meet up a week or two later to talk about things and decide to get back together. 
A month after this, she tells me that said guy had kissed her on the cheek, which then turned into a peck on the lips which then turned to them full on making out over this weekend while she was there for his formal. (I still don‚Äôt know if anything more happened but I feel as though it‚Äôs not really my business anyway as we were broken up at the time, however I have gotten over that now.)
Fast forward to now and she is at University about a 6 hour drive from where I live and about a 2 hour drive from said other guys house (let‚Äôs call the suburb he lives in ‚ÄòMilton‚Äô) She has been down to said ‚ÄòMilton‚Äô two times in the last month and has said that she has gone there to see family and hang out with friends and told me that she did not see him. 
The other day, I was on her phone and was sending a photo of something to myself through messenger, I was scrolling to find my name to send it and see that she had talked to said guy recently, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see what they were talking about (I understand this is wrong of me to do and an invasion of privacy however I was quite worried) and surely enough when I read through I see that they have seen each other twice at least in the last few weeks, one of which they met up at a park at 2am in the morning after she had been drinking and the other time at his house at night. 
I then decided to confront my gf about this as I don‚Äôt think she should be lying to me about these things and when I confront her she gets mad that I went on her phone and admits to seeing this guy. She said that nothing happened between them and that they just talked about life and caught up on stuff. She said that they talked for 3 hours between 2-5am in a park in the freezing cold which I find a bit hard to believe considering in the messages she said ‚Äúwe could go back to your house‚Äù (nothing provocative or ‚Äònaughty‚Äô was said in the messages just them wanting to catch up with each other). 
Now I really want to believe what she is telling me and that nothing really did happen but now I don‚Äôt know what to believe after knowing that she has lied to me twice about him. Should I give her the benefit of the doubt and continue going out with her, am I just being too weak, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I won‚Äôt be seeing her again for another month and things left on a good note when I eventually had to head back home, she thinks that I am all ok now and I have told her that this is going to be in the back of my mind for a while and she understands that.

They are in such deep denial I cant even bring any of it up, they deny any part of it. I am engaged and they never said much to her for the past 3 years but they have been a little frosty towards her, they know they could talk to me about her but havent.
So we see them on holidays and other occasions, I felt.very close to them. Things suddenly blew up 2 weeks ago with 2 separate incidents with my fiance and them.
So here is my core dilema, I have always wanted more from them than they give. I have tried like one brother to just show up on major holidays and yet when I do I can see their dysfunction and eventually shit like 2 weeks ago happens. Things are smoothed over but I feel like I still want more and I just cant settle for this weird crap and yet they are the only family i have left. I do have an adult son who i do see but he is living his life, building a career. I do have my fiance.

Back story: 
I am the oldest of 4 siblings, I am in my late 40s. The youngest is 10 years younger. They are married or common law.  Our mother died 6 years ago, she was the patriarch who held things together. our father was a handful and became ill so that kinda held us together. But since he died 2 years ago things are slowly falling apart.  They had nice lives, they were lucky and basically have been with their same partners forever, the two that married have been married for over 20 years.

I on the other hand had a rocky life, I married a few times,.tried very hard and finally after one disastrous relationship went to a therapist for over 5 years. In that time I uncovered what a fucked up dysfunctional family we had growing up starting with the seriously flawed relationship my parents had from the moment they laid eyes on each other at a dance. They never loved each other.

I fucking worked hard to sort things out and back in 2006 I met someone, she was the healthiest, we had the healthiest relationship I had ever had. My siblings  really liked her but she was hit with cancer, struggled with it until she died 3 years ago. I was disappointed with their lack of support, we had very little from them or anyone else and they knew that, It still hurts.

So in less then 6 months after her death, I met someone new. I had done everything right, went to grief counselling, I was slow in getting serious with her, we got engaged 2 years later, and our engagement will be a year and a half before we actually tie the knot.
So I felt I was overly cautious just to be overly cautious, i believe in what I have done, no regrets.

My siblings have been kind of cool towards her, they know they could talk to me about her but never did, one brother and his partner never spoke to her at a party where we sat across from each other for an hour. I called my brother on it, he was offended and despite an apology then and a year later he has never invited us over.to his place.

A few weeks ago my fiance and I were over at my sisters, my other brother and partner were there. 
In the course of one night my sister spoke to my fiance about what did she and her family think about marrying a guy who had been married a number of times before.
They had not really talked much so they were not on that kind of level, it came.off as tactless and unsupportive.

Then my brothers partner flew off the handle in a rage due to her being sensitive about a topic my fiance and I were discussing with them, it was weird in that my fiance and I were both talking and therefore both offended her but she flew off the handle at my fiance who she hardly had spoken to in the last.3.years.
She apologized the next day via email.

tl:dr

When the dust settled things seem to back.to where they usually are.

So here is my core dilemma, I have always wanted more from them than they give. I am trying like one brother to just show up on major holidays and yet when I do I can see their dysfunction and eventually shit like 2 weeks ago happens. Things are smoothed over but I feel like I still want more and I just cant settle for this weird crap, I want more than I guess they will ever give  and yet they are the only family i have left. I do have an adult son who i do see but he is living his life, building a career. I do have my fiance.

I usually dont go this long before I just say fuck it and just roll with this crap. But it's really gotten under my skin.",13May2019,1

459,"I posted this In career advice but with little to no response, so I thought I would try here. 

I am going to be a little vague with my post on purpose so please bare with me. 

My boss is getting old (well over retirement age in U.S.) and naturally I assume his retirement is forthcoming. He doesn‚Äôt speak much in regards to it though. 

I work for a fairly large company but my particular department consist of 3 people including me and my boss.

I have roughly 5 years of experience. My coworker has about 8 years of experience and my boss has 20+ years of experience. We all work in a position that is very unique. Combining our area of expertise into an industry to solve problems and save/prevent the spending of A LOT of money. I‚Äôm talking hundreds of thousands to sometimes millions. 

I get paid roughly $60k/year + Bonus with benefits.

My coworker gets paid roughly $75k/year + Bonus with benefits. 

My boss gets paid roughly $165-$170k/year + Bonus with benefits

I love the work I do. The work is challenging, interesting, and honestly I am position miles ahead of the average person with my level of education. I essentially work as an internal technical consultant in my mid twenties. People who do similar jobs to mine and have my ‚Äúbackground‚Äù are well in late stage of their career due to the nature of the job. 

Once my boss retires, I am confident that it will just be me and my coworker working. I doubt they will hire sometime to replace my boss when we will have to teach them how to do this job effectively. Once he retires, my coworker and I will take on a substantial amount of responsibility. Responsibility not only in regards to workload but in regards to decision making. My boss has trained us well and we are fully capable. 

My question is when my boss retires, am I in position to negotiate a substantial salary increase? I‚Äôm talking about a 100% increase or basically doubling my current salary? 

I want to start to prepare for this early. So that when the inevitable occurs, I can act relatively quickly and not let an opportunity pass me. 

Additional question, should I include my coworker on my idea? Will it hinder my raise or strengthen my chance to get a raise?",13May2019,1

I know if I invite my friend, then his fiancee will pretty much have to come too, even though I don't really want it to happen. I don't really know how to approach him on this subject, he is the type of person to just toss out a friendship, even life long ones, if they ""disrespect"" his family.

She blushed and smiled when I say hi first.

It's been almost two years since we last saw her so for a long time I've been wanting to go see her. I'm 16 so I can't really go on my own since I don't have a driving licence and I doubt my parents would let me go alone anyway.

Apparently my dad and grandma got into an argument a while back (don't exactly know when but probably over a year ago) and grandma said something about grandpa and dad has been mad at her ever since. I heard from mom that grandma has always been straight with her words and isn't afraid to say what she thinks. I don't think I mind that and I've never seen her as a bad person or even angry. 

But this sets me in a really bad position between the two, I want to go see grandma but dad doesn't want to see her and mom just is kind of in the middle ground. Grandma is over 80 now I think so I don't want to wait too long for things to cool down because it could be too late by then.

I always keep hearing about things like this that you should never just wait and wait and wait, but rather something like just do it because if you don't you'll regret it.

I am interested in seeing an apartment, however the landlord is offshore on an oil rig and cannot personally show it to me nor send his key to someone he trusts in the city or anyone that works in the building (they are privately owned condominiums). 

His solution is to list his apartment on Airbnb and have me stay there rent free until he comes back to the city (now until the end of June) as a trial period. The caveat is that he wants a $1000 security deposit that he says will be refunded to me once the trial period ends. 

I‚Äôm weary of sending the deposit just to see the place.. he says it will be refunded but that is quite a large sum of money to send when I literally just wanted to walk through the building for an hour max. I like what I see from the pictures and it fits my price range but am iffy about dealing with this man. What do you think about this? Should I send the money through Airbnb and document everything so that he can‚Äôt make a false claim afterwords? Or just skip on this place and find another?

In Denmark, we have this tradition where kids when they are in the 7'th grade have to either confirm or deny their Christian beliefs, and usually big parties are held with a lot of friends and family attending. At these parties the people closest to the ‚Äúconfirmand‚Äù, give a speech.

This year it‚Äôs my sisters (14) turn, and I‚Äôm (18) happily helping with the preparing party and doing much more than she is to make it special and helping my mother greatly, since she is the one organizing the entire thing.

There are no problems, until I think of the speech, because I have to say sweet things and cherish her greatly, but the thing is; my sister is hell spawn and a truly bratty, trashy teenager and we have a large amount of hatred towards each other.

I was talking to another girl a while back, before my girlfriend and I knew each other, and she dropped off of the face of the earth. She came back into my life later and started talking to me here and there, but it was all just friend type stuff. Later she starts telling me all this stuff about how she loves me, and it's all downhill from there. I bought it, played into it, and forgot to delete messages.

479,"Hi so I was cycling home from work and two people (chavs) around 16-18 years old I think were biking on the roads getting in the way of cars, they started blocking me and caused me to go into the back of one of them when they turned and broke in front of me.

I was annoyed and called them out on it I had to get off my bike to fix it, they talked back and came up and threatened me, I pushed one away and went back to my bike, I was then sucker punched in the side of my face, I told them to back off with some back and forth swearing, they punched me in the face again, not enough to cause me to startle or move or anything though.

I need to know if should I feel pathetic for not fighting back, I'm not a fan of confrontation or fighting in general, I'd always stick up for a friend or anyone I was with and I'd always fight back to defend them or myself if we were in genuine danger, even though they hit me twice all it really did was make me look at them, it didn't do any damage, they biked off so I stood my ground but I dunno, part me really thinks I should have punched them back or was I right not too?

I just don't think people see me as someone that's tough, I just wouldn't want people to think that I couldn't stand up and defend my friends or myself, I'm 29 if that helps with context. Anyway sorry about the long post, it's been a long time since I've been in something that resembles a fight, I do believe if they properly attacked me I would have fought back properly, thanks for reading this, sorry it was so long.

Edit: Also I guess they were just kids really that didn't know any better, they've got a lot of growing up to do.

481,"Okay so I'm a 20 year old college student who works full time. I have good conversations with my coworkers and classmates, people consistently laugh at my jokes, I've been told I'm a good listener and easy to talk to. I have one coworker who used to/still sometimes talks with me over snapchat constantly. I've give him advice over his friends and his breakup and he told me that I'm really easy to talk to and good give advice.

&amp;#x200B;

But nobody ever invites me to hang out outside of work, nobody initiates conversations with me. If I want to talk to someone I have to start the conversation. Nobody just decides that they want to talk to me, I have to, like, convince them that I'm worth talking to for a bit with a witty starter. On the rare occasions people initiate with me it's usually something that they're sending to a lot of people to maintain streaks on snapchat, so I'll turn it into a conversation if I can. But no one asks me what I'm up to or thinking or feeling, and no one wants to talk to me unless I remind them I exist. (Once I remind someone I exist the conversation can go on for an hour or two, so it's not like the conversations are duds, we're both engaged as far as I can tell.)

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any reason why no one ever wants to get closer to me? I was talking to one of my coworkers the other day and he called us friends, and I was like ""Yeah, but we don't hang out outside of work"" and he said ""Oh I thought you didn't want to hang out outside of work"" and I replied ""No I would really like to, actually."" But he's still never invited me to anything even though he hangs out consistently with another coworker I'm friendly with, and we'll talk and joke around for the entirety of our eight hour shift. So even if I give off the vibe that I don't want to hang out with people, wouldn't this conversation at least change the dynamic in this instance?

&amp;#x200B;

I know an answer might be ""ask people to hang out with you"" but the people I want to form friendships with ask other people to hangout all the time, so why am I the exception? Why has no one ever made the first move to be friends with me?

484,"I've been working for at this place for about 3 months and I am under a 9 month probation. It didn't take long for me to notice that every time I would talk to my supervisors, they would more or less give me attitude and simply undermine me in any way possible. I recall a ton of instances where their responses to me are the furthest from constructive criticism, and every time I make a mistake, no matter how small, they act as if I've committed a crime, whereas if someone else made a mistake, it was like a funny joke that they would get teased about for a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 months in, there was a dispute about working over time, which my supervisor tried to cheat me out of by getting me to sign a form that stated I wasn't working, even though I was. I brought this to HRs attention, and nothing was ever said about it again and I got paid for it. At the end of that week, I was notified of a performance review that was scheduled an hour and a half from the time I got it. Turned out to be a poor performance review, which leads to a follow up which was in another month.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a month and I have the second one. They same the same things, and without entering too much detail, because it would take a while, they're nitpicking what I do and that instead of something taking 5 minutes to do, I should do it in 3. And then they just bring up single occurrences to support the point that I'm not living up to their expectations, when in fact this work is entirely new to me and I had no prior experience, which they knew when they hired me. I'm not going to claim to be the smartest person or best worker, but their expectations are genuinely ridiculous; they seem to aim them just out of my reach, and even when I improve, the expectation goes higher.

 I've been told that they need to hand me a paper outlining what I need to do to improve, and have not gotten that both times. Another thing is that in both reviews, they said that because I don't do things fast enough, they can't teach me to do certain things. This is despite the fact that I am literally working all the time, and they have me do clerical work most of the day after I finished my few duties that are assigned to me. So their point makes no sense because they just have me do non important work the entire time that I could be spending learning whatever they want me to learn. My phone is actually off unless its lunch, while everyone else constantly uses their phones.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm being discriminated against, but I've never been in this situation and don't really know my options and who I can talk to. I barely know anything about the union I pay for, and I've been in contact with someone who works for the place that I work at, but this person, call them Z,  isn't an employee of the union. A is like the go-to for questions about the union. My understanding is that Z is kind of like a middleman for the union. We recently decided that it would be for the best to resign, so Z sent an email to the head of HR and our union rep, called Y, describing our game plan. I've never heard anything about Y, and Z never told me to talk to them or consult them. So I asked Z if I could consult Y about the situation, and I received a questionable response that was along the lines of ""what, my help isn't good enough?"" which is a major red flag to me and I didn't reply. My issue is that it seems that Z is guarding me from talking to Y. This was Friday, and I wasn't feeling well and I called out sick. I should also note that my official 3 month review was Friday, and when I was talking to Z, Z said that they would basically terminate me at the end of the review if I didn't hand in my resignation.

&amp;#x200B;

So I emailed Y over the weekend, and I called out sick again today. Still with no response, I contacted the union and left a message for Y. Almost a half an hour later, I get an email from Z stating that Z was aware that I called out of work and that Z could notify HR of ""my intentions"". Z also asked why I never replied to Z's email, also stating that Y forwarded the email I sent and apparently Y said that there was nothing Y could tell me that Z hadn't already said.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very concerned at this point because my union rep won't even talk to me which I think is ridiculous because that's their job, isn't it?

the following week i then texted her a about 5-10 times to where it got annoying; just clearing up potential misunderstandings, apologizing etc.. NOT me asking her to hang out after she already said no.

I sent her a few texts sharing how her rejection caught me off guard, but I do respect her decision etc.. it was kinda awkward and she did say to stop in the text a few times.. she kinda thought I was not accepting her decline to hang out, which i totally did, so I responded and cleared that up and told her thoroughly that I respect her and her decision..

She then replied that she knows I""m respectful, and I apologized if I made her uncomfortable, she replied and things we were cool!

then a couple weeks later I sent her a few more texts, because this coworker played some love song on break, and I didn't want her to think it was me that asked him to play it...

far fetched i know, but I wanted her to know I didn't do that because it would be disrespectful and rude ya know.. so I texted her and she said she never thought it was me..

then a few days later i apologized for making things awkward by texting her that, explaining how it wasn't like me to be this thorough and go overboard with the clearing up misunderstandings/illustrating my respect for her etc.. because it's probably annoying ya know..

i just really wanted her to feel respected and it was during a tough time and my worry got the best of me, which i told her and she understood and said things are all good once again.

we still work together all the time.. she's approached me a couple times to ask about products in my dept (something she's never done in the previous 8 months before I asked her to hang out)... she also said hi to me yesterday in the break room, probably just to have things be casual and normal again between us and not awkward..

she seemed very comfortable around me... but just to be certain, if there were any issue and she was concerned, wouldn‚Äôt hr and/or management have contacted me?

how does this situation sound? to me it seems like she knows i'm respectful, I've made that abundantly clear, she doesn't feel i'm a threat (i'm a very gentle/respectful person... she's seen how I am with customers, coworkers etc for over many months *before* i even began to talk to her/ask her out etc..

I have not contacted her for one week, she‚Äôs approached me casually since then, we still work the same shifts together and things are casual and normal again it seems..

she seems very casual about the situation, and it seems like i‚Äôm the one going overboard with assuring her to feel safe and comfortable, illustrate my respect etc when there‚Äôs no need to because she already knows so by my words and also actions at work.",13May2019,1

487,"Back in 2015, when I was an undergrad, I attended a party at a friend‚Äôs place. Long story short, I was in a really bad place emotionally and had been drinking a LOT - not that it excuses anything.

I don‚Äôt have much memory of that night, but apparently, I was hitting on a guy (whom I will just refer to as X). We were seated next to each other on the living room couch. He told a mutual friend the next day that I was flirting with and touching him all over, including ‚Äúdown there.‚Äù X felt uncomfortable and so, after 30 minutes or so, he got up and walked away.

When X was recounting the incident to our mutual friend, he said that ‚Äúif the genders were reversed, and I had done that to her, she‚Äôd be calling the police!‚Äù This makes me feel like I must‚Äôve really, really crossed a line.

According to our mutual friend, X now refers to me as ‚Äúthe girl who raped me‚Äù i.e. ‚Äúhey, what‚Äôs the name of that girl who raped me?‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt spoken to X since that evening, although I did ask my mutual friend to apologize on my behalf. All of this information was relayed to me by my mutual friend. We are still friends to this day, and he tells me not to worry about that incident and that he‚Äôs certain X is fine. But I still feel like some kind of a monster. I feel like I committed sexual assault and got away with it. I touched someone very intimately without consent, and I have no clue how long it went on for.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve felt immense guilt over this incident for years. I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting and this was just a relatively benign bit of drunken handsiness at a party, or if I‚Äôve basically committed a crime. 

I‚Äôve considered contacting X to apologize for that night, but as it was so many years ago, I‚Äôm scared that doing so will just seem totally nuts. I also don‚Äôt know how to reach him, although my mutual friend may be able to help if he‚Äôs willing. Should I contact him and apologize?",13May2019,0

For a very long time I've been highly considering legal emancipation. I live in a household that is deteriorating my mental health due to transphobia and many other issues. I've attempted getting help but nothing in the past few years has helped. Child services didn't do jack shit.

491,"I recently just graduated from university. I am originally from the Metro Detroit area and was given a couple of job offers in the Chicago area. The first job pays 42k and the second job pays 47k plus commissions. Basically, my job would be working for a third party logistics firm in the River North area. However, here are my questions. First, the job that offered me a 47k job has an office in Metro Detroit. Would it be sensible to save up all that money, live at home for a year then move to Chicago? Or, is it sensible just to move to Chicago area, and establish connections here? One of the reasons I like Chicago so much is that you have the ability to meet people from all over the United States. Metro Detroit, on the other hand, is very cliquey and people are only friends with others they went to high school or college with. Also, I feel that there is more opportunity in Chicago as you there are more jobs and you can grow with a company. Would love your advice!

Here's where the issue comes in. They have been (strongly) hinting that I need to wash the dishes and clean the office daily. This was not communicated in any of the interviews. On top of this, I do not use any mugs, plates, etc. in the office. They want me to clean up after everyone else, every day, on top of my marketing and business development responsibilities. My hours are also an hour longer than anyone else's in order accommodate the cleaning. 

I don't mean to bitch and whine, but I worked very hard to get where I am now.

Is this fair? How can I politely say no? Or do I just silently suck it up?

495,"Backstory:

6 years ago, I transferred to a new university with 2 years to go. On my orientation day I sat next to a really cute girl, and for the first time in my life, got a date with a girl in an organic way, striking up conversation and eventually asking for her number.

She was a few years older than me and at the time, much more mature. We went on one date and had a class together, during which time she flirted with me a lot. I never got that second date because she met another guy around that same time. 

Once they started dating, I didn't really see her or hear from her much for a few years, until around 2016 when she reached back out to me to come to a poetry event with her. I quickly realized this was just as friends and that she was still dating that guy, who had moved 5 hours away to finish up his school.

They got married a couple of years ago and she moved up to him. In late 2017, I moved up to the same town and she told me we should hang out since she lives there too. We became good friends, and though I always had a crush on her to some extent, I was able to separate it in my head and keep it very platonic. I've had issues in the past with girls in long term relationships messing around with me and enjoying my attention. I'm pretty shitty about it. So this time I even made an effort to meet her husband and helped him out with a project he was working on.

She's more mature and interesting than most of my friends that I usually see, and since most of them don't live in town it was nice to have someone I could occasionally get coffee with on weekdays. We'd do trivial errands together and things that just...felt like we were a couple. At one point she even let me in on the secret that she was an online professional dominatrix, though she was retiring when she told me. That made her hotter but I was flattered she trusted me as a friend enough to tell me (she said only me, her husband, and one other person knew).

This was all fine until 3 or 4 months ago, when she started deliberately flirting with me and teasing me a bit more about things. I made a few jokes about her former profession and we joked about me being a client. She called me out too, implying she knows that I've been into her for years...but was still playing footsies with me and resting her leg on mine under the table.

She messaged me right after I got home that night. I'm into a very specific thing (not dominatrix related) and when I explained it to her that night, she started sending really suggestive messages to tease me (not sexting, unless you're into what I'm into), at which point I realized this was more than a crush now and a genuine problem. She also told me they're moving back to our home city this summer, so I'll only have a chance to see her when I'm visiting family.

I couldn't stop thinking about her and though I tried to hang out a few times, she was always busy and never initiated anything. This went on for the past 2 and a half months, until she finally asked to get coffee yesterday. We would often go a month or two without seeing each other but this time it just felt different.

Given my track record of depression and desperate loneliness, I knew seeing her again wouldn't bode well for me but I couldn't not do it.

We got coffee until late in the evening, then went to Walmart for something I needed and got food. She teased me again about being a ""client"", saying she might come out of retirement and that she's never done an ""in-person session"", but that's what mine would be if she were to do it - which she wouldn't.

It was much easier to restrain the crush I had on her when I knew she'd never, ever show any interest in me again, which always seemed to be the case. Plus, she was married of course. But now, for whatever reason, even though it's still futile, I can't stop thinking about her. It's more than anything I've felt before and it's ruining me.

I've never *really* been in a relationship (I don't meet girls IRL and online dating doesn't really work for me) but I've been a party to cheating on multiple occasions. I know for that alone, I deserve this, but I can't focus on work or anything. I thought I was over my depression (last time it was this bad was with another friend who was in a LTR) but I feel like after all this progress I just fell down the stairs back to square 1.

I don't know what to do. She's a friend and it's unfair to ghost her. She's had multiple guy friends in the past confess their love to her and I don't want to be another one of them, because I know she sees me as different.

I'm also fiending for this supposed ""client"" session as it's my absolute peak fantasy and kind of a one-time opportunity I don't want to miss.

Tinder dates were causing me too much anxiety. I get ghosted a lot and now even if I meet someone else it's just going to be ruined by me comparing everyone to Her.

I've never met someone even close to how relentlessly attractive she is, not just in appearance but in attitude, intelligence, humor. Even her flaws just make me love her more.

We fit so well together but it doesn't matter because I know she just sees me as someone fun to fuck with. I don't know what to do except sleep.",13May2019,1

497,"I don't have a good relationship with my parents. We've been estranged for a long time. My relationship with my brother is decent, at best. We just basically text here and there, and maybe see each other once a year where he lives. He never tries to see me or make any effort. We never talk about anything really important. 

I don't want to go to his wedding because (1) estranged relationship with my parents, (2) nobody has ever made any effort to make my wife feel a part of the family, even before estrangement, and (3) this is my brother's second marriage, and he's only doing a wedding because his fiance wants to do it, not because he gives a shit about having a wedding. In other words, it's just keeping up appearances so he looks normal. 

 I know he will probably stop talking to me or talk to me much less than he already does if I don't go to his wedding. Is that a good reason to go? I feel like that's a bad reason to go, and that as an adult, I should be able to do what I want to do, and if he disagrees with it, then tough shit. Our relationship is already completely on his terms, so why shouldn't I get to choose one thing I don't want to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'll hate going, that my wife will have a bad time too, and that it will feel like a waste of time, money, and energy. A final reason as to why I don't want to go is because in my family there's always some stupid event in the future, i.e. a graduation, holiday, wedding, etc., that allows my parents to see me and obviously I have to be cordial even when I don't feel like it. So in a way, I feel hostage to these events because it permits my parents to keep acting like nothing is wrong between us.

They are still recovering their relationship to become friends again but it'll take time.

 And then my feelings came out now I know I like her (my best friend who was her 'ex' is supporting me too, I'm glad). We've been having a connection between us and not few people mentioning that we look like a couple. Until today where she suddenly ignores me and getting mad at me without concrete reasons.

 She wouldn't talk to me so one of her friend (mine's too) asked her privately. She said that she doesn't really want to give me hope when at the end she won't accept. So she tried to draw a line between us. But my friend also said that she didn't mention anything about she doesn't like me anything including how my behavior towards her that she hates (except she hate seeing my depressed). All she said that she was traumatized and don't want the same thing happen again. 

I'm trying to move on because it's my first and I'm in a bad  mental condition too. I've been getting depressed lately because of reasons and I'm actually recovering from it. Now this happens idk what to do. I do understand that I might have a glince of hope, but it'll take time right? I need something to clear my mind and start going on. Shit I'm 15 but I fucking drank 2 shots of vodka ffs. I'm heartbroken but at the same time confused. I don't mind the heartbroken all I need to figure out right now is how do I move on?

It affects alot you know. I don't know the point of living anymore (I used to think that I still have chapters of my relationship that needs to be filled in) now all I need to do is wait for the author to fill in the next chapters. There's another thing, you know when ur trying to sleep u get this imagination about ur fantasy world shit. Well mine has her and idk how to change it. Now I can't sleep without thinking about her. When I'm hanging out, how do I act then? I used to act close and she would accept me. What do I do now? Ill mention that she didn't know that I know about her thoughts about accepting me. I'm thinking to just do it by myself with the help of my few friends.

Sorry if I'm overdramatic but this is my first time falling in love (really in love) and my mentality is so fucking bad idk why. To the point where the joke ""I'll just die"" partly is my own serious thought. Now I have this problem..

For the past few days grades have been unofficially uploaded and I thought I had all A's. Well, I got my official grades back and I got all A's except for in one class where I got an A- . I misread the syllabus and I was only one point away. I logically know it isn't a big deal but I'm kind of upset that I'll never be able to have a 4.0 now, even though a 3.9 is just as good.

The thing is, I did bad on one of our tests and my prof told us that she'd drop the lowest test score but didn't. I'm positive that had she done it I would have an A in that class. Should I email her to ask about this? I really don't think anything will come of it, because then she'd have to petition her department head to change the entire classes grades. I just don't see her doing that when she could just say that she decided not to drop the grade, and if I had read the syllabus correctly I would've done it days ago where it would've been easier to fix.

On the one hand, I really don't think emailing her will accomplish anything other than an awkward exchange and annoying my prof. This class has nothing to do with my major and it's not like being a hundredth of a point away from a 4.0 is going to kill me. But on the other this is my grade and gpa we're talking about here.

I'm starting to worry that they might grow even more antivaxx and prevent me and my little sister from getting our last shots. 

*How can I change their minds?*

I already argued them with a bunch of facts on my side, however they keep giving me counterarguments like: ""You remember the Mexican Flu where they told us it was safe but it wasn't. How are we shure this won't happen agian?"" and: ""We don't know what's in them."". My counter arguments are: "" Vaccines are researched for at least a couple of year before they're released and if the cons outweight the pro's it would deffinitly not be on the market."" and ""With a 2 minute google search you can find them""
To the second counter argument thei got nothing but they keep repeating it. And for the first one their argument is: ""Remember those invertile babies from the Mexican Flu vaccine and the sister of your sisters best friends got vaccine complications from the measels.""
I think this is nonsense because there's just a small chance at having serious vaccine complications and it's better than dying from measels. Also he's really stubborn and often won't lissen to my side of the story.

509,"I think confidence is a problem of mine since I was little and shy. I grew up with this because I spent most of my childhood inside and never socialised with others beside social-media. In middle-school I wasnt really talking with anyone since I was bullied. Now I am in high school. Having a gf made me express myself more (before being with her I couldnt show any emotion and I had a poker face all the time, she says). Now I have the problem that I mumble whenever I speak (I'm pretty sure that it is related to my confidence because when I drink I don't have that problem, which, funny enough is a big reason why I drink sometimes, just to don't be self-concious or mumble). I don't want to go to an expert (idk how it is called) because I think it will affect my confidence even more since I couldnt solve that on my own and I had to go to someone. I think that there might be people who experinced that too and maybe they can give me any advice on how to improve 'myself'. (As a side-note; I stay in the front desk in class and when I think of that sometimes I start 'shaking' because I think that everyone is looking at me during the class; could it be related to anxiety?).",13May2019,1
510,"For months now, my parents' dog has been getting sicker and sicker. He'll hardly eat anything but treats now and he's been shitting liquid for weeks. My parents will give him any table scraps. My stepmother will just throw whole food items (bread, biscuits, meat, etc.) straight onto the carpet. The dog usually doesn't even eat it so, in private, I dispose of it myself (because I don't need her getting all sensitive about how I think what she's doing is sick). Whenever the dog barks or fusses, she tries, flustered, to get him to obey and make him quiet. She'll then reach over to this bag of treats by her seat and feed him treat after treat. It seems she thinks that he won't fuss if he's eating, but he literally has her trained and it's so obvious to everyone. But she refuses to hear it. 

This dog hardly runs or plays because he's so exhausted so quickly. They never walk him or take him anywhere except the front yard to relieve himself. He makes these horrible struggling-to-breathe noises in his sleep or when he's just sitting. It's so disturbing that he's suffering even when he's just trying to exist.

I, as well as other siblings, make jokes in front of our parents, calling him ""lard"" and ""chunky boy"" and, while my dad will brush it off, my stepmom will always be like ""No! He's a good boy!"" She refuses to believe it. My dad insists that he can see his ribs but it's literally just his coat. The dog is fucking massive and it's obvious that he's ballooned and become disfigured from the weight.

I don't even know what to do because everything I have tried in the past has failed when I try to confront my parents. They are very deluded and refuse to believe anything that goes against them. Not to mention, they both are MORBIDLY obese and have never heard a word we say about living healthier (even though we children are all thin). Even the vet has told them repeatedly that he's overweight and needs to lose FAST.

Is there anything I can do to save this dog?",13May2019,1

513,"I have been having confidence issues and in turn it has become harder for me to get into and keeping relationships. I don't like the way I look, dress wise and actual physical looks, I never have.

I haven't been able to stay happy for more than the length of a conversation. After I finish a conversation no matter how happy I was during it I can't stay happy. I know I need to talk to a therapist/counselor which I have not much has helped.

Going back to relationships, I have problems talking to men or women I am attracted to(I'm bi) about going out or whatever. I would say I probably have an irrational fear of asking people out.

Every time I actually get that fear out of my head, not for long, I then think about how I can't even take someone somewhere(I don't have money and I only have a permit not a driving license) which causes me to get put down and back to square 1.

I want to talk to my friends about my feelings. Even though they say I can talk to them about whatever I want, it is so hard to talk to them, it's not that they don't listen it's because of how every time I talked to someone in the past about my feelings I was made fun of and bullied.

Even writing this is so hard for me. Whenever I try to talk about my feelings I freeze up.

I want to get a job to occupy my time in a healthier way, but I can't because if I get a job my father will lose money since he gets money from the government for disability. I have tried working out but no one I know will work out with me and spot me, I have a home gym.

I feel like my mother compares me to my brother all the time, even if she doesn't mean to. Whenever I do something for my parents I don't feel like I am doing good enough.

514,"Me and my therapist have been working on trying solutions to help me cope with an extreme fear of death which, from what she had said is related to the PTSD diagnosis she gave me two years back. Now to make this short, this fear seemed to bloom out of nowhere but after experiencing and witnessing very disturbing life events including death has made me have this very intense pure fear driven emotion and is usually accompanied by severe panic attacks with out of body experiences.

Now I'm not sure if this is related but I personally think it is, but I don't believe in God or any sort of afterlife. I started really thinking about this and trying to find ""concrete evidence"" about what happens to the consciousness after death and after literately almost a year of obsessing and every single fucking night going through an existential crisis I found nothing, that there is no after life, there is no God, not for me at least. It confirmed my worst fear ever. My whole entire world flipped upside down and filled me with this sense of extreme fear and dread I walk around with now (usually these episodes of existential crisis happen at night but also happen with panic attacks). 

With everything I just said in mind, is it possible for someone like me to get over the fear of death entirely? And maybe even embrace it so I can move on and live with the possibility that this very well could be the only life we get and once we are dead we will return to the state of nothingness just like before you were born.",13May2019,0

She has 3 kids that are like children of the corn, and attempts to push her way into any social events. Mind you her kids are younger and ours are all older so able to stay at home when we go out. She gets pissed and goes off saying it's not fair. She was helping a neighbor put some stuff together for her wedding and asked why she wasn't a bridesmaid and gave her a lecture on my she should be. On our engagement , she was pissed she wasnt invited over (it was a surprise). She was mad no one attended her birthday (we all have busy weekends and the place she had it at was a crappy restaurant but since it's a local favorite she wanted to be the ""it"" girl. ) She believes her kids are the most gifted and told us that her boys ""don't lie to her"" (their 11) .

520,"This is really weird, and I've never been involved with drama like this. So any advice on how to deal with this is welcome.

The story starts on this past Saturday. My mom wanted one thing for mother's day. A rock, but not just any rock. A massive boulder for the front flower bed. Naturally me and my dad said yes and we went and got that rock, it took us all day to move it into position because it weighs 1,600 lbs.

4 months ago some new neighbors moved into the cul-de-sac. An elderly couple. The culprit is grumpy Dave. Grumpy Dave likes to stand at his windows and spy on anything that's going on outside. When the neighbor's kids kick a ball into his yard, he goes out and yells at them ""for damaging his grass"". He also likes to walk around with binoculars looking at people's houses.

I don't think he's trying to get a peep show but rather he is looking for things to complain about. Since he's moved here, all 5 of the surrounding houses have had complaints after complaints filed against them, for everything you can imagine.

He has it out for me in particular though. Just before he moved in here, somebody parked their car partially in his grass where it meets the cul-de-sac. This was after it rained and it left a big gash in it. The first time I ever saw him, or interacted with him, he was out there trying to fix it with a shovel while swearing to himself. 

The first words I heard him say were; ""hey you, did you do this to my lawn with your big obnoxious truck?!"" ""I should make you fix this!""

For context, I drive an 19 year old F-150 that was my 16th birthday present. The only truck in the cul-de-sac. Hence the only vehicle that could have done it, naturally. He is still convinced I made his first day here ""a living hell"" (his words) and hates my guts. Probably doesn't help that I put a moderately loud exhaust on the truck a decade ago...

I told him no and walked back inside. Fast forward to this past Saturday after we've moved that rock. The shower I usually use is being remodeled so I go to use my parent's shower.  

Apparently Grumpy Dave was up to his usual spying. Because he made a Facebook post about what he thought he saw me do in there, on the neighborhood's Facebook page no less.

He posted that me ""get naked"" and ""perform an act of beastiality"" with my dog. He even posted my full name and address. Obviously that got quite a stir...

Not me or my parents use FB. I didn't hear about this until today, literally 2 hours ago when my friend called me and asked me what was up with this dude posting fucked up shit about me on FB. Since I've never been involved with any drama, at least not since 3rd grade when I whacked Brandon upside the head with my math book, it was really shocking to hear that.

He told me who posted it and where. I made a FB account and messaged the admins of that page. I explained this to them and they removed it but it got something like 70 reactions and several dozen comments. The police never showed up so that's good I guess..

What I *think* he observed was me going to use the shower. I did take my shirt off but still had my pants on. The dog was sitting on their bed so I gave her a shirtless hug. That's it. 3 seconds of hugging is apparently depraved sexual behavior now. That will teach me to leave the blinds open from here on out.


____

So what do I even do now? I don't want to go the legal route since I can't afford that but that also seems like a hassle. I can just keep doing what I am doing, ignoring it. Everyone who knows me knows this isn't true...but the people who don't obviously wouldn't. I've lived here for 22 years now. Never had a bad neighbor, till Grumpy Dave. I don't want his lies turning the community against me...I walk the dog almost every day. Today is the first time where I don't feel comfortable walking her. I'm scared I might have a confrontation with somebody who has been misled.",13May2019,2
521,"Hi there guys! Please forgive me if this is the wrong sub for this, but it was the most appropriate one I could think of. Heads up: long post ahead. 

So, my mom is in her 60s now, and she's had a really rough life. I'm talking heavy family abuse, rape, PTSD, abusive relationships, deadbeat husbands, anxiety and depression... You name it. We have had a largely complicated relationship because of this and because of her own abusive tendencies, and I ended up moving far away from her to distance myself, even though I do love her dearly.

Most recently, we got some news that she's not well; she's in constant pain from RA, she's losing her memory, and her doctor says that she's a likely heart attack/stroke patient in the near future. She doesn't have any money for doctors or treatments (we're in South Africa, so specialised healthcare is by no means free, and she has been largely unemployed for a long time). I'm trying to help, but I'm only 23 and self-employed (and have a boyfriend who is somewhat financially dependent on me) so as much as I try, I don't get very far. Being physically far away doesn't help either. 

Basically, I'm not coping well with my mom's news. She seems to know what's coming, and is preparing for it quite rapidly; selling her jewellery and sentimental possessions, approaching me about her will, etc. She has accepted some of my help in the form of cannabis oil as she says it might buy her another few years, but she isn't convinced of that herself. When I approached my boyfriend about it, he offered a pretty vague ""everything will be okay"" and told me that ""time heals all""... Presumably with regards to her passing. I don't know what to make of that. 

My question to you guys, as hard to answer as it is, is: how do I begin to cope with this? How do I prepare for the worst, should it happen, and how do I do it more or less on my own, without support? If anyone can offer any advice or experience, I'd be so grateful. I'm normally good at taking things in my stride but this has really thrown me...",13May2019,2

525,"I procrastinated what I thought was an incredibly easy project. Then I became so busy the past couple of days that I didn't even get the time I meant to set aside to do it. So, what I expected to be a 3hr project ended up being a 15hr ish project, and I worked on it from 9pm to 11am. I had to redo it 3 times. I had to skip the class for it to work on it, but I managed to turn it in 11 hours late lol.

My next class is from 3 to 7. I haven't slept and I have a hard enough time paying attention even when I have sleep. Attendance isn't required and I do have friends in both classes that can keep me up to date, so it wouldn't be disastrous to skip. Plus, soon enough I'll be buried in projects as finals approach. Maybe I should take this time to take a break?

But... I haven't had a full week of attendance in the past 5 weeks. If I'm not skipping discussion, then I'm skipping (and consequently regretting) classes that I actually enjoy. I just skipped my morning class for the first time to do this assignment, so I'm bummed that I no longer have a class with perfect attendance. Now that I think about it, I should've just gone to class and finished the assignment later, considering that it was already late.

(They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‚Äòexcuse me....excuse me‚Äô and then asked me ‚Äòhow do you get a job in here‚Äô and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‚Äòyea we don‚Äôt know her that well‚Äô and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‚Äòawww no don‚Äôt say that‚Äô then the brunette said ‚Äòwell not weird just a bit...you know...‚Äô and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you‚Äô quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

So basically I‚Äôm fucking exhausted and feeling tired all the time, emotionally and physically. I‚Äôm doing my ‚Äùsenior year‚Äù in vocational high school (it isn‚Äôt correctly senior year in my home country but it is basically the same thing) which means, that when I graduate, I will also have a profession. In my case that means I‚Äôm a cook at the same time. 

This school has been very very exhausting and I have literally been working my ass off and studying and studying and being in the kitchen for long days and nights, and I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. My finals are in two parts, and this spring I did one part of it. The second part is in September. The time and effort I‚Äôve put in studying has got me feeling numb. I think my brain isn‚Äôt capable of processing the text I read anymore. 

The second thing that I think makes me more exhausted is that I train nearly every day. My hobby is olympic weightlifting (snatch, clean&amp;jerk etc.) which I love so much. I have wonderful friends there and I love lifting. The problem is, I have an issue with training. I cannot stop it, it‚Äôs a must for my mental health and I couldn‚Äôt live without exercising. It gives a break for me from studying and I love hanging out with my friends there. It just makes my body feel physically very tired.

If my life was for school and training only, I think I could easily handle everything, I think the hardest part in my life is, that my boyfriend for 2 years has been serving in military for 5 months now (in my country it‚Äôs obligated to every man) and the first 4 months I was very okay with it. Now that I‚Äôve became very tired because of trying to study and be an athlete at the same time, I feel like my boyfriend‚Äôs abscence feels so painful. We see each other about 1-3 times in a month.

533,"I feel Ike there is something wrong with me. I feel like i can connect with anyone and when I try it ends with me realizing that me and that person dont related or connect.

My sophomore year I was taking to this girl, Jay. Jay and I started talking when the semester was coming to an end and all throughout the summer. It was very fun and eventually I wanted to be more than friends but she wanted nothing more than how thing already were and eventually we stopped talking. To add, we never had a single conversation in person, it was too awkward and weird. 

Next it's the end of my junior year and I start talking to someone else, Kay. The same thing happened with Kate except, we are stilling some kind of friends and we actually talk in person, and very often. I am in the process of ending things even though I don't really want to.

 Back with Jay, when I asked her, I was persistent. She however, never had anything to say. That's always how it was, It was annoying that she never but even worse, it made me think i had a chance.
Now I don't blame her for anything bc I realise that I was the problem.

Now for a part on me. I am a antisocial person in public but when Im alone, I want friends more than anything. Its like a switch flips as soon as I get to school and I become a brick wall. I can speak at a normal volume so anytime I try to say anything, I have to try really hard or just give up.
I just had a a military ball (a sending away type part for the seniors in JROTC, and an awards ceremony for the underclassmen) where I spent the whole time feeling distant and not connected to anyone. While people were dancing I was standing there watching, wishing that I could be that open with myself and just enjoy the moment.

Now back to Kay. Things were really good over the summer just like thing were with Jay. [[With Jay, I actually like her friends alot and thought they were cool asf but I always got so nervous trying to talk to Jay. That also led to us ceasing communication.]] Then summer was coming to an end I started to worry because she had other friends and I was both afraid of how they would treat me and jealous at how they had fun with Kay. The same thing happened with Jay. She had a group of friends like Kay that she hung out with very often. With Kay, I got passed the friends part and we actually talked really fine in person, I got to the point where I gave her hugs (unfortunately this was a big step for me) but that's it. It all went to shit when I asked her to be my girlfriend. In summary, her response was ""I like you too but let's wait bc I have trust issues."" again, things went to shit. I waited till Valentines day to ask again. For her gift I made her a video of funny screenshots I took of her, got her a bear, and wrote her a really really nice letter. When I gave it to her I kinda expected something, at least a card but I got nothing. I had been talking to her for month by then and she didn't consider getting me any. That night I asked her about the girlfriend thing again already knowing the answer, a No. Now we are at a point where I don't really want to be friends with her because I just don't enjoy her company as much but I'm not a dick enough to just get up and go bc I don't want anymore regrets. 

Now I want to try to talk to Jay again but as a friend like she wanted because I really did mess up there and she was really cool. 

Now I'm at a point where I don't feel like anyone can really be my person. For one my personality in public doesn't reflect any of the real me, the cheerful(I think)guy inside that just wants to love someone and be happy.

534,"I recently posted asking for advice for my girlfriend and I. The post explained that her ex committed suicide (they broke up 5 months ago and dated for a year and a half) and I needed advice with helping her and feeling self conscious. This post is strictly for me. All my life I've struggled with a sort of self hatred and everything I do I feel that I could do it better. I get anxious very easy and I'm harder on myself than anyone should be. Despite our short length relationship thus far we've moved quickly and I honestly want to progress until marriage. She's an amazing woman and a lot of what I've always looked for in a spouse. 

Obviously I've been keeping to myself about the stress this has caused on my mental health because she's going through so much right now. She blames herself for his death since he threatened it and they made a lot of memories together. I try to understand that.

A few hours after we found out about the suicide she asked me if I'd be upset if she posted something. I told her I'd be fine and to do what she needed to do. Since she's made a total of 3 or 4 posts along with changed her Twitter header to a picture of them together. And I'm nosey and anxious so of course I looked at them. One of the Twitter posts is a video collage of many memories the two of them had. There's parts with them kissing, laughing, and just looking happier than ever together. I addressed before that I worried I didn't make her as happy as he did and she explained that with me she didn't have to worry about being cheated on, the only reason he ever treated her well was to make up for cheating on her, and that I made her happier than ever. 

Idk necessarily what I'm looking for here, maybe just general reassurance from an outward perspective. I just worry that I'm never going to trust that she loves me as much as she loved him. 



Further information if you couldn't tell we're in our 20s. She has expressed thoughts about our future numerous times in the past and has always felt like I was the slow mover of the relationship, so this hasn't been an issue in the past.

535,"TL;DR: want to leave my job to finish grad school and try something different - anxiety is making me terrified to do so.

I'm 25F, have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from a good university in Canada.

Got a full-time job right after graduating about 2 years ago. Did lots of co-op terms during my bachelors and have good work experience.

I switched from full-time to part-time employment in order to become a part-time student to get a graduate degree.

Lately (6+ months) I've been considering quitting my job in order to go to school full-time - I've been feeling like by trying to do two things part-time, I haven't been doing either as well as I could be. 

I really like the idea of being a full-time grad student so I can try out being a TA (I've done it before and I liked it) and get some teaching experience so that maybe I can work as an educator at a university one day. I'm not really passionate about my job (though I do find a lot of the work cool and interesting from a learning standpoint), and I would really love to be able to do something where I'm working more with people (teaching), or where I'm doing work I feel is really benefiting society (solar power maybe?).

Here's where my dilemma is - I have anxiety and the uncertainty that comes with thinking about quitting has me terrified. What if I never find another job after grad school? What if I don't graduate and don't find a job? This is a perfectly good job with benefits and vacation and I have a permanent position - I feel like I should be grateful to have it?

I have enough savings to keep me afloat for a while if I had to go without work. My research supervisor in grad school has a research grant and I would have a stipend that would probably cover most of my living expenses while in school if I went to full-time. 

I feel like it's genuinely what I want to do - leaving my job (on the best terms I can), being a full time student for a year or so, and then moving on to my next stage in life. I just can't stop my brain telling me that it's a terrible idea and that I will end up unemployed forever if I leave my job now, and that it will be a huge mistake. That my boss (who is a good guy!) will hate me for leaving and letting the projects I've been working on suffer.",13May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 3 weeks, my mental health has been terrible, and I've lost all interest in going. The first week, when he asked why I didn't go I simply made up an excuse. The second week I didn't reply. Today he sent me a message asking whether I would go. At first, I thought: ""will he give up asking?"", but I've realised that it's selfish to think that about someone who seems to care about you. I've lost people before for trying to avoid them when I've felt depressed, and it makes me feel like an awful person. I struggle to talk about mental health even with my closest friends and family members, let alone someone I don't consider to be that close. Plus, it will probably be awkward to him if I just say: ""Hey! Sorry I've been avoiding going lately. My mental health has been so bad I even struggle to get out of bed!!"".

542,"Hello! I'm a virgin in my early 20s. I'm fat, supposedly unattractive and have been rejected multiple (5+) times by women throughout high school and college. I masturbate almost regularly to porn and for the past few months, all I can think about is women. Now I'm completely aware that I'm in no shape to score partners or even try. I haven't ever kissed or come close to making out; the maximum I've done is hold hands. I've tried working out in the past but I've quit the gym three times by now. I do some exercise on me own time but not enough to get me fit in the decade to come.

Recently, thinking about women has been proving to be a constant distraction from work and study, a luxury I cannot afford because I constantly feel the need to move up, learn more and do better in my career, and get out of my parents' place and settle on me own. I do not want to be attracted to women like the way I am right now and no amount of masturbation or not-masturbation helps. Has anybody been in this kind of a situation before? I constantly find myself fantasizing about women I've liked, like or am infatuated with.

So I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and there‚Äôs this situation with a coworker where I asked her to get lunch outside of work and she denied me... things are most likely fine; she says hi to me and has told me she knows I‚Äôm respectful etc...

the following week i then texted her a few times to where it probably got annoying; just clearing up potential misunderstandings, apologizing etc.. NOT me asking her to hang out after she already said no.

I sent her a few texts sharing how her rejection caught me off guard, but I do respect her decision etc.. it was kinda awkward and she did say to stop in the text a few times.. she kinda thought I was not accepting her decline to hang out, which i totally did, so I responded and cleared that up and told her thoroughly that I respect her and her decision..

She then replied that she knows I""m respectful, and I apologized if I made her uncomfortable, she replied and things we were cool!

then a couple weeks later I sent her a few more texts, because this coworker played some love song on break, and I didn't want her to think it was me that asked him to play it...

far fetched i know, but I wanted her to know I didn't do that because it would be disrespectful and rude ya know.. so I texted her and she said she never thought it was me..

then a few days later i apologized for making things awkward by texting her that, explaining how it wasn't like me to be this thorough and go overboard with the clearing up misunderstandings/illustrating my respect for her etc.. because it's probably annoying ya know..

i just really wanted her to feel respected and it was during a tough time and my worry got the best of me, which i told her and she understood and said things are all good once again.

we still work together all the time.. she's approached me a couple times to ask about products in my dept (something she's never done in the previous 8 months before I asked her to hang out)... she also said hi to me yesterday in the break room, probably just to have things be casual and normal again between us and not awkward..

she seemed very comfortable around me... but just to be certain, if there were any issue and she was concerned, wouldn‚Äôt hr and/or management have contacted me?

how does this situation sound? to me it seems like she knows i'm respectful, I've made that abundantly clear, she doesn't feel i'm a threat (i'm a very gentle/respectful person... she's seen how I am with customers, coworkers etc for over many months *before* i even began to talk to her/ask her out etc..",13May2019,1
546,"Hey everyone, I'd really appreciate some advice on an issue that's plagued me since birth really.  TL;DR at the bottom

I quit EVERYTHING. Not because I get bored, or because I don't believe in myself, but I just truly believe nobody would ever care if I completed it. 

I start things, writing, a sport, an art project, a new show, an idea my boss might like, I throw myself into it with unparalleled gusto and passion and dedication... for like... an hour or two. Often once I start getting into it all the excitement I felt dissipates and I think ""what's the point? nobody cares. it's a dumb idea. why spend the energy on this when it doesn't matter. "" then I stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be a writer, a really good one, could have been a great one, but everyone around me never commented on my writing, they would read it and say ""WOW - So what kind of car are you going to buy me when you're famous?!"" ""Dang girl! I'd like a 3 story house after you buy that island haha"" like.. I get it.. people are trying to be supportive and they think that saying I'm going to be rich from it is like.. their way of being supportive or whatever, But hearing ONLY that since birth? That nobody cares about the plot or characters or work I put in, only about what I could buy THEM when I'm rich?? it took every ounce of joy out of writing. By highschool I could only get maybe halfway through. I thought ""what's the point? nobody cares about the story, the research, they just want to stick around to see if they can benefit from it""

That's how it became with everything, whatever i did, someone would spin it into ""you're gonna be rich!"" and it sucked the joy out, a lot of it from my estranged mother, we've been broke our whole lives, so she was obsessed with finding ways to live vicariously through me or turn what her kids had into a pay day for her. Never cared about any of the kids, she didn't care about you unless you did something she could brag to church group about to make her seem so cool. Whatever I did, sculpture award, a play, cosplay, I even got a scholarship to study at stanford for the summer in 7th grade! wow! Should be amazing, right? No, it wasn't about me it was about how I could make her look, everything I did became a bargaining chip. nothing I did really mattered, nobody ACTUALLY cared. I even stopped having brithdays because what I did get, would be held over my head for all eternity, ""you can't cry that i hit you because I bought you that book 2 years ago!!"" kind of mom. Everything around me held no value anymore. 

Acting was the only thing that I never stopped doing, because nobody believed in me. Not a single soul thought I was going to ever make it, friends, family, teachers, they constantly belittled me and made back-handed comments about throwing my life away. I didn't care, I knew i was good and I knew I could do it. After highschool I got cast in a big movie with a big name movie star.  (still gonna remain anonymous so you'll have to guess sorry lol) as an actual character! Not an extra, a character with an arc and lines. I was going to keep it secret but I told myself I was crazy, I felt proud of what I accomplished so I posted the trailer for it. mistake. everyone came out of the woodwork. Nobody cared i gained weight for the role, the work I put in, how hard it is to even get a callback for something like that... just message after message about people joking about me buying them things. It makes everything seem so meaningless. 

Nobody wants to be my friend. People have openly told me they just ""stick around in case you get famous haha!"" every interaction I have seems fake. I tell people I hate it when they say those things, because a real friend would say sorry and express their support another way, but they don't, they stay the same, so not a real friend. I don't have any friends, no support, because when I get it it's always under the guise of me being rich and famous one day, which is literally never going to happen.  nothing about who I am. What I like or dislike. If I have a bad day nobody cares, but if they see my instastory of me at a photoshoot suddenly everyone is like AHH OMG HOW ARE YOU HUN I MISS YOU. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been depressed for a really long time. but now I finish nothing. I barely work out. I don't go to shoots. I don't seek out castings or attend the intensives i should to continue my career. I just can't help but think ""what's the point if I'm alone? I get to be in a fun movie then go home and be alone. Have no real interactions with people. Nobody would care if I killed myself right now."" and I know I need a therapist and medication for the depression but I can't afford that ('cause getting a couple roles doesn't mean you're suddenly famous OR have any stability, that movie check got eaten by medical bills. back to square 1.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what small steps I can take to start finishing things. I know I need to just get over myself, do things for myself, but I've been alone my whole life, to me nothing matters because I'm alone. I used to do it all, go to movies, events, parties, but always alone, never could make any real friends, go home alone. So i just stopped doing things, 'cause again, what's the point if at the end of the day I'm always alone? No memories or experiences to share with anyone. Just me myself and I. I don't finish paintings, food, I don't even finish Netflix Binges. everything around me is just so ""what's the point? nothing I do matters."" I've started small, take your vitamins everyday. do yoga every day. update your mood tracker app... but then sometimes I'll realize i haven't updated it in days. I'll realize I can't remember the last time I took the vitamins. things matter so little even when I make a point to remember them I still forget and abandon them. Time is all one big mush. I get a great idea and then just get overwhelmed. what's the point. what's the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I've been depressed since i was a kid, but I can't afford medical help. I feel like nothing I do matters and that nobody cares about anything I do or say. Whatever I start to do, no matter how excited I am, the passion wears off in a few hours because I realize nobody really gives a shit about me and what I do unless they can benefit from it. I don't know how to complete things anymore. I've been giving up for years. My life is just fading away in front of me. I'm trying to start with small things but that's not really working. any advice is appreciated.",13May2019,1

549,"Ok so this is going to slightly be lomg but I need advice and I  dont know what to do anymore. 
So I'm in high school and I have really bad anxiety. I started dating this girl who I slowly learned to trust and she was the only person that I have ever trusted to this degree. So we dated for five months and we were happy. It was great. We started off very loving and it only got better from there.  It was perfect.  Until a week ago. So I got a call from her (we used to call all the time) and in that call she said that she wanted to talk. She said that she felt like something changed and she started crying. I didnt feel like anything had changed but I told her to talk to me about her problems and we'd fight them together. She never did tell me. So after that everything continued as normal. But she was off. I started trying to make things go back to how they were by making jokes that I used to or stupid stuff like that. I tried. But she always seemed distant. We still hugged and kissed like normal but she changed. Then came last friday. It was right after school ended and I routinely went to meet her to give her a goodbye hug and instead she didnt hug me. She started crying and said she didnt feel like we were going to work out. I panicked. I started telling her that we could work it out all she had to do was talk to me. I'd help her through this. That we should fight for what we care about. It didnt work. When I got home I fell apart. I was so stressed I was dying. I started texting her asking what went wrong and trying to convince her to fight for our relationship, to fight for something she cared about. It didnt work. I broke. I got really depressed and started talking to my friends. One of them (who's friends with her) I got to message her so I could get more information. I found out what happened through him. So apparantly theres this dude she used to have feelings for and she realized she was catching feelings for him again. So she dumped me because she didnt want to date me while she had feelings for someone else. She told him not to tell me but he did. After that she told him that she didnt plan on doing anything with him but she just didnt want to date me when she liked someone else.  I immediately blamed myself. I feel like I let myself go and started using her as a crutch, I basically expected her to always be there. I'm not horrible out of shape but I am,  and i dont have anything to be confident about. Not to mention I'm a mental wreck. I feel like she fell out of love with me because I refused to make myself someone she could care about. When we started dating I was openly more happy and caring. I was still happy at the end I just stopped showing it as much. I also was fit when we first started dating. I know i shouldn't blame myself but i do. So I came up with a plan. Over the summer break (which is in like 2 weeks) I decided that I'm gonna get a job and work out a bunch, but most importantly I'm gonna seek profession help for my anxiety. I want to reinvent myself. And then next year I'm going to ask her out again, but this time itll be different. So I got really excited about this. I have hope. But then as I was heading to lunch today I looked into the gym (the class she was in) and I think I saw her sitting with a dude and he was stroking her hair. That killed me. I lost any motivation or confidence I had. I know it's none of my business because shes single now but it hurt. Now I dont know whether I should give up and be depressed so that she can be happy, or if I should keep going with the plan and then see what happens. I'm in love with her, but I dont know if I'm just wasting her time. Plus for my plan to work I have to remain friends with her (she said she wanted to be friends still), but I dont know if I can be around her. I'm so awkward, and I dont know how to interact around her. Plus I get so much dread if I think about what will happen If she turns me down. But if I give up now I'll never forgive myself. Idk anymore so that's why I'm posting here. Thanks",13May2019,0

552,"Okay so I'm on medication called Mirtazapine for anxiety and depression. This is the first pill I've actually been good on, I've gained weight and am now healthy, my anxiety is so manageable etc however I've been having bad night's sleep since November when they put me on it. I know this because I get vivid dreams every single night and I'm shattered all the time. 

I asked my doctor about the dreams and he said it's because I'm not getting a good night's sleep, and you only remember dreams when you haven't slept well. This makes a lot of sense because I'm super frazzled all the time, can't remember much and am easily confused most of the time.

Anyways after discussing it further with my doctor he said it's a good idea to ween me off the medication in the summer after I've finished uni (being tired isn't affecting my work half as much as coming off the pills will) which I'm fine with, I just didn't know if there was anything I can do to try and get a good night's sleep until then. (Another reason he wants to ween me off it is because my motor skills are fucked and it might be the medication so we wanna see if it is or if I have a condition developing. An example would be if I go to put my phone or glasses on my desk, instead of doing that my hand will drop the phone and then punch the desk)

At this point I'm very happy just getting just one good night's sleep until I get off the pills, I feel like I'd be refreshed and a bit more with-it with just the one night.

Not sure if any suggestions will work but at this point I'm willing to try almost anything. I'm gonna test out if I sleep well if I get drunk but obviously I don't want to get drunk every night just to be able to sleep, as tempting as that is üòÇ",13May2019,1
553,"A throwaway account. I posted this on r/relationship_advice too.

Me and my bf do see each other 3-5 times a week.

When we first met and we confessed that we liked each other and wanted a relationship, I told him of some boundaries I have as a Catholic. I made it clear to him that I do not want a sexual relation with him until we are married and he agreed.

We hold hands, hug each other and give kisses on the cheeks and forehead but that's about it.

It's been 6 months we are together. Twice we did kiss passionately and we haven't done anything sexual after that, because I told him I don't want to. He agreed. He is trying his best to keep to my boundaries. However, the two times we kissed passionately I could tell he sort of lured me into it. He came close to me in a different way, held me differently, ran his hands over me softly and was just breathing into my face, blowing softly over my face and lips and it made me want to kiss him and we did.

Anyway, so this one day we met up at his house where I do visit him regularly if we decide we want to stay in and not go out. One discussion lead to another and we talked about how it's like for a girl to be frustrated and how it's like for a guy.

We were in his room- not for the first time, btw. Usually we watch movies in his room when his family is home. That day his family wasn't home. He then asked me gently to sit with him on his bed and I did. Not something new either. He then asked me if I masturbate, I said no. He asked why and I told him it's not for me, I'm not comfortable with it. Also, I had never masturbated before, so didn't know how to do it. My bf however, has had sex before and knows quite a lot about it for both guys and girls. I've never had sex before, so it's sort of a dark area for me.

Anyway, he suggested that I learn how to masturbate and that this might help me with my frustration and that it's healthy for me. I made it clear that I don't want to and I won't pursue it and also that I don't know how to. He then told me he will help me and teach me. I said no. He asked me again, I said no. He then told me ""come on"". He stopped asking me and more pushed it... but I also eventually agreed. I did agree.

So, he was telling me what to do with my breasts, then with my vagina. I thought that would be it, because he said he's helping me. Then he starts touching me too. I didn't say anything, I was sort of enjoying myself but at the same time didn't want what was happening.

This next thing he did really hurt me later on. He pulled down my trousers and saw me. He saw my front and back. He didn't ask me if he could pull my trousers down. The thing is that when he did that, I also didn't react and didn't say no. I let him continue because I enjoyed what he was doing to me down there.

This last thing he did really made me feel like it was all so planned out. It was never to help me, but to make me do something for him. He asked me if he could 'cum'. I froze. I couldn't think straight or say anything. It was really a moment that felt like I owed him. The entire situation I was in summed up that I did owe him. And because of this feeling I said yes.

Him helping me lasted only for a few seconds in the beginning, very soon he started to touch me everywhere himself, which escalated to taking my trousers off. I didn't say no to any of it and I'm aware, but the final draw of asking me if he could 'cum' almost certainly ripped my eyes open to the truth in front of me about what he really wanted. It really did feel like that.

There I was trying to make him cum because I felt like I owed him- he was telling me what to do since I didn't know what exactly to do. I wanted to cry throughout the whole thing. He didn't go into me. We didn't have sex. But he also dry humped me and he came on me. He saw I wasn't happy. I know he saw how I felt throughout the whole thing after he asked me if he could cum.

I think because of my inability to perform well sexually, he still couldn't cum. So he got away from me, told me I didn't have to do it as he knew I was feeling bad. However, I think he got away from me because I couldn't make him cum. I think he felt bad for himself, not for me. Because he kept going for a long time ignoring my feelings until it didn't work out for him. And then used my emotions as an excuse to get away from me and make himself look good.

Edit: when he got away from me, I left the room and went into the garden for some air. I felt like shit and betrayed. It took a while until he came to me. I could see he had cried. He stood next to me, asked if I was okay, said he really cares for me, cried and said please not to leave him. He clearly knew he had done something wrong. I don't know if he had planned it so perfectly, but still he put me in a vulnerable situation that made me feel helpless. I just quietly told him that I won't leave him and left it there.

The truth is that I feel betrayed.

I haven't dumped him. It's been 2 days since the incident.

I genuinely want insight and advice on this situation please.

Edit2: When I told him about my boundaries in the beginning, I asked him if he's okay with it and made it clear that of he isn't, we can't be together. He really insisted that he wants me and loves me. He said he's okay with it. Several times after that I've asked him and every time he says he wants me and doesn't mind keeping to the boundaries I set.",13May2019,0

555,"I've found myself in a really bizarre situation that has escalated over the last 3-4 months. It started when I received a whole lot of text messages from my brother and close friends asking me why I'm harassing an ex girlfriend. Let's call her E. I replied to these messages concerned and confused. According to my brother and close friends E had been getting threatening phone calls and texts from random (I think spoofed) phone numbers. The person was claiming to be me. The person was harassing her using some personal info and referencing events that had happened in the past. As soon as this happened I called her and talked to her for over an hour. At the end of the call she believed that I was not doing this to her, and I helped her change her FB, Insta, SnapChat, etc password. I left the call NOT knowing these passwords, as I guided her through it over the phone but never saw what she changed them to. I thought this was over that night. The call ended with us saying we should catch up soon, as I hadn't talked to her in months and our relationship ended about 6 years ago. I was excited to talk to her again.

1 week later I texted her saying something like ""Hey, did the messages continue? Excited to catch up maybe we can facetime!"". I never received a message back, so I figured she just changed her mind about catching up with me. I was a bit suspicious about this based on the previous call, but left it. 3 weeks later I receive a text from a number I don't recognize. It's a screenshot of my snapmaps with my GPS showing where I am. I just reply ""who is this"" and don't think much of it. Later on I get a text saying ""you're fucked now, we know it's you."" This kinda freaked me out, but I still didn't clue in that it had anything to do with the previous weeks incident. I then received texts from the same number accusing me of being the harasser that has been called, texting, and emailing E. I replied back stating that it is not me and I don't know what the person is talking about. The person didn't reply. 

Later on that night I was laying in bed watching youtube videos and I received a call from a random phone number. I live in a town with a transient population so I figured it must just be someone I exchanged numbers with but didn't add into my contacts. When I answer the phone a female on the line starts yelling at me about why I'm harassing E. My response is basically ""I don't know what the fuck you're talking about even my brother asked me that, who are you and why are you doing this."" Right after I said that the call went dead, and I texted asking why the person hung up. No reply. About 1 hour after the phone call had occurred I get another text from the same number that had sent me the image of the snap map location. The text states ""We have a voice recording of you, we know you did it."" At this point I'm so confused. That is impossible. So I ask for the clip and the person refuses to give it to me. This is the point in the story where it starts to get really serious. I start talking to the person who sent the GPS images, and later confirm over facebook that it is E's friend. I talk to her all night telling her about how this has been happening for a month, and explaining that it isn't me. She clearly doesn't believe me because of the voice clip - but she also won't show me it so I can't defend myself. I am sent the clip a few days later and it turns out to be an audio recording of a phone call that randomly called me the day before. So this person audio recorded me then played it back to the girls making it look like I'm on the phone. She states that someone has been calling her and E with the call display of my workplace. I tell her that is impossible and that I will go there first thing in the morning and get IT to pull the phone records and check them against her number and E's. The text conversation ends for the night.

The next day I get up and go straight down to IT. I tell them what is going on and they pull the phone records. My workplace has never phoned any of the numbers that I provided them. I get a screenshot of IT confirming this and send it. I don't think they believed me. I called the police that afternoon to open a police report because I was scared that the situation would continue to escalate. That same night I had the police called on me, my name was given specifically and as far as I know I was described as the harasser. I told the police exactly what had happened and the call ended in them telling me there's nothing anyone can do and not to talk to the girls anymore. After that night I had not made contact with any of them until the other day. 

I figured that maybe things had died down. Then a few days ago my best friend received an email from E. The email contained about 10 screenshots of random phone numbers harassing her, emails harassing her, etc. The email basically was her last shot at getting ""me"" to stop harassing her before she goes to the police to press charges on me. at this point I haven't talked to them in 2 months or so, but the person harassing them has been making contact a few times a week. It's hard for me to know exactly how much because I cannot ask E as the police told me not to talk to her.

During the time that my best friend received the email I was on a road trip with a friend for 3 days. The email stated that the harasser was emailing E, and that the harasser was using fake email accounts. E said that she would only talk to the harasser if it came from my email, which she knows. The harasser made up some BS about how they can't do that because then it would show the IP (like that makes any sense). So my friend said ""man, if you email her from your real email she might actually think its you and believe you're not doing this - because the harasser stated they won't. I was really excited because on top of that, I had a trustworthy mutual friend who has been with me for the past 3 days who would have seen me doing these things to her if I was. I send her an email confirming my location and identity, and telling her my side of things. She just replies basically saying I don't believe you, don't contact me, then threatening a peace bond against me (canadian law kind of like a restraining order). 

I was blown away by this. I really thought this would prove it's not me. This event takes me to 2 days ago. I changed my number because of this. I just learned last night that the person who is harassing her has been calling the police quite frequently and lodging fake police reports against her. One of these phone calls she claims her friend overheard, and cofrims it's my voice. This is impossible as I have never phoned the police in their area, and the things they claim I'm saying I've never said. The only time I've ever made contact with the police in their area is when they called me 2 months ago. This is an actual crime, and why I am now scared. 

I don't know what I can do anymore. Someone is basically using my phone number and information to harass people.",13May2019,3

557,"For a long time now I‚Äôve struggled being open, or being my ‚Äúauthentic self‚Äù around others. I put it down to fear. I‚Äôd rather people not know me and hate me than know me and hate me? So around most people I‚Äôm quite reserved, quiet, a bit awkward, boring. The people closest to me are people who have taken the time to really get to know me, and I‚Äôve taken the time to open up to them and be myself around them. 

My closest friend tries to encourage me to be more open around other people. She says when I‚Äôm myself I‚Äôm very funny, witty, warm, caring, thoughtful. I just struggle to see these things. She initially thought I was pretty boring like most people seem to, but she broke down my barrier. I find it difficult being so open and ‚Äúme‚Äù in public, it feels as uncomfortable as if I were sat there naked. My sense of humour can be dark, sarcastic and I worry about offending people who I don‚Äôt know very well. I feel like if I were myself around most people it‚Äôd be inappropriate. I‚Äôve lost a lot of friends over the years, because I push people away.

I get we all put on masks for different situations, but my mask for acquaintances/coursemates is so disconnected from who I really am, I feel like a fraud. I feel like I‚Äôve missed the boat at uni for making friendships. I started off with a decent friend group which has dropped to just the 1 friend (and as nice as she is, I have very little in common with her). 

I need to get out and meet more people and make new friends, as lame and sad as that sounds. I just don‚Äôt know how? It seems so inorganic? I feel so anxious about meeting new people when its forced on me, let alone pushing myself to do it. How can I break down the wall I‚Äôve put up and learn to be myself around others?

558,"Hi, first time im posting here and i actually feel really ashamed. Also, sorry for any spelling mistakes and the formatting. English isn't my first language and I'm on mobile. 
So I'm 18 for 6 Months now and the first 2 months everything was fine. I had a Job, my father payed child support (he didnt for 16 years before) and i could live my life like a normal teenager i guess. 
But then my depression and my ptsd came back at my and everything went downhill. 
I needed to quit my job and needed to move away, at the same time my dad decided to stop giving me money because I'm 18. (He just payed 300‚Ç¨ per month, which isnt the amount he usually needs to pay but i waa happy with what i got). So he had the perfect timing for fucking me up actually. He changed his mind overnight from giving me money till im 21 to ""ah fuck this"", so i planned the rest of the year with his money and that was my mistake. I know I shouldnt rely on people moneywise but i had no other chance. 
So i didnt had money to pay my bills and i went into dept. I started 2 jobs at one but needed to quit one of them really quick because of my mental health. 
So i have one job now that gives me 450‚Ç¨. Its like a mini job, i cant really do more atm. But with all my billd running i cant pay my dept. Especially because my dept is with paypal (because i needed to buy train tickets to move) and my bank. Paypal doesnt allow you to have your account in dept and they threaten to transfer the claim to a debt collecting agency for collection.¬†Its ""just"" 140‚Ç¨ but they want there money now and i dont have it. My bank account is 460‚Ç¨ in dept and they also want the money right now. I tried to handle the situation and asked if i can give it back to them over time but they didnt allowed it because i didnt had a monthly incame the last months. 
I really dont know what to do and im really close to a breakdown. I wish i could work more or something to get more money but actually having 1 mini job is too much for me right now but without it i wouldnt even have a place to sleep. 
I feel really lost right now.",13May2019,1
559,"So, earlier this year I started college and although the subjects are interesting, I wasn't really identifying myself with the degree I choose, and just over a week ago I stopped attending class. But then, a job offer came and I'm pretty confident I can get this job because it's right on my alley (did my first interview today and it went really great, will be called for a next one too!), the thing is: the job requires that I'm active in college bc it's an internship. In this time that I wasn't attending classes, I am studying to get in to the college I really want to do the degree I actually want too. If I get back in college and get the job, I won't have anytime to study for that. I'm just so tired of not getting even a job interview, but I'm also worried that since I won't have time to study, I'll just get stuck in this degree for another year, which I really don't want to.

563,"Backstory: I'm a science major just out of my first year of college and made the choice to attend a fairly prestigious university with \*really\* steep tuition; my family is well off and my dad offered to foot the bill because he figured it'd be a better investment than sending me to a less prestigious but less expensive school. I'm starting to realize more and more that he was kind of wrong on that count, as college rank isn't that important in the sciences from what I understand and a public honors college gives STEM majors a lot of the same perks for a lot cheaper, but I love my university - it's also kind of the family college and I'd bring dishonor to the family name for leaving, and since it's the family paying for me to be there, I'm not against staying.

I came home for summer break and after less than 48 hours I've started to realize that I may not last long in my family dynamic anymore. ""Conservative Southern Christians"" will hopefully be enough of an explanation, but I'll go into detail for anyone who's curious. My mother noticed I had a hickey (long-distance boyfriend, saw him for the first time in 2 months the evening before, we're both good Christian teens but we got a little out of hand) and had a little talk with me hinting I should talk to a priest/break up with him before we both go to hell. That sparked a long spiel about ""sexual immorality"" that went from anti-homosexual to anti-Muslim back to anti-homosexual, and I made a few too many arguments against her (""well, Mom, NIH reports directly contradict that"", ""there are Christians as well as Muslims who endorse stoning gay people"", ""the pastor that got banned actively praised acts of terrorism against gay people, Mom"") and while she didn't get angry with me, I'm pretty sure I went too far and she thinks college has infected me with liberalism. If she brings this up with my dad I don't know if he'll cut me off or not. They're both loving, supportive parents, but they won't want to pay for me to go to college if they think it's corrupting my immortal soul. As previously mentioned, my college is really fucking expensive. So in case they cut me off, I'm trying to figure out how I could transfer (seeing as I'd be dishonoring the family name already). 

My first choice would be South Carolina's honors college - it's fairly high-ranking, but it's a comparatively cheap college and I'd be fully up to the task of funding myself with scholarships and work and such. I also have friends there and close by. They ""generally"" require a 3.6 GPA for college work, though, and mine is a bit (.3) below that - my current university is also routinely ranked in the top 20-30 colleges in the United States, which I'm hoping would cause them to look favorably on me, but I really just don't know. It also requires a bunch of other stuff that I think I could manage, but I wouldn't be super optimistic about getting in. I'd also need to spend one more semester at my current college and I guess I'd take out a loan to do that, but I'm wondering if there's a way around that or if I could like take a gap semester or something, I don't know. I'd love some advice - anyone who knows other halfway decent colleges to transfer to or has any advice whatsoever about transferring colleges (or anyone who knows a subreddit that knows more about this stuff), anyone who knows more about getting into UofSC, or especially anyone who could give me advice on smoothing things over with my parents, please, I feel like I'm blowing this out of proportion but I'm also scared as hell.

565,"Context: I'm a relationship coach attending an incredibly in-depth and challenging school called the Relationship School. I'm already a coach, men's group facilitator, finished 3 years in the school, and thought to learn to teach the things I had studied for so long was the next logical step. I volunteered to teach the first year course at the school thinking it would take me to the next level in my career. It turns out I'm not a natural at teaching, it's really hard, and the feedback around how I teach that I get from my mentor as well as a few coaches who are more experienced than me is sometimes crippling.

&amp;#x200B;

  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My life has become very focused on self-development and personal growth so I want to be open to their feedback, but it often brings me to anger, tears, confusion, frustration, and I feel the strong urge to leave the unpaid position. I hear things that are delivered to try and help me such as, ""It doesn't seem like you care about the students when answering their questions,"" or ""When you shared about being abused by your mom it didn't land for me.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These people have helped me in so many ways in becoming a better man, waking the fuck up, learning how to love after struggling with PTSD, and this training helped me start a career. I'm so grateful for the past 3 years and those who taught me.

&amp;#x200B;

  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It also feels incredibly painful to have what I believe are my flaws, weaknesses, and failures discussed so bluntly. The feedback doesn't always land for me, but it also often does which leads to a lot of personal growth. I've become exhausted and overwhelmed recently hearing their feedback. I'll even collapse into depressing pits falling into old unhealthy habits. It's like a continuous growing pain that drains me in every way I can think of. I feel like leaving the role and focusing on myself outside of the school instead.

566,"19M here and I will tell you a backstory on this.  I met this girl (lets call her A) so A and I met on tinder and we talked for a few months until we decided to meet in April. She was really pretty and an awesome personality too, the date went perfect etc. we went on a few dates after that and everything was going chill. Recently she stopped messaging me and when I confronted her about it she called me a ""clingy"", few arguments later she blocked and and I messaged her on whatsapp asking her about the reason to block me. She says that she is not attracted to me etc and that I am not her type, and she is not interested in being friends either. I respected her decision and I told her goodbye and have a nice life. she replied with ""same to you and hope you grow some brains"". I was taken back a little bit and then she video called me, I picked up the call and it was her roommate acting like a ghost to ""weird me off"". She had blocked me in instagram so I made a new profile and saw her story in which she took a pic of her friend vid calling me and the caption goes ""foolproof ways to get rid of a creep who wont just give up"". I was suoer shocked when i saw this and sent her a message on whatsapp confronting her on her behaviour. Her roommate took the phone and called me a ""creepo"" etc. she finally blocked me on whatsapp too but later on the new account which i made to watch her story, she called me ""bloody loser"". I really liked this girl, we kissed we held hands etc, but i cant get over the fact that she did something like this to me. I am a bit of a sensitive guy and I was always sweet to her.

568,"sorry for the long post

I have been dating this guy I met on tinder for 6 amazing months, I have never loved another like the way I love him, what I loved the most about him was how attentive he was to me. Like all couples, we had our fights over stupid things, sometimes I felt like he did not try to understand me.

3 weeks ago, I asked him if he would like for me to come over his place and he rudely replied that he wouldn't. Usually, he is the one pleading for me to come over. Anyway after a while, he texted me apologizing for being rude and saying that he was just stressed about work, I came over and we ended up fighting because I told him he shouldn't be rude to me infront of his friend(he screamed at me in front of him) while he felt verified to do so because I wasn't helping him out to organise the place...

when I left the next day, we gave each other the silent treatment for 5 whole days,I tried to reach out to him after and after numerous attempts, he picked up but didn't seem the same and he said he is fed up with our fighting which I understand. Because I love him so much, I have tried to reason with him, ashamed to say I may have indirectly begged for him to see if we can work it out, go back to how it was, but he says he has no desire to do that. 

I have asked him a lot of times if he wants to break up and he always says he doesn't want to break up with me, he wants to continue our relationship but of late, it seems one sided, I have been the one calling him, asking him how he is, telling him I love you. I decided to give him some space thinking maybe it is what he needs, it has been 12 days and I have had nothing from him, today would have been our 7 month anniversary (we were cheesy like that lol). I tried to reach out to him but he didn't pick (to be fair, he is usually working at this time). Even if it's the most painful thing I may have to do, I feel like I should let him go for my own mental health and sanity

Anyway should I let him go and how should I go about it if he won't pick my calls, I feel like a text is a rude thing to do!

580,I've grown quite dense about my situation. I've just passed out high school. If you're familiar with science stream opportunities in India then you've probably heard of JEE. It consists of 2 phases and I've cleared the first one(though barely). It's almost impossible to clear the second phase for me due to lack of preparation. I may not get my preferred stream in my preferred college. Now let's come in to more non academic side of the issue. I'm also not being able to come out of  a rejection. Got a severe back pain which is going to take a long time to heal so I can't indulge in sports. I wanna learn how to drive a car and dance but I'm pretty slow at learning artistic stuff for some reason. I'm having a mental breakdown almost every 3 week now.

581,"In a bit of a bind here: my roommate/landlord is moving out soon and I need to find somewhere for myself, other roommate, and my dog to live, but I'm not having much luck. The last time I was in this situation I tried Craigslist and though nothing ever came of it (I ran out of time/money) I was talking to *actual* people. This time it seems like I'm getting nothing but Roomster bots or out of state scammers. 

Googling places to rent only brings up professional property managers with places way out of my budget (I have about 2k). I don't need somewhere with bells and whistles, just someone with a spare room looking to make a bit of pocket money month to month. 

I feel like I'm at my wit's end here; we need to be out of here pronto. Anyone have any suggestions for websites that also do budget renting ala Craigslist?

One is the fraud department (where I'm at) and the other is the sales department (where the co-worker in question works). Due to us being on the same floor, I see this girl a lot, and while we've bumped into each other a few times, I've never been able to muster anything besides the usual ""hey"" or a weird face.

Lately I've been trying to get out of my comfort zone and meet new people, and this person seems like someone I could really get along with, but alas, I can't think of a simple way to start up a conversation or even get to know her name. The few times I see her I'll either be with my group of friends or vice versa, and my social anxiety isn't helping anything either. It doesn't help that her desk is the complete opposite way of anything I would ""casually"" go to, so I wouldn't have any reason to be there unless I wanted/needed to talk to her, and in my mind it seems weird to walk up to someone's desk and start talking to them. I've played a lot of scenarios in my head on how I would go about this but I believe most of them come off weird or awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to hear your thoughts on how I should approach her and get a conversation going. If you have any ways of starting up a conversation with a stranger or getting past your social anxiety I would absolutely love hearing them. While any help would be appreciated, I'm more so specifically looking for ways to start a conversation/friendship. Once I get past the beginning conversations I have faith I'll be able to do the rest lol.

583,"To start things off, I'm 14 and suffer from bad depression and anxiety (diagnosed).



so basically like to simplify the backstory, my mom has a lot of dogs. Too many for her to look after. Recently she was manipulated into getting more dogs to 'adopt out' (whole story about that but I don't wanna get too specific), one of those first dogs was one one I was assigned to look after, Average sized mutt who I'll call Rex since his name is rare. 
So basically what happened was the guy with the charity told my mom to keep the dog seeing how nicely we were getting along, and my mom told him that we'll do that. Don't get me wrong like, Rex is a lovely dog. Eye-catching, Obedient, an absolute doll and adores me to death. He's not the problem here. 

The issue is that I'm not good with dogs. I'm not really good with any form of responsibility, It'll work fine for the first few days but then I start to break down. 


Some days he helps me so much and is the reason I get up, other days I forget to feed him, get angry at him for doing dog things (peeing out of nervousness, eating cat food ect), I can be mean as fuck to this dog sometimes and he really doesn't deserve it, and really makes my depression so much worse since I don't cope well with animals in my bedroom, much less being forced to be the sole carer. 


I have the option to adopt him out to someone else. but there's some days I'll miss him to death, as well as he gets scared and upset when I leave him. I tell my mom so often that I want him gone but I can never commit to it. There's other days where him leaving is the best thing that would have happened to me. 


I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm going to get better or not, I would love to talk about this with a mental health professional but if I ever get mental health it's not going to be soon. So I'm not sure if it's fair to keep him in the mean time?

She can ruin your faith with her casual lies

She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me  
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you

She's ahead of her time  
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in  
She just changes her mind  
And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding  
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me  
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants  
She's ahead of her time

My parents have abused my my whole life. Unfortunately, I, being a broke university student, still live with them. Luckily, I barely ever see them now because we‚Äôre all so busy. 

Next week I have a hearing to legally change my name (first and last). A main motivation for this is because I don‚Äôt want to share a name with my parents. I‚Äôm doing it now because I am graduating soon and will be starting a PhD program (I‚Äôm 20). Now seems like the best time to change my name since I‚Äôll be getting my BA soon and I‚Äôll be publishing research as a grad student, etc.

They‚Äôll get over it quickly though. They‚Äôre alcoholics, so they just get super angry and aggressive in short bursts and then usually calm down. 

I have to tell them obviously I get mail and stuff with my name on it, so they‚Äôre going to find out anyway. I‚Äôd rather just tell them than get a piece of mail with a random name on it and have no idea who it is. That would just make them even angrier.

I still have a really distinct memory of this one time, I was on the couch in the living room with my parents, him, and my grandmother, and he came at me really fast from the other side of the room, and I screamed 'no' and I thought he wasnt going to stop and he was gonna grab me until my grandmother told him to stop and leave me alone. It was all a ""fun"" moment to my family, who just laughed about it so I just assumed it was fine that he didnt seem like he would listen to my no and idk he was just being ""silly"" and he passed it off as a joke. 
Last year I was sexually assaulted by someone else, and I didnt realize for a whole year that i was, and now that i know how that behaviour works, I've seen a lot of behaviour that's the same in him, and I'm just not sure what to think with these memories coming back. 
But I also dont think he ever did anything worse than what I've described above? If he did, I definitely dont remember. I do have a piece of a memory that was this one time seeing him without a shirt on, but I dont remember the context of that, and it may have been after he stopped messing with me and my siblings.

So well known that customers eventually found out where we lived just from my husband washing the car, doing yard work outside, or word of mouth.

Yesterday was the last straw for us, as a customer dropped off a Mother‚Äôs Day gift to me (I‚Äôm a new mom. Yay) at 9:30pm!!! Other instances of unannounced visits include customers coming by to see if my husband wants to hang out, if we‚Äôre going to open a certain day later in the week, if we can mark down a reservation for a party in our restaurant,  or other stupid miscellaneous reasons.

596,"So Friend A has made it pretty apparent today he is dating this girl. I've always had a gut feeling of distrust with her, after my other best friend (Friend B)  broke up with her. She manipulated him (primarily for money and free stuff), and eventually caused him to spiral into a state of depression for almost a year. After HE broke up with her, she then started spreading rumors about him being in jail (spoilers: he wasn't). I even told one of my other friends they were dating, and his first reaction was ""why does that kid have anything to do with her crazy ass?""


For some context: We're HS seniors. Friend A is very smart and outgoing (unlike me), and has never made less than a B. His parents push him to succeed, and to that he has. He's Mormon (if that means anything.) He's a great kid, hasn't done anything illegal (other than that one time he went a whole 5mph over the speed limit). He's as clean as you can get. 


Now, we have the girl. In essence, she's manipulative and greedy. She ruined by best friend for a year, and because of her moved schools. Don't think she's dated anyone in the mast 2 years, after my friend broke up with her. The most recent thing I remember her doing was at prom, grinding up on a bunch of guys. She doesn't have anything really likable, I can't see why either of my friends started dating her. She comes off as nice, but once your in, oh lawd she crazy. 


It seems all of a sudden, as well. On Friday, they were playing the pool thing in messages (I don't like iPhones), and he'd occasionally sit with her in History, but other than that, and being the type of guy he was, I didn't think anything of it. Then today, he doesn't show up at lunch, and my friend sitting next to me gets a text from his friend in the Tech lab saying they say in their and ate together. Here I am going to myself ""shit, of all people putting hoes before bros it's him."" I then went to meet him, and asked it they were dating. He said he thinks so. I then told him how she manipulated my friend and lied about him afterward. I said it kind of rushed, and definitely felt like I didn't come off like I wanted. He kinda said ""OK"" then I left. 


Then, when I got to history, he was in his normal seat, next to me, the girl on the other side of the room. Nothing to do, so we just stood there, my having no signal and a dead laptop, watching him watch math videos for his exam tomorrow, when she waltzed on over and sat on the chair (no, he wasn't sitting in it). She had a bag of popcorn, and offered me some, I declined. Then, here and there, she'd hold he hand out flat, and they high five each other like 20 to 50 times? Idk, so I kinda played it off by counting how many times they did it. Then saying how much, then the girl putting her hand back out to keep it even, idk. So I know he hasn't told her what I told him, but now I don't know if I should repeat it to him at some point? We play on the PlayStation together, so I'd rather do that than irl, when theres less tension and an easy out. I can see why she'd like him, but of all the girls that seem to have an interest in my friend, she's the one he picks. (I'm not gonna lie, one of friends saying she looked like Miss Piggy had me dying, knowing full damn well it's the truth). 


My mom thinks I should text my friend and see if she'd done anything I should let my friend know about. I'm 95% sure it wouldn't be an issue, but then I'd have to take him at his word (which I'd most certainly take over a lot of people). I think I should push my friend about it. I don't want him being left in ruin like my other friend was after the break up. But maybe she's changed? She's always been approachable, and we've even talked here and there.

608,"I (25M), over the past five years (since I graduated high school), have failed so much that my life is still the same as it was when I graduated high school. Allow me to (as briefly as I can) elaborate:

First I went to a broadcasting school in hopes of getting a career in radio (thus my username). I had become interested in broadcasting and decided not to go to college for engineering/architecture (my interest before I got interested in radio) since I wanted to save money and jump right in to a career (and hopefully avoid having to do a minimum wage job). After graduation from the broadcasting school and about 3 years of searching, I couldn't find one entry level job in that field. So that was a failure that now I have to pay for for five more years. I have thought of going to college for IT (my current career interest) but now that I'm older, I don't think any college will want anything to do with me. On top of that there's the student loan I'm still paying off from broadcasting school, and going into even more debt for college sounds like an incredibly stupid idea. Anyway, moving on. The next failure was that I've failed to get a girlfriend. I can think of three girls I came into contact with that I later found out were already taken. That really hurts as my sister has been married to my brother-in-law for close to five years and still no children, so it seems likely that I'll have to be the one to give my parents grandchildren. Just to be clear, I'm not one of those Incel dirtbags, I only mention that because many of the people I went to high school with have gotten married and are probably starting families of their own by now. It makes me feel like life has left me behind in the dust and there's no way I'll be able to catch up. Next, I still live with my parents so I saw a counselor in hopes of solving that problem. It didn't work. Most recently, I tried to obtain a minimum wage restaurant job at the end of last year (what I'd been trying to avoid by going to broadcasting school) because I've never worked a day in my life since I was foolishly holding out for a radio job. Also, it's a job anybody should be able to get, right? I applied, I scheduled a phone interview, the interview went well. Weeks went by and I never heard back. I only figured out recently that they didn't hire me. EPIC. FAIL.

It seems at this point that I'll never amount to anything and that I'll never be independent. I realize that that's probably a lie, but it seems to be the honest-to-god truth. I want to move out of my parents house someday, but that doesn't seem possible. I can't keep failing like this. It's almost like someone put a curse on me that after high school I would never progress further than that in life.

So, how can I stop this pattern of failure dead in it's tracks and start succeeding in life? I don't want to be a failure anymore.",13May2019,1
609,"I'm 27 years old now but during high school, I knew this girl in which I had tons of talks with. During after school, we would just talk and joke about different stuff. Each time that I saw her, she would give me hugs but it wasn't anything romantic, I just viewed her as a good friend. She came off as a real down to earth person.

Plus coming from a broken home, it felt good that I knew someone that was so kind.

She was 15 and I was 17.

Yet suddenly as I was walking down the hallway and saw her, I said her name then gave a wave. She then looked at me but it was weird, gave an odd stare, nod her head a little then kept walking.

I tried to ask if she was okay or anything was wrong but she just ignored me and kept walking to lunch. I didn't think much of it because I thought she was dealing with something personal and just needed to give her space. I could relate with that and could place myself in her shoes.

Yet she just stopped talking to me, I truly don't know why. After some weeks, I saw her talking to someone that I also knew and joined in the conversation. The person didn't know what club to join, so I told him to join whichever club that interested them and other stuff. I didn't look or speak to her but hoped she would just say a quick Hi, yet nothing, she only nod her head and kept staring at him. Yet I could feel that she wasn't comfortable with me there.

So I left and she leaves, which was the last time I've ever saw her. Yet it hurt me because it triggered things within my household where I was loved in one minute and hated/ignored the next. It caused me to not get that close to people because they might just leave.

So recently, facebook actually gave a friend recommendation to her and saw that she became a medical coder and in a relationship. I really hated facebook for this because it triggered those bad memories again. I haven't messaged her because 

1. I'm afraid of the results, in which she'll either block me or just ignore me
2. She's in a relationship, so it would feel wrong to do that as a man.
3. For some reason, she has messages saying ""cut off the negative things in your life and ignore it"", which made me feel that I was her negative thing.

623,"TLDR at bottom. So, I don‚Äôt own the phone number that used to be connected to my phone.  I‚Äôve deleted it from my settings and haven‚Äôt had it for a few months now but I‚Äôm still getting texts meant to go to another person. 

I usually just delete and ignore because it happens daily and it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúwrong number‚Äù it‚Äôs just still sending them to me for some reason. 

Anyways, today a man sent me photos of a woman‚Äôs breasts and her whole face is in them as well. He was forwarding them to the person I assume has my old phone number and said ‚Äúasked for an iTunes card lol‚Äù implying the woman sent them for an iTunes card. Now I don‚Äôt care why she sent them or even that she did, I‚Äôm ANGRY the man she sent them to is now spreading these photos. He also sent a photo of his face with the caption ‚Äúfor you or would you rather look at this‚Äù ? So I have this mans phone number and I know what he looks like. 

Is there anything I can/should do here? The phone number is from my home state, Maine, where I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs illegal to spread explicit photos with out consent. (I could be wrong but I‚Äôm going on the assumption this woman didn‚Äôt consent)

It hurts even more knowing that I have opportunities to play overseas but financially it just wouldn‚Äôt work or make sense.

625,"Here we go. TL;DR at the bottom.

I've known this girl for a year and a half or so, we met on social media through a mutual interest and ended up talking a lot. We got to know each other pretty well just texting each other every day (sometimes every couple of days) with a few breaks within this 1.5 year time of a few weeks at a time. 

Sometimes she would tell me about troubles she was having with guys and stuff, and I'd always do my best to help, but I never really thought anything of it other than the fact that she was living her life and it didn't directly affect me. I was never really jealous, though I've always found her pretty (and told her that at certain points) but I never considered the real life implications of this, as she lives almost 3000 miles from me. She was always super nice to me, and we talked alot, but it was always just through text and face time and stuff. I had never met her in person. I had suspected she might like me but I never knew if it was friendly banter or if she was actually interested but (like me) accepting of the fact that long distance relationships like this weren't practical.

Anyway, last spring she invited me to go travel out to see her at her prom, and I couldn't do it. This year I could, so I recently travelled out to where she lives. We went to prom together and had a great time. I stayed at her house and from what she told me, it was a great weekend. 

The thing is, I think I really like her now. And I don't know how to go about telling her, because for all I know, we went to prom as friends and now she's talking to another guy. I don't have a CLUE how I can go about articulating my interest in her, as although I do find her physically attractive, my latest revelation regarding my interest in her is not based on this physical attraction at all. I enjoy her company, her persona, just the vibe I get from being around her. 

I just have this feeling that while my feelings towards her increased, hers might have gone away. For all I know, she likes someone else right now.

What should I do? If you need more details, PM me, I'm sure I forgot stuff that might be important, I just can't think straight right now.

TL;DR: I met a girl awhile ago that lives across the country from me through social media, liked her and thought she liked me back. Ended up going to prom with her and really enjoyed the time with her, realized I REALLY like her, but not sure how (if?) I can go about telling her I really like her and want to see her again, as she and I are going to college within driving distance of each other (as opposed to flying distance, like we are now). Should I just let it be?

629,"Hi there! I am currently writing a novel on Wattpad. My teacher thinks I am talented, and she began to read the book herself. The problem here is that I wanted to include some romance in the book, but I don't want it to be awkward when my teacher reads it. A portion of my class is also reading it, and they would criticize me if there was anything too juicy written. Keep in mind that I am 12 years old, with a rather immature class.

She would like me to write a novel for next year's eighth grade novel study. She has suggested that I would write it over the summer, and in September my classmates will have to read it and do multiple assignments on it.

639,"Background Info: I (f19) currently live with my mom and stepdad along with my older brother and twin brother. I have also have a fianc√© who I have been with for 5 years and engaged for 6 months. Who lives with his parents. My fianc√© and I have a BDSM relationship and when I turned 18 I bought my first beginners kit as a birthday present for myself, and have bought around $500-$600 total between the two of us. My mom knows of this and is okay with it, my stepdad is a different story altogether.

The Actual Story: So the last time my fianc√© and I had the house to ourselves. About 2 weeks ago, we wanted to have some fun and took out our kit that we have in 2 cardboard boxes and one locked box under my nightstand but quickly noticed that A LOT of our items were gone. We were both too horny for it to take us fully out of the mood, so we put it in the back of our minds and made due.

Well today, we thought about it again and actually looked at all that was missing, everything that was actually sex related that wasn't in the locked box was gone, around $400-$500. At first we thought it was my twin because about a month ago he asked if he could borrow some of our items and we of course said no. So we confronted him and he denied it and even let both of us into his room to look around. It wasn't in there. We also tore apart my room and still couldn't find anything of ours.

Well, after some extensive searching in both my room and my twin's, my older brother starts asking what is going on. We explain what we lost and he offhandedly said that is PS4 controller and headset are missing and that his clothes that were once on a chair was on the floor. So we looked in his room for his missing items tore apart his room and couldn't find any of our missing items. My twin then realized the pattern and looked in his room and noticed some sex items were missing from his room. 

A thing to note about my parents, mainly my stepdad, which is the main reason we suspect them is because my parents are constantly saying that we have no money for food, that all of our bills are going up, having all three children pay rent. They are buying tattoos, high quality weed, leaf blowers, etc. So basically all four of us all thinking that my stepdad is taking the items he doesn't want in the house, selling them so he can afford his weed stash. In total between the four of us about $600 is missing. Majority of it being mine and my fianc√©'s stuff. 

We have no proof that he took anything. And my stepdad is very closed off from us. Only really close to my mom. And because they own the house we live in, if we are wrong then we are kind of fucked. Because they have been aggressive towards us when we have brought up complaints in the past. And nothing to this extreme. But I have already cried because of everything missing. I no longer can afford to buy those things back and some of those things that were custom made. Any advice for what to do what be appreciated.",13May2019,2

649,"(Long, sorry). This happened within the last two hours and there are reasons why I am concerned and why I am not. I would love any advice possible. 

My bf, his mom and I adopted a dog recently and he is about a year old. Black lab mix, absolutely amazing and we have all fallen in love with him. He has never showed any signs of real aggression towards any of us until today. 

Earlier today, he went to the vet and had to have anxiety medication to calm him down, because he gets very aggressive at the vet. He‚Äôs been before though, and when he came home he didn‚Äôt behave differently towards anyone (this was the first time he had the medication however). 

He was home for a few hours with my boyfriend before I got home, and there was no issue. I came home and I brought my friend inside so she could meet the dog, and he was excited to see her until he randomly started growling at her and his hair stood up. I knew I had to intervene to correct it and then afterwords he let me rub his belly. He still was being aggressive towards my friend so she left and I went downstairs to pet him again (after I corrected it). He let me, as if nothing was wrong, and then OUT OF NO WHERE started to become the same way towards me, and then tried to lunge at me. Thankfully my bf got in between. Our dog isn‚Äôt being aggressive towards him. 

Now, I‚Äôm not completely concerned because I know it might just be the side effects of the medication he is coming off of, but what if it‚Äôs not? I‚Äôve read online that it can be a neurological problem that would need to be addressed, but I don‚Äôt want to assume that when there is the medication involved. 

So now I am just waiting for the medicine to completely run through his system, and I‚Äôm hoping that this issue doesn‚Äôt continue. However I‚Äôm also now slightly afraid of him considering he did lunge. 

Oh last thing, he sees me sometimes if I walk by his crate and will wag his tail normally, but then will stop and start to growl. If anyone has had a similar situation and has any advice, please share! Anything helps.",13May2019,2

651,"I'm a 30 year old man and before recently I hadn't thought of my grade school bully in over a decade. Then, about two months ago, I started dreaming and remembering the mean things he used to do. It's only happened three times in total over the past couple of months, but it's always me just reliving a negative experience I went through involving him.

The first dream was of me reliving a traumatic event at an after school function in 5th grade. It was at a skating rink, they did a speed skate where you try to go as fast as possible and the kids who weren't skating would hold out their hands to give you high fives as you went past them, all in a line. It's supposed to be a cool and fun experience with your classmates. Well, I got halfway through the line of high fives when I felt someone latch on to my hand instead of high-fiving me. I got violently jerked to the ground going full speed, like hitting the end of a tether, it was traumatic and painful. Looking through my tears, I saw him laughing at me with his friends in a group. I skated off the rink and didn't confront him. That's what I relived in my dream.

The other two things were smaller, schoolyard things. Things like getting in my face and threatening to beat me up for making a joke, insinuating the brownies in my lunch box were made of shit and the other kids laughing at me at the lunch table, etc. 

It's not like everyday was a living hell or anything. When we were kids, he would never seek me out, but if we were near each other, he would do stuff to fuck with me. He'd only mess with me if he had a group of friends around him too, I think he must of been showing off for them or something. What's funny is, I probably could of kicked his ass as a kid. I was always taught that fighting was never worth it, always walk away if it's at all possible, tell an adult etc. In reality, the kid needed a good smack in the mouth, but I would never defend myself.

I understand that kids are just unempathetic little assholes, they lack the ability to see how their actions effect others. I have to admit though, as a grown man, I woke up from the first dream in a rage. I wanted to find him and beat his ass bloody. I was angry the rest of the day. The rational part of my brain knew that this was wrong of course, and that I was about 20 years too late to act on these feelings. The kid version of me would never have thought that way, as an adult, I very rarely allow people to treat me badly like that.

I ended up finding him on facebook. It seems like he's living a pretty happy life from what I can see. He married an attractive doctor, got his degree in biology, I'm not sure what he does for work though. I did notice he's pretty out of shape. Deep down it bothers me a little to see him successful, but at the same time it kind of gives me hope that he grew into a well adjusted adult, and hopefully isn't an asshole anymore. I'm doing pretty well myself, but this post isn't really about that, plus I don't want to compare our lives. 

I've been toying with the idea of contacting him of facebook and sending him a message. Just something along the lines of ""hey, I don't know if you remember me, but the things you did to me as a kid were pretty traumatic. That wasn't cool, and I've been reliving them in my dreams the last couple months. etc"". I don't know what the purpose of contacting him would be though. Only one of three things are likely to happen. One, he's still an asshole and sends an asshole reply. Two, is genuinely sorry and apologizes, however I don't think this will change anything about me now. Three (most likely), either denies it or ignores it. I just don't see a lot of good coming from it. The rational part of my brain says nothing good can come of it and I should focus on living in the present like I had been doing the past 10 years, while the emotional part of my brain says reach out and tell him what he did was wrong. 

Anyway, can I get some advice? Should I try to contact him? What should I do? I feel like these dreams aren't normal.

TL:DR - I've been dreaming of my grade school bully and reliving how he used to fuck with me. I'm thinking of contacting him and telling him what he did was traumatic and wrong. What are your thoughts?",13May2019,1

I so often see post from females offering to share pictures/nudes for payment on platforms like reddit or instagram. Just average girls with a cell phone taking pics and cashing in.

But a new problem arises as she had been elect to be one of the committee member in our associations ..as she will have to approach other men and work with them..just thinking about it is making me furious i questioned her and tried to get every information out of her about his association with them.And i dont really know how to proceeds with my feelings..and also i am 2 years senior than her and i will be leaving the place soon.I dont know why i am feeling this way, is it because i dont like her meeting new people or i have trust issues?

657,"She and I have been friends got three years. Most of our interactions have been via text because we go to colleges nearly a state away from each other and we sometimes are busy during the summer, though we see each other and hang out sometimes.

Here's the thing: she knows how I feel about her, well, just that I see her in a romantic light. In the beginning, I told her that I liked her and she rejected me, and later on, she told me that she is on the asexual spectrum and that she never has been interested in anyone, but that it wasn't me.

A year passed and we still talked, having fun, but even still, I realized I liked her in a romantic light and that if I entered a relationship with her, I would be okay never being able to have sex with her. I like her and respect her that much.

One day in January, I worked up the courage to ask her some hypotheticals. How she feels about a romantic relationship, who she'd like a relationship with, and if she could see us in one. I also did this is as a way where if she said no to the first or third, I'd get closure and just accept it.

But to my surprise, she told that she thinks she can see us dating despite her asexuality. She told me that she would like a romantic relationship (in general) some day. This made me very happy.

Now the semester ended and the summer is here, and at some point in the summer, we're gonna hang out again. I just finished having a quick text with her and she said that though she's gonna have classes during the summer, she believes we should have able to find time to chill.

It's just during that hangout, should I work up the courage to ask her out on a date, or should I just enjoy the relationship we have now and wait for her to come to me?",13May2019,1

663,"The best way to describe how I feel while before and during my period is like a pot of boiling water. With each passive aggressive comment, inconvenience or negative action, the water boils more. And depending on what the action is, it can go from zero to hundred really quickly and I‚Äôll be bawling my eyes out. 
A lot of people don‚Äôt understand this, and during my period I have to be really careful when interacting with people. And sometimes I will feel on the verge of tears and will ask people to give me a minute to calm down. 
Today‚Äôs example is I was at the DMV trying to get my car registered. I didn‚Äôt know you have to have car insurance so I go back out to the car with my boyfriend, and he puts me on his insurance policy while I try to pull money out of my savings account and into my checking. He sent me money on Facebook, I accepted it but the mobile banking app was having troubles and giving me a hard time and it was making me teary eyed and my boyfriend kept trying to talk to me and I didn‚Äôt respond because I was getting ready to cry and I was trying to calm myself down but he kept insisting that I was mad but I wasn‚Äôt. I was trying to keep from crying about something minor. It turned into a small fight and I was trying to emotionally control myself but it was really hard because I just couldn‚Äôt communicate since I was trying to prevent tears. 
There is a scenario similar to this nearly every period, and it‚Äôs during and before the whole period. 
Is this normal? I don‚Äôt think pms should be like this. How can I keep my emotions in check without upsetting anyone or myself?",13May2019,1
664,"So people of reddit here we are again but there‚Äôs no need for introductions let me tell you why I‚Äôm pisses so my 7th period teacher was being a total bitch today to me and my group of friends now it‚Äôs only three of us and I admit we can get a little loud from time to time but we‚Äôre relatively decent students so let me make you a list of all the things she did to us Today.


1.I asked her could I go pick up a piece of my project my teacher was helping me with that she told me I should pick up my the end of the day and she replied to me with ‚ÄúNo because this is U.S history and that has nothing to do with my class and if your teacher has a problem tell her to come and talk to me‚Äù but this made me and my friends very confused Because it‚Äôs the end of the year and testing was over with and no one was working on the final project she gave us because it‚Äôs due in a couple of weeks hell when I walked in she had a movie on the screen for us to watch  

2.Now one of my friends are very smart out the mouth and he said something to her after she finished telling at the student and she said ‚Äúwell of courses the kid who docent do his work says something‚Äùand he was offend but this understandably and he was like what are you talking about of course I do my work and he then turned to me and my other friend and said right and before me or my friend could respond she said don‚Äôt get them involved or I‚Äôll get them in trouble too which made us all raise an eyebrow because we me and the friend who wasn‚Äôt talking didn‚Äôt do anything so after that she sat down at her desk and my two friends got notifications on there phones telling them that they got zeros in the grade book and there grades went down which also pissed us the fuck off 

3. And the worst part of the class so at the end of the day the teacher makes sure we all of her students have there things ready not because she cares she only does this so she can walk out when we‚Äôre all dismissed and so my friend stands up because his book bag was thrown on the floor two desk away from him so he stands up fixes his pants and goes to get it and the teacher sees this and says hey don‚Äôt stand up even though she tells us to go get ready to leave and I say my friend was simply getting his bag and she then walks up to me and yells at me in front of the calls and there are people laughing at me and others with shocked faces and there‚Äôs this one guy sitting there and obnoxiously laughing at me and I‚Äôm sitting there hot to the touch and shaking in anger because she did this 

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pissed today any advise on what I should do because I was planning on skipping her class for the week but she checks everyone‚Äôs attendance to make sure we don‚Äôt and after todays I‚Äôll know she‚Äôll be looking for me or should I just ignore her and get my work done",13May2019,1
665,"Context: Our entire family has inheritable severe mental illnesses. Unfortunately, all of my parents children, including myself, got them. We all have major depression and varying levels of anxiety, and with my brother, myself, and now my sister, they have all surfaced during puberty. My brother is 22, I myself am 18, and my sister is 14. 

We've all learned how to cope with the hardships we've been dealt differently. My brother decided to bury how he felt and masked his pain through drugs as soon as he hit highschool. He was a huge stoner, all of a sudden he was a heroin addict.

 I wallowed, ate (a lot) and latched on to anybody that would give me the time of day, whatever they did, I did. Luckily, I realised how damaging that was and have been working hard to come into my own so to speak. My sister is completely consumed by her friends. If somebody likes her, she adopts their personality, much like how I was, and if some other 14 year old girl decides by whatever magical force moves them that they don't like her anymore, she is a complete mess for weeks. Her entire livelyhood lives and dies with her friends. She's also bullied by, to my understanding, a fair amount of people daily with no help from school administration. While we all know what it's like to struggle, she's been an incredible strain on my parents. She doesn't perform well in her classes, she yells and screams at them when challenged about school work, she has severe issues with self harm and almost every day, as soon as she has a problem, she calls my parents and begs to be picked up. They try as hard as they can not to give in, but they often do out of fear that she'll kill herself. 

I know a lot of this sounds like typical hormonal teenage stuff, but it has gotten so severe that my mom confides in me about how often she contemplates killing herself. She has moved schools, which she found didn't help her problem, which in turn sent her spiraling worse. Living around here every day and witnessing it all is so hard, all I want to do is leave, but I know that I'm the only thing my parents have to keep them stable right now. 

I just wish I could slap some sense into my sister. I wish I could force her to realize the bigger picture, but I can't despite best efforts. 

Is there anyone out there that has dealt with a situation like this one? Is there anything we can do to get her through school in one piece?",13May2019,1

677,"I posted this in r/rant, but I guess if anyone else has experienced this I could use any words of advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start. My grandma has always loved taking pictures, especially of the family.. Cute right? Great way to \*capture\* the moment. But, now it has transformed from a cute ""grandma's always taking pictures"" to ""goddammit that constant flash is blinding"". She has stopped asking us to pose, which means that candids are 90% of her pictures.

For a long time (before the popularity of the internet) these pictures would be developed and placed into photo albums or in boxes, which I found really cool because finding these pictures would actually be an exciting event of reminiscing old times. Unfortunately, with the age of social media, she posts all of these photos on Facebook and tags me in every single one of them (flattering or not). Luckily I'm tech-savvy enough to make it so that I have to approve photos to be posted on my profile, but they still remain on hers. She gets the ""Year in Review"" or whatever it's called that gives you a summary of all your postings from that specific day every year prior, so I'm constantly getting notifications of her retagging me in photos that she's reposting from years before. I'm not the most happy about my appearance so in general I'm not happy seeing images of my own face (camera-ready or not). The candids are what kill me. At least let me be ready for the photo! And if I refuse to take a photo she'll move the camera around my hand blocking it until she gets one and be angry that I didn't let her take a photo of me. I've told her many times about my issue with her posting my images on the internet without my consent - especially unflattering candids.

The most notable incident I can recall is at my sister's gravesite. We visit her every year for her birthday and generally just sit there thinking about her with a birthday cheesecake. This is the last place on Earth that I want my face being photographed, but there's grandma catching candids and ordering us to take pictures together by my dead sister's grave. This last time I flat out refused to take pictures there. She got angry and said that my sister would be disappointed with me. I responded that I didn't come there to take pictures, I came there to remember my sister.

For a long time my mother agreed with how inappropriate my grandma can be with her camera, but over the last few years she is slowing turning into her. My mother's forte? - videos.

So I'm graduating university this year and was invited to an honors convocation to celebrate our department's students with honors. As I walk up to my mother and grandma waiting for me in front of the building, I'm faced with greetings behind a digital camera and a smartphone documenting my arrival.

I understand their wanting to document and share specific moments with their friends and family, but these moments don't feel genuine anymore. I don't look forward to holidays or family gatherings as much anymore because I'm going to have to relive them every year through Facebook anyway. I'm sick of trying to be camera-ready every time we meet (which are mostly family gatherings), which I never feel because I have oily skin and they love using flash.

I had an argument with my mom about the idea of privacy on Facebook. My family tends to be pretty judgmental, so she was complaining that our cousin moved to Portland for a new job and posted it on Facebook ""leaving a cliffhanger"". Essentially he posted that he was moving out of LA to Portland for a new job (he's a vet tech) and he was really excited. She then started complaining that his mother didn't post anything of detail about it on Facebook either. I tried to explain to her that not everyone wants to post every little detail about their lives like they do, and she got really defensive and upset - given, she was 1 margarita in (lightweight maybe?). She somehow related this to the fact that she didn't know about her uncle's funeral years ago because she either didn't get a notification about the event on Facebook or she saw it too late to attend. She was quite incoherent at this point so I'm not really sure. I basically told her that Facebook is not a reliable source of information and really isn't responsible for what happened. Good communication (and the gathering of information) comes from genuine connections, like a phone call or even a message. She seems to think that she is entitled to all information however vaguely posted on Facebook, just because it's being ""shared"" with her. I told her that there are many reasons why someone may not want to give all available information to their ""Facebook friends"", like my former stalker, for example. She sent me an interesting text this morning about our conversations regarding this and she hasn't responded to my reiteration of this...",13May2019,1

My mother mentally abuses me, most things I do are dubbed as bad things because I don‚Äôt know any better. When she gets angry at me I take it out on my self, hitting my self in the head as hard as I can.

Where I live she doesn‚Äôt make meals and sleeps all day. I‚Äôve been surviving by eating ramen noodles. 

At school I don‚Äôt think I do poorly but when I come home with good grades the first thing she does it point out the one mistake and make some joke about it.

I am (20f) starting to envy my sister (18f) because she seems to be a lot better  I will ever be. I hate feeling this way and I don‚Äôt want to resent anybody. 
She will graduate in a few months and has accomplished more of what I did at her age. She is prettier, has a lot of friends, good grades and a wonderful boyfriend (I don‚Äôt have feelings for him). She is also going to study the same career as my father, which I predict  he is going to have a preference for her. The way I got this assumption will be explained later.

On the other hand, life has been a little rough for me. I lost confidence and  gained trust issues due to bad friendships. Since I graduated high school, I had no motivation to do what I loved and refuged myself in binge watching videos and Reddit. I also went to a small institute where I am currently studying a career that is not quite the one my father works, but is in the same field. Very few people attend it, and they are all about parties and shit I am not into.

Later on, I realized that my only friend was going to leave the country in two years and I will be alone. Watching my sister hang out with friends and having fun has made me resent her a little. She invites me most of the time and most of the time I go. I tried to befriend her friends, but we had little in common. I know she only invites me because my parents tell her to. 

Yesterday, my parents and my siblings were having dinner. I left a bit early because I had to check on something in the living room. I heard them talk and they couldn‚Äôt see me.  They started to talk about careers and what kind of person each of us will be after we graduate. Then the topic turned to me. My father started to talk about the chances I had at succeeding at my career and he basically said they were low. I froze. My siblings asked why but I couldn‚Äôt hear what he had to say. As I went back to my room I head them laughing.  

It broke my heart. I‚Äôve always respected my parents and their decisions. Now, I see my sister as their perfect daughter and I as the faulty one. My sister is good to everyone, has a great personality and creativity. I hate myself for feeling this way. 

I‚Äôve also thought about moving out a lot since then. I don‚Äôt think this environment is good for me. However I don‚Äôt see that happening very soon. 

TLDR: my sister seems to be good at everything  and my parents expect little from my career.",13May2019,1

I recently tried to start a buisness with him but it didnt go so well so now because of my stupid fault he has some debt.

And finally, everybody says that they're there for me, that i can rely on them but thats bs, its Just some made up phrases to say to someone who lost a loved one.

All of this combined caused some mental shitstorm that im going through atm and im sincerely veeeery deep into sadness and depression, my dad says that im one of his main problems in his life, im doing shit at school and suddently everybody forgot that im not supposed to be mr perfect boy anymore.

My parents are already upset with me because I turned down Harvard as an undergraduate after visiting because I couldn‚Äôt stand the smug self importance that the place radiated and they‚Äôre really pressuring me to go to law school, telling me that they‚Äôd support me if I had a better idea but I don‚Äôt, I have no idea what I want to do, what I know is that I want to do something that I take seriously, something that I think has value, my dad says that I‚Äôm being foolish and careers like that don‚Äôt really exist, at least not anymore because our society is structured around materialism and so the only thing that has value today is money. I fear he might be right and part of me is ready to give in but I don‚Äôt know if he is just pressuring me, since he is a lawyer and part of being a ‚Äúgood‚Äù lawyer is being manipulative. I do believe that he is right when it comes to how society is today but I think that‚Äôs wrong and I don‚Äôt want to be a part of that. I‚Äôve gone through some spiritual and religious changes since I started college and although I don‚Äôt believe that lawyers are inherently evil the American legal system and legal profession has inherent attributes that are against my beliefs. I haven‚Äôt had that discussion with my parents since they‚Äôre not really religious and they‚Äôll just probably argue with me.

686,"When I was 10 years old I was sexually, physically and verbally assaulted by my older brother. My parents, friends and the police have been made aware of the ‚Äòsituation‚Äô and I continued to live with my abuser for 6 years after. About two years ago he decided to move out and I had become much happy and healthier being given control on when (or if) I saw him. This Christmas my parents invited him up to the family cottage and I had to spend Christmas with my abuser. This past year he asked my parents to come by everyday to shower after work. My parents consulted me and asked how I felt. (But what am I going to do? I‚Äôm 18 living under THEIR roof). Anyways, I frequently see him and I feel helpless and like the only control I had of the situation has been taken away from me.

692,"Hello all, first time posting (so this is uite big for me, yay), since I don't usually need advice, I usually deal with things by myself. This time however, I found myself in a new situation. It is a long story, but I feel like the background is essencial for a good advice. English is also not my first language, but I presume I'll do fine.

I am a student (24M) and I've been dancing swing for a year and a half now. In this time I have gathered a small group of people interested in dancing. We usually meet one or twice a week for an evening of dancing and drinking. I really like the people in the group and they became some of my best friends over the last year.

One member of the group is an (29F) and I've always found her to be good looking, fun and really kind aswell. But for some reason I never made a move or anything; something about her was off for me, and I decided to just be friends with her.
I do feel as if she liked me for a certain period of our friendship, but I never really adressed it. Maybe i was also unsure of myself and didn't want to risk it.

Afterwards she danced less ofted and we havent seen much of eachother since november. Five of us (3 F and 2F) decided to attend a festival last weekend in an apartament together, lasting three days. We danced alot, talked and had a really fun weekend overall. 

The thing is, she felt different to me this time. She seems more mature (I know this is strange of me, but I am pretty adult, a bit too much I'd say - some tragedies in life made it so) and damn, I think she looks even more attractive and confident. She seems more stabile and was very supportive and interesting to talk to. I just guess I'm really atracted to that.

But our interactions were mostly friendly, so it's difficult to say how she feels abou me now (well maybe I'm just blind). To make matters ""worse"", we dance with each other all the time; the dancing is flirty more often than not, but then again - that's a normal part of it too!

So now I wonder, whether I should say something to her or not. Ofcourse, I don't want to change the group - and this would probably result in a changed group dynamic (but, maybe I should add - we are the only single ones in it, and kind of asked about this often - like, ""why/how are you single""). I also find it strange that my feelings for her changed. That being said, I do have a bit of a tough time, and feel lonely (haven't had a girlfriend in a while - or a really close person to talk to; that's why I'm writing here). 

From what I gathered, I am very specific when it comes to people that I allow near me. That is why getting a girlfriend has proven to be quite difficult for me, even tough I know a few women who are interested in me; I am simply not interested. So this is quite special for me, but at the same time, pretty scary.

Should I talk to her, or can it be I'm just confused and it's better to just hide and wait for my feelings to die in my cold heart? I feel like the answer should be obvious, but I need support on what and how to confront her.

So, Reddit, what is your advice?

So I plan on moving in with a friend from a past job, but he keeps getting denied due to his poor credit. He had an overdue medical bill at one point, that he just recently paid off. He has no rental history (still lives with his parents) so the only reason he is getting denied is because of the credit issue.

I just moved into a new apartment and on move in I checked out all the rooms and had a decently spacious hall closet right inside the front door. A couple weeks ago I let maintenance into my unit to replace window screens. Thinking nothing of it I went back the next day to check the closet for some reason and found the door was locked from the inside. I thought maybe maintenance had done it to store some tools or something in there but now its been several weeks and the door is still locked from the inside and doesnt seem to be from the handle. Unfortunately I mistakenly left my front door unlocked one day around that time frame too but I cant remember exactly which day it was.

Other strange things I‚Äôve noticed:
1. Theres an odd smell coming from the entryway to my apartment. I thought it was the trash among other things but I‚Äôve cleaned all that stuff and the smell persists.

2. This morning there was a small puddle of water in the middle of my floor in the living room. Now at first I thought it was a leak because it had rained and the apartments are new. But the puddle was thin and didnt really appear to come from anywhere after multiple inspections of the ceiling and floor. 

3. Small things have been moved here and there that I chalked up to me moving and forgetting them. I havent specifically noticed any food going missing but I seem to run out of food and have to grocery shop more than usual.

705,"About a month ago I got a call from my parents saying my sister had commited suicide. She had been struggling with mental health and over the past year or so developed severe schizophrenia. She got to the point where she believed there were cameras and microphones implanted in her and she believed she was pregnant but she wasnt. She had tried (unsuccessfully) in the past to kill herself by swallowing all her medication but because it was only antipsychotics she lived. 

She was found at her friends house where she had been staying. In her room they found multiple suicide notes written that same week detailing some of her shchizophrenic delusions and how she was going to kill herself, leaving details for funeral plans etc. With that information, it seemed clear that she had overdosed on something as she was found passed out on the floor having coughed up blood. 

I have spent the past couple weeks dealing with her death as a suicide, but today we got a call from the medical examiner saying her actual cause of death was Pneumonia. I just got off the phone and do not have any idea how to feel about this whatsoever.

709,"So my first year of college is coming to an end and I have a dilemma.

I moved into the dorms with two roommates and we all became very good friends. Both of them knew each other a few months prior to me meeting them, and we've become close over the past year. Now that the year is coming to an end, my two roommates want the three of us to rent a place together, but I have two serious reservations.

1) I am the third wheel. I don't like it one bit, but both of my roommates constantly do things without me, and often request that I stay behind while they do things without me. This makes me wonder why they want to get a place with me when they are openly better friends with each other- but they insist they still want to get a place with me.

2) They are unmotivated. I am uncomfortable with counting on either of them for rent, because they have not been motivated enough to go to class, get jobs, and while I love them as friends, this is a major concern.

I have quite a bit of social anxiety, and making new friends is typically hard for me. 


So I have to decide between the following two options.

1) Get a place with my friends, but remain the third wheel and risk living with unreliable people.

2) Move back into the dorms and take a chance with new people who I've never met, and have to start all over again socially- I won't have any friends returning to the dorms next year so I will literally have to start from scratch, but my living situation will be more stable.


Just looking for advice as to which of the two options I should choose, or if there is a better option I am failing to see. I should also say I haven't yet spoken to my roommates about this. Thank you!",13May2019,1

Apologies in advance for I am on mobile and the formatting is probably wrong 

I (F20) have recently cut my biological father (M50) out of my life. 
This comes after years of abuse, physical, mental and emotional, to both me and my mother. 
He never wanted me and refused to believe I was his for the first few years of my life. 
He scares me and makes me uncomfortable. 
I didn't speak to him much throughout my teen years and when I told him I was raped all he could say was 
""Well, with the way you dress what did you expect"" 

He was never there for me when I needed him and I have just had enough. 

He tried to come in and be friends with me as soon as I turned 18, when he didn't have to pay child support anymore.
But I wasn't having it, the only reason I allowed it to go on for this long was for my sister (F9) 

I cut contact, blocked him and his on/off girlfriend on everything. 

It's been a few days since this all happened and yesterday I just broke down  about it. 

After I sent the message I asked him not to contact me at all but the fact he didn't even try makes me think I never meant a thing to him which has made me feel like I truly was a mistake from his side of things. 

How do I get over this feeling? 
I have a dad (my mother's husband who took me on as his own when i was 10 and who I've come to love) 
How can I move on positively from this?

2. My landlords don‚Äôt allow pets and the lease is pretty strict. Their reasoning for not allowing pets is because previous tenants who‚Äôve been allergic have moved in and had issues from previous pet owners.

So obviously, can't form deep meaningful relationships with them because I can't talk about my relationship with my Fiance with them. 
I need adult friends but I feel outside the norm with my situation and I don't know what to do. My partner is older than me and has kids 11 &amp; 13. I'm having trouble adjusting to living with them and segueing into a different relationship with the kids as I take on more of a caregiver role as well. I have effectively isolated myself due to depression in the past years and only confide in my family and partner but I need someone else because there are things you can't always voice in your relationship or with family. 
Any insight and advice is helpful.",13May2019,2

736,"I dont know what to do

Met a friend of mine in year 9. We were science partners and quickly became friends. I enjoyed her company but didn't like her or anything. Eventually, a large GC was made for my class and we started talking regularly when we got each other's numbers. She was really kind and funny and had the best laugh but she would sometimes go to a dark place and would open up to me a lot about her troubles. I did my best to support her and regularly checked up on her whenever she seemed off because I cared about her. Year 10 arrives and we stopped talking over the summer because her dad was coming home after being away and him not being keen on boys. It really sucked and was the only thing I could think about over the whole summer. When I come back I see her and start to realize that I have feelings for her so we start talking again and she introduces me to her friends and we become really close after that.

After many months my feelings grew stronger and it came to a point where I couldn't even talk to her properly without getting shy. It really sucked and I held them in for a long time which led us to slowly drift apart. I was an idiot. It interfered with my studies and my grades dropped and I was really depressed for a long time because at that point my feelings were really strong. If she complained about her subjects I would print out revision worksheets for subjects she did and give them to her which she never asked me to do. I told her whatever she missed out in school whenever she wasn't in even if she never asked. I still would always check up on her to see if she was doing ok if she seemed off. Saved up money to buy her a necklace for her birthday and regularly send videos and memes just to make her smile. I didn't care that she never really responded with the same treatment because I genuinely just wanted the best for her and cared a lot about her. It came to a point we drifted a lot during year 11 and realized I had to tell her. I told her during the holidays but said I wasn't asking her out and just wanted the weight off my shoulders so I could focus on work. She said she also didn't want to ruin our friendship but we ended on a ''good luck'' from each other. I didn't know what it meant and was hoping we could still be friends. Obviously, I was going to give her personal space. When the October holidays finish I learn from a friend that she's gone around telling the whole school and that apparently I'm some weirdo. It destroyed me and ruined my confidence and self-esteem. I didn't hear a word from her after 6 months of utter shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after 6 months of not speaking my friend comes up to me and tells me that she told him that she misses me a lot and would like to be friends again. He told me that she was really sincere and thought I should talk to her. At that point, I forgave her despite her silence over the months and was over the moon when I heard this. The thing is I was just going by the ''forgive and forget'' and just wanted to talk to her again even though she broke me previously. I asked her during a lesson if we could speak and she said yes but I did it in the most awkward way possible by stammering and everything. We didn't talk to the next day So on her way to another lesson with her friend I asked her When we should talk to which she replied with a half-arsed shrug and walked straight into her class. Did kinda hurt but I guess I asked her the wrong time. I was told later by someone she was laughing with her friend a couple of seconds after she walked inside. We still didn't talk after that so last period on Friday I told her if she's comfortable with any time then we can talk since I'm always free throughout the day (at that point I thought I was mainly asking her while she was busy so I made sure she knew I could talk at any time). She said ok and Monday arrives. Still nothing from her. I didn't want to be the one to come up to her since she was technically the one who hurt me. I became desperate but thankfully my friends made me realize I was an idiot and slapped me multiple times for trying to talk to her because they all HATED her.

I was told that she wanted me to come up to her but I was advised by my friends that if she did care she would talk to me and put the effort to fix it herself. It sucked a lot but I just thought it would e better to wait. A week goes by and nothing happens. Monday arrives again and I find out that another guy likes her and is going to ask her out. I was annoyed but didn't mind because he was one of those guys who would literally flirt with every girl in the school and everyone knew that including her.

He comes up to me during my break and puts his arm around me and whispers

''Shes mine''

At this point, I'm just cringing so hard at this guy and just want to get away from him. (Just like some typical episode from Riverdale). He starts boasting and telling me he talks to her every day and that he's going to ask her what she thinks about me. I get annoyed because I used to be friends with this guy once so next class I try to warn her that he's going to probably ask her weird questions. I call her name while she's talking to someone and at first I think she can't hear me. I call her name again and she blatantly ignores me. Her friend points out that I'm trying to talk to her so she slowly turns around and gives me this awkward smile but a ''why are u talking me to'' kind of smile. I try to tell her but the bell rings and she scurries off to the next lesson. I was really confused and so asked her friend why she was acting weird and she told me to give her personal space. I was really annoyed and hurt but thought I should give her space. A week later I hear a rumor that apparently I am pissed at the guy previously because he was talking to her on top of that I still like her. I was so angry knowing he probably told people (also i found out while he texted her and insulted me constantly and made fun of me). I went to her and told her it wasn't true and walked off. Turns out she misunderstood what I meant and thought I was telling her to stop talking to the guy and she was super pissed at me. (btw did not say that at all).

I went home super stressed and then told her the next day what I really meant but she was ignoring me the whole time so I just told her friend. Fast forward couple of weeks I hear she's going prom with the guy and still she hasn't bothered to talk to me. I was being told by everyone that she was just using me as an ego booster and she didn't care because she didn't bother talking to me. I was really hurt and stayed quiet for a bit. Another week of silence and so i thought maybe I should drop the subject and try be friends first. I spend 3 hours thinking of a heartfelt paragraph to send to her to try amend things and or maybe end things on a good note . After 3 hours I finally send a heartfelt text with nostalgic jokes inside and I was really excited to finally send it to her.

She pops up quickly which startles me but then just replies with

''ok''

and goes.

Man that broke me. I never felt so hurt in my life and just stared at my phone in shock. I just silently cried and later went to bed and slept unable to feel anything.

 Fast forward a couple of weeks I just wanted answers and so I went to her straight and asked her her side. She tells me that I was wrong for being annoyed as her friends are trustworthy and she knows she didnt do anythhing wrong. I didnt even get to explain my side of things because she had to go into class. Before that I told her that I forgave her for telling everyone yet she kept telling me she didnt want my forgiveness and persists she did nothing wrong. She started ignoring me again because of she got pissed of of me telling her she was wrong and for some reason I still feel really sad about it.

I dont know why I still have feelings for her. Sometimes I remember old memories which were full of happiness and she was somebody who would always make me smile and I genuinely care so much about her.

I dont know what to do or why she is acting like this since she tells my friends she cares but has never shown it and just treats me as if she doesnt know me.

What do I do?",13May2019,1
738,"I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this and could really use some advice. The cat that lives a few houses down has recently started following me when I stop to pet her. I‚Äôve been doing this for some time now - she was taken in as a feral and has slowly been warming up to certain people over the years - but the following is recent. Any time I would be out for a walk I‚Äôd stop and pet her if I saw her. Nowadays, she‚Äôll come running if she sees me and I can easily sit on the curb and spent 20-30 minutes with her. 

A similar situation happened to me in the past, but there were a few key differences. First, this cat - who belonged to our neighbors across the street - wasn‚Äôt actually adopted, the neighbors took her off someone else‚Äôs hands. Second, her emotional and physical needs really weren‚Äôt being met, and when she moved into our front yard she never left (eventually we took her in and she became our cat, she apparently used to be an indoor cat so she loved it). Everything worked out well and I think she‚Äôll always be my favorite pet, even though she‚Äôs gone now. We really bonded. 

As for this other cat - she was actively adopted after her owners found her, although she does seem to be pretty lonely (always see her outside, but this might be because of her feral past and not because she isn‚Äôt allowed indoors - they do own a dog though and she‚Äôs afraid of it). These people adopted another feral cat recently under similar circumstances, so they must not be opposed to having pet cats. This cat also knows where I live (I can see their house from where I am and vice versa), and to my knowledge, she‚Äôs never actually followed me into my yard. Another good sign. 

I want this cat to be ok and happy. It breaks my heart when she follows, so much so that I avoid walking down that side of the street now. She‚Äôs so persistent - she‚Äôll chase after me and I have to move her back a few times and then fast walk away. My family tells me that I‚Äôm overreacting - that she isn‚Äôt being emotionally neglected and is perfectly happy living where she lives, she just likes being pet and doesn‚Äôt want it to end. I *really* hope this is the case. All I know is that this has been very hard for me to witness, and I‚Äôm trying to tell myself that I‚Äôm reading into things too much and shouldn‚Äôt feel so emotional about it all. 

Am I overreacting? I hope I am, but I also want honesty. I obviously can‚Äôt be stealing other people‚Äôs pets, but I wish there was a way I could know for sure that she‚Äôs being well taken care of, not just physically with food but emotionally as well.",13May2019,1

740,"In s bit of a pickle. I suppose a brief bit of backstory is warranted. I'm 22 years old, living in London, working part time in retail. I have been working at the same job for about 5 years, I don't hate the job, but I definitely don't like it. 

Every so often I do some job searching, attend some interviews but due to my lack of qualifications I feel like I can only go for more retail jobs so I often feel uninspired. I wish I could perhaps give education another try or maybe even an apprenticeship of sorts but both are not possible as my mother is out of work indefinitely due to illness and we have major arrears on the rent so I have to been earning money, hell more money than I'm currently earning (only a 20 hour contract) 

Here's my issue, I have absolutely no goals or aspirations. I know this is a very common issue but it hit me really hard the other day. Damn near had a panic attack in the shower thinking about it. All my friends have goals they are currently trying to achieve to further careers or progression in their current jobs, but I have nothing.

It's a dumb question I guess, but what do I do about this? What can I do? I don't have any passions, hobbies or skills that I could try and develop into a career. At the moment the only thing I'm good at is editing photos of Korean people and playing rocket league. I don't want to be stuck in Retail forever.

TLDR - I do not have enough qualifications, 0 passions or hobbies that can be profitable, 0 goals or aspirations. I can't afford to go back into education or apprenticeships. Not sure what to do.",13May2019,4

742,"- This part includes a bit much venting, so you can skip it - 

I don't have anyone to talk about my problems. No friends I can trust, no family and so on.

So what do I do? I come on reddit after just reading posts and never posting myself out of the fear that nobody would even care.

I have tried this a few times before and everything that happened is me getting rude comments that make fun of me, weird dm's and comments that read like: ""You're to young to know anything, go back to daycare."".

My fear of talking to people about my problems is hurting me so much and seeing that even at places detected to that, people are just mean or gross hurts me even more then the long post I fought with myself to even write down.

I see so many people getting help and feeling better on here which makes me Overthink even more.

I tried this multiple times now and it's always the same.

- Till here - 

Finding and trusting people in real life is way harder for me than typing something down so just getting friends won't be an option. Reddit is slowly getting worse and worse for me so this might be my last try on here.
I can't afford a therapist and I'm in constant beef with my family.

Does anyone can help me with this?
Where can I find someone to talk to? Advice or similar?
Why do I always get hate on my posts?

744,"Hi guys!
The thing is i was kind of dating this girl for a while now but all the time she seemed kind of distant and hard to get close to. Yesturday we had a talk and she told me that she‚Äôs still not over her ex after 3,5 months.
I am confused becouse everytime we went out we had a really good time, like we would really get along, laughed at each other and kissed every time. But she always seemed kind of distant when we were texting (like she didn‚Äôt answer me for hours, short texts...). In 3 months we went out only like 3 times becouse she often excused herself. I also lost my temper becouse of that and told her i won‚Äôt ask her out again becouse i feel annoying asking her out over and over again, and i told her that if she wants to hang out she should suggest to go out next. I wasn‚Äôt rude or anything, I just left her to choose. After that i made my closure and thought that was it (that was shortly after our second date) but after two weeks or so she said to me she is finally finished with school work and she wants to get out again. We went out and again had a great time, but the story repeated afterwards.
Yeastyrday i broke it to her and asked her why is she like that and she told me she is not over her ex yet and she is not prepared to get into new relationship for now. She also told me she has a great time with me too but she is not prepared to get into anything now. We didn‚Äôt had a fight, we just talked nicely through it. 
Is this just some excuse or is she telling the truth? Will she miss me? Will she contact me when she gets over her ex if that is the thing?
Pls help, I am really confused right now. I also really like this girl.
Thang you in advance guys!
