0,"Hey everyone! I’m in the school musical and I’ve just finished tonight’s show, feeling lots of nausea, bad taste in my mouth, strange stomach feelings/noises, I know I’ve got the sickness bug because my friends have it.

I’m a pretty big role. Tomorrow night is the biggest show night yet. I have classes for school tomorrow, and straight after I have the school musical. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I take the day off school, go at night and perform? Do I not participate at all?

Thanks :(",15Nov2019,1

3,"My sister, who is in elementary public school K-5, has an extremely toxic ""friend"".  Basically, there's this kid who's friends with my sis and stop other kids from playing with her. For example, during gym, if my sis is playing with said kid and another kid comes over, said kid will push the other kid away from my sis violently. Like the other kid falls and is out of whatever thing they were doing.  Whenever my sis tries to play with other kids, this toxic kid starts yelling at everyone she tries to play with if it isn't her.

Any advice on how to deal with this? Other than moving classes. We already talked to the teacher about this but there is only so many things teachers can control with having to teach many students.",15Nov2019,1

7,"Hi everyone, tomorrow I am going to spend a couple hours with my girlfriend and I wanted to surprise with a cute little sweet date. It would probably be best if it was outside, however, there’s nothing in our small town to do. There arent any nice views, the parks are usually packed and since its the winter its cold and terribly humid, there arent arcades or entertaining types of places like you find in a generic city or town in america per example, there aren’t ice skating rings, the mall has too many people, food and eating isn’t an option so no picnics or going to cafes, the movies we already do too much of (plus not enough time for it), there isnt time to go somewhere and we both know every nook that exists around here. I don’t have any ideas at all, and I dont think any of us wants to stay inside. I would like to do something different and fun and spontaneous for her, I just don’t know what. Unfortunately i’m also in a time crunch here and dont have much time to do anything.

I dont know if it’s relevant, but we’re both 16 which means that in our country we’re not legally allowed to do pretty much anything (and that sexy times wouldn’t be appropriate. Neither of us wants that anyway).

Thank you in advance for any ideas and help.

8,"In High School, I think that the best day of my life was realizing that I could survive on my own and to learn to value myself more instead of depending too much on other people. Anyway, some of the people seemed to dislike this, they could not understand why I wanted to leave a friendship where the only things that I was doing was doing their homeworks, paying them food or giving them presents while they left me out of many things and outright cut me while I was talking a lot of times.

The same thing is happening in College, I prefer spending more time with people that value me as a person instead of deriding me. 

These people think that the things that they are doing such as shunning me, treating my opinion as trash, talking to me only for service, they think that all of these things are normal. 

Are they faking being sad so they can manipulate me, or are human beings really that illogic ?",15Nov2019,2

This kid named Alex used to think he was the shit in 6th grade. I'm in 7th grade now and on the way home I sadly started encountering him. We go to different middle schools. Yesterday my dumbass said to my good friend Gustavo from last year that goes to the same school as Alex ""why are y u hanging out with him that's kinda sad man"" and it really was. Alex is a shitty person. Then Alex said ""shut the f*ck up before I beat you up with this bat"" and kept walking. Today he was waiting at the park me and by 2 friends  walk across everyday. He started walking toward us with his friend Alex and some teenagers. Yes teenagers. As we were crossing the street. An old man saved us as we dipped up the hill. We have an alternative route we can walk if we feel the need. I brought a knife today because that shit yesterday was sketch as hell one of my friends is going to bring axe body spray and a lighter.

12,"Sorry the long paragraph.

I’ve (17M) been talking and hanging out with this girl(17) since the beginning on senior year. We hangout almost everyday and talk everyday several times a day. We do everything that a couple does besides the sexual stuff. We go out to lunch/dinner, we watch Netflix together, she’ll curl up against me and just let me give her a head rub when we’re parked in my car, she goes out of her way to talk and hang out with me. On the way out of school she’ll sometimes put her arm around mine or hold my hand. She’ll go and playfully suck frosting/ cool whip off my fingers. As well as try to “a lady and the tramp spaghetti scene” with random food like cookies and pizza crust. We’re also planning on going to the same college together as well. A friend told me that when he sees us together, that we actually look good together and that she looks really into me. The problem is that she’s “dating” a guy she met once when she was at a convention in Florida over the summer, while we live in Florida. All they do is video chat every once in a while and only the guy has anything about her in his bio on Instagram. Is there anything I can do about this?",15Nov2019,1

16,"So, to put this as simple as possible, I have a gap between my two front teeth and my right front tooth is chipped. My teeth have been like this for about 9 years (I'm 16 now so since I was 7) and I've always felt self conscious about it and it has drained my confidence completely throughout these years. My parents cant afford braces and so I feel it is completely up to me to save up for them. I cant talk to women well because I'm a tall guy (6'1) and most women I talk to are short and can see my teeth easily. This has prevented me from making any real relationships with girls in school and it just has completely brought me down in all aspects of my life. Now, as I said earlier, my parents cant afford braces so for the time being, I am 100% stuck with my terrible teeth. I just need advice from a fellow redditor who has gone through a similar situation and whether i should really be worried about this or not, or if I should just say fuck it and start talking to women and smiling like I dont give a fuck about what anyone thinks.

18,"It all started when a close friend from my [18M] class invited me to join a session of Star Wars roleplay, DnD-style with his friends (not sure exactly what it’s called). I went and met these awesome and cool guys around my age and we had a blast. I meet our DM who is a very charming and sweet, genuine guy and everyone likes him a lot. Anyway, I went back many times to play with them and after a while I felt like we had become good friends. 

Recently however, I started noticing changes in our DM’s behaviour and he looked sad and distant a lot of the times we interacted. It didn’t make much sense and I didn’t think much of it until a couple of days ago when his school sent out a message to all students that he had suddenly passed away due to an ’incident’. They didn’t say how or why or give any sort of information about the situation. This however, turned out to be a miscommunication error and he was still alive but heavily anaesthetized. Still no other information but at least me and my friends were a little more optimistic. That didn’t last very long however, as he sadly passed away today on the 14th. My friend had talked to a relative of his and told us that my friend had apparantly hung himself.

I feel like garbage right now, and I know it’s not because of me he died, but I can’t shake the fact that I unconsciously suspected he was in a very bad place and didn’t talk to him or try to help him by being there for him. It’s even harder to think about when things like the new Star Wars game is getting released tomorrow, or the last Star Wars movie reminds me of the things that he loved which he’s going to miss out on.

This year I want to get my boyfriend a UFC subscription for christmas but I know nothing about this and do not know if I need to get the fight pass or something like a BT sports/Sky Sports year subscription? As he also is very into football and I have overheard him and his friends talk about which station has the rights to a fight or match etc... I am lost and need sports watching advice! 

Every UFC night he looks for links and streams and it can get frustrating and the quality is always poor so would like for him to have a decent service so what would your advice be? UFC fight pass or sports subscription? 

I was also thinking that if I got a chrome cast then he would have it on his phone (fight pass or sports sub) and could use it for any TV then too?! I am not sure how they work either? I think chrome cast works with iPhone now too.

23,"Male, 6’2”, 215lbs, Caucasian 

Long story short I took 90 Xanax pills in 3 weeks. I cut cold turkey cause I ran out of my prescription. I was taking 5-6 pills a day. I had bad withdrawals and many symptoms the first 2 weeks. Only 2 weeks into my withdrawals I binge drank heavily 2 days in a row at my best friends wedding. The next day I woke up with my initial symptoms back like insomnia, night sweats, shaking, bad rebound anxiety, constant high heart palpitations, depression, poor concentration, and blurred vision.

It’s been 3 weeks and 3 days since the wedding and I still have symptoms. I feel very out of it and have like tunnel vision. Also I have bad anxiety still that comes in waves and also have constant light shaking, tremors, and muscle twitches that won’t go away. 

My calves just started twitching 2 days ago for no reason. I’m freaking out it’s a neurological disease than withdrawals. My calves will not stop twitching and it’s constant.

27,"I've known one person (17f) since we were high school freshmen, and she has an 11 year old brother (soon to be 12) and they live with her biological father (46m) and step-mother (39f). They had her half(maybe step)brother, who i believe to be the youngest. The youngest is treated like a flawless angel, being the only biological child of the stepmom.

I'll refer to the two victims as 17f and 11m

17f is the result of immense psychological torment. Her parents keep her stuck in the house with no bedroom door, no phone, she SOMETIMES is allowed to make monitored landline calls to her Bio-Mom, and they force her to tutor the ""angel"", who bullies her with no consequence, since, if she were to rebut, the parents would crack down on her even worse. I don't have contact with 11m, but he has been physically abused, and forced to lie and tell people that he tripped, or had any other type of accident.

46m is a government employee, and 39f is a teacher. They are both skilled liars and incredibly charming. They have lied their way through custody court, and multiple CPS investigations.

30,"I am a recent graduate from Lincoln Tech for HVAC/R. I am currently working for a poorly run company who only has 3 workers; The guys that removes oil tanks (Dale), the guy who does service and installations (Nick), and me. I work with Nick, the guy who does the service and installations. While he is a good man, he's not a great worker, consistently lies to the boss, does not keep track of the time, but knows the trade very well and is willing to teach me this trade. The man is strange with a temper that is unpredictable. 

Today, we went to a job that I was told needed to be finished, which we went to and finished. Afterwards we went to his home to clean up a mess that Dale made. After he spoke to his GF for a while, we drove an hour south to finish the wiring of a thermostat and condenser. Although I was responsible to keep track of the time, I failed to do so. I asked Dale what time we may have arrived so I could message my boss about the hours spent, he said to tell the boss 11AM to 1:30PM. I did just that. We were told to go south for another hour and a half to install a new condenser for an apartment. 

We work from 8PM to 4PM and are paid by the day, not by the hour and there is no payment for overtime. By the time we would have arrived at the jobsite, it would have been 3:20 and anyone that knows about installing new AC units would know it would take much more than 40 minutes to do the job entirely. So, we decided to head home and head to the job site asap after arriving at the ""Office"" in the morning.

My boss just called me about half an hour ago trying to figure out what happened and why we did not arrive at the installation site. I told her that because it was more than an hour away and that by the time we got there we would not have enough time to install the unit, so we decided to head home and do it in the morning. I did not tell her about going to Nick's home and fixing his heating unit.

This is my dilemma, should I tell the one that's paying me the truth or should I keep my secrets with the one person who's willing to teach me a trade? Either way, I can really screw myself over by sticking to one side. 

I tell the truth to my boss and I'll keep getting payed, but I will most likely lose the one person who's willing to teach me. Whether the man gets fired, or gets so pissed that he refuses to work with me will screw me over in the long run, I will still get payed.

I keep the secrets from the boss, I can lose my job, which I need to pay for my car insurance, student loans, taxes, and personal entertainment and hobbies. By keeping these secrets though, I can continue working with Nick while he continues teaching me the trade, which is the whole reason why I chose to do HVAC/R.

So please, tell me what I should do. Tell the truth and possibly lose the only one willing to teach me, or keep the secrets and possibly lose my job?",15Nov2019,1

34,"It’s quite a long read, hope you guys will find the time to read. Tldr at the end.

Last night, my boyfriend had a really long day at work and I met up with him after. I was tired too, and I don’t know why I most often sulk to my boyfriend. He’s amazing and has always been good to me, always understands me and I know he really loves me. We’re together for almost a year now and I’m really thankful he’s putting up with my childish behavior lately. 

I must admit I have been clingy and childish and jealous. I get upset when we end up not seeing each other, I cried in front of his friends when I got upset at him for something so petty and he got annoyed that his friends told him how to manage his relationship. When that happened, we got through that. He’s been really understanding that this is my first relationship and I’m learning. 

The past few weeks have been so stressful for him - work, postgrad, family, and I’m doing my best to support him by being there for him when he needs me even just over the phone and this went on for 2 weeks. We finally saw each other last Sunday and we had a really great time. We also spent Monday night together. Then yesterday, at a friend’s, I was so tired from work and he is too, and I kinda picked up he’s probably upset at me by the way he talks. We had a quiet but heated argument in front of our 2 friends, and he got upset at me. He told me when we got home that he doesn’t like that. We made up and we’re all good. He’s also supposed to move in with me this coming weekend.

Then, going back to tonight’s situation, I was trying to make the conversation light as he had a really long stressful day at work. But I don’t know why I started kinda acting passive aggressive again, I tried to get it out of my system, and he asked me and I explained i understand you’re tired but I just feel like not being cared for when he sounds so stern. He told me sorry I’m just still in business mode, I had a really long week at work. 

Then, when we got in a cab, we were still okay, then he told me his dad is taking him to the pub Friday night. We’re normally spending Friday nights and the weekend together, so I just said, “oh sounds cool, though I’m not seeing you then. It’s fine, I’ll see you whenever.” Then he got quiet and I asked him if everything’s okay, and he just snapped and said the following, nonverbatim:
No. You make it seem like everything is a problem. Everything is good but you always find a way to be upset. What did I ever do to you? Your childish behavior needs to stop. You can’t always throw a tantrum for nothing. I’m getting tired of tolerating this behavior. The other night, you did it again with our friends. I hate it when my friends tell me how to run my relationship. You’re causing unnecessary drama. You know how rough it was for me lately with everything that’s going on, the last thing I want to do is babysit you. I’m not a babysitter, I need someone to support me. You have to cut it asap. The other night at our friend’s house when that happened,  I had second thoughts about rushing in to move in with you. I’m glad I haven’t moved in with you yet.

I was really shocked as this is the first time it happened. He was right. I needed to fix my attitude. I told him I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean to piss him off, I’m doing my best to change. And I’m thankful for him for being understanding but I understand he has limits too. And I told him I’m learning as we go along. 

He told me he really loves me and wants us to work out so he’s giving me a chance to change. He told me he thinks I need to go out more with the girl friends in our group, as it seems that I’m depending too much on him and I get really upset when he won’t be able to see me. To be honest, I don’t have much friends here as I just moved to a new place. 

He also told me that he already said his part, let’s forget about it now and move forward.  We went back to his place and we had a nice night still. My boyfriend always tells me that I’m the love and light of his life, it’s different with me, he can see a future for us, that I’m so good to him, he’s so blessed to have me. I think I’m a good girlfriend to him except this annoying side of me. I really want to change.

I really love my boyfriend and I know he really loves me too. After having this conversation, I kinda felt some anxiety that he might break up with me anytime soon. I left his house this morning for work without waking him up fully like I usually do, I just whispered in his ear I love you and he said I love you back. 

I need your advice, thoughts, and support. 
1. do I message him or just wait for him to reach out to me?
2. Is this a really big fight? 
3. Is this a big deal he might break up with me now?
4. I’m afraid if I don’t initiate seeing each other, he might end up not initiating anymore. Though I don’t think he’ll do that

35,"I don’t know where to go from here.

Hi. This is a throwaway account.

My husband of over a decade recently had an emotional affair. He lied to me for over a year about multiple things but also throughout the duration of our marriage together. 

I’m still young. We got married fresh out of hs, and had kids right away. Due to a lot of unfortunate circumstances, we never had family support. This led me to have to stay home to watch the kids while husband worked.

Many years of one car, husband working swing, and no family or “village”, I am extremely depressed. Majority of my says are spent in the house, unable to leave and no one to talk to. Not my mom, my dad, my grandma passed away etc. 
my world revolved around him.

I have anxiety. I’m obviously depressed. 
Well after finding out about his infidelity, I feel myself falling more and more into despair. I don’t see the point in anything anymore. Things that I previously enjoyed, I don’t. I don’t want to do absolutely anything at all. In fact, I’ve daydreamed about running away almost every single day and I finally understand why people want to commit suicide, although that’s not what I want to do.

In fact, I don’t know what to do. At all. I feel stuck. Suffocated. I feel like I cannot move one way or another. 

Money is tight. If I work a part time job, I will have to pay for childcare which would negate anything I would make from my job. 

I just simply do not know what to do. I just want to lay in bed and sleep all day or stare at the ceiling. How do I get around this? How do I get past this? What do I do?

36,"hi all! f19(almost 20) here, hope you’re having a good day so far. so, i guess i’m sort of looking for advice/if anyone else feels the same way, i’m not too sure this is the right subreddit to come to, but i already posted this onto an anxiety subreddit and need all the advice/experiences i can get!!

so i got my driver’s license at 18 and right away i loved driving. i loved the freedom of it, the fact i didn’t have to depend on anyone, and it was relaxing for me in a way, up until maybe around four months ago. i don’t really know what happened, but i started getting anxiety driving on the highways. (used to commute 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes back every day) i started getting intrusive thoughts like “what if i accidentally drove off of this?!” and just general stuff like that, but was able to brush it off. 
fast forward and now i absolutely cannot drive on highways at all. i moved to a new city, with some of the tallest highways i’ve ever seen, i think this might contribute some. 

i avoid the highways/even access roads as much as i can now because i get like, full on body tremors, incredibly lightheaded/dizzy to the point where i get fuzzy black and white dots/tunnel vision. but i don’t actually get ANXIOUS, i just get this weird physical symptom that leaves me feeling like i’m going to pass out. 

is this just a panic attack or...? i don’t know what’s going on. if anyone has any advice or anything at all to add PLEASE do. thank you in advance!

tldr; uncontrollable shaking/tunnel vision/ dizziness only when driving on highways, access roads &amp; accentuated when i don’t have an easily accessible place to pull over to",15Nov2019,1

40,"So this is a bit of a tale, but hopefully you all can help me get my head on straight about how to proceed here. Thanks in advance to anyone who chooses to respond because I'm feeling in the woods on this one. Obviously this is a throwaway in case anyone involved recognizes this story.

About a year ago I hit management at the restaurant I work at. I was originally in one location but transferred to another. Initially I thought the location would be a better fit as the management team seemed more solid, but I and other staff have been running into several issues with our head honcho. The boss here had previously had issues with management turning on her for being largely absent in the location, but I and others who switched stores were led to believe this was unreasonable on their part.

In working here for the last six months I have noticed that she leaves early most days, but she's got a family and some health issues so I didn't think much of it to begin with. Another manager came with me when I transferred and he took issue with this, and made it apparent to her. The two of them disagreed a few times and then one day she fired him for ""dividing the staff"" by speaking bad of other management (her). There have been other terminations for similar reasons, leading us all to know that disagreeing with the GM means losing your job. So I have been keeping my mouth shut and letting her do her thing.

This was fine for awhile until she injured her back. She does not want to take a pay cut and will not inform corporate that her doctors have forbid her from working because she will further hurt herself. Now she spends maybe 25-30hrs out of what should be a 50hr week in the store. She repeatedly leaves us without support for the dinner shift, and when she is here she is severely medicated on pain killers. A lot of the time she spends in store she spends chatting about her personal life, smoking, or hanging out with her family - for whom she provides free food and beer on the regular. Since this development she has had next to zero administrative presence, and when things go wrong she throws us (the other managers) under the bus to corporate rather than assuming any of the blame. One example was weeks ago, when she handed out checks a day earlier than we are allowed and when corporate caught on she blamed it on our service manager. He ate it because of the fear that going against her will result in job loss.

The last time I remember her working a full day she told me she took 8 prescription morphine pills to get out of bed in the morning, and continued to medicate through her shift.

All of this is pretty damning, but she is supposedly in good with the district manager and I have worried that going above her head will mean I lose my income. I have been keeping a log of her comings and goings in case she turns on me next, but otherwise have not made any moves because I need to be able to provide for myself just like anyone else and she has a long track record of winning these disputes.

This is how the last few months have gone. Two weeks ago I had to terminate an employee for sexual harassment against one of our service staff. When I told GM she agreed the offender had a history of being a creep, and told me she saw him pin another female worker to the wall out back at my old location in the past. I filed his paperwork, she termed him; all proper business. But now she is on a crusade because she believes the harassed employee was 'asking for it' by being flirtatious. This is a restaurant, and we all get a little raunchy with our chithcat at times. That's no excuse for a grown man to forcibly put his hands on a woman, and I would like to think my female boss would be one of the first to understand that. But now she is having an all staff meeting about harassment that boils down to this: If you are playful with someone and then they make advances on you, you shouldn't blow the whistle because you were asking for it.

Obviously she's not putting it in these words, but that is exactly what is going on. I suffered abuse like this as a child, and I watched my mother suffer the same. Morally I am outraged and I plan to quit my position, am currently job hunting. With the fear of being canned removed I feel I'm obligated to do something about this toxic woman, but I don't know how to approach our corporate bosses about the subject and I don't know if it's worth the fight. If I change jobs I will probably take a paycut, so this is fucking with my livelihood in a way, but I have plenty of experience to get hired elsewhere and get out of this drama-fest.

&amp;#x200B;

So Reddit, what advice do you have for me here? I guess I should say my piece to corporate and roll with the punches since I'm prepared to leave already, but how do I go about addressing them? Do I talk to HR? What other evidence should I collect? I own a tape recorder but have not put it to use, unfortunately.",15Nov2019,1

51,"My sister has four kids, but the biggest example of the lagging development is with her 10-year-old daughter. To be totally honest, the girl smells. My sister has admitted it and chalked it up to “she has really thick hair and doesn’t like to thoroughly wash it” and “she really fights me on brushing her teeth,” but the girl spends almost all of her time in pajamas with stringy/greasy hair and smells faintly (sometimes strongly) of BO. She’s also got some fairly strange tendencies that I’m not certain are developmentally appropriate for someone who’s 10. She does things like speak excessively in a baby voice, throw all-out tantrums, crawl around on the floor, work herself into hysterical/shouting laughter every few minutes, that kind of thing. My sister has admitted that “a little bit of peer pressure might actually be a good thing in her case” (like, getting made fun of once or twice at school might have nipped all this in the bud) but is totally against non-homeschooling. The girl has no friends her own age, and though she does a few extracurricular activities, they tend to be solo (like piano lessons).

Are these things within the realm of normal for a homeschooled kid? If not, is there anything I can do to help my niece adjust to the real world?

52,"I [F19] wanted to fake being sick and call off of work to hang out with my boyfriend for his birthday. The thing is... I have never called off work myself. At my previous job I would have my boyfriend to pose as a family member and say I will not be coming in because of sickness. So I hoped it would be as easy to call off. I have my boyfriend call my job, a daycare, and my manager was not there yet so he was talking to a coworker. The coworker said that I need to call myself whenever my manager gets in an hour later. I assume that my coworker will still tell my manager and I will not be calling again. An hour later I get a call. I don’t answer. I get a voicemail from my manager and she says that “One of the girls said your boyfriend called saying you won’t be coming in today. Give me a call to confirm this.”
I was mortified that she thought my boyfriend had called instead of my brother. I personally think it would be weird if my boyfriend called since I do not live with him so that’s why I had him pose as my brother. 
I have a very habit of over thinking which leads to me panicking. 
I’m playing different scenes in my head thinking of a comfortable way to show up tomorrow because I know they will confront my about this situation. The only way that makes me comfortable is that I just never show up again. The next day comes and they call my dad to ask where I was. I know how disappointed my dad will be if he knew I quit without a notice so I lied and said I was at the library to study for a test that my manager must have forgotten I told her about. Since they have called my dad I assume they won’t stop calling. I have my close friend pose as me and call the daycare and quickly quit my job and hang up. 

I think to myself “I just really quit my job because I was too nervous to call off sick” 
“I really just quit my job because I felt too embarrassed to show up”
I talked to my boyfriend after this had happened saying that I believe that what I did was not normal and that I need advice on what to do. He said that I need to get help but the thought of “getting help” terrifies me. He also said that I will need to talk to my parents about getting help and that also terrifies me. Every time he mentions it to me I start to bawl my eyes out. I do not want to self diagnose myself. I don’t like to admit that there’s something wrong with me, but the things I have done are very questionable.

The other day i was checking my dads emails for something unrelated to an affair which was when i saw a chat between him and another woman, i went through the messages (which i shouldn't have and wished i hadn't) and he messages where all intimate messages along with nude photographs been exchange between the two, there was also evidence of hi, sending money and buying items for this woman. I later decided to scroll up in the group chat all the way up to the date that my mum first found out about an affair (the first story i told above), he told her that he couldn't do this anymore and stopped messaging her for a whole **TWO** days, the prick couldn't withstand from his horny urges for two days, my mum had sacrificed almost 3 decades of marriage to a man who isn't loyal to anyone but himself. I guess what i'm trying to ask here is what do i do, i'm torn between what and what not to do, tell mum and she becomes heart broken, like she was the first time and i cannot see her go through that again, not tell her and she will end up having to live a life with a man who has feelings towards some other woman.

57,"After moving in with my best friend (Art), they fell in love with my cat and considered him to be theirs just as much as he was mine. We had to put him down 2 months ago yesterday due to the size of his heart, and complications from a steroid shot he got to treat his flea allergy. We just got rid of all the fleas, and they were in our house for nearly 6 months. Art is allergic to fleas and had huge pus filled bites all over their ankles during the time we had them.


About 3-4 days ago Art sent me the profile of a cat they found on Petfinder. I was unaware that they were looking for a new cat until then. I tried talking to them about not being ready for another pet yet as I was unsure of whether there were any remaining fleas, and I cannot afford to take care of anyone but myself right now. They said they would pay for everything until I could help but he would be my cat too.



The thing is, the reason he would be my cat too is because I have to take care of him. Art has asthma and cannot clean out a litter box or groom a cat. Then last night we went and picked the cat up. They never asked me if I was comfortable with or emotionally ready to care for a cat yet. They were completely inconsiderate of my thoughts and feelings on the matter and I'm quite upset about it. Especially because I had to put over $100 on a credit card at the vet today to treat (yeppers) the fleas that the cat has and get him up to date on vaccines. I do not want to deal with having fleas again. I am not yet ready to take care of another pet. 


Then today they fucked off and went to hang out with their ex. They had an unhealthy relationship and last I knew, Art did not plan on seeing this person again. So instead of staying home and trying to introduce the new pet (*they* decided to get) to the cat we already have in the house, they went and hung out with someone they claimed to not want to be around. It has been over 4 hours now and when they get home they will go straight to bed. They will have spent maybe 5 minutes with the new cat total all day. 


I am both upset and concerned. Art recently started new medication and I'm worried it along with the greif of losing our last cat may be affecting their judgment. I do not know how to address the issue, and/ or ask if they are okay without being a complete dick as I am not very good at confrontation. We both have BPD by the way, so that's just another communication barrier that I have to keep in mind when bringing any issues up. Any advice on how to deal with this?

I got a car last year and he offered to get my permit but I never got my permit and now he’s selling my car to get him and mum a new one.

64,"So I'm a 21 year old looking to drop out of my final year of the healthcare program I applied to 2 years ago. I'm basically supposed to be done in about 6 months as I'm doing clinical placement now. However I am now realizing how stressful this job environment would be, and I keep on making mistakes and not improving adequately as to the standards of the program. Also pretty stupid of me to realize that I cannot handle the mental stress of actually dealing with someone's life on my final year :/ One of the clinical instructors has even flat out told me how they think my personality is just not a fit for this job. I worked hard throughout the past two years to study, but because of my shy personality and anxiousness, I just kept flunking the past few weeks. 

I'm deciding to quit now even though it sucks and I feel like I've disappointed everyone around me. Most people tell me to just finish the last 6 months, but truth be told I just feel so miserable and so stressed and anxious that I honestly just cannot continue for the sake of my sanity. Many people have expressed how it's such a waste if I can't even just finish it knowing that I worked extremely hard the past two years, but at the same time that's also where I'm finding the strength to quit: I know I've worked hard, that I've given it my all, but I think this is where I draw the line. 

And I am also not sure if my program faculty would even deem it fit for me to continue on with the program as the expectations just get higher with each passing month until graduation.

My family has been very supportive (which I'm so lucky for) and I am trying to get into counselling ASAP too to help with my anxiety (which has reached new heights lol). However, I don't exactly know what to do after I quit my program. 

As a kid, I was one of those people who did quite well in school, and thus when I graduated I was pretty great on most subjects (I'm not saying this to brag). But because of that I developed very high expectations of myself and did not really find a certain ""passion"" or interest as I've built my self esteem solely around the idea of getting good marks for everything. I only pursued healthcare because my mom works in healthcare, and because most people told me it'd land me a steady and guaranteed job . So now I'm not too sure as to what my next step would be. I think I actually prefer working in an office and mostly by myself... but I don't wanna keep on disappointing my family, study again and not find a job at all so I can't even begin to choose my next study path...

(If I think too hard about it, I used to be slightly more interested in English as a subject in high school compared other subjects... but is there even a job for me in that field?)

So I guess what I'm asking advice for is: 

1. Do you think it's the right decision to quit my program - I personally am torn between not giving a f\*ck about what other people think if I quit the program vs. doubting myself because maybe I am making the wrong decision here and I'm just being a weak person by ""quitting"" now...
2. What career options do you guys recommend for someone like me? I know this is such a vague (and slightly stupid) question. I don't have a lot of ideas in regards to the job prospects in other fields because it's almost as if I was ""groomed"" to land a healthcare job ever since high school by my mom. I live in western Canada if that helps?",15Nov2019,1

I think that online cultural identity forums can tend to be 'all or nothing'.  I think a 13 yr old could easily get swept away with it.  

Am I being a dinosaur?  Probably a bit.  I suspect my unease is that I don't know enough about online lgbt culture to spot if something is off.  I want to be able to support her, but she's steering into unknown waters.

Am I wrong to be worried? How do I educate myself?  Again, to be absolutely clear - fancying girls and boys doesn't worry me in the slightest.  Buying into the flag identity thing... I feel like I need to understand better :/",15Nov2019,1
68,"My gf and I have been having extreme communication and conflict resolution issues. We started arguing seriously about 4 months ago. Prior to that we have had some disagreements but never anything outrageous until a few months ago.

We have been on a break since then because I admitted I had doubts and was unsure about being with her and we still communicate a few times a month but a bit more frequently now. 2 days ago we were talking on the phone and the topic of our communication came up and we started talking about issues we've had. She proceeded to tell me an entire list of faults I have displayed such as: not listening, not being present, often times being bossy, not matching her effort and being inconsistent to name a few. I was left angry and speechless after she said those things. Some of the things I was aware of or somewhat aware of but other things I had no idea.

She asked me if I had anything to say and the only thing I could say is ""Im trying to figure out why Im mad right now and if you felt all those things why even be with me?"" I dont understand why she'd be with me if I treated her so poorly and tried to point out good times but she shot it down and said. ""of course there were good times but thats not what we're talking about right now.""

So I just said that everything she said makes me feel like I don't deserve her. And really was left speechless. And anything I tried to attempt to say was coming out angry and potentially argument worthy so she initiated we hang up to cool the fire that began forming.

I honestly am thinking about what to say and reflecting on what she told me and am trying not to be angry about it. Im seeking advice for this situation, please.",15Nov2019,1

Do they ever get in the way of normal, day-to-day activities?  My kid wears glasses and the lenses get so dirty!  Is that just because he's a kid or will I be cleaning them every day?  I keep trying to think of scenarios that I'm going to run into that aren't obvious to people who don't wear glasses.

73,"So ever since the first few weeks of school, my friend (who I have been friends with for years, but now is more different)has been copying my notes, my booklet answers and test answers.
I sit beside her on almost on every single subject everyday damn day. 

Ex. One time I had to leave the classroom so I  closed my booklet along with the answers. When I came back the booklet was shifted completely differently to her angle (but closed) along with the answer booklet sticking out (also was bended).
Every day she is looking at my notes and answers along with leaning in. When ever I look at her, she quickly looks away.

She likes to brag a crap load but I never thought she cheats off of people.
How I know she is copying them? She has her head turned and looking down towards my paper, then writes (and then repeat.)
I looked at her notes to see if she was actually copying mine, and she was. She doesn’t even try to write them differently. She writes them exactly like mine. She’s always breathing over my shoulder.
What do I do? I don’t wanna cause attention but I’m just pissed off.
Is there any nice way to tell her to please stop copying my answers and stuff? Thanks...",15Nov2019,1
74,"So I'm a 21 year old looking to drop out of my final year of the healthcare program I applied to 2 years ago. I'm basically supposed to be done in about 6 months as I'm doing clinical placement now. However I am now realizing how stressful this job environment would be, and I keep on making mistakes and not improving adequately as to the standards of the program. Also pretty stupid of me to realize that I cannot handle the mental stress of actually dealing with someone's life on my final year :/ One of the clinical instructors has even flat out told me how they think my personality is just not a fit for this job. I worked hard throughout the past two years to study, but because of my shy personality and anxiousness, I just kept flunking the past few weeks. 

I'm deciding to quit now even though it sucks and I feel like I've disappointed everyone around me. Most people tell me to just finish the last 6 months, but truth be told I just feel so miserable and so stressed and anxious that I honestly just cannot continue for the sake of my sanity. Many people have expressed how it's such a waste if I can't even just finish it knowing that I worked extremely hard the past two years, but at the same time that's also where I'm finding the strength to quit: I know I've worked hard, that I've given it my all, but I think this is where I draw the line. 

And I am also not sure if my program faculty would even deem it fit for me to continue on with the program as the expectations just get higher with each passing month until graduation.

My family has been very supportive (which I'm so lucky for) and I am trying to get into counselling ASAP too to help with my anxiety (which has reached new heights lol). However, I don't exactly know what to do after I quit my program. 

As a kid, I was one of those people who did quite well in school, and thus when I graduated I was pretty great on most subjects (I'm not saying this to brag). But because of that I developed very high expectations of myself and did not really find a certain ""passion"" or interest as I've built my self esteem solely around the idea of getting good marks for everything. I only pursued healthcare because my mom works in healthcare, and because most people told me it'd land me a steady and guaranteed job . So now I'm not too sure as to what my next step would be. I think I actually prefer working in an office and mostly by myself... but I don't wanna keep on disappointing my family, study again and not find a job at all so I can't even begin to choose my next study path...

(If I think too hard about it, I used to be slightly more interested in English as a subject in high school compared other subjects... but is there even a job for me in that field?)

So I guess what I'm asking advice for is: 

1. Do you think it's the right decision to quit my program - I personally am torn between not giving a f\*ck about what other people think if I quit the program vs. doubting myself because maybe I am making the wrong decision here and I'm just being a weak person by ""quitting"" now...
2. What career options do you guys recommend for someone like me? I know this is such a vague (and slightly stupid) question. I don't have a lot of ideas in regards to the job prospects in other fields because it's almost as if I was ""groomed"" to land a healthcare job ever since high school by my mom.

They also say that going to parties is an essential part of adolescence. Is that true? I mean, I'm not antisocial or anything, I have many friends, I just don't like going out. I enjoy staying in my house watching movies, drawing or listening to music. Are they right to be concerned?",15Nov2019,1
77,"My therapist and I talked about bringing my parents invalidation habits up casually and in a way that would provoke thought and not anger. Then the moment I got in the car and told my mom about how we talked about my problems communicating with my parents in therapy, she said they were pretty darn supportive parents and the problem was in my perceptions. 

I want to tell my mom and dad the truth, which is that they invalidate my emotions constantly and that’s probably why I invalidate myself and hide my pain from them. However, I am scared that they will be hurt by my statement and I don’t want to cause a scene. How do I bring it up gently? They get really upset when I criticize them for not being supportive enough.

I asked why (movie), and she replied "" Oh everyone is busy and i dont wanna go see it alone""

I replied "" that's crazy, don't you wanna be a film director? I could take you to see it if you want""

She said ""yeah, why not""

I waited until next time to ask her again and see if she still wanted to see it with me

Unfortunately we had a test this time, and i wanted to ask her before the test began so i didn't awkwardly waited for her after she took it

She got late, i finished and i figure i had time to spare so i waited for her to finish

When she was out, i asked about the test and how she felt about and her week

I then asked her "" You still wanna see the movie? ""

She said ""sure""

Me ""How about this weekend?""

She "" I'll have to check my schedule but yeah""

Me ""I don't wanna force you to go out, if you don't want to you can say no it's fine""

She "" No i do""

Me ""Okay, text me then to let me know""

My thought obviously this girl doesn't want to go out

I took the L and moved on

She tried to talk to me but i just kept it at a minimum and quickly changed every time to talk to my friends

84,"Two years ago, I broke up with her because I wasn’t happy with her and it was affecting my depression because during our relationship, I started changing. I wasn’t the best girlfriend at the end and started not talking to her as much. It wasn’t that bad of a breakup at first because we tried to get back together and I backed out after I realized I’m not gonna be happy with her. It was okay until I moved on too fast. She accused me of cheating on her. She started calling me a hoe and other things, mocked how I didn’t return a sexual thing because I wasn’t comfortable (she said it was okay at the time), and other things. This is just context to how our relationship ended. A few months ago, her ex comes up to me and tells me that she said I pressured her into sex. I was shocked at this and knew I never purposely pressured her. I get scared that maybe I accidentally did and didn’t pick up on a sign somehow. We didn’t have the best communication either so she didn’t tell me during our relationship. It’s pretty fuzzy because it was decently long ago. This leads up to a few days ago, where her ex tells me that she said I raped her. She dropped this into the conversation casually and made a joke about if I heard rumors about her raping her ex they weren’t true. I’m still in shock from this. I know I didn’t rape her. When we did stuff, I usually did it after she did it to me and she never said no or tried to fight back. She seemed to enjoy it from what I could tell. She didn’t look bored or uncomfortable. I’m scared that maybe I did hurt her and didn’t know. I couldn’t live with myself doing that shit to someone. Nobody has heard this around. Most of my friends were as shocked as I was when I said she may have said that. Her ex can exaggerate things but I don’t know if she’d exaggerate that and she said she wasn’t sure she said that.

85,"Hey reddit! 

Just to preface, I am stressed about this whole situation. 

My close schoolmate, lets call her Amber, is my go to friend, we do our projects together, pick the same timetables, and share our life experiences. She has been through some shit. We are in a social services program, and earlier today we had a mock counselling session where the group of us were in tears. We are becoming close friends. 

She shares her cell phone with her boyfriend who she lives with. I have met him a few times over the course of projects and assignments, and he seemed nice. Well I’m wondering what the fuck just happened. Out of the blue, boyfriend sends me a text. It’s borderline inappropriate and he even acknowledges it, even mentions that she would kill him and that he’s going to delete the messages. Then he apologizes. 

It appears he deleted the messages, as she messaged about a class project not long after, and nothing about the messages before I had a chance to process and respond to him. 

I’m torn between these options:

A) Show her the text messages. It will almost certainly end our friendship as she’s admitted to me many times before that she has a hard time with jealousy and does not have many friends because of it. I’m not sure our friendship can survive and I’m also almost certain he will explain his way out of it. She is unfortunately somewhat dependent on him. 

B) Send him a warning message when he has her phone tomorrow. I have zero interest in receiving those kind of messages and want to draw a serious boundary. I think something along the lines of, I have too much respect and love for your girl and I sincerely hope this was a one time lapse of judgement. I am not interested in betraying her trust. But is this option betraying her trust? I will also avoid group projects at her house. I’m torn between getting involved and staying TF out of it. 

C) Do nothing. 

D) Suggestions welcome.

That being said I want to know what else I can do, I really don't want a fight I just wanted to be paid what I'm owed. Another intern complained but HR brushed them off saying that they pay a stipend. It is true that our offer letter states that we are paid a set amount per month, but it's absolute bullshit because they make us clock in and clock out.

90,"So I recently moved to a rural area, in a small town of 500. I live in a rental complex that are bunch of duplexes. My place is right next to the street, all the other houses are further away from the street.

So I went outside and noticed a prius sitting right at the end of a 100 feet long driveway leading to someone's house that sitting on around an acre or a football field size land, so not like a normal drive thru a in a suburban area. I get into my car then I drive my car to the street, and as soon as I passed the car, that car turned to the road right after me.

Things that made me suspicious, why did the car wait right after i passed to get to the road? They had plenty of time to get to the road, why wait until right after I pass them, if they go on the road like 1 or 2 minutes later, and i noticed them later, I wouldn't though nothing of it.

Right as get in the street and pass this car just sitting at the drive thru, the car gets immediately behind me. What are the odds they are doing something with their phone and immediately want to drive right after I go?

So the car is behind me, and Im going to the grocery store which is 8 miles away, and you can either take the highway or take the service road to get there. I take the service road and expected the car to go to the highway as majority of drivers here use the highway, but it also went to the service road. The car followed me all the way up until the left turn light where it would directly get to the parking lot of the grocery store.

None of this would've been concerning if the car didn't wait for to get to the street and followed me right after, and also follow me all the way up until the left turn to get to the parking of the grocery store.

So am I just being paranoid or should I be concerned that someone is spying on me? Could this be a private investigator or a government official or even a hitman? I haven't done anything wrong nor have I made enemies recently, so Im really hoping im just being paranoid. I'm worried about the possibility of a mistaken identity by the government or someone else.

The thing that's easing my concern is that they were on a driveway. It would've made sense to park their car on the street, which is not traveled at all. I'm just hoping the prius is from the house sitting in a big yard.

I'm not schizophrenic or anything but I have anxiety, and i realize probably nothing is going to happen but there is that doubt of something could be wrong. Please give me reassuring comments unless you really believe it might be something concerning, this will really help and would be greatly appreciated.",15Nov2019,1

107,"Apologies for formatting, I’m on mobile

My parents just told me they’re getting separated, I knew this was coming so it isn’t a big deal for me, my main issue is the move. 

Currently my 21 year old brother and I live together in house with our parents, my brother goes to university, but it’s pretty far away so he drives about 2 hours there. 
 My mom wants to move away from our current home and closer to where my year old brother studied at university. 
She wants this because then getting an apartment would be cheaper,  and we would only need 1 car, as my brother would be able to take a short bus to his university. 
I don’t want to move, my issue is that I’m still in high school. I’m currently halfway through my grade 11 year, moving now would be a massive issue for me, ignoring the academic transition (which I honestly wouldn’t know how it would work) 
I would also lose all my friends. At my high school I have a lot of friends, and a couple of really close ones, it makes my school life a lot easier and helps me do better in school.
If I had to move I know I would be lonely and miserable there, I don’t know how I would manage, living with my father isn’t an option. So now I’m faced with this dilemma, do I stay here (we’d move to an apartment near my school) so I can stay with my friends, but it would mean we’d probably need a second car for my brother again, and all our expenses would increase, or so I suck it up and move to a different high school, (hopefully) making life easier for my mom and brother?",15Nov2019,1
108,"My boyfriend has been struggling with a lot in the past few months. He was living with his extremely toxic and emotionally abusive father until it got to the point where he couldn't take it anymore. We decided that the best option would be to move in with me and we have been living together for the past 5 months. He needed some time to get back on his feet and save money, with the plan of moving to his own place. He's been frustrated and depressed about finances and his job. He feels like he can't save anything after bills each month. He's been lashing out at me and the mood swings have been a lot to handle. Because of it, I haven't been in the greatest mood and it's started to take a toll. He moved into his new place this past weekend and I haven't seen him since. He has been texting me expressing how depressed and hopeless he is. I have been encouraging him to get help and he's made a psychiatrist appointment for next week. I'm happy to be there for him. However, he has been sending me mixed signals on top of this. Telling me he loves me but doesn't know if he wants to be together. Today, he said he needs to be alone and think about our relationship as well as get his life in order (adjusting to the move). I'm not sure if I should take the things he is saying to the heart or if he's pushing me away because he's depressed. Should I take a step back and focus on myself?

I work part time, 2 days a week, which for my current situation is perfect for both him and me as he had one other VERY longtime employee.

fast forward a little over a year later my Truck is stolen, The whole situation made me so mad I got sick to my stomach, my boss was kind enough to give me the friday off (with pay) to help me collect myself.

I decide to pick up a second job for the other 3 days a week to be able to afford a new car at a place a family member works, the full intention of me and the employers for me to just work only those 3 days and just help out with what my current field of work is...

Well The longtime employee at my old job (which i still have) decided to quit to pursue a more lucrative career in our field of work, which is understandable.

The new job has ended up loving me and wants to hire me full time with a very good position with full benefits etc...

How exactly do I quit my old job, which for the past almost 2 years has done a lot for me in terms of teaching and being there for me for a better job all around that is also right across the street from me.

Last weekend, my girlfriend was sexually assaulted by a friend of a co worker at a work event. He repeatedly made attempts to touch her/make out with her, even after my girlfriend said no several times and tried to get him to stop. He eventually 'shoved his tongue' down her throat and kept on trying; eventually she finally escaped and was thankfully unharmed. This guy is like 35 years old and my girlfriend just turned 23.

Here's the juice:

We just found out that this guy has a wife and children. We have his phone number, address, facebook, instagram, linkedin, and everything. We are ready to pull the trigger and tell his wife everything.

HOWEVER - we are concerned about what repercussions will happen if we go through with this. We're worried that he may have the ability to strike back (he's relatively wealthy), or, this may give her trouble at work because this isn't the *most* professional way to deal with this.

127,"Alright, so a little bit of backstory. I am a 13 year old with very bad anxiety and am in the 8th grade. I have a best friend named Ryan that I met last year. Ryan acted like a best friend should until my girlfriend came into a picture. My and my friend never had classes with her last year, but this year we do. Ryan constantly bullies her (probably because he's jealous). Now, this was never really a problem because it was all fun and games but one day he actually punched her in the face. I wasn't actually there to see it but even he told me it was bad. I didn't really do anything about it being 5'11 and only weighing 109 pounds and him being 5'6 weighing 150. 

&amp;#x200B;

So knowing that backstory here is where everything started. Today we were joking around and he punched me in the mouth. I have braces so you can imagine my pain so in defensive I hit him back. This continued until he punched me so hard in my mouth it made me shed a tear. Obviously being pissed off I walked away but we just had the next class together and we sit together. He acted like everything was fine while I was literally sitting there trying not to cry in front of my girlfriend. I forgot to mention it but she was there when we were somewhat fighting. Anyways, afterschool obviously being infuriated I saw a text conversation that pretty much went like this:

Ryan - best friend

Patrick - me

Bob - ryan's best friend

Kate - Girlfriend's friend

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: Ryan when I was telling you how to properly hurt Patrick one of the things I said was to not punch his mouth

Ryan: Yeah well he opened his mouth or rather my fist was too lose

Bob: No. You should have not gone near his mouth

Ryan: True

Kate: Ya'll were planning on how to hurt Patrick?

Bob: I wasn't ryan was. I was just telling him how to

Patrick (me): Ryan I'm gonne nut check u tmr

Ryan: I dare u

Patrick (me): Bet bitch I never got u back

An old friend from middle school and I, reconnected after high school, and basically fell in love instantly when we finally met up one night to catch up after all these years. We are both huge believers in doing the right thing. Even though we were both in a relationship when we decided to meet up, we knew how the other person was, and that we had nothing to worry about. (Neither of us would do anything to disrespect our SO or the other persons SO)..but we fell so hard that night we first met up. We began to talk 24/7 if we weren't already hanging out somewhere together. (Unbeknownst to our SO's) We just had this intense connection, and it was so strange that we never felt the typical nervousness you would usually get from being around someone you liked, it was so pure.....eventually we made the mistake of having sex, our SO's found out. It was a mess. We felt bad about what we did, and amidst all of the drama and chaos that followed, we privately stayed together as much as possible, until we ultimately gave in to our guilt, and reluctantly returned to our SO's. Since then she has cut off all communication with me, blocked me on everything (out of respect for her BF, and my GF) and ever since then I just haven't been able to love the same. I dont know what we had, but it was special. Something more authentic than I've ever felt, but due to our circumstances, it just couldn't be. I try to move on, and sometimes I thought I have, but when I see her, or hear her name, I cant help but imagine what could've been. She's single now, but I'm still with the girl I was with during our rekindled ""friendship"", and I feel like I cant love her like I used to, ever since being with this girl...our whole ""fling"" lasted about exactly a month, and I wouldn't hesitate to say that it was the most exciting and alive month I have ever lived. 

It's been over a year from then, and I just miss it all so bad. I dont even know how she feels about me anymore, but judging from our time together and all the talks we had, I feel like she most likely does feel the same, but doesnt want to be disrespectful and talking to me while I'm still in a relationship.

140,"So, my grandfather died Saturday. It was a little expected, but a little sudden. Like we knew he was on his way out, we just didn't know it would be so fast. I have a lot of feelings about it, but mostly I'm just glad it's over. He had Alzheimer's, and made it clear years before he got bad that if he ""lost his mind"" he wouldn't want to be alive anymore. So I take comfort in the fact that he would've been mad he lasted as long as he did and would've preferred it this way.

I've never really lost anyone close to me before now. I lost my great grandfather when I was about 11 or 12, but he also had Alzheimer's and I was so young before he got bad that I wouldn't have considered myself close to him. I was at his visitation and funeral. I also lost both of my grandparents on my dad's side, but they live on the other side of the country and only saw them a handful of times. I did not attend either of their visitations or celebrations of life, since they lived so far away. So my experience here is limited.

The visitation is tomorrow (Friday), and the funeral is Saturday. At first, I wasn't going to attend the visitation. My dad was going to pick up my brother and I from our colleges, and by the time we got back, it was going to be too late to go. This was more than ok with me, because I don't really want to attend the visitation. I've never been very social (I'm autistic), and I don't understand how hugging a bunch of people who I don't know and really don't want to hug is supposed to make anything better. I understand how it might help others, but I don't see how it wouldn't just make me more upset. Then not only am I sad, I also have to think about it instead of focusing on something else to get my mind off of it, I can't properly express that I'm sad because I hate crying in front of people, and I have to socialize with and hug people. I really don't like hugging people. At my great granddad's visitation, most everyone wanted to hug me and I still hate touching people who I don't know well as much as I used to back then. 

So, what am I supposed to do? I want to be there for my mother and grandmother, but I don't know how. I don't see how me being there would help, but I think quietly asking if it would be okay to skip might make it worse for them. Is there any polite way to avoid touching people? What are you even supposed to wear to the visitation? I only have like 2 items of black clothing, a dress and a t shirt. I'm wearing the dress to the funeral on Saturday.",15Nov2019,1
141,"About a year ago, I told my crush I liked him but he didn't reciprocate. He asked if we could remain friends and I of course said yes. Summer passed and I stopped thinking about him. Now, we talk all the time, he leans in when he talks to me, he is never not smiling at me, he occasionally touches me and it just brought my feelings back. He is very conservative around girls and doesn't act like that others. I don't know if I'm just being stupid or wishful, but I want advice on how to deal with it.

I have a little bit of definition in my hips but only because I've lost some weight recently. I feel like it only makes me look even younger than I already do. I'm constantly mistaken for 16, 14, hell a lot of people think I'm 12 and I know that part of it is because I have a bit of a baby face and seem nice and innocent but I think part of it is because of my body. I get hit on by a ton of creeps and I'm just sick of it. I know I just went on a bit of a tangent past my original point but yeah, my tiny boobs only make me more insecure because even though I'm very thin now, I used to be a bit thicker and I had a potbelly, so to this day when I eat a lot, I get bloated and my stomach sticks out farther than my boobs do.

Anyway, I realised that I sent her a screenshot of my cc info a few months back when I was trying to Venmo her money but an error kept coming up on the payment page. Should I be worried/cancel my cc and get a new one? I never got the feeling that she’s malicious or untrustworthy, like that she’d use my card or anything.

156,"This might be a bit long 

I’m a 19 year old virgin.  I’m not a bad looking guy at all and I’ve had some sexual experiences in the past (not actual intercourse though) but a few years ago I couldn’t get it up with a girl before we were going to have sex and that scarred me, in fact I’ve barely talked to any girls in these past two years out of fear of this happening again.  

I’m a very anxious person in general, and anxiety is something I’ve struggled with for a while, and lately I’ve been talking to this girl I really, really like, and she likes me too.  I do think I’m punching way above my weight here though and I think she’s miles out of my league and that already has had me nervous to “mess up” so to speak.  

Last Wednesday was one of the first times we hung out and we were in her room for a while making out and what not and the entire time I had an annoyingly hard erection.  On Tuesday of this week we were watching Netflix in my room for a few hours and for a while I was able to get and keep an erection but by the end (we were there for like 5 hours) I could barely get it up at all.  This was fine though because doing things was never really on the cards.  I also feel like I should mention that she’s a virgin with even less sexual experience than me, so I’ve kind of felt like I have to be the “leader” in our sexual escapades if you know what I mean.  But anyways, by the end of Tuesday she made it clear to me that she was ready to do things (sex or at least head) and I told her I felt the same way.  The next day (yesterday) I was back at her house for a while and a similar thing happened where I could get an erection at first but we were waiting for her grandma to go to sleep so we were just making out and not really progressing sexually for a while.  Then when her grandma went to sleep one thing led to another and we were both completely naked and I was fingering her and she was practically begging for sex, except I just could not get more than half hard.  This was extremely frustrating but also made me so nervous that I was visibly shaking.  I was honestly really embarrassed by this and was trying so hard to get it up, but things got worse when she asked to suck my dick, she started doing it for a moment but it was honestly just making the issue worse.  This was despite the fact that it felt amazing it was just like my nerves were overpowering everything else.

We’re going to hangout tomorrow now and I’m just so worried that I won’t be able to get an erection when I need to again and I’m honestly just really afraid of disappointing her.  I just don’t know what I can do to help myself here

157,"Preface: I've recently turned 18 and begun college. I started at a local college but am soon moving away from my family to continue my education (paid by me). Past issues with mild substance abuse caused my parents to have an increased tension towards leaving me lenience and historically they started drug testing me. Today I've been clean for over two years now and on rare occasion drink a bit at social settings or use marijuana as a registered medical patient. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came home, and randomly, my mom asks me to take a drug test. I replied explaining my stance against it and how her anxiety surrounding providing oversight for me causes me stress, but she continues to believe I decline to take it because I'm using drugs again. I'd be willing to take it as I'm clean from everything, but she still sees cannabis and alcohol as massive issues. She continued to elaborate that since I live with her I need to abide by her rules to which I explained I am fine moving out (though I'd be tight on funds). From there, the conversation quickly escalated and I cut it off saying I'd talk more another time.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I'm looking for what to do to explain to her I'm looking to be treated as an adult and gain a sense of independence without losing all her respect for me and making her think I'm an addict. She's unaware of my medical card for now, but even then I'm unsure how much that would change her mind. Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated.",15Nov2019,1
158,"So a little bit of backstory, i’m 19 and me and about 8 of my friends have planned a trip up north (about a 2 hour drive) for about 2 months now. We all paid together for an airbnb ($80 each) and it’s coming up this weekend, I also can’t get my money back if I were to cancel. 

It just so happens that this weekend is my grandparents 70th anniversary and there’s a big dinner here in town, with family flying in across the country for this event. I was told about this prior, and it’s my fault for not checking dates to see if i was clear. I just thought there’d be no way these events would land on each other. 

My mom also decided to kick me out of my house so my moms niece could sleep in my room. She never consulted me about this and kinda just told me to hit the road. I’m not upset about that, it’s family, but i feel like that’s something she should’ve talked to me about. She also made me drive to the airport to pick up this person i’ve never met before, take her to my house, show her my room, then leave and find somewhere to stay. I also only know about 3 of the people flying in, the rest I haven’t seen since I was 2 years old. They don’t really know me, and I don’t know them. I know it’s “family” but still. 

My mother is also asking me to drive around my states general area  (usually 40 minute drives back and forth)  doing favors while my car is on its last leg. I only use my car to get to school, and she knows it’s about to break down. 

Anyways, my dilemma is whether I should go on this trip or not. I’m going to regret not going, but i’m also going to regret going. I’m missing a 3 day trip for just the Saturday night dinner.

Her license plate was all warped but he said that happened previously before this, and definitely couldn’t have been me anyway because of the angle. So she went to her the driver side bumper of her car wiping off dirt and looking for damage, trying to find anything she could but I still didn’t see anything. She got my information but didn’t make a police report and said she is calling my insurance company first thing in the morning. I should have gotten a picture of her car as well, since she took a picture of mine (with no damage at all) but I was so shocked by this that I wasn’t thinking. Now I’m scared she’s going to purposely damage her car and commit insurance fraud and it’s her word against mine. This is so messed up and I don’t want something I swear I didn’t do to go on my clean record, and I can’t afford this right now.

I have very high expectations and consider myself a perfectionist, i know there are times wherr i should just shut up and play music instead of constantly overthinking and trying not to be cliche, , but i project my expectations of myself onto other band mates ain addition to myself and feel i eventually drive people away because i want to create music with a very refined sound.

She's alright, I wouldn't say we have much in common but thats no big deal. The only issue we have had is she once ate my food without asking, but one polite conversation cleared tbat up and we've been good. Anyway, we both smoke weed, and are about on the same cycle of picking up so we usually buy weed together.

174,"One of my closest friends (let's call her M), is one of the funnest people to hang out with. She is loud, outgoing, gregarious. I loved being her friend in the beginning when we where regular-level friends. But at this point we are ""best"" friends (i am one of her only two close female friends), and i truly feel she does not value me. 

It seems because of her personality, she is always intent on making MORE friends, instead of being a QUALITY friend. For example, when i go to an event with her (such as a football game at school), she will know many other people while i don't. And instead of introducing me to others, i stand alone by the side while she completely ignores me to talk to other people. What's most hurtful is i know its on purpose, since she loves being the center of attention and feels good to be the ""it girl"" that everyone is talking to, and wants to leave me out because she wants to be the cooler one of the two of us. --- when she is giving you her attention, you feel great. But once she feels that she has ""gotten"" you as a friend, she doesn't treat you the same. 

This is only one example. One time, the girls had a night out planned  (i was looking forward to this for 2+ weeks), but she canceled literally 2 hours before saying that she had to finish writing this essay and was working at a nearby coffee shop. Since i spent so long doing my makeup and getting ready, i didn't want to spend the night moping alone. I decide to call one of her guy friends to pick me up and come with me to visit her at the coffee shop. He says that he cant pick me up, because he was hosting a party that night, and said that M was there. I felt so betrayed by her... she wanted to hook up with the guy friend, so chose to go to the party with him instead of coming to girls night. then LIED about it. 

Normally, i would confront her and tell her my feelings. But she is so always gets extremely defensive and turns it back on me. The thing is, she doesn't see herself as in the wrong. At the core, its a difference in values and i don't know how to proceed with the friendship. I have considered just stopping hanging out with her, but the things is, my most CORE friends are really close with her as well. And because she is so loud and good at getting people on her side when complaining, i'm afraid that she will ruin my reputation with many people since she has a huge 'network'. She has done this with another of her ex-friends (who everyone now hates because of how vocal M is. I constantly have to bite my lip as M degrades her ex-friend's intelligence, looks, etc.)

The only person she responded to remotely was me, she was extremely combative with her nurses, and was very withdrawn from her brother (my husband) also from her parents.

She told me he wouldn’t leave her alone, was pressing her to talk to him, and at one point had a conversation with her that gave her the impression that he would kill himself if she didn’t interact with him. This person was a huge detractor from her recovery and resulted in at least 2 panic attacks where she was inconsolably crying and hyperventilating.  In conversations over the years she had confided to me that this ex boyfriend had cheated on her and reminded her of her abusive father so naturally I tried everything I could to convince her to block this persons number and to insist that he not contact her ever again. She disown agree and they stayed “friends.” She eventually went to love in her own place, her meds seemed to really start working for her, and she was working again. We eventually came to find out through mother in law that she was not only talking to her ex but considering dating him. A few weeks later he was living there and they were back together. After she moved she had grown extremely distant from both my husband and I and very defensive and irritable when she was around us because we wouldn’t allow her boyfriend to come to our house, go to dinner together, etc. They had many fights in which she would confide in us and tell us a lot of concerning information that made us worry for her mental and emotional well being. She would ask advice and get upset when we would give her answers that involved leaving him. The most recent even involved neighbors calling the police because they were fighting loud enough that they were worried. She said he was just drunk and argumentative. Last night she called me to ask if she could “stay with us for a month and a half and that there was a lot of stuff she didn’t tell me.” She came over and told me he had picked her up and thrown her into a coffee table, hit her in the face with a pillow till her nose bled, wrestled her phone from her hands so forcefully that he scratched her till she bled and had multiple bruises from where he was grabbing her. He has grabbed her by her hair when drunk and arguing. He threatened to “put her face through the wall” and refers to her as a “useless cunt.” She has sent me over 18 picture messages of deep black and blue bruises, bloodied hands and noses, and hair he ripped from her head, and holes in the doors/walls of their apartment. Were insisting she calls the cops and files charges if she wants to stay here for a month+. I do this because he is on the lease to their apartment and has legal right to reside there for another 11 months, and I am worried he will stalk her and seriously harm her. I am so scared for her and she thinks I am trying to force her to return to her abuser and that I’m trying to punish her. I also had an very physically abusive ex before I was married so all the advice I give her is from shared experience and genuine concern for her safety. I also worry about the safety of my family and home. I am working on a very difficult degree and my husband works 24 hour shifts so this is a lot to take on for us too because our place is modest. I’m trying to be reasonable and supportive but I feel like I’m making any headway. I have hugged her, listened to her, and offered advice. What else can I/should I be saying or doing in this situation.  My husband is at work till the morning, I have surgery tomorrow afternoon and 4 exams at the start of the week next week and I’m struggling to keep all the pieces moving right now. I don’t know how to help her and take care of myself and my husband at the same time.

TBH I'm not even sure I want a relationship or it's because every one around me has one.

178,"I am a 23 year old woman who works in trades. I am the **only** woman in my department at the company I work at. I have worked here for almost 2 years. There are a few ladies that work in the office (HR, accounting, dispatching), but in the field I am the only one, which means I spend all my time with men. I knew I was going to have to deal with some sexual harassment, but I never imagined it would be this bad. 

In the 2 years I have worked at this company I have only filed one official report to HR. I have talked to my boss confidentially about 2 other ones. I asked to not be on jobs with any of these men but 1-2 months later they started to put me back on jobs with them. 

My boss &amp; the ladies in HR have assured me that I should feel safe at work and am welcome to come to them any time. However, my boss is always under extreme stress and I feel like I’m inconveniencing him when I talk to him. If I were to file a report on every case of harassment that I’ve experienced, I would be in the office filing reports 50% of my time at work. 

I am completely outnumbered by men. The ones that haven’t/don’t sexually harass me were too scared to talk to me or made jokes about the “Me Too” movement for weeks after I filed a report. (I didn’t tell anyone that I did, the man I filed it against told people). I have no friends at work because of this. My work partner right now is good but the guys always make jokes about if his girlfriend is threatened by me being with him every day &amp; other comments that make me uncomfortable. 

I literally don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so isolated at work. I have no friends because of this and I don’t even know if it’s worth it to stay at the job if I start actually reporting every case, because it will take up so much of my time.

He did walk around with me but every time I asked to hang out, he’d say he was sick and I’d tell him to get some rest and hope he feels better. He would point out small things with me too like my weight gain or saying I looked better with lighter hair. In September, everything came crashing down and I let it because he wasn’t fighting for it so why should I? I cried to him asking why he doesn’t like to be around me anymore and he told me it’s because people will think that we’re dating but he’s fine with other girls. He hangs out with one girl daily and he never seems bothered by others opinions with her. Am I overthinking it or was there something wrong from the start?

He messages me in the morning and throughout the day. Will call me at 5am until I pick up if he feels sad, and call me from the momment I get out of school till I go to bed every day. If I do not pick up first, this will go on for another 10 times with a streamline of messages on whether I died or if I was with another boy.

If I admit to my feelings of suffocation I know he will use it against me whether or not he knows it, when we meet later he will tell me that I must dislike him or that I hate him for it.

The emotional abuse was also extremely harrowing and Im still helping her understand whats happened and how to navigate it. 

I have managed to avoid contact with him for the most part, and our friend group steers clear of him; However, he has gotten close to a girl in our class and I found out they're dating.  There has been a thought of my friend writing a letter to warn this girl of what this boy is like ( My friend is the most recent in a string of women) but we are worried that 1) This girl wouldn't believe her and 2) The guy would try to retaliate in some way. We feel guilty because we want this girl to go into this situation eyes open, or avoid what might happen; But at the same time it feels like overstepping and again, retaliation. What should we do?

192,"Fairly long story, but my sister has been a mess her whole life. She has 4 kids, one of which lives with our mom. The other are 3, 4 and 8. My mom said she would take the 8 year old, but they live one state over so she will have to switch schools for the 90 days, which is just painful.

The 4 year old she has plans for, so he will be staying with “someone” in theory, not sure who. He is very misbehaved, so none of us are volunteering.

The 3 year old, my husband and I offered to care for her. However, we both work from 8-5 Monday through Friday so child care is 100% necessary. My sister has been saving a lot of money since she knew this was happening so that she could pay for her house and bills while she’s gone, however she’s trying everything she can to find a cheap childcare option - I don’t blame her, and none of it is legit.

Here’s the issues - she has changed her mind 4 times in the past 48 hours, of whom will be watching the 3 year old while we work. People who she doesn’t trust, too expensive, etc. Today she told me she wants me to file to get state assistance so she can go to daycare.. but just use MY information and not total annual income. She says she’s only giving ME guardianship, not my husband so no reason to include him. I know this isn’t true.

I know as a married couple we would have to use both of our information and we would NOT qualify for state assistance. I’m trying to find out how to help her, but I’m not willing to lie to do that. I’m not about that, I am a very straight line type of person.

If we don’t help, the other option is foster care and I really don’t want that to happen. Can anyone give me any advice on this? My sister only ever talks to me when she wants or needs something and we don’t have a very good relationship as far as being close. We never really have. I always let her make me feel guilty if I don’t give in to what she is asking for.

202,"A little back story. Since I’ve moved in here I have had all sorts of problems with him. He is a psychopath. 

It started as him bringing a bat out to threaten me and my friends for having a couple beers in the garage, and has just continued to escalate. 

The neighbors on the other side of him. He punched his wife in the gut, and when her husband said something he pretty much beat the shit out of him. 

We have seen him chase his wife around with a taser outside, and when we asked if everything was okay. She looked panicked and scared and just say “Yeah, everything is okay. We are just playing around”

He had two dogs when we first moved in. We noticed only one dog a couple months after, and after talking to one of the neighbors behind us. 

He said he took his other dog and through him against the shed in the alleyway, and his youngest son, about 10 saw it, and he told the child if he said anything. That he would kill the child. The father called the police, but he denied the dog was his or that he said anything and played it off as the child was crazy. 

Yet we still haven’t seen his other dog. 

I love my too little guys so much, and they absolutely love just sitting outside, but they are a curious bunch and will take off and quickly come back but I live on a very busy street. One of my little guys actually got hit ones. Just grazed by a vehicle, he recovered quickly thank god. 

I can’t afford cameras at the moment, and I don’t want to sit outside and hover over my dogs. Whenever I do that. They act differently. They don’t act free or even play together when being watched. I take them to dog parks and walks, but the backyard is where they really love to sit and protect the house from vicious squirrels. 

I do go out and check the gate every time. But I have found it open after letting them out again. They like to sit out there for an hour or so. Cold or hot. It doesn’t matter. 

A few other things I noticed. 

Dead rotting small animals, what I think are miles. Appearing in the back part of my drive way. In the middle of the cement. It’s clear they were caught in a trap and they sit closest to where his fence is. Like if he wants my dogs to eat them and get sick. 

I would take this to the legal sub Reddit’s but everything legal they won’t proof of, and I don’t have any way of getting proof at the moment, or will I be able to afford it. 

Also I live in Iowa. In the states, if that helps.

I don’t get any profit from the company if a customer buys the picture *I made*. 

Today, I went through those bins for the first time and saw all of my artwork that I’ve done in the $5 bin. That kind of stung but I get it, I’m mediocre compared to other long term artists there. 

The owner left before I could as her personally so I texted her asking if I could bring my painting home this evening so I can give it to my mom for the holidays. I left before a response because I had to be out by a certain time and took the painting with me. 

I’m *so* broke *and she knows this*. I’ve voiced my concerns about being scheduled twice a week just to be told not to come in because the class size is small - I get the business needs. 

So I expected to pay $5-$10 for it. She responds with: “Hahah. I’ll have to take away the pay for your day.” WHAT how is this even fair? Especially when it’s going to go into the $5 bin. I’ve also worked while other instructors - on the clock - did the exact same thing without repercussions. 

So in response to her text about docking my pay, I told her I would bring it back because I’m so desperate for money right now. Literally in tears that my art is not my art/I can’t live without being paid right now but want this painting so bad to give to my mom. 

I also can’t afford to paint at home and that’s why I picked up this part time gig hoping to get my hobby in work. I was totally crushed when she said that so I’m planning on taking it back tomorrow morning. 

I’m also working at a restaurant to bring in more money since the sip n paint place isn’t consistent hours. Well come to find out, the restaurant isn’t either. 

On my way to the restaurant, I was told to stay home since it was slow. I asked if I could come in to grab my weekly tips and it was busy. I offered to help but I was told I wasn’t needed. I have the Friday to Saturday off due to celebrating thanksgiving with my family now so I can work on the holiday. Therefore I’ve only worked one day this week - yesterday.

I’m starting to realize that one of my closest girl friends is being very manipulative, making me feel guilty for not wanting to do stuff constantly and saying I’m a bad friend when I don’t agree with her. I’ve had the time recently to really step back and reflect on our relationship and I don’t like the fact that she takes advantage of my kindness and plays the victim even when she’s in the wrong. 

I know this relationship is toxic and needs to be fixed, but how do I do so without falling into her trap again and just apologizing for nothing?",15Nov2019,1
211,I want to ask my mom if I can do therapy but I’m afraid she will ask me why. I don’t want her to know that I am currently failing most of my classes at least not yet. It’s not that I am having trouble with understanding the work I just have been feeling extremely useless and a waste of space to where I just stopped doing my school work completely. There are many other reasons why I feel I need therapy that I would list but that’s not what I’m on here for rn.

212,"I’m 16 and dang it seems life is not liking me so far. It’s honestly just cruel. I’ve struggled to take on this stress.

Then there’s my step sister who cut contact with us after threatening to kill my mom. It’s been stressful at home with my stepdad dealing with my step sister, I’ve been trying to carry the load after my brother left and my mom becoming ever more stricter and tougher on me. It took me some time to adjust to my new schedule with my cross country tiring me out.

213,"So the past couple of weeks, my girlfriend and I have been having a rough couple weeks. We haven't been talking as much since she wanted time to work on school stuff and she wouldn't get any work done if she was texting me, which is understandable. I think the space and lack of talking has caused us to kind of drift apart cause I noticed that she hasn't been as affectionate over text, but every now and then it returns and I'm beginning to think it's just cause she's stressed over school. I got into an accident on Tuesday and I was pretty shaken up, I talked to her a bit and she said I could spend the night. We stayed up for a bit talking and I thought things were good between us. I even asked her multiple times if she was upset or if she was doing good and whatnot, and she always said she was doing alright. Drove home the following night (Wednesday night) and the weather was shit again, she was saying things like ""Drive home safe and text me when you get home"" and it was reassuring that she cared. I texted her a little blurb when I got home and I never got a text back. Figured she'd fallen asleep and I'd hear from her in the morning. Nothing. Sent her a cute little message on snap in the morning just saying how I appreciated the fact that she let me spend the night and what not. She just left that on read. I didn't think too much of that, but she typically responds to those. And then I texted her asking if we could talk about some stuff between us and she didn't respond to that (She did open some insta post I sent her previously so I know she saw the text). It's kinda outputting cause she's not one to typically ignore my texts and stuff, although it's been happening more and more since she wanted space for school and whatnot. I kinda figured I'm gonna give her the space now and let her come back, but I did want some third party input. Am I thinking about this too much? Should I just let things be? Should I follow up later? I just don't know what to do right now.",15Nov2019,1

216,"Ok so, I feel really bad for even typing this but I need advice from an outside source really badly. So I've been helping out a friend of mine and it was going great...at first. I created a space for her to be comfortable so she could talk about all the things she couldn't/ wouldn't tell anyone else. I gave advice, helped talk him through stuff etc, and it felt like I was really helping but now I'm wondering if it did more harm than good. At first I thought it was a good way to help someone who I wasn't super close to but now it just feels like I was never going to become a friend in the first place, just an extra therapist. 
Before when we had our talks, it was a lot of commiserating about the darker points in our lives, and if the combo focused on one, the other would  get their due later. Now, however, it's only ever her and it's all the time. Our texts, chains of her venting/asking for advice/ talking and me responding. I haven't talked about myself in months. That sounds kinda awful to say, but it's shitty when a friend doesn't seem to ever want to talk about the things going on in your life or your own problems but being expected to continue to old up your end of the bargain as a friend. 
Our hangouts turn into her venting no matter what the topic is, my efforts to steer conversation always go back to her I guess I'm just frustrated because it seems as if I cant tell her anything and when I do get a word her reception and ability to listen to me are subpar at best. I can't talk about myself now and while I don't make a habit of doing it often, it can be nice to unload. Now I know I'm being a bit unfair (she has been diagnosed with depression I have not, she is in a more stressful point in her life than I am as well) I guess I'm just wondering what to do or if it's even worth trying to keep this a friendship instead of just letting be one of advice giver and receiver which seems to betellere it's going now.",15Nov2019,1

219,"So this may seem stupid. Bare with me. To start I got the first gen of AirPods in October of 2018 and I my pair were faulty. So I got the case replaced at no cost. Then both of the AirPods sound stopped working. The two AirPods were also replaced at no cost. ( note I replaced them separately as they broke a month apart. ) Then about 3 months after all this the AirPods sound on one ear stopped all together! I took them back in to the place I purchased them and they said after three issues they will give the customer a new pair. As they didn’t have AirPods one and more they gave me two. So I had a new pair at no cost. Sweet what could go wrong now. Well while riding considerably fast one of the AirPods fell out of my ear on a bridge with water underneath, started spinning and hitting the concrete and narrowly missed falling in. The sound is low and a small piece of the plastic fell off. The place of purchase (from my knowledge) doesn’t offer another warranty which makes sense. And I’ve told my parents but am not sure what to do as I’m not keen on paying $250 for a new pair.

I’m not antisocial, or alone, or secluded. why am i pushing myself into that place? why is it so hard to find people that i enjoy being around who enjoy me? it’s as if i had 20 friends and now i only have 1.

225,"Last year, I reconnected with a friend who has a serious potentially terminal auto immune disease. (Jay) I moved across the country after he begged me to move home because he missed me, and my life was fairly unstable in Big City (I was facing homelessness).

Upon returning, he gifted me a Switch for helping him. Since then I’ve driven him around, done all his laundry, cooked for him and done all his dishes.

He started complaining a lot and criticizing everything I do. He’s a self admitted narcissist and wants everything done his way. I tried to do this to make him happy because I know his life is hard and awful.

He wanted me to make him cupcakes. He kept changing the number of cupcakes, until it was a multi-hundred cupcake project. I kept trying to schedule time to do this and he kept blowing me off. He wanted hand made chocolate toppers so I melted 150 chocolates by hand.

 The night we tried to make cupcakes together he went full Gordon Ramsey on me. The next day he had replaced me with a different friend, (Lucy) and used store bought frosting and candy. I got upset when I walked in and yelled “wtf, I spent 6 hours on these chocolates!”

He has since made a huge show of reprimanding new for my behavior. Every time Lucy is over he reprimands next in front of her. I don’t even know Lucy.

We tried to chill out, I went over after he asked me to check on them and Lucy was there. I politely declined to stay because he always reprimands me in front of her and it feels like a trap. We had no plans prior to this, and I was not scheduled to watch him.

He accused me for putting him in danger by leaving, even though he never asked me to stay. I got mad, and said I’d return the Switch. He said not to, it was a gift.

A few hours later, he changes his mind and is trying to force two other friends (Mike and Ted) to take the Switch away, even though Mike and Ted are not involved and I have no drama with them.

 I had to tell Ted that I couldn’t play Pokémon with him because Jay and I had a fight, I didn’t want to take Jays friends, and Jay and I were fighting over the nintendo. 

Jay is also saying I’m a narcissist and won’t take anything I say in good faith even though I want to dial this drama back.

I admit I said some things in anger, but should I give the nintendo back? Jay and I had some good times and it reminds me of that. After I said it I realized I wanted to keep it to remind me of happy times w Jay. I have a PS4 already and could afford to replace the Switch with a new one.

In the past that this is a huge fear of mine to be considered “smelly” in any way. I do in fact practice good hygiene and shower daily. They even sent me articles to which I replied that I do in fact practice what the article recommended. Am I wrong for being upset about how they went about it?

230,"This is a pretty heavy question. But I appreciate any answers.

I'm 19M, and over the past few years, I've gone through a lot of depression. And through these constant depressive episodes, I've learned what causes it and how to get out of it. The depression seems to stem from a lack of purpose and direction, and the cure is the pursuit of a meaningful purpose.

Whenever I've set a meaningful goal, I've known exactly what to do and what not to do. Anything that gets me closer to the goal, I should focus on, and anything that doesn't get me closer or gets me further is just a distraction. It serves as a guiding point that I can base all my decisions on. When I have a meaningful goal, I get obsessive and nothing in the world matters except working on that goal. I love it.

Whenever I'm not chasing any meaningful goal, I become restless and don't want to do anything. I get complacent and slowly fall into a deeper and deeper depression. And everything I do becomes pointless because I don't see what it leads to.

""If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable."" - Seneca

The only time I'm truly happy is when I'm pursuing a meaningful purpose.

Knowing this, I want to devote my life to a single, purpose that is important to me. A very big decision. The biggest decision in my life.

So I wanted to ask you guys and get and see what kind of advice you can give. I don't know if I'll get any good answers, or even any answers at all, but I think I should at least put it out there and see what I get.

What I've done so far is I've come up with a list of values. Things that are important to me. And I've come up with a vision for an ideal life for myself based on those values. And I've thought about making my purpose to pursue that ideal life and move in that direction. For me, this life would mainly be about working towards mastering the physical (health), financial (freedom), and social (connection) areas of life. Then leaving behind inspiration, knowledge, and experience for those to follow in my footsteps. My purpose would be to succeed and lead in those fields.

That's one idea. And the only thing that I could see myself pursuing.

But I worry that my values will change in the future. And so will my desires. And what I once thought was important (what I think is important now), I no longer care so much about. And the purpose I decided to commit to based on those values, is no longer relevant. And I fear that I'll have wasted my time.

My biggest fear in life is that I waste the one chance I have to be alive and regret my decisions later. My other biggest fear is that I live a mediocre life. To live a life in quiet desperation. I have no desire to play it safe and end up conforming to societies values like the majority of people. I want to do significant things. And I want to live a life I'm proud of. But time is running out. And I'm forced to make a decision. If I don't take action, I'll be forced into living these fears. I feel kind of paralyzed here.

I think the kind of advice I'll get in the comments will be something along the lines of ""do what you think you need to do, and just go for it"" or something like that. Or ""just start and course correct along the way"". I've already planned out how I'm going to pursue this purpose of succeeding and leading in those areas I listed earlier in the post. And I've begun to take steps in that direction. I'm happy and have a deep sense of fulfillment with every step. But those fears in the back of my mind are still present.

Does anybody have any advice for me in this critical stage of my life?",15Nov2019,1

The post was pretty short and to the point, but I just feel like maybe it's cringe-y to post on there at all? Should I take it down or just leave it? How cringey/awkward is it if the person posting about you is actually attractive? Is it still too weird to be ok?

239,"I’ve known my roommate (22, they/them) for a little under a year now but we’ve been living together since July. They are a very high energy, boisterous person, very charming and often gets away with rude jokes because of it (screaming “shut up” when somebody sneezes or intentionally cutting people off mid sentence). They have some problems with mental illness (I do too) and are heavily medicated but smokes weed everyday and drinks most days. 

I generally have a very positive outlook and have a hard time with confrontation. Initially I was fine with all the jokes, as most people are, but to me and their one other best friend they have become outright rude, very frequently. Cussing and yelling at us, throwing things, belligerent pestering, degrading and tantrums to get what they want. Completely disrespectful, in public and private situations. 

There have been a few occasions now where I’ve been so hurt or upset that I will address them about it (generally me saying “hey fuck off, you’re being rude”) and a very clear pattern has formed of the confrontation that follows.

First they get mad and defensive. Relentlessly asking me to prove what they did was hurtful or offensive (and then telling me I’m wrong), making me think our friends hate me, and saying they hate how I make them feel like they need to apologize all the time. 

Then they break things and have a complete fit.

And then they have a meltdown. They start crying and telling me how they’ve got a lot to work on and if I don’t like that behavior I don’t want to be their friend. They start self harming (grinding teeth) and telling me they don’t deserve to live. They say they love me and would never have the intention to hurt me.

But it just keeps happening. I keep telling them I want to be heard and if they really loved me they would act like it. Right?

So what do I do in these situations? Should I be less sensitive to these things or am I being manipulated into feeling that way? Who’s in the wrong here, should I stand my ground or let them apologize? While I’m very much not inclined to comfort them in these times I do care about them very much and would not want anything to happen.

I’ve invested so much emotional energy into trying to resolve all this, but am at this point exhausted and just counting down the days until I can move out. How do I make it out alive?

The problem I'm having is that i asked him when i was sober if he remembers it... this was like two days later and he said that he doesn't remember that at all.

The thing is though...he wasnt drinking that much to not remember things and i specifically remember him saying that he never forgets when he's drunk.

I expected him to apologize but he just didn't and I've been really upset about this because i have a long term partner who i love and live with and I've told him everything. I feel like I've been taken advantage of.

252,"Hey, I'm the sole founder of the proposition of a gaming club. For this story to make sense, I need to give context.

TL;DR my friends had a wacky idea for a gaming club and I decided to take it into effect with a petition, 131 signatures.

\---------

On November 13th my friend was having a conversation with the teacher about a gaming club for E-sports at school. They essentially talked about how it would or wouldn't be too pricey, how the school computers can possibly run LoL, etc. I joined in because I felt the need to add my two cents, since the teacher had 0 faith&gt;!and 99 dex!&lt; in this idea. What I talked about wasn't too important to note, but basically it made me feel as if there was a chance of it working.

Fast forward 'til after class. We have this sort of break time where kids sit in the lunch room and chill before going to the next classes. I sit with my friends as usual and I hear my *other* friend bringing it up as well (they must have talked about it before I got there). He brings up how it would be awesome to have a club for games and such, and at that very moment I felt something click in my head. ""Why not just make a petition and see what others think?"" I asked myself. So, I got a pencil and paper and started to walk around.  
""Hey, I'm making a petition for a gaming club in school. Wanna sign?""  
""A *gaming club?* Sounds awesome!""  
""Hold on, let me get my other friends' signatures with mine too.""  
What happened was that over the course of that day, I had collected a total of *131* signatures in high school alone. That's fucking nuts. So any thoughts I had about this being an elaborate joke were out the window; this is for real and the entire high school is counting on me. Kids were starting to see me as popular, my entire government class wonders about my club (even the teacher, bless her heart), and essentially I felt a lot more... noticed. It felt great, and it gave me the courage to continue through my plight.

\---------

Now it is tonight. Earlier today I arranged a meeting with the principal with my ideas for the club, and-drum roll, please- he was on board with the idea. In fact, he explicitly stated that he wanted it to work. However, he wrote four notes down on a piece of paper, each was something I needed to provide him with for this to work:

* **Find five schools in the CSRA or GA that have a gaming club. Get me all the details you can and a school contact.**
* Who would be the faculty sponsor?
* How will you ensure internet safety and proper behavior?
* Write a proposal including rules and plan.

The last three I can get on my own; however, I'll take any advice I can get for those. The first one, however, is much more difficult. I kept being led to college e-sports teams and all this other shit, so if you all can find any of the dozens of counties with gaming clubs, please let me know.",15Nov2019,1
253,"It’s getting pretty difficult to pretend I’m okay. I feel so unheard, unloved, and isolated. 

I’ve really withdrawn from the rest of the world because I feel like every time I have tried to talk about my own feelings or even just my perspective about something to family or friends nobody seems to be able to understand or relate or attempt to do either. 

As a result, I’m becoming extremely private and closed-off and obviously that’s not helping my case either but I just don’t see the point in opening up to anyone anymore. It’s like I open up about personal, private things and then I lose a piece of myself to others that don’t even care. 

I feel like I’m always the person that’s there for everyone else but the second I need someone to be there for me they are “there” almost as a formality and not because they truly care. The subject gets changed or my feelings get dismissed quickly and... this happens every time. I feel so small and so worthless. So I give up and drop it. 

Has anyone else struggled with this? Could this all just be my perspective not accurately translating context and somehow this is all a misunderstanding on my end?",15Nov2019,1

255,"Well, ""conservative"" doesn't really describe it that well, I just wanted to keep the title somewhat short. But I should probably start from the beginning.

I decided a month or two ago that I wanted to get officially diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I had considered myself a guy for quite a while, and the signs have pretty much been there for years, before I even knew what a ""gay"" or a ""trans"" was.

The reason why it took me so long was because of where I live. I'm lucky to not live in an abusive household, but with a very conservative town that really doesn't like lgbt people, I was a little afraid to be honest. That, and my family thinks I'm inly doing it because it's ""trendy"" (They look at really fake stories and assume that all trans people are faking it)

My options are very limited for multiple reasons. My family is broke, so we can't afford an hour long drive to a decent enough city that has a decent therapist. But at the same time, none of the doctors/therapists here are really qualified to deal with someone as ""special"" as me. Where do I go? What do I do? I'm just so tired and confused.

Like I know she probably just doesn't wanna talk to me but I've been really upset  because I don't like it when people aren't being direct with me.  Like I'd literally rather have someone roast me to death than just ghost me.    


I'm tempted to message her one last time and basically just ask if she actually wants to be my friend or not.

259,"I really suck at cars, so when I went to the mechanic they told me that repairing it would cost a bunch of money. I'm Mexican, so the estimate was about 10,000 pesos just to fix the thing and make it work again. (About $450 us dollars) I can assume that for some that's not a lot of money, but for me, it certainly is! I don't know how to compare it to your currency, but let's say that it's a little more of what I can make with a full month of work.

&amp;#x200B;

Eitherway, my cousin got a good deal on fixing it with a mechanic friend of his, dropping it to 7,000. We were going to sell it for 35,000, but my mom oposed to it, so I didn't sell it because she was the one that gifted me the car years ago. When we canceled the selling, my cousin had placed my car in some paint workshop, were I assumed they'd just paint it up in a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to visit my family for 5 days, and expected to have my car when I came back. Days became weeks, aparently it not being a priority because we were going to pay it little by little, now that I didnt sell the car, I had no money for the paintjob. Suddently it was over a month before my cousin told me the car was finaly ready.

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin sadly is a bit ill currently, not moving much from the bed because of a hard flu, so I went with my girlfriend to pick it up. I requested him to call the guy and tell him I was going there because a stranger poping up to get a car was kinda random in my opinion. So I went trough the public transport and Uber, taking me almost 2 hours to get there. I find the place and head in, requesting the car in the name of my cousin. (This people don't even know who I am at this point.) So they say sure, and that they'll prepare it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin never spoke the espesifics of the deal, nor costs, for some reason I didn't bother to ask. Some worker requests me to go to the office and I meet who seems to be the owner, I politely shake his hand and he says something I can't remember espesificaly, but basicaly, he was requesting some money before letting the car go, since my cousin never gave any money at all. He asked for $800 pesos, and called it ""Symbolic.""  
It made sence to me, after all, the job wasn't free, I didn't have the money at hand, so I borrowed some money from my dad via phone, in the mean time, the owner tells me to help the worker turn on my car since it had been standing there for a month without being turned on.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is in the process of sending the money to me so I can payup, but then, I see my car not being painted at all, so at this point, I don't know what the heck I'm paying for, When I aks the worker whatsup, he says that they couldn't continue because they never had any money. The only thing they did was removing the messed up paint that it had before, just leaving it more ugly and unpainted. Basicaly, I waited 1 month with no news of my car to find out that it had been sitting there not being painted, with me moving around on public transport. (The paintjob was suppoused to be a deal of my cousin and his mechanic, if he had painted it, I'd have payed it all without daubting)

&amp;#x200B;

Eitherway, before seeing this, I had agreed to pay up via card on their office, but for some reason while the boss was at the phone, he sent some worker with a debit card, telling me to take a picture and send 800 pesos there as a deposit, allowing me to leave since it was obvious that I didnt have the money in hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not sent any money yet, so I called my cousin and explained what happened. Personaly, I don't want to pay for what just happened, but my cousin is telling me that removing the paint is super difficult and costs a lot of money (If someone can confirm that I'd apreciate it) So if I don't pay up, he says I'm basicaly stealing, yet, I'm not entirely sure that's the case. My dad says the man is crazy and I should not pay at all, so, I'm really not sure what to do now. Any advice is apreciated.

I ask because today, i had an experience. I went to Red Robin with my dad. THere was a waitress there. I think she was a trainee. She was following our waitress around, i could hear the waitress giving her instructions about doing her job.

Anyway, she came to our table with our main waitress. She didn't talk or anything. She let the other waitress do all the talking. While she was explaining some of the specials to my dad, i glanced up at the trainee and just smirked at her. Like, a smug smirk, not a happy smile. She giggled a bit. But that was it, she approached our table on her own (Without the trainer, to fill up our drinks.)

She asked a couple more times if we needed anything and how the food was. I told her everything was fantastic.

She was pretty smiley when she kept coming to our table.

It was a minimal experience, but i think i should've played it with her. Tried to get a number or something.

264,"I've been single since 2009 when I broke up with my ex after 18 months. We spent 15 months of that relationship on third base. At first, she didn't want to have sex before marriage because of her Christian beliefs, but later it was me that didn't want to. She is kind of messed up as described here https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9wh0a/i_29m_am_in_love_with_a_girl_who_i_think_has_bpd/ and I felt when we have sex for the first time, I wanted to be more in love with her than I ever was before, which never ended up happening. Ever since I was like 12, I've always wanted my first time to be special and share it with someone I'm truly in love with. Since then, I've gone to third base with two other girls. Both were drunken party situations, and I stopped it from going further because even hammered, I knew that wasn't how I wanted my first time to go.

This Tuesday, I was feeling really lonely/horny, and decided to go to a strip club. It was pretty dead, and there were only two dancers working. When I sat down with a drink, one of them came up to me and started making conversation. I didn't consider this genuine flirting, I know it's their job and they do it to all the customers, but I was fine with that. I enjoyed our conversation, even though I knew it was a fake paid for transaction. I even bought a private show from her which I'm pretty sure she got closer than she normally does, and lasted longer. Towards the end of the night, and after a few drinks, I thought what the hell. I straight up asked for her number and if we could go on a real date. To my shock, she said yes. 

Today, we met for coffee, grabbed dinner at a restaurant, then went for a walk down town. It was fun, and I think we both had a good time. The two of us kind of just clicked personality wise. I told her how shocked I was she gave me her number, and how I'm sure she gets hit on all the time at her job. She said she rarely gives it, but she just really enjoyed talking to me that night and she thought she'd enjoy seeing me again. I also found out she isn't from here, and is only in town for about month. Apparently, dancers travel all across the country to perform. I invited her over to dinner at my place on Saturday, and she said yes, and implied we could fuck if I wanted to. 

The thing is, I have no idea what to do. I know I might be taking sex and my first time too seriously, or maybe I'm not. It's a shitty situation being a virgin at my age, and this might actually be a good thing. I know it would be weird to go through that with a new partner at my age, and this way I'll at least have some experience. Obviously this isn't going to be a lasting relationship, as she's only here for a month. 

Any advice or opinions are welcome as I still have no idea what I'm going to do. At least this whole thing is a HUGE boost to my ego, which is certainly helpful, as my depression has been bad lately. I'd been starting to doubt if any woman besides my ex would ever find me attractive, and actually getting a date with a stripper, something I'm sure a lot of guys try to do and very few succeed at really ups my confidence.",15Nov2019,1
265,"I'm going to try and condense this as well as I can. 

In 2017 I started college with plans to get a biology degree and then apply to medical school. I wanted to be a physician. During my first semester I started feeling really sick and long story short, was diagnosed with Carolis disease which is a rare genetic liver disease that inhibits your ability to absorb nutrients and can cause liver failure and cirrhosis. 

My liver function was ok and it wasn't cirrhotic at that point so I continued with my plan and continued school to the best of my abilities. A year and a half later however, I began getting sicker and found out that somehow, my disease had progressed to the point of end stage liver failure and stage 4 cirrhosis. My doctor's were stunned and still have no idea why or how it progressed so fast. 

Present day, I am taking a break from school to try and regain the weight and the strength I have lost. Eventually I will have to have a liver transplant, there's no way around it. The issue with my career plans is that after my transplant I will be on anti-rejection medication indefinitely, and this medication weakens your immune system. 

This threw a huge wrench in my goals and my dreams. I don't know if it is safe for me to pursue a career in medicine as a physician or at all because I am now and will forever be immune compromised. I don't want to lose time on this Earth with my family by being in a career where I'm putting my health at risk. But I also want to have a life where I feel fulfilled. I'm also stressing out because I'm already 30 years old. I was 2 years away from getting a bachelor's and will probably have to wait to continue schooling until after I receive my transplant which, who knows when that will be. 


I don't know what to do. I feel lost. My body is weak and it's hard to concentrate, but I'm not sick enough to get a transplant just yet so I have to wait until I get sick *enough*. Do I wait u til after my transplant to continue my dreams even if it could be years from now? Do I do something else? Do I give up on my dream entirely?

theres a lot of names here so this is a key or something idk:
s, n: first/current friend group
b, f, h: second friend group
a: in between friend
z, l: other current friends

so i am in my second year of hs and have gone through multiple friend groups. first i starting sitting one friend, ill call her s, and her friends n and j. j didnt really mind that i was there but n didnt seem to like me all that much and i was aware of it. (she has told me recently that she thought i was a bitch for a long period of time)

after a 3 or 4 weeks i ended up transition to another group, b, f, and h. it was easier because we had a class together and we went to the same elementary shool for 5 years. i spent a solid 3 or 4 months eating lunch with them and thinking of them as my best friends. i stopped talking to s, n, and j. 

at the beginning of this year s got a bf and started spending more time with him then us. at the same time i became friends with a and she joined our group. we were fine for 3 or so months, and s continued to prioritize her bf over us. during that time i was talking to a guy and we were kinda dating. i started to feel like i was relapsing into depression and anorexia because of the anxiety that being in a relationship gave me, so i cut things off with him. 'a' was really concerned so she asked me about it and i told her not to bring it up to anyone, and explained my experiences with suicidal thoughts, sh and anorexia. i also explained about recent urges to fall back in sh. she said that she would support me no matter what and had my back. less than 15 minutes later the guy messaged me asking me not to hurt myself. we faught about it the next day after she claimed it was someone else, then said she did it to help me get back with this guy, something i never expressed interest in.

i told her i couldnt trust her anymore and we stopped talking. s took her side so i stopped sitting with her and b and h. (this was in april)

i started hanging out with s, n, and j again but by the time june came n was completely done with j and basically kicked her out of our group. at the end of the month i became friends with z and we got closer over the summer.

in september i became closer with a new friend, l, and now consider her and z my closest friends. 

ive become progressively pissed off by n and s, both by them being incredibly entitled (theyre parents are buying them cars when theyre 16 and give them $50 a month to buy food from mcdonalds at lunch). now im in an upper middle class family so i understand having things, but the way they act like its insane that im not getting my own car at 16 or im paying for my own university makes me so mad. 

l has told me that i should drop them because of how they act and the fact that one jokes aboht bullying j, but i feel like im going through friends too fast. 

like in the last year ive lost over 7 best friends so i feel like eventually i have to look at myself and maybe im the problem.

273,"First of all hope this is not too mainstream. It might be but this is happening to me for first time.

So a little bit of context first.
I'm a very shy person and an introvert. I have friends that i can count on my fingertips and even among them i have only 2-3 female friends.

Now with the story of what happened exactly. So in my office there is a girl who i believed was of same age as me. [ 22-23 ] rest all the co-workers are older than me. And ever since i join i caught her staring at me for countless number of times. Honestly speaking this never happened with me. So i didn't even believed it first. I used to thought it was just my imagination or coincidence. But one day i caught her staring directly. Our eyes met and we both stared each other for like 5-10 secs. After that i was quite sure that she was staring at me. 

I became quite happy that this is happening to me. So after a day or two i gathered all the confidence and went to speak with her. Obviously by trying to make it seem like I'm discussing something official. This went on for like a week. Within that period she was quite ill, so in between i used to ask about her wellness. After that i got notice that i might need to shift to the other office. And i really didn't wanted to left this on hold. So one day i called her to discuss something. I told her about this and suddenly asked her about her number. ( This was the first time i asked a girl about her number ) she said something along the lines of yes or sure. Tbh I was so shocked that i didn't even remember but i felt happy but at the exact time a guy happened to come ,she left suddenly. I didn't wanted to confirm  when is she going to give me her number so while leaving i just said bye to which she replied with smile. To this point I was really happy. I thought I'll get her number next time. But next day when i went to say hello she just turned her face after seeing me.

It's been 4 days we haven't spoke anything. I don't even have courage to go and speak to her. I'm not sure why but I'm really regretting that i asked her about her number.",15Nov2019,1

Event: a movie scene is being watched

Topic: A movie is garbage because it doesn’t follow rules from over 30 years ago when it comes to filmography. 

Their stance: (with a specific anger towards the unconventional use of Dutch angles) A movie undeniably sucks and is ridiculous when they use conventional film rules and bend them to their own liking “for no reason”. It’s tasteless and bad. (They also commented on the stylistic choice of the movie and how ridiculous it looks (but if they read the books, this is all explained and was done for a reason)) 

My counter-argument: not everything has to follow classical or conventional rules, that new styles are allowed, their idea of all movies HAVING to follow filmography rules to the bullet-point is boring, and that this person needs to get out of the past

Their attack (the issue): “100% disagree with you here. This is probably the f*cking stupidest logic when it comes to film analysis.” 

(Then they switched and stated that they agreed with my first part about not everything having to follow those old rules).

 “—but if you’re going to break from convention YOU CANT JUST DO IT FOR NO REASON! This movie isn’t like pushing the f*cking grain of like this type of significance afforded to us by film or anything, it’s not like trying to be something (pauses to find proper word) — it’s not trying to be confrontational or edgy in a way that like challenges classical conventions of like the things (??). The way that they’re doing this is essentially not......the reason that I call it misappropriation is because it’s not being used for any particular reason to any particular end. Like you can appeal all day like ‘oh they’re just...’ like you don’t have to use it in the same way that it’s been used historically speaking and you’re right! You don’t have to, you can use it in a new way. But it’s not being used for any specific.....like there’s no payoff here. It’s like an action sequence being shot with cinematography for f*cking German expressionism to NO END! It’s ***** (movie name) *****! It’s not being (fumbles for proper word) — it’s not confrontational [why did I use that?] — it’s not being subversive like it’s not being subversive with like its appropriation of these film conventions, it’s just being stupid. It’s just trying to be edgy and like appeal to this like 13 year old audience because like ‘oH wOw tHAt’s So cOoL”. It’s [stupid] like you can’t do that. This is like the most nonsensical argument I’ve ever heard ‘nagging voice with mocking gestures) oh yoU donT haVe tO foLLow thE saME coNveNTionS oF the PAsT’ no sh*t you don’t but if you’re gonna do something with things that are well engrained as a subversive tactic - y’know because Dutch angles are a subversive tactic - YOU CANT JUST use them for no reason.

What is this drink?” 

Tone is hard to illustrate but I quoted it word for word and depicted tone in my best ability. 

Immediately after this they see a shot in the movie and say it’s pretty cool in a very tiresome tone then reverting to the film for what it is “well I guess it’s ____ so that’s fine I guess”. 

****************

Now for the highlighted question:

The next day after this stream, I decided to contact the person privately and express what I felt. I said that I felt attacked, belittled, invalidated, and disrespected. I expressed how I didn’t like how they argued indirectly when everyone who was viewing knew very well that it was directed towards me. I expressed not liking being yelled at and how I found their tone to be unnecessary and that they blew everything out of proportion and was ridiculously unnerved. I explained why I said what I said and gave several points with it. I clarified that I wasn’t defending the movie itself but that I was instead defending artist’s choice. I acknowledged that the movie wasn’t phenomenal and classical but pointed out that it’s cult following is respectable and exists for sentimental value because the movie was made for its time and for minors specifically girls and that movie is literally a fan fiction and is meant to be as unreal as possible in its own regard. I clarified that I wanted no apology but that I felt the need to express myself because I don’t enjoy being attacked or people hating me for no valid reason. I chose my wording to the best of my ability to convey that this was MY point of view and how I felt and how it bothered me. The argument wasn’t my concern, the way it was handled was. I said how I felt that I was being told I was irrevocably wrong and directly the stupidest kind of person. 

They responded and said: “This is a really disrespectful message”

I was honestly shocked by this because I wasn’t disrespectful in the slightest. 

They continued by saying that they didn’t name call or belittle me. And that they try not to yell but sometimes it happens when they’re passionate about something. They said they didn’t like that I was flipping their disagreement with my opinion into invalidation. They said sorry for yelling and that they try to let it be known that disagreements don’t equal a disliking or hate towards the person. They ended with “I do feel strongly about this particular reasoning. It’s cool in moderation...but can be damaging to artistic discourse as a whole.” 

They came back 30 minutes later adding that they think the “crux” of the situation is that they try to negotiate soundness and validity to people’s arguments but what they found “disrespectful, not only to me but to yourself, is that you’ve internalized your opinion to such a degree it feels like my attacking that is attacking you personally——— I don’t think it’s healthy but I know it’s a tendency associated with insecurity from personal experience and can be difficult to navigate.”

At this point I immediately got a deep feeling of being gaslighted. I’ve dealt with enough narcissist to sniff out the slightest amount of it. This person is arguably a narcissist outside of this limited context you have of them and I feel like they were gaslighting me whether consciously so or not. So I responded saying I think it’s unfair to call me disrespectful for misunderstanding their approach. I reiterated that I was speaking from my POV and that it was how I felt based on their tone and word usage. I stated that I didn’t mean to judge their character. And pointed out how else they could’ve responded to my message that would’ve been more suitable and civil such as simply stating that they were sorry for how I felt but that I had it wrong and they didn’t mean it how I perceived it. I ended saying that we’ll just keep misunderstanding each other due to different levels of communication and that I had no ill will. 

They finally said that they didn’t say anything about me judging their character. They say I was disrespectful because I was projecting. They were “suggesting that your ideas were wrong (subjectively - of course)”. Then they said again that I’ve internalized my position so deeply that I feel invalidated. They said they were attacking my position, not me. They said that me feeling this way was regrettable and said sorry for bringing that on BUT they don’t appreciate being projected onto and that this is a me thing and they are being used as an effective scapegoat. They finished with saying it’d be different if they directly name called me but they were instead saying my position was stupid. 

I responded apologizing for possibly dramatizing the situation because I chose to reach out and that not everything needs to be confronted and how we can both clearly disagree and never agree and then restated that I felt hurt by their approach to things. (I mean it was a whole drawn out 4 minute tangent to a simple comment I made). But after they read it I deleted it because I felt like I allowed their “gaslighting” to succeed and that I only needed to apologize for misunderstanding and NOT confronting them. 


(Stream was oddly cancelled for the night during the hours of this convo)

**********

Now it’s tonight and a new stream and they address it without using details and go into a 5 minute rant about how only “very insecure people” feel this way. How I (“people” was used but it is me they’re talking about) internalized my ideas so deeply or whatever that if it’s attacked then I crumble or feel like it’s the end of the world (my words, not theirs). They kept repeating “really insecure people” several times. They even indirectly acknowledged that their argument was invalidating (after telling me it wasn’t...). They pretty much said that very insecure people struggle to separate their ideas and beliefs from who they are and that even they went through this phase and sometimes go back to that mindset. They spoke about attacking ideas but not the people and only very insecure people see it as an attack. 

I understand what their saying but I didn’t like the tone or the word choice or the repetition of calling me and alike people “very insecure”. I know what I am and I know what I’m not. Of course I’m gonna be bothered by being called something I’m not. I’m not nitpicking and saying I’m only good things because I very well know I can be annoying and I acknowledge that (but never argue against it) and try my best to lessen it when it’s called out and change whatever I’m doing that’s annoying— but I’m not stupid and neither was my idea nor am I insecure for speaking up about it. I even stated how this may be trivial to them but it’s not to me. 

*******

Finally, the main question of whether my actions mean that I’m very insecure? If me confronting them was out of insecurity or unnecessary? If I am completely wrong? I welcome whatever opinion you have to say, I just ask that it be said without harshness or name calling no matter who’s side you agree with. I can see how posting this can be ironic but I want insight. 

BTW, take all of this in and now know that it was about Twilight. Literally TWILIGHT!! Who watched that movie and expects it to be up to the same standards, execution, and praise or whatever as Eyes Wide Shut, Titanic, or even Get Out (etc.)?? Who critiques it with old conventional filmography rules on a checklist sh*tting on it for being for teenagers and dramatically fantasy using “Dutch angles” bent from the original intention. Who sees it and expects purpose to it outside of entertainment? It was literally specifically about the iconic baseball scene. All of their very long argument to my simple comment and defense of artist’s choice was about TWILIGHT.....",15Nov2019,1
277,"Hey, i live in Missouri and i also am in an apt, the neighbor lady who is like rarely home but yet still happens to be a problem is currently the cause of a roach problem big one. and our kitchen connects to hers because the apartments mirror. now im not perfect but i try and keep my apartment as clean as someone with depression can but its like im a goddmn hoarder myself and my house is better than most depression cases. theres babies fuckin everywhere! and adults...so many mommas... they get in my drinks their on my food if i look away for a minute and ive gone through like 100 cans of raid, But my last Fucking straw was when my poor PS4 Which i bought new for 300 Fucking dollars! became a roach nest and short circuited! thats right the Fucker wont even turn on anymore and ive taken it completely apart and blown every last poop piece, leg and carcass out of it.  


Background: Landlord knows and has sprayed both apartments at least 3 times heavy duty professional at Neighbor lady(NL) expense but it only helped slightly, there was a visible decrease then bam back too babies in my kool aid and momma's laying eggs in my electronics. and to add on to this tyrant ive smelt cat shit at least two times really bad smell and ya so this bitch dont even clean her cat box sometimes. Another Background at night when her light is on and i can see into her kitchen and its obvious why theres a roach problem and ill leave it at that. last note, she obviously is aware of her apartment sometimes cause she'll sit out in her car for hours on end and just sit there like a damn creep.  


So What im needing advice on is how to proceed, how can i get this bitch evicted or how/can i legally sue the realty company for letting a flithy roach infestation bitch live in their domicile, i dont think her problem is bad enough for DHSS to get in on it but hey i may not know anything, i do have a pic of her license cause this bitch left her keys in her door with her little keychain wallet and if i didnt knock on her door and be nice (wish i didnt wish i took her damn keys and thrown them in the trash) probably wouldnt have know for hours. when i did this she did stand so i couldnt look into her apartment so again she must be aware. Like ive wanted to just swat team 10 cans of bug bomb into this bitches apartments and say fuck her damn cat like thats how pissed this has made me. please any advice? if not thanks for letting me rant.  


Also: the only thing in our lease agreement about bugs is that before unit was moved into it was inspected and treated for bugs, by signing you take responsibility for notifying landlord and letting them spray at your expense (NL was Charged cause she is the nest and the exterminator confirmed. thats why we werent responsible)  


our unit was pest free until about 5 months of us living there so our lease hasnt been a lie, i believe her Spacing has gotten worse so she stopped keeping clean and thats why our apartments are suddenly infested thats my theory i have no evidence to this.",15Nov2019,1

281,"Going to preface this by saying I am not interested in going to a trusted adult due to fear of them getting angry at me. 

I started using nicotine vapes almost 6 months ago, and ever since then I have always had a nicotine device on me and use it multiple times a day, every day. 

It's gotten to the point where every time I use I get a bad headache and nausea, it is not pleasant at all, but I continue to use it multiple times a day (&gt;20 times a day) 

People frequently give me free puff bars (cheap disposable nicotine vapes) and I am constantly exposed to it in school as people have them in the restroom every time I go in there. 

I'm giving everything I own to someone for one dollar because I know I can't keep owning things at home if I want to quit, but I don't know how to stop myself from using other people's vapes at school.

283,"I've already made a few posts about my situation and about my abusive mother. In a few weeks, I am going on a family ""vacation"" to Nigeria to visit family. It will be my first time overseas. Ever since I can remember, my mother has been emotionally, psychologically and physically abusive towards me, to the point that when I was a young child I thought that she would kill me. That's how violent and angry she is. Anyway, she's always been very controlling and forceful and believes education can solve all problems. Here is a timeline of my schooling 

2017-  Year 12 (Senior year) I was depressed and insanely suicidal to the point of googling ways to kill myself DURING CLASS. I had a part time job and ended up working anywhere from 15-20 hours per week (not by choice) although it was advised that year 12's don't work more than 9. I ended up trying to kill myself just after my 18th birthday. I obviously did horrible in school and didn't a high enough score to get into university. I didn't know what to do since that's what everyone expects you to do after school.  

2018- I had no idea what to do since I couldn't go to uni so I applied for a business diploma set to start mid year. Something went wrong with the enrolment and long story short, I couldn't enrol into the course (a mistake that was made by the university NOT me). From January up to that point, I had told everyone that I would be studying mid year and when I couldn't, my Mum was very angry at me. Even trashing my room when I said that I didn't want to go to university even though I would have gone, I just didn't want to.  I was also suicidal and attempted to take my life due to experiencing sexual assault and harassment from an ex and developing ptsd symptoms. 

2019- I enrol into another business diploma at another university. I ended up not going to classes due to mental health. My Mum throughout all of this, has given me hell. She forces me to enrol in another course, the only course that I could enrol in was a 1 day a week course and she was enraged at me at the fact that it was only a 1 day a week course (even though it's not in my control). Fast Forward to now, she's trying to force me to do a two year nursing diploma. 

Now she's threatening to not let me return home if I don't ""obey"" (her words), her and that she is ""regaining control"" and that she is my ""boss"". She said that I'm not allowed to do anything without me letting her know where I am. Today I had a job interview at 9am that I didn't tell her about because I'm going to be 20 next month, she said that I can only work on the weekends and fOCUs oN StuDYinG. And as a punishment for not letting her know about my interview, she's not allowing me to see my boyfriend before we leave (we leave for 5 weeks). A few things to note:

\- She knew about the university fucking up my enrollment, and she still blames me for it

\-She knew that my ex boyfriend assaulted me and you know what she did? Laughed about me needing to see a therapist, asked if I liked it 

\-She was there when I tried to kill myself. I was literally going to go to the bathroom and stab myself to death. I brought up the fact that this happened (recently) and she laughed  

I have been through so much trauma that I think it has affected the structure of my brain and all my Mum can think of is me going to fucking university. I wasn't feeling anxious about the upcoming trip but now I am. I am scared that she will try and force me to stay in Nigeria and go to university there. What should I do?",15Nov2019,1

285,"Where oh where do I begin?

For starters, some context: my ex-gf and this one girl HATE EACH OTHER. Like, HATE. They’re rivals. I’ve complained about the other girl many times to my ex. 

My ex and I broke up a month ago. We were planning on singing a song for this talent show together, but I said we shouldn’t after we broke up (because apparently that needed clarification, according to her).

Now, the girl my ex hates has asked me to do the show with her, and I’m torn.

On the one hand, I really want to. It’s perhaps the biggest event where I live and there’s money to be won. However, I don’t particularly like this girl even as a friend, but I don’t mind working with her. My big issue is my ex. I don’t want to hurt her or make her angry or sad because I’m afraid she’ll spread rumors about me or say bad things about me as revenge. (We broke up because I said some things I really shouldn’t have, but I wanted to break up anyway so I wasn’t too hurt. I’m just super ashamed of what I said and if she tells people what I said, it could really hurt me.)

So, should I play it safe and not do the talent show, or should I “risk it all” and do it?",15Nov2019,1

They pretty much said that very insecure people struggle to separate their ideas and beliefs from who they are and that even they went through this phase and sometimes go back to that mindset. They spoke about attacking ideas but not the people and only very insecure people see it as an attack. 

I understand what their saying but I didn’t like the tone or the word choice or the repetition of calling me and alike people “very insecure”. I know what I am and I know what I’m not. Of course I’m gonna be bothered by being called something I’m not. I’m not nitpicking and saying I’m only good things because I very well know I can be annoying and I acknowledge that (but never argue against it) and try my best to lessen it when it’s called out and change whatever I’m doing that’s annoying— but I’m not stupid and neither was my idea nor am I insecure for speaking up about it. I even stated how this may be trivial to them but it’s not to me. 

*******

Finally, the main question of whether my actions mean that I’m very insecure? If me confronting them was out of insecurity or unnecessary? If I am completely wrong? I welcome whatever opinion you have to say, I just ask that it be said without harshness or name calling no matter who’s side you agree with. I can see how posting this can be ironic but I want insight. 

BTW, take all of this in and now know that it was about Twilight. Literally TWILIGHT!! Who watched that movie and expects it to be up to the same standards, execution, and praise or whatever as Eyes Wide Shut, Titanic, or even Get Out (etc.)?? Who critiques it with old conventional filmography rules on a checklist sh*tting on it for being for teenagers and dramatically fantasy using “Dutch angles” bent from the original intention. Who sees it and expects purpose to it outside of entertainment? It was literally specifically about the iconic baseball scene. All of their very long argument to my simple comment and defense of artist’s choice was about TWILIGHT.....",15Nov2019,1
288,"So I (27 F) am quitting drinking. I’ve been struggling with nightly drinking for a few years now. I’m not drinking in the mornings or daytime. But it’s turned into every time I get triggered with stress in the evening/nighttime I turn to having a drink. A little background I take care of two small children and an elderly father. My mother passed when I was young leading to some anxiety and depression. Both parents severe alcoholics (which I think keeps me from getting too bad but also statistics are against me) But for the most part I feel very level headed but since I’ve had this habit more so in the last 3 months  it’s affecting how I feel emotionally everyday.

304,"BACKGROUND:

I’ve never been a fan of school, but I’ve HATED college. My freshman year was a blast and then I chose to major in Computer Science and it’s been a fucking nightmare ever sense.

I didn’t have access to a personal computer until my freshman year and it showed immediately. I went from feeling like a top tier student to dead last in just about every CS course.

It took a huge toll on my confidence, social life, and physical health, but I gritted through it until the end of my Junior year when my GF of 3 years left me. 

Shocking that she didn’t see the point in dating someone who 1) spent most of their time chained to their computer and 2) wasn’t even getting A’s.

That crushed me. I spent a couple weeks picking up the pieces then forced myself to start working out/whoring around. The learning curve for CS must have also started to kick in because I actually started to do really well in my courses that fall semester.

Then I started to feel hollow again. I’d given up friends, distanced myself from my family, and lost the person I loved all for what? A mediocre GPA in a good major?

Applying for jobs the “final” semester coupled with everything previously mentioned was one gut punch too many for my self esteem. I’m sure I don’t have to explain how demoralizing/time consuming the whole job search process is to the reddit community.

I stopped going to classes because 1) CS professors are notoriously bad at teaching and 2) I was just going to end up googling everything anyways so why waste time that I didn’t have. Long story short, I had to drop several classes and the only job opportunity that I still qualified for w/o a degree was a $10/hour summer internship making websites, 



PROBLEM:

Learned a lot from the internship and used it as a solid resume builder while applying for jobs this semester, but real jobs require a ridiculous amount of preparation. I essentially skipped school for a month, BUT IT PAID OFF! Starting January I’ll have a real job with a salary that I wasn’t expecting until my late 20’s!

But I’ll lose the job if I don’t graduate, and there’s one course in particular that I know I’m currently failing. There’s several labs that I haven’t done that would boost my grade enough to at least pass, but have serious doubts that he’ll let me receive any points for submitting them now. 

Most professors are pretty lenient if you talk to them, but I’ve barely attended his class. I’ve also heard him say “if I give you points for a late grade that would be unfair to all the other students” to someone else before. Which I’d respect if I was competing for valedictorian or some other honors, but I’m literally just trying to scrape by with whatever the lowest passing grade is so that I can start my life and escape this depression that’s been beating me down for what’s seemed like an eternity.



Please, any advice as to how I should approach this would make such a difference in my life. Failure isn’t an option here. I’m literally going to snap if I have to throw away the opportunity of a lifetime to repeat a single course and pay another semester’s worth of tuition.

PS - Sorry for the insanely long post, also I’ve been a lurker on reddit for 3 years and this is my first official post across all of my accounts because I trust this community and I’ve never needed as much advice as I do right now &lt;3",15Nov2019,1

316,"Hi all,

First, my apologies if this is the wrong sub for this. Please take my post down if that’s the case. I also posted this on r/dementia.

Some context: My grandfather is in his 80’s and is in the beginning stages of dementia. He deals with periodic bouts of memory loss, confusion, and frequent angry outbursts. He also fractured his neck in a fall recently and will have severe mobility limitations for the rest of his life. Other possibly relevant context: we are located in the US and I have power of attorney.

The only activity that seems to calm him during moments where his dementia or pain acts up is access to his iPad. He plays gambling and billiards games that have in-app purchases and he racks up thousands of dollars in fees per month. His retirement income used to cover this habit but we are now going to have to divert those funds to in-home care.

Given his mobility limitations and the fact that these games are the only thing that bring him any peace, I’m trying to find an alternative for him as opposed to just taking the iPad away. My current plan is to install all of the parental controls that the iPad has available and turn off his ability to make in-app purchases. I’m also hoping to find replacement games that are either entirely free or only have a single up-front cost. 

Given that context, I’m looking for suggestions regarding the following:

1. Is there a way to make absolutely sure that my grandfather won’t be able to make any purchases- even through the web browser on the iPad? Will the parental controls be sufficient or do I need to take further steps? He has lucid moments where he’s very motivated and able to make purchases. He’s also pretty tech savvy in those moments and I’m afraid he’ll be able to get past restrictions I put into place.

2. Does anyone have experience with trying to move a fragile loved one away from these apps? I’m anticipating a strong negative reaction even if I replace the apps with similar ones. He still desires some level of autonomy and this will be taking away one of the last ways that he’s able to spend money. I don’t take that lightly.

3. Is there a website or something where I can find info on apps that don’t require in-app purchases? I’m afraid I’m going to accidentally download something that has in-app purchases and he’ll either spend money or become very angry that the app won’t let him play anymore.

4. Do you have any recommendations regarding resources for dealing with gambling addiction in seniors, tech access for seniors, or anything else that’s relevant here? Are there other subs that might be helpful?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",15Nov2019,1

319,"My boyfriend (21) works at a medical center. He was out on deliveries about to get food, when a man was aggressively tailgating him. My boyfriend was in a company van already going 75 in the freeway, but obviously wasn’t going to speed..so he maintained 75. 
The angry driver then got in front of my boyfriend, started going 40 mph (forcing my boyfriend so go a dangerously slow speed), and kept slamming on his brakes in order to try to get my boyfriend to crash. 
My boyfriend was stuck in the lane behind this crazy driver due to a semi truck.
When he was finally able to get off of the freeway, the man followed my boyfriend, pulled next to the drive thru that my partner pulled into for food, and started video taping my partner.
The angry driver told my boyfriend that he was recording him for “evidence” because my boyfriend apparently “tried to kill 4 people on the freeway” and that the man was going to get my boyfriend fired using the video.
My boyfriend asked the man what his deal was, that he obviously didn’t try to kill anyone, and that he was going to call the police if the man didn’t stop harassing him.
The angry driver told him to “Go ahead, call the police, see what happens”.
My partner called the police, and the man took off.
The situation is causing my boyfriend a lot of anxiety because;
-This man is obviously unstable, angry, and possibly violent
-This man, a stranger, has a video of him, which would be uncomfortable on its own, but again, he is unstable, angry, and possibly violent.
-We live in a relatively small area with one road leading in and out of the town
-He didn’t get his license plate, so despite the police being notified of the situation...there’s a possibility that he could encounter the man again, and the man could do something rash (crash into my boyfriend, shoot him, idk...crazy [though unlikely] shit)

I'm in my first year away at college, have a fantastic group of friends and am generally doing well, but I have a long history of depression and anxiety and because of this I find myself increasingly dissatisfied, constantly sad and in general just tired of everything. I have this one friend, he's absolutely fantastic, has consistently been there for me through small rough patches and checked up on me when I seemed ""off"". However, he does not know the extent of how I'm feeling now, or the history of my mental illness.

I find myself really really wanting to go to someone for help/just to talk to about everything, but to be honest he's the only one I really feel comfortable doing so with (I find it difficult to open up to people and generally don't like to share much of the negative aspects of my life). Recently, though, he's been really stressed and busy, and consistently talks about how he really doesn't want to be stressed and is trying to think positively, etc. This has made me really nervous to go to him for help, since I don't want to put more on his plate and I really don't want my friendship to be a burden on him. 

I'm worried that I'm spiraling into a hole I won't be able to dig myself out of, and I don't have many resources here that can help me (university counseling is shit, I have no money for therapy/medication, relationship with my parents is not good enough to go to them for help). I feel like he's my best option to help me through this, but I'm terrified of losing him if I stop being a ""positive"" influence in his life. 

Is this unjustified/paranoid? Would I be a dick to put more on his plate and be ""negative""? If I were to tell him, how should I do it? I'm basically worried that I'm going to be too much for him, and that I may lose him which would damage me even more. 

tl;dr: my mental health is worsening and I fear that going to my friend for help will be too much for him. What should I do?",15Nov2019,1
321,"My ex F27 recently broke up with me M30, actually one week ago today. Two days after the break up she was drinking and texted me that she missed me. The next day I told her that she was the k e that left me and that I'm willing to work things out, but I can't live in the middle. It's too stressful and not worth it if she isnt interested. She texted me later that night she had a tough day and that again she was missing me. 
Two days later I texted her and we talked a bit more about what's going on, however she started to question if I actually love her and miss her or if I just miss being around someone because I'm lonely. She then told me it's been really difficult on her as well and that every time we talk it's like opening up an old wound and doesn't allow for either of us to process. This really got to me. Wasn't angry or upset, just really felt defeated. 
It's been a couple of days and I finally feel like I'm doing a lot better. It's been a rough couple of weeks and I'm just ready to move past the feelings of grief and loss. 
Then tonight happens. Out of the blue I get a text from her while I'm watching a movie. At first I go to respond, but then I decided to wait until I finished the movie. I just always seem to walk away disappointed after the initial high of seeing a message from her. So I text her back and she says she was walking a dog she watching and walked past my place and wanted to know if I would like to see the dog. But 2 hours had past and she was now in bed. 
I ended up calling her and talking for a few minutes. I casually mentioned to her if she was walking the dog tomorrow night I'd be happy if came by. She said okay, but not a definite commitment to. 
So I'm pretty confused about all of this. I'm really hoping she comes over, but I'm not going to wait on her to. I didn't have any plans either way, so we'll see. Any advice on what's going on and what should do or expect from here? Just generally confused about this whole thing. 

TL;DR ex has reached out since we broke up. Told me we shouldn't be talking a couple of days ago and tonight she reached out. Asked if I wanted to see the dog she was watching because she was on a walk by my house. I didn't respond in time, but I know nothing would have happened. Confused and in need of advice.",15Nov2019,1

329,"Hey , first off all thank you for reading this , I've been feeling lost and I really apriciate all of you who dedicated the time to read this, tldr at the bottom.

Well a little something about myself or about why I'm here, I'm 17 , at december I'll be 18, I live in the middle east in a modern democratic country, I will be recruited to the army in less then 12 months.


Until around 5 months ago I was happy , your regular teenager who's enjoying life and being a person, playing video games and loving technology, studying (not so well though , except subjects important to my future that I want to make my field in , computer science and physics),  I was in a quite of a serious relationship , my high school sweetheart , life was quite good and I was happy, but then , shit started to happen and it left me different , a person who I'm a stranger do , and now I have no idea how to face me.

It started with an event that happened with my gf and one of my close friends at the time, I'll leave a link to a post I made when all shit went down
but in short what have happened is that I had a loving relationship with my gf for almost 2 years , I became really close to her and her family to the point which I was kind off a part of it, I made a party which my gf stayed after every one left to watch movies with my friends instead of closing the house and taking care of me as she said she would as I felt quite bad, I couldn't be mad at her so much as I didn't want to be , I've went through a biopsy to detect skin cancer(which I don't have luckily) , something similar that happened in the party happened at another party with another friend, I still stayed , she kept treating me worse and worse, I've tried to talk about this to explain her but it always ended in a finishing that wasn't quite good , eventually I stood up for myself once which led to a breakup which was mutual but more on because she didn't want to explain to me why she kept being like that , and her not wanting to listen and try to resolve this together as a couple, I've done mistakes too , I'm not the perfect bf or a perfect human being , I'm me , and I can't explain who is me, this happend two months ago. that first close friend that they party stuff happend with that she met through me ,not even 2 days and she invited him over  , 10 days and they're already dating, I knew that because he tried to ask me stufd about her in order to ""help her after the breakup"" , I was informed by a mutual friend of ours of that , they were spreading a lot of shit about me, about my abuse of her abd selfishness , after this I had a mental breakdown and my friends at the time of need , didn't care too much, my dog died as well after this happened. If you want to understand a bit further this is the post.

I've went through the pain of it , it hurt me , really bad, days of crying and no sleep , grieve about my dog and the pain from all of the stuff that happened , the realization she developed feelings for him during the relationship , the pain of my friends being who they're , people I've known for up to 11years, who've I grown with, I've started to be a different person , trying not to hurt myself by helping others , I was a fool by acting like that to all of my surroundings , I was hurting myself the most . I'm a different person now , I wanna be different, but I can't seem to find the things that make me happy not depending on others , I've invested much time at the past on video games , I really loved them and now I can't anymore(my ex was into video games and I've build her a pc , I've introduced her abd her new bf in my favorite game), now I have around 1500$ of equipment I barely use , I've met some people who I've known for a while but came closer to them , but still not the people who I can , how to explain this , have mutual interests with , I've began to volunteer by tutoring kids computer science , I took 2 jobs and went to the gym , lost a significant amount of weight and look a lot better , but still I just feel empty inside , like I have no purpose , how to make myself happy from me , I would really appreciate to hear your advice if you have any , thank you.

TL;DR : was hurting myself by wanting to help other people , a chain of events left me empty and I cant feel hapinness anymore.",15Nov2019,1

I am in a long distance relationship with my fiance, and we barely see eachother. The next time ill see him is for the holidays, after that we will be a whole 6 months without being able to hug each other...

I asked him how ut will work out for the holidays, just to be sure about the flight (which may be a 500$ damn flight!) So I can get ready in time, and asked him when are his days off so he can come pick me up..
The conversation goes as it follows: 

Me: So, should I book on your days off? 

Him: No, on my mom's days off, she will come pick you up.

Me: But you will take the time to come too right??

Him: idk, my boss switch my shifts often sooo...

Me: well do like I did with my boss and let her know to not make you work the day to come pick me up?....

Him: Nah, tbh id rather work, youll go wait at my parents house. 


That broke my heart... and I dont know if im a bad person to think its uncalled for... I mean... its such an important moment for us, well at least me... and he would rather work that see his fiance at the airport??? I WAITED 3 hours at the airport this summer for him! Flowers in hand and shit! Standing up in a crowd, fighting my anxiety....

But he would rather work?........

But wait... it gets worse..:

Me: So will we be at your parent's or grandma's? 

Him: Idk... ya know, I think we should call it off for the holidays..


Me: .....


Him: it would be better that way.

332,"I wasn't really sure where to post this since I'm sure this wouldn't really fit in casual conversation, but I guess I could also just use some advice.

Basically the title, I feel like everything I'm doing is just for null, and unfortunately it makes me really depressed. For some background I've been a good kid, had good grades, scored well on tests, got into a good college. What makes me sad is that this was 3 years ago, and I feel like I've failed as a student. I'm currently majoring as a computer science student and I failed one of the bottle neck classes. Took it again, failed. Got super frustrated with myself and am now taking the class for hopefully a last time, because if I fail again I think my college drops me, or at least forces me to change majors. However I've only ever seen myself working in computer science, and it's just not clicking, like at all. I thought I could be good at this, I was always good at math and I love the ""puzzle-esque"" thinking on how to solve problems with code. Turns out I might not be good at it at all. I feel like I've wasted my years as a student, since now everyone that I shared a class with two years ago passed it and are closer to graduating. I'm not. If anything I might be a college dropout, which would not sit well with my family.

Besides the student portion, my car is also dead. I was lucky enough to inherit a car from my grandparents, but it became apparent that the car came with many problems. After trying to just make it all better by throwing money at it and taking it to mechanics, it just died on me. So now I realize how much money I've wasted on repairs that could have been spent on a newer car. To help pay for the car and expenses i held a job for a year, but quit that so that I could focus on school and pass my classes without any difficulty or failure. And yet here I am again, almost to finals, with no money in my pocket, no motivation to keep going, not being able to see past my failures. 

I guess the advice I'm asking for is what do I do in my position? I feel like crying all the time cause I'm nowhere near as successful or talented as my brother or sister, and I constantly feel belittled by my father. It's nothing serious, but constantly being told to get a job just reinforced my insecurity that I feel like a useless sack of garbage that feeds off of others for help of any kind. I don't know, I just don't feel like I contribute to society anymore and I don't think much would change if I left. I feel useless since school is all I've ever known and I can't even do that correctly anymore. So, what can i do to be better? I'm not in a healthy mindset to really think of a better question, but I can give more specifics if necessary.

TL;DR - 20 year old college student who has only known school can't seem to do it correctly anymore. Also other setbacks have happened in the same year making me feel worthless. Am I stupid or just being too dramatic about my position?",15Nov2019,1
333,"So, this is kinda a long story, I’m just kinda hoping for some advice I guess? When I was in 10th grade (Sophomore for the Americans if any are reading this) I got incredibly ill with a mental illness. I was hospitalised twice towards the end of the year. I missed my year 10 graduation due to being in hospital. Despite all this I managed to top 3 of my classes for the year. My illness progressively got worse, but I started yr 11 (Junior) at a new school to get a new start. I have been an A student my whole life. Now, my brain functioning was suffering from malnourishment, I couldn’t remember things and would space out a lot. So I started year 11, (toped Advanced Eng for the term) and then landed my ass back in hospital worse then ever. I spent a month in hospital before being sent to a specialised centre, where I spent 5 weeks. I got out, and was still recovering so there was no way I could go to school. I then ended up back in hospital (the 3rd time that year) for 6 weeks. When I got out, I was sick and tired of being told I was stupid and all that fun stuff. Everyone else I knew, all of my friends, my only friends, where stressing about exams and parties and school gossip, while I sat in a hospital bed. Towards the end of last year, I got better, so went back to school, but as I had missed out in so much of yr 11, they put me back into yr 10 for the last few weeks of the year. I knew I had to repeat yr 11, which for me was heartbreaking. My disease had taken so much from me, my friends, my life, and now my dignity. I was always that kid who people said was going to go places, I studied hard, I loved school and learning, I still do. I held myself at such a high standard that my school work had to be perfect. But I couldn’t because my brain and body couldn’t handle it. So, at the start of this year, I started yr 11. Again. I subsequently ended up back in hospital, where I spent 3  1/2 weeks. During this time, I kept up my schooling online, and put my education above my recovery. When I got home, I feel right back into bad habits and couldn’t handle school. Flash forward to now, I’ve cried and grieved and tried to come to terms with the fact that it is likely I won’t ever have the experience and education I dreamed of: I won’t complete my HSC and get an ATAR. My sister is in yr 9, and I help her with her assignments, I also tutor another young girl. I love learning, and helping with my sister’s assignments is so thrilling, but I do not have the physical capability to go to school 5x a week for 6 hrs everyday. My boyfriend is in yr 12, (where I should be) and I have helped him with his assignments and had so much fun, and loved helping him study for his final exams. But now, all of my friends are graduating, celebrating 13 years of schooling. The kids who smoked weed and skipped class and bullied people and hated school, have graduated. And I, someone who loves learning and school, am a high school drop out. I hate myself so much for all of this, for being so jealous of my friends, for hating my body and the fact that I can’t go to school, the fact that I feel like I am incapable of schooling, i feel like my identity has been stripped from me. 

I’m really sorry this is so long. I don’t really now what I’m doing. I guess the gist is, I’m not graduating and I’m jealous and sad and angry at myself. But I want to be happy for my friends, but every time I see them or they mention it it feels like I’m being stabbed.",15Nov2019,1

335,"I'm not really sure what to do in this case. I went to talk to my professor about a separate issue about my current standing in the course. Two things in particular stood out about what happened:

1. He tells me that my voice is monotonous and asks if I have any hearing/auditory issues. 

\-The above is something I've always been hypersensitive about. I have a tendency to speak at a high pitch when I'm stressed and it's something I've been bullied on horribly when I was younger as my classmates would mimic the way I speak. I don't have any auditory issues though....

\-He didn't take the disability I went to discuss during office hours seriously and basically discounted everything I said by saying my grades were high. There is no need to make any accommodations.

There were a few other examples of what happened below:

When attending office hours, he made fun of my name in front of the other students.

 He asks my for my GPA, says it's on the lower end to get into XYZ . (Although I did round down by a bit.) Then decides to try to steer me into another profession by saying another student with a 3.9 in a harder major went that route and it would make me an ""important person"" etc. Basically the prick decided that I wanted to go into a profession for the money and prestige.

337,"TL;DR guy I'm trying to room with flakes after a month of me searching and him not doing anything to help. He wastes my time and I'm not sure if I want to unleash my anger or be passive aggressive or just be chill.


So there's a little more to the story. I was planning on getting an apartment with two guys A and B. 

Now originally B wanted this one apartment but it was too expensive for A and me. Except after he gave up that apartment, he stopped trying to look for more. Red flag 1. I would continuously look for apartments to accommodate everyone and he would find something wrong with all of them. So then I would ask for elaboration or a solution to which he would reply ""uhhh."" I tried to get more feedback from him but he wouldn't respond.

Eventually I gave apartment looking a rest and asked him to try to look too, to which he replied okay and never did. Now the other day, he texted in the chat that he had another friend and that they would possibly live in the first apartment that he wanted but that it was up to A and me. 

I was livid. I had spent my time catering to him and he had the audacity to say ""it's up to y'all.""

Red flag 2.

But finally, yesterday, I gave it a last try with a good newly built apartment that I didn't possibly think anything was wrong with. Alas, the process was the same, ending with ""uhh.""

At that point I pieced together that he didn't want to live with us. And honestly that's not what I'm mad about. I get that he wants to live in a nice place and probably the original apartment he was looking at. I really don't think it's personal (maybe it is but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt). 

Anyways, I immediately moved on and began my search for apartments without him and all is going dandy. 

However the problem is still that I'm mad that he wasted over a month of my time when he most likely knew he wouldn't room with us. I spent so long trying to accommodate for him and waited and waited for responses but never got anything from him. 

And here we are today and he finally broke the ""shocking"" news that he's not rooming with us anymore. 

Obviously I'm not like blindsided but I'm still very angry and feel almost taken advantage of and wasted. I have currently left him on read but I'm not entirely sure how to answer that text. At the moment, reading it just fills me with like white hot fury. Should I respond like angry or passive aggressive or chill.

A note: I am genuinely friendly with him outside of apt searching and we are forced to see each other a lot. However at the moment I'm putting down a friendly facade that I am seriously considering removing.

339,"Around two months ago, I started working at McDonalds (mind that I’m only 18). I just moved here from a completely different state, so I didn’t have many friends. One of the first people I clicked with was someone who I will call Jack, soon enough he wasn’t just an aquatints with me, he was someone I could call a friend. Someone who immediately caught my eye was someone who we will call Jill, Jack’s girlfriend. She also, soon enough, became one of my friends. However, Jack doesn’t always make the right choices... not that he’s not a good person, it ultimately comes down to that Jack drinks and does stupid shit when he drinks. His alcoholism led to him stealing liquor with Jill’s seventeen year old, little brother, which eventually led to the kid getting caught due to him wearing his baseball jersey with his last name on it, while they had no evidence that Jack did anything. This led to only the little brother get in serious trouble and almost got Jack in trouble, which led to more drinking and more stupid decisions. This infuriated Jill, things wasn’t right with them at work anymore. They constantly ignored each other, while I was the only one who was trying to help their relationship. I consistently pleaded on Jack’s behalf and explained Jill’s reasoning to Jack, neither worked. I care about Jack, I really do. But he was in the wrong and cares about drinking more than Jill. Needless to say, Jill ended it. My little brother started working with me, so he’s up there in the front with Jill and her friends. He told me that they said that she should get together with me, she thinks I’m cute, etc. She’s ALWAYS been a touchy person with me, but after they broke up we both knew the feeling was mutual. However, I set my pride aside and told Jack about the situation. I couldn’t hurt him like that, however, he kept giving me mixed signals when I asked. “You can date her if you want”, “I’d rather you date her than some douchebag”, “But I’d respect if you didn’t”, “Go ahead and date her man”, but I know ultimately he doesn’t want me to. But to be honest, I’m alone now more than ever... It’s little-to-never that someone I like actually likes me back, so the situation has left me dazed. Jack fucked up, but Jill is depressed also and needs someone just as much as I do. I just don’t like picking sides, but sometimes I wish I could place my own needs above my basic morals. But DAMN, I want to date this chick so badly it’s not even funny. 

Anyways, any advice? Should I stand by the Bro-Code even when my bro fucked up, even though I literally put my feelings aside to try to help their relationship?

She hasn't been in a relationship for quite some time, but I know she doesn't like me back (anymore) , she just sees me as a friend,but for me, she's like the most important person I know atm...we never went out together and we only interact in school, and when I text her...Any advice would be appreciated",15Nov2019,1
347,"Ok so i have a bit of af situation. 

a couple of weeks ago i had around 6 friends over for some (very small) party type thing in my dads apartment. a couple of days later my dad called me and said that a car had been wrecked with bottles that night and we are being blamed for it. the neighbors say they heard what sounded, not just like a party but something strait out of the movie ""project X"".

They say they witnessed bottles being thrown out of the window that night (we live on the second floor) and some people coming back the day after and cleaning up the ""crime scene"". i have to pay 3,500 danish crowns for this (515 us dollars).

The neighbors also claim that they have video and photo evidence, but won't show this to me. We have said that we will take this to court if we have to because no one was sp drunk that they can't remember what happened that night.

I hope that someone will respond to this, and help me in this situation.

348,"So basically this guy and I have gotten pretty close to the point where we consider each other to be best friends. We always tell each other everything and, naturally, I developed feelings for him. 
Here’s the problem, he recently started dating someone after a friend pushed and pushed for him to. So obviously I kept my feelings on the lockdown and let him be happy. After all, I would rather be a supportive friend than let my feelings take over.
Here’s the other problem though. We’re constantly talking and it’s very common to fall asleep on the phone with each other. Sometimes it’s accidentally since we both get extremely tired, but other times when I want to hang up (because I feel like it isn’t my place to be there) he tells me to stay.
So obviously the feelings are one sided, yeah? Well that’s what I thought for the most part too. 
Until he one day drunk texted me and such and obviously, him being dumbie #1, he said the following:
“I feel like, if I wasn’t so scared of losing you”
“I would’ve tried to pursue something with you.” 
This obviously just messed me up. He deleted it a bit later, probably after realizing he could potentially ruin our friendship, and I pretended like I never saw anything. To this day, he still thinks I saw nothing.
Obviously there’s two sides of me tugging. One that says be patient and wait for him to figure his stuff out. Another one says move on quickly before you actually ruin the friendship. 
Obviously I’m NOT going to do anything or express my feelings since I respect his relationship. I understand the girl liking him, because I like him too. So it’s not her fault and it wouldn’t be fair to her.",15Nov2019,1
349,"I""m looking for some advice on what to do in this situation, any feedback would be appreciated.

Currently at the end of this month I am moving back home with my parents/sibling. It's been decided that I would live downstairs with said sibling and split the cost of the basement suite. Which would be $500 each. She is currently paying $800 by herself so she is getting a drop in rent. It was also offered for me to rent the upstairs bedroom at a cost of $400 but it came with a rule: no having my boyfriend spend the night. The basement suite consists of two bedrooms, a den (which is occupied by her computer) a fairly sizable living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom. This all has the siblings stuff in it. We also have our own shared laundry and a private entrance that will be used by her because my vehicle won't fit in the back driveway. I'll be parking upstairs in the front drive way. I've already been told by her to pack most of my kitchen stuff away and bring only what I absolutely want like a favorite bowl because there is no room in the kitchen. I agreed. We spoke tonight about splitting the grocery bill and I agreed. She also agreed to cook if I did the dishes and kept the kitchen clean, I agreed. I also agreed to pay $100 more to have the bigger bedroom in the basement since her bedroom already occupied the small one, and she and her dog would need to come through my room to go upstairs to see our parents. I also agreed to be putting money into a jar for junk food that we can both use. This is a pretty good deal all the way around, I'm not paying as much rent where I'm currently at, she's getting to pay less rent and my parents are making more money for help on the mortgage. Here's where I'm frustrated.

I'm paying half the rent for this space, and I have one condition. I would like my couch in the living room, or somewhere in the unit. She wants me to put it  in storage, I would prefer not to do that just because it's going to get ruined either by mice, or water or my dad throwing greasy dirty things on top of it and not covering it properly. She is fighting me on this. She has used every excuse she can think of not to have it in the living room. Most that it's going to be in the way of her sewing machine that she uses only once in a while. I've talked to her about moving it slightly in front of my couch, or into the unoccupied dining room and she is refusing, saying it's going to be in the way, it's going to be blocking her sewing machine, it's going to look weird in the living room, it's going to be cluttered etc etc. I understand it's just a couch, but I""m already giving up space in the kitchen so she doesn't have to accommodate my things, and I have just the one room, she has the den and her bedroom, plus the living room because as it stands it seems like I'm paying the same amount of rent for only the bedroom if she won't let me have my one thing in the living room. She is okay; however, with me having a very large black shelf in the same spot I'd like to put the couch. She suggested to me tonight that I even get rid of the couch and that I should buy a new one when I move out. She's also suggested putting her couch in storage and putting mine in it's place since she doesn't like her couch, but I know it's going to be a fight later when she decides she doesn't like my couch. I""d also rather not move it into the unit and then find out she doesn't want it in there and have to move it out anyways. 

I've tried to be civil and reason with her politely but now I'm to the point where I want to tell her, then if I have to put my couch in storage anyways,  I""ll move upstairs, deal with the rule, not have to pay for groceries and help mom once in a and pay $100 less in rent for the same amount of space I'm going to get in the basement and she can go back to paying $800 by herself for the whole unit.

I understand it's just a couch and it's such a petty thing to be mad about it, I just feel like I've accommodated so much already with agreeing to things and she can't bend on one thing because she still views this unit as hers. I haven't moved in yet and we're already disagreeing on things so I'm frustrated. I don't see how I can resolve this without just backing down and giving her something else that she wants and giving in. I'm so tired of just giving in with this person as well she always gets what she wants and always manipulates people into giving her what she wants and I just want to not start off  our new living arrangements by doing that. I figured if I agreed to the other conditions she would give me one thing and she's not.

Thanks for reading.

TLDR; Moving in with family, want my couch in the living room, sibling disagrees despite paying the same amount for rent.",15Nov2019,1
350,"So it's a crazy long story, but I'll just type out the tl:dr because who has the time or emotional energy?

I have a fairly toxic life at home with my siblings. My older sister ('Oldie') rents a flat from the landlord, and my younger sister ('Youngie') moved in before me, and I followed a few months after. I feel like Oldie lied about the amount she pays, and Youngie is in on it, because I'm paying a lot, and never have enough money for other stuff, but they always have plenty, and spend frivolously, despite having less income than I do (or maybe they're lying about that too). 

They made a rule that I can't have any friends over, but theirs are over all the time, including boyfriends. They told me that if I ever tell my parents about the boyfriends staying over from time to time that they'd tell my parents I was using drugs, which isn't totally true, but I smoke occasionally. This is a problem because my parents found some weed when I was a kid and caused major issues in the family. 

They constantly blackmail me, make a mess, leave me to clean it, eat my food, never cook or replace something, leave empty milk cartons in the fridge, etc etc. The list just goes on and on. 

Should I leave? I don't wanna stay, but also don't have any other place to really go to at the moment, and don't wanna move back in with my parents.",15Nov2019,1

Yes i get it he is doing it for early preparations.

355,"Hi.  
It's almost 5 AM and I'm trying to study for a midterm that I couldn't study for the past two days. I've been trying to write emails to find a graduate advisor and I can't even focus long enough to even read their papers. It's like there's this huge pressure on my brain that prevents me from starting things and if I work through that, I can't do it anyway. I have to reread sentences multiple times and it still doesn't stick. The only relief I can get is if I do something mindless that doesn't require a huge attention span. So I spend hours on reddit scrolling or watching stupid videos halfway through until I get bored.   
I have this immense brain fog all the time. I used to have depression so for the longest time I thought these symptoms were related to that, but my depressions gone now man, I've been taking antidepressants and the symptoms are still here. It's affecting my school work. It feels like I'm not living up to my true potential and I know I could be really great if I didn't have this problem.  
People talk to me and I zone out and can't focus. It feels like I have memory loss because I can barely remember anything that happens or anything someone tells me. Maybe I'm overstating, but it feels that way. I ramble on and on and forget my initial purpose of talking. I get irritated by people ""wasting my time"" by talking about things I don't want to talk about at the moment. I've left work multiple times because I felt I had more important, pressing things to do that couldn't wait which wouldn't let me focus on the topic at hand. 
I haven't been to class in fucking weeks because I can't start and finish my assignments on time, so I skip class to do them.
I feel fucking useless. I can't commit to any hobbies, I can't read which I love, I can't do anything except lay in bed and go on my phone.",15Nov2019,1

I’ve been having some internal struggles on deciding how to approach this and if I can make this a reality.
To sum up I currently work full time (38+ hours a week in a management role) and earn a very comfortable living from this. Now this was only meant to be a job to tie me over for a year while I saved money and fast forward a number of years and I’m in the position I’m in.

359,"My mom and i fight a lot, especially lately we have been getting into arguments almost every single day.  

Most of the arguments are about the smallest things. Usually it goes like this, i raise my voice (i have a pretty short temperament) and my mom calls me out and tells me not to raise my voice, i feel like my mom doesn’t understand what i mean or my point, she gets annoyed because the argument goes on and on and starts walking away from the argument (i’m the type of person that wants to resolve it). And usually we just end up annoyed at each other and never resolving the argument. 

But one of the biggest things we fight about is hygiene - yes that sounds really weird but it is a very common theme in our arguments. That’s because i am a bit of a ghermaphone, i don’t really have an issue with it but i have always been big on hygiene and being clean, and my mom does not care about hygiene that much. (Sorry if this is a little TMI) For example, my mom almost never washed her hands after going to the bathroom after peeing, and she almost never washes her hands before cooking (this is a big issue for me, especially because she doesn’t care about hand hygiene, otherwise i would be ok with it) and she just does these little things that really annoys me when it comes to basic hygiene, it’s a lot of stuff like this.  

Yesterday we had a pretty big fight, we were having some family friends over and discovered that one kid had peed on the toilet seat, so my mom cleaned it and i didn’t even know about this incident. When it comes to these types of things i do not trust her, because in my opinion she could just wipe it away with a tissue and think it’s clean (i mean the past bad experiences with hygiene things makes me not trust her) so i asked her “mom did you use a spray on it” and she got really angry and refused to answer my question. I was really confused by the whole situation since i did not mean to offend her, i simply asked. Eventually i just told her the truth, that i don’t trust her when it comes to these things and that is why i asked. She thinks i’m being unappreciative and mean for asking that when she is the one cleaning the house, and i understand where she is coming from but i still don’t understand how it’s wrong of me to ask a simple question like that. Maybe it was wrong of me to tell her the true reason why i asked, but i could not lie when she asked me.  

When i ask her to wash her hands or do things differently she is so stubborn and she refuses to do it. This is such hypocrisy since both my parents literally teached me to wash my hands and be careful with hygiene when i was a kid.  

I think one of our biggest problems is communication, because she seems to think that everything i say is meant to offend her (or she is offended by something) and i get angry because she doesn’t listen to me or understand my point. I also am a bit of a germaphobe and i have ocd tendencies when it comes to hygiene things so it really hurts me when she refuses to listen to me when i ask her to do these little things like washing her hands before cooking food that requires using her hands. Maybe i’m wrong, but i don’t understand how these little things are so hard for her, if she asked me to do it i would just be like “ok” no big deal, but she acts like i ask her to do something hard or something. I only have these issues with my mom, my other family is “normal” when it comes to hygiene and i’ve never even had to think about it with them. 

Fighting like this is so draining, i hate it. I love her despite how much we fight. What do i do? How can we stop fighting so much?",15Nov2019,1

Maybe a month ago or so, my BF gave me a Thrasher blanket that hes had for a few years. I've had it in my room and it's super comfortable and is extremely valuable to me (it's really only worth like $60 but the sentiment makes it priceless). I had a small discussion with my mom when she brought it up and she expressed her disdain for it, but I just shrugged it off because she tends to be dramatic about things. Shes a borderline jesus freak, and she took issue with the imagery on it but shes taken an issue to a lot of the things I like for different reasons and I just block it out. I admittedly havent had the best relationship with her, but over the last few months I've been making an effort to fix that because shes my mom, we're cohabiting and I'm tired of arguing with her about stuff from the past.

So, just for context, I just started working. Like, literally 3 days ago. Since I announced the interview, shes been giddy about my efforts to get my life together and we've been completely fine. 

Last night, I got home beat and I wrapped myself up in my blanket and as I was drifting off to sleep, I overheard her loudly arguing with my stepdad about how I fell asleep in the blanket (which has a pentagram and a goat's head on it, duh. Its Thrasher) and something about Satan and whatever other religious or sacrilegious stuff she goes on about. I ignored it, went to sleep, minded my business. 

I get home today, everything is fine, she smiles and asks me how my day was, I'm just about ready to collapse and they quickly leave to have some fun. I start cleaning my room and discover that - lo and behold, my blanket is not in my bed. I looked through laundry bags (which I know I didnt put in). I tried calling her but she didnt pick up. They told me they'd be getting home at like 5 of 6 am.

I'm extremely upset by this. She came into my room (the lock on my door doesnt work) and basically confiscated something she didnt like as if I was a teenager while I was away at work.

Lately James opened up to us about his family, his drug and alcohol addiction, and his suicidal tendencies. We've been trying to help him for about 3 months now. Trix talked to James about everything, trying to help in many ways, going to his house and talking to him about his problems, picking up a hobby like drawing or photography, but he wont even try it. We recommended him a therapist, and he went, which we thought was progress, until he said that he hated it and never want to go again. 

A few days ago he came to school with a bandage on his forearm, and when we asked about it he said that he cut himself, and that he had more on his shoulders. My problem is that he said it in a...proud(?) way. We knew his tone when he bragged because he always bragged about his money, watches, and other weird stuff.

Today he told us that he went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I asked him about what he was going to do about it, so he said that he gave up and doesn't want to do anything.

Backstory before I get started, I’m a 21 year old male who knows absolutely nothing about what I want to do with my life. 

Okay, so my situation is that I’ve been working in a construction trade apprenticeship for about three months now, I’m due to start traditional schooling for that in the new year. I absolutely love fixing and creating things so I figured that this would be an amazing career path for me. However, I have recently noticed a decline in my physical and mental well-being (from waking up at 4AM every day and not getting home until around 7:30 each night). I’ve thought about quitting this job and getting a part time one while I go back to school (I’ve completed one year at a community college) for IT. Funding school won’t be an issue for me as I’m lucky enough to have had a fund that will more than cover the expenses set up by my grandpa shortly after my birth.

I’ve had a lot of careers in mind ever since high school but for one reason or another never decided to pursue them.

I knew one of the neighbors already, she said the sellers regularly had loud/violent arguments which were uncomfortable to listen to, her dad had gone round there once to check no one was getting hurt. They were an older couple though, and other than this they were always OK with us and never gave us a feeling of concern about buying the place.

We came by to measure for furniture about 3 weeks before exchange, and saw that when moving their furniture out they had caused quite a lot of damage to the stairs which the guy assured us he would fix. On exchange day, we found he had not. We were of course annoyed but didn't make a huge deal of it.

They knew we were not intending to move in for at least a week. 2 days after exchange, I was at the house at 6am as we had an early delivery. My partner went to run some errands, suddenly I see the seller pull up outside. I immediately opened the door, he looked embarrassed and confessed he had come to collect an olive tree they had left in our garden. You can get to our garden from our other neighbor's garden, whom he was friendly with. I was not happy but he was a big guy and I felt a bit uncomfortable just agreed he could take it. 

About 2 months later he text us asking how things were, my partner didn't reply. The neighbor who is friends with the sellers told us they had been asking after the house, and they were coming to see her the following weekend. We made an excuse that we were out. 

Things went quiet, until about 4 months ago we started receiving deliveries for the seller. 4 or 5 over a few weeks, small enough to fit through a letterbox so we couldn't reject them. We didn't open them but kept hold of them. Then, a huge parcel turned up for the seller - we refused to accept this. A couple of weeks later we get a text from him that he had sent some stuff to our house - could we please post it on to him. My partner said we rejected the large parcel, and would give the smaller ones to the neighbor. 

Things went quiet for about 2 months, but then on Monday, about 1am, we received a text from him saying ""If there's one thing I want to say to you.... it's good luck."" 

We have no idea how to take this message, knowing his personality it comes across a bit threatening. We have since changed the locks, however we are not sure if we should threaten/take further action. Whenever we see the neighbor she tells us they have been asking her about the house, what it looks like. We are just fed up - this is our house now and we don't need them involved in our lives!!! Any advice or similar experience would be appreciated.",15Nov2019,1

386,"Hi all, thank you in advance for any helpful suggestions on how to go about this situation.   


So I have a 99 Toyota Camry and the battery was really messed up. It had to be jumpstarted every time with my portable charger but when it was started, all would be fine. I was doing Uber deliveries with it and I would leave it on the whole time while I went in and out of pickups and drop offs. I really didn’t have the funds for another battery and definitely not for the service to get it installed.  


However, it’s getting cold and more than once, my car wouldn’t start even with the jumpstart so I said fuck it, I’ll use my credit card. It needs to be done. I was willing to do this because I saw Autozone installs batteries for free.  

I purchased a battery, had it installed, car turned on no problem, but all electric power was off. No dash lights, no radio, couldn’t get it out of park. I went inside to tell them and that began a 3-4 hour scene if the store manager trying to figure out what happened. He really really tried, but he just couldn’t figure it out. He was looking things up on YouTube, he even called a mechanic to ask him. At first he concluded it was the alternator. But if it was that, the car would have died after being on for some time. So no. The mechanic told him something about a relay fuse. He checked and everything was fine. Anyways, this guy was not a mechanic, obviously, so I really couldn’t expect much. I’m super grateful that he did so much but that doesn’t change the fact that MY CAR DOESN’T WORK. 

He apologized kinda, but he was just like...I dunno. There’s a bigger problem. He offered to talk to customers he knew who owned tow trucks that could help me out and get it to wherever. I just have no idea what to do. My husband and I had been talking for some time about getting rid of it. It’s obviously been having problems. I don’t mind selling it even to a junkyard if they tow, I took everything out as if I won’t see it again. But shouldn’t there be some kind of compensation from Autozone? Like...how can you offer mechanical service and then shrug your shoulders when something like this happens? I’m going to call them today for sure, but is there something you all think I should say or ask for? This is a super tricky situation. 


The car is currently sitting in their parking lot. 


TL;DR: went to autozone for a battery change, car now doesn’t work. What to do?",15Nov2019,1
387,"My sister is getting married earlier next year and I don't know if I should go to the wedding or not (tedious story warning). 

I have never been close with my sister and describe her as an only child with a brother as that's how she has always acted, most of the time if people ask if I have any siblings I say no. In my eyes she is not a nice person at all, she hasn't even met my son properly yet and he is almost a year old, only seen in passing and no interaction with anyone.

We haven't talked in years yet my wife insisted she was invited to our wedding, my sister said she wouldn't come but changed her mind at the last minute. She arrived the venue in time for the ceremony but didn't actually participate and sat in a different part of the venue until the reception. I still haven't spoken to her since and I have just celebrated my second anniversary. 

I heard she had gotten engaged from my cousin's when they were saying they would see me there, the engagement party was organised and hosted by my parents and I wasn't even made aware (the parent situation is a whole other story for another time). We have now received an invite to the wedding (evening invite only, no ceremony) and I have no desire to go at all. This situation is impossible for my mother to cope with as well as for my wife who likes my sister as much as I do but still insists on going for reasons unknown to me.

388,"For example, a close friend A tells you something in confidence that another close friend B of yours has been lying to you about something.

But if what A said is true then I just can't go on in a normal friendship knowing that B is continually lying to me and it's nagging at me. I don't know what to do.



If that was super confusing to follow, then a more general situation is like if a friend tells you a secret and in order to keep it you have to pretend or lie about it but now that you know it you want to act differently.",15Nov2019,1
389,"Would it be wrong if me to quit my job with no advanced notice? 

The backstory is that my father died in late August completely unexpectedly and at that point I had just been promoted into management after working here 6-7ish months. I took a week off work as suggested by the store manager using all my personal and bereavement days. 

When I came back, literally within the first 15 mins of my shift I was told by two separate people in management at two separate times that the store manager mentioned that my father died and implied to them both that I was milking it to get out of work because I had been gone for a week. Saying “hey did you hear ______’s dad died, don’t you think they’re milking it a little I mean they’ve been gone a week.” 

At that point I lost all respect for my store manager but I powered through because I needed the money and honestly I needed something to distract me. Ever since then it’s gotten worse because I just have no respect for anyone there anymore. Everyone else in management is petty, self-centered, wants everyone on the prior shift to do everything for them, and will spend hours doing the dumbest bullshit to run the clock while I’m one of the only ones who actually does anything. 

The other day I was upset as I came in for my shift and helped the prior shift and what did I have left for me? A sink full of dirty dishes. Normally I wouldn’t have been upset but it was a gigantic pile, they hadn’t even been rinsed, dishes had been ran through the dishwasher without being rinsed so I had to rewash the food out of them, and the dishwater was chunky and disgusting. Three management members were there on including the SM and none of them did them. The month prior SM left a giant note about how all dishes are to be done before the shift leaves. I was upset that there’s weren’t done. So I left a note about it. Not petty, not passive aggressive, all I said, and I quote, was “a sink full of dirty dishes isn’t cool :(“ 

I received such a passive aggressive and rude text from the SM the next day about it. SM wasn’t even in the STATE to see this note, somebody else sent her a photo. SM said I was petty and rude and SO passive aggressive for leaving that note and “sometimes things get overlooked” and basically saying we weren’t even busy on my shift so why did it bother me because they pulled our numbers and blah blah it wasn’t nearly as busy as their shift! 

So I shot back and said it was busy. Number wise or not it was busy and I was working with people who were new so I was struggling really hard and the dishes set me back an hour when they could’ve easily been done and they weren’t. I said I was disappointed because 3 people in management were there and not one of them did anything to help my shift. I said I’m sick of people who don’t work my shift claiming that it isn’t busy. I said I’m allowed to be frustrated just like you and I said I will gladly pull out the note from last month where SM said all dishes are to be done before the shift leaves. 

I am incredibly frustrated. SM wants to say we do nothing all day but if we pulled the video cameras we would see the SM do nothing but sit in the office and chain smoke cigarettes, meanwhile I barely even find time to sit down and eat on my shift. SM wants to tell us all the time don’t be petty and gossip but they are the only who does that the most. SM tells me about which coworkers they “fucking hate.” SM played themselves by saying don’t trust anyone in management but I guess they didn’t think I’d take that as don’t trust them. 

Meanwhile SM knows about someone else in management who is stealing from the company and won’t do anything about it because they don’t want to split the overnight shifts if this person gets fired. Oh, but I’m horrible and negative and mean for saying please don’t leave me a pile of dirty dishes. There’s a lot more crookedness to this story, but this is the last straw for me, and I think it says a lot about what SM cares about. 

So, I have another job interview today, and I’m hoping it goes well. If it does, I don’t even want to show up to my shift today at my current job. Would that be wrong of me to do? Just not show up and give no notice, and not go back?",15Nov2019,1
391,"I’m 29F. My mom is actively trying to ruin my life and has been since I was a teenager. She is a covert narcissist and has managed to convince nearly everyone around me that I’m mentally ill (I’m not). When I was a teenager I she would look up symptoms of mental disorders online and then take me to doctors and tell them I had those symptoms. She would tell them that I am manipulative and a liar who is out to get her and when I tried telling the doctor’s my version of events, like how she would beat me, tell me that she hated me, that she regretted having me and that I should kill myself the doctors didn’t believe me because of everything my mom had told them and she had ‘amazing’ reputation. She has an important job at one of the major hospitals in nearby city and she acts like a very kind and compassionate to everyone but her family and therefore nobody suspects her of being a monster. She is a monster. She had doctors put on all sorts of medications that I didn’t need to ‘treat’ my mental illness. Some of the medications I was prescribed as a teen weren’t meant to be prescribed to people under the age of 25 due to them causing problems with reproductive organs and as a result of being forced to take them I won’t ever be able to have children of my own.

Every time I tried to see a new doctor or psychiatrist she would ALWAYS come to the first couple appointments to make sure I “got the story straight” because I was such a liar and would just try to blame her for all my problems instead of addressing the real problem…me. When I came back from my appointments I then had to relay EVERYTHING that was discussed in vivid detail. If I said something about her to the doctor that she didn’t like or agree with she would tell me what to say and make me return the next week and correct myself. My mom was constantly screaming at me, beating me to the point my extremely passive dad had to pull her off of me. I’m pretty sure she cracked a few ribs that day but I wasn’t allowed to go to the hospital. Instead she told people it was a sports injury.

The constant bullying caused my younger siblings to hate me which isolated me in the family home. I was bullied at school because I was gay in a small conservative town and didn’t have any friends and eventually I began to believe I really was the problem. I did EVERYTHING she said to do to try and get better. If she said jump I asked how high. She treated me like a prisoner.  I wasn’t allowed to date, go to parties or have friends over without a month’s prior notice and she would have to meet the friends first to decide if she wanted them in her house or not. Granted I was 22 at this time and when I tried to move out she threw a tantrum, trashed my room, broke all my stuff and said that she has given me everything I have (also not true I worked two jobs since the age of thirteen because she refused to buy me clothes or school supplies) and that I was ungrateful. I didn’t care anymore so I left but I ultimately came back. I don’t know how many times I came home to my stuff in trash bags outside because she was sick of me and wanted me gone. When I would leave she would get my younger siblings to call me and ask me to come back and I always did because I didn’t want my younger siblings having to deal with her craziness.

Eventually I found a good psychologist/psychiatrist who didn’t believe everything my mom had told them and she actually listened to me. She told me my mom had some serious issues and how she treated me wasn’t right. I was taken off my medication but my psychologist said to continue to tell my mom that I was still taking them so I wouldn’t get beaten. As long as I was on my medication she believed everything was better and that I was fine. My psychologist helped me gain the confidence to finally move out and things got infinitely better.

My siblings and my girlfriend all agree my mom is fucking nuts but my sister and I are really the only ones who know how fucking evil she can be. My brothers were raised differently and never experienced ANY of the shit I went through. I definitely got it the worst though and about a year ago I snapped. I told my mom that she was toxic and I needed to distance myself from her. Ever since then she has been running a smear campaign against me to all of my family and friends. She’s telling them I’m not taking my meds anymore (I haven’t been for 5 years but she still thinks I’m on them) and that I’m dangerous when I’m not on them. She lies so much and she twists conversations to suit her narrative and it’s killing me. I have very close and healthy relationships with all my siblings, we’re like a real life version of FRIENDS but they are beginning to crack under all the drama my mom is causing. I haven’t spoken to my mom in nearly a year and yet she keeps telling people I’m saying all of this horrible stuff to her which flat out isn’t true. My maternal grandma with is struggling and begging me to make things right with my mom because it breaks her heart to see my mom so upset. My grandma doesn’t know the truth, she only knows what my mom has told her and I don’t want to upset my grandma by telling her what a piece of shit her daughter is so I just apologize and say I’m doing the best I can.

I don’t know what to do. I’ll never be free from this woman and the thought of having my relationship with my family ruined because of her lies makes me sick to my stomach. If I agree with my mom and go along with whatever she is saying to make peace, then she controls how the people closest to me perceive me and my life becomes a lie. If I stand up for myself and tell everyone the truth then she’ll make everyone else’s life worse including my own with her nasty lies and she’ll probably fake a cancer scare or a heart attack again. She does this when people start catching on to her bullshit to gain sympathy. She uses her ‘poor’ health as ammo to attack me because then I get a bunch of angry phone calls from her friends and relatives saying how I’m a horrible person for putting my mother through all of this stress it’s affecting her health. I honestly just want to end it. I haven’t been suicidal in years but I can’t keep doing this. I can’t spend the next 30 years like this I just want it all to stop I don’t know what to do. I know this is a long post but please, I really don’t know what to do. My girlfriend and psychologist are telling me to cut all ties with my family and live my own life away from everyone. I love my siblings and they haven’t done anything wrong they are the victims of my mom’s lies and manipulation. My brother is about to have a baby and I’m going to be an aunt for the very first time and I’m so excited, I can’t just walk away from that. Please, if anyone has lived through something similar what did you do? How do you cope with knowing those closest to you hate you based on lies? ",15Nov2019,1

398,"Hi guys,
This is going to be a long post, sorry in advance!!
Ineed help. I (19F) have a friend (also 19F) who I’m trying to distance myself from without hurting her feelings. She is still very hurt from being left by her previous best friends, and has been hurting the entire two years we’ve known each other. I think because of this, she has clung onto me as sort of a safety net but constantly talks about how horrible her past best friends were to her and compares me to them every single time we see each other, and bringing up the fact that she will never be vulnerable with me because of what happened to her years ago, but expecting me to put my heart out there for her although she hurts me constantly.

Moreover, I’m not really allowed to share anything about myself because I am constantly being bulldozed over by her problems, and she always mentions that I’m victimizing myself or making things about myself when I try to share anything that’s happening in my life with her. In the past two years I feel that she has only been comfortable around me when I am acting as her baggage dump or validation sponge, and I’ve not been able to share any good or bad things in my life with her in more than a couple sentences. 

She is very anxious and projects all her insecurities onto me when it comes to her self image, social standing, and romantic relationship. Because she is so anxious about all of these things, anything I do in my daily life is something that she feels the need to comment on that I have to change because my behaviors remind her of how uncomfortable she is with some of her own. I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense but around her, I always have to act a certain way that means keeping my mouth shut, doing or buying things for her, making time for her even though I’m a full time student with a full time job because “if I truly cared I would ditch work once in a while to see her.” I’m also expected to drop everything for her all the time, and she will often just show up to my apartment and expect me to give her everything I own and do anything for her without her even asking. In fact, she gets especially offended when I can’t read her mind and offer her what she wants and she has to ask for it.

The times that I have hung out with her she always leaves early and then texts me with a whole paragraph about how inconsiderate I am to her because I don’t pay attention to her problems, and that we only hang out when I need her. I then broke down because I was obviously so tired from life. I’m severely depressed and anxious, but I don’t have enough money to be hospitalized although my therapist keeps pushing it. I also don’t have enough money to continue school next quarter, I can’t just take days off of work because I need to pay rent and buy food since I’ve been estranged from my family as well as continue my education, and I also mentioned that I feel uncomfortable that she is asserting her own narrative of what I’m going through into my life because I haven’t mentioned a lot of my problems to her since she is not willing to listen to me because she feels like she already “gets me” without having to. 

I stopped trying to open up to her because she tells me to do things like sue my family, break up with my boyfriend, and that that’s what she would do in my situation so I don’t really have a right to talk about it more since the solution to my problems is so clear to her, even though she doesn’t even know the situation at all and doesn’t have the perspective because she is from a cushy background. She also said she can’t apologize for calling me a bad friend or inconsiderate or comparing me to her friends who left her because she’s putting herself first and she didn’t know I was so depressed that I almost checked myself into an institution when she confronted me about it multiple times. She also mentioned that she knew she was a terrible friend to me and that it isn’t ok, but that she can’t help the way she reacts so I need to stop bringing it up when she confronts me. She always picks the times when I’m most beat down by life to confront me about these things too, and because I’m often so tired and hungry I don’t have the energy to focus on the argument because I’m so worried about food and rent and tuition, which is one of her points of evidence for why I don’t care about her. 

She keeps asserting that we are best friends and we need to work through it, but my actual best friend and I are very uncomfortable with the way she has wedged herself between us and almost tries to separate us so she can see me more. The same goes for my relationship. She has asserted that she hates my boyfriend because he is socially anxious and frankly doesn’t like her so it’s hard for him to talk to her, but she says that because he isn’t willing to be friends with my “best friend” (her) that I should leave him, even though she is mean to him to his face all the time. I’ve never doubted my relationship so much as when I lived with her last year in the dorms, and only realized it was her influence when I moved out and didn’t feel the pressure to break up with him anymore. 

How do I distance myself from her without hurting her feelings? I know how much it sucks to be anxious but I just don’t think I can take another hit right now. I’m just in a lot of pain already and this is peripheral compared to my literal survival in the world but it hurts a lot to have someone who is supposed to care about you beat you down when you hit rock bottom because you can’t be at their beck and call.",15Nov2019,1
400,"So for awhile I've been down, but these past two weeks have been especially hard.

I'm a college student attending part time with only two classes. One class is math and the other a film class.

Math was going well until I started getting sick of doing math every day and sometimes forgot to do some assignments because of the weird due dates (basically, we were told to do these worksheets but half the time I did them my teacher would skip it, so it became every other worksheet). Slowly I got frustrated and depressed because of other things. One of them being my other class.

Honestly, most of it is fine except for one particular person. This person (I believe) is autistic, and it just  ANGERS me that he's even in a class like this because we basically have to BABY him 24/7.  Sure, he can work the equipment, thankfully, but he talks EVERY. OTHER. SECOND. If we so much as look at him. My crew mates have been good at telling him when he needs to be quiet. Me, on the other hand, not so much. And now I'm at the point where I'm surprised that I haven't just lost it in class with his constant jabbering behind me. Especially since he love to talk to me particularly. I mean. he's a good person, but he loves to talk in the middle of class TO ME, while the teacher is talking. And instead of turning around and saying ""not now"" I just don't make eye contact because I can't be directly mean to people for some reason (even though giving the cold shoulder is just as affective). 

On top of my classes, for the past two weeks I've been sick with a bad cold. At first it was loosing my voice, then coughing all the time, and then a fever, and then getting too warm, then going to the doctor to makes sure I didn't have strep, them saying I didn't but continuing to cough every 2 minutes and have thick mucus running down my throat-**IT'S WONDERFUL.** 

And on TOP of all that, the house I'm living in right now sucks at being warm in winter weather. So that my room is always cold, except for the rare times that it isn't. Which is REALLY HELPFUL when you're sick. And yes, I've gone to where its warmer in the house but then I'll end up with night sweats, or think that I'm fine sleeping in my room in the basement where its cold, only to wake up with cold feet. 

I hate it.

I hate this stupid living situation and I wish I could just go home.

But my parents are going to find out that I'm failing math and I can't tell them that. 

I still have time but I've been missing class for two weeks because (of course) on top of **EVERYTHING** my sleep schedule is messed up because of being sick and my coughing keeping me up at night (which is my fault for being scared to take medicine because I have a fear of meds because of the past). 

Anyways, I don't know what to do. 

I'm stuck in this never-ending loop of sleeping all day and waking up at night and missing class on accident and hating myself for it. 

I just want to go home.",15Nov2019,1
401,"i honestly might just be posting here in boredom but ah well. i’m 17 and just over a week ago now i fractured the back of my skull skateboarding, i was unconscious and taken to hospital for a few days. i was about 2mm away from breaking my spine and had something called a subdural haematoma but it seemed to stop haemorrhaging pretty well after a day or so. i’m home bound 90% and medically exempt from school for the last two weeks before christmas holidays (australia). my head is still a bit swollen and bruised and it’s hard to find a comfortable way to lie down with my head but i’ve noticed now that i can hardly smell anything since the accident and it’s like my ear is permanently blocked but only on the left side. i only noticed the smell thing putting on deodorant because i couldn’t smell any of it even though i accidentally sprayed on my face then tested on a few other things and noticed it’s pretty hard to smell anything at all, and the ear is just an annoying thing i’ve noticed basically since i woke up in the hospital, it’s like a bubble of water muffling every i hear on the left side. i know i should be grateful i’m as alright as i am and i am i’m just curious how long the recovery process is going to take and if these things are something i should mention at my next scan or if my boredom is just making me overanalyse things.

403,"Ok so I have this friend of mine who I've known for about a year now, and well there's something off about her. It started in my first year of high school when she transferred over because there were apparently some problems with a bully in her previous school. I kinda felt bad for her cause even when she transferred to my school she was kinda left to her own devices and generally ignored. So I approached her along with my other best friend and tried to get to know her. As far as I knew of her at school she was a pretty nice girl, harmless. But halfway into the year she started getting suddenly closer, slinging her arm around my shoulder, or sliding it over to my waist and asking what I felt when she did that, randomly during class if I was speaking to another friend she would poke my arm with a compass, or if I didnt tell her i was hanging out with another friend she'd get pissed off and well, other things like that. I'm generally a quiet person and only open up to people I'm comfortable with, so I didnt think this was anything out of the ordinary, since I didnt have much experience. The thing is both of us ended up transferring out of this school to another one along with my other friend. And here she seemed a bit more possessive. Recently for the first time we actually hung out at a mall. She asked me if my mom would also be there and I was a bit put off thinking why would she want my mom to be there? Anyways flash forward we're at the mall just lookin around and for some reason every five minutes she'd take selfies and ask where my mom was. My mom was actually in the mall cause she requested her to be there but I told her she had some work to do and she was getting that done. But she was persistent, and insisted that I call my mom over so that we can all sit together and have a chat. At this point I was thinking dude did you come here to hang out with me or my mom. But we all ended up sitting together and she was rambling on about some batshit crazy topic and taking more pictures of my mom and I together, then all three of us together and even a picture of my mom and her and saying oh our families should meet and we should take trips to other states and at this point I was like ok I'm ready to head home now nice talking with you, all the formalities, but even as we were leaving she would not shut up. She continued to speak and try to keep the conversation going but my mom was finally able to say ok we need to go now and that was that. Weirdest shit that has ever happened to me my brother and well the rest of my family are telling me to stay away from her and that she has some problems, but shes in my current school ( we're both in our second year of high school) and we meet up during recess, and I dont know whether they are overthinking things or are they right.

405,"Hi all, somewhat tame question here but I feel quite strongly about the dynamics at work and the situations. 
I work in a small group of IT that are onsite support, the company works in marketing so has a flexible time - you can get in any time from 6am-10am and you have to stay for 8.5hrs before you can leave, standard. I do a four day week and we take it in rotations so there are always 4 in the office, and one is on his day off for the week day (we all have weekends off).
The rest of us four have been asked by the AMA her if we can stagger the times we get in by 1 hour, which is reasonable so we have at least one member of IT in the building throughout the working hours. I was nominated to be the person who gets in at the latest time of ten.
Now, I know ten is the official latest time - but I often run over, only ever by a minute or two - I have never been more than five minutes late for a day of work. However, this week HR pulled it up and ask my manager to have a word, they threatened a disciplined. I’ve been late to work 3/5 days of this week, by 2mins, 2mins and 3mins. 
I tried to explain the situation to the man who asked me to do this in the first place, and he said why can’t you leave earlier - I explained I would but then I’d leave earlier too, he turns around and goes “why can’t you stay 15mins extra a day for the company?” 
we have zero overtime currently, so I wouldn’t be paid and I don’t buy in to this “good of the company” stuff anyway. 
I told him I would if I get paid and he says not happening and to focus on getting in earlier. 

I’m fine getting in earlier, but I want to prove a point. There needs to be an element of give and take with these things, if I am late I ALWAYS ensure I stay the few minutes extra I was late - furthermore it’s not uncommon for me to be caught in a job at 6:30 and stay late, unpaid while I finish the job. Sometimes for close to an hour. 

This has annoyed me a lot, Am I being wrong or petty in making a conscious effort to leave on exactly the minute I am contracted to leave, no matter the situation? If work can’t excuse me being a minute or two late once or twice a week because I’m trying to ensure we have support the entire day - why should I stick around and help them afterwards when I don’t get paid? I must’ve worked hundreds of free hours over my years here - yet I’m being threatened with a disciplinary because I’m 120 seconds late a couple of days the week. Funnily enough HR have never pulled me up to say “you know you can leave when you’ve done your core hours?”

Sorry for the rant, I just want some advice on how to handle this situation",15Nov2019,1

Clothes and furniture seem to be affected by the smell as well. Fire department said we had hazardous levels of carbon monoxide yesterday but they flushed the unit until it reached allowable levels. 
If it matters, the cause of the fire was the copper wiring in the walls being welded together or something to do with faulty electrical work. Unclear details... We and the affected neighbor are on the first floor. Residents up to the third floor had to have their unit's air flushed.

1) Any kind of scented candles, food cooking, etc. that might help remove the smell?

I am a 5th year Biology major
Asian American
100 completed credits towards degree
1.87 GPA
Have been struggling with some depression
Lost all motivation
3 years - pharm tech at CVS

Now it looks like I am about to be academically dismissed after this semester and have no idea what to do next. I’ve read countless articles online about applying for another university or community college on an academic watch type of deal. Is that a smart/viable option?

My plan c would be enlisting in the US Air Force and go from there. Perhaps finishing up my degree during or after? 

My plan d is moving back home, find a part-time job and try to reapply to my university after a year? 

I am in a very dark time in my life right now and stuck in a rut. My parents do not know yet and scared for when I have to tell them. Any advice or wise words would be more than appreciated.

424,"So I'm not sure how long I'm going to leave this post up because there are way too many identifying details (if anyone from my job comes across this they'll for sure know it's me).

I'm a 25 year old woman who started a job in tech sales about two years ago. Every quarter on the job I've been a ""top performer"" and I think what my company does is really interesting. What's more, the company went public a little while ago and I have stock options that I think might be worth a lot someday. I got promoted a few months ago and am making way more money than I ever expected to be making at this age. I pretty consistently get praise for being smart and good at my job.

But it's also been an absolute nightmare and I've been left in disbelief and tears more times than I can say. Mainly because there are a couple of other sales guys who are very well liked, kind of ""central figures"" at the organization, who decided they absolutely couldn't stand me. They started a number of rumors that I was ""cheating,"" that I'm a terrible person, and that I'm an absolute loser, and they spread that across the entire organization. I'm kind of a shy, slightly anxious person so I have never talked to a lot of the people who have heard about me. While I have a few friends at the org, I'm definitely not miss outgoing and popular.

Back while I was in my first position (before I got promoted), I told my manager about what was going on. But he's a very young, fratty type and it turns out is friends with one of the guys who was giving me a hard time. My manager lied to me about knowing about the false rumors/consistent bashing (eventually he admitted he did know but just didn't do anything about it). He suggested I talk to one of these guys one-on-one to ""clear the air."" I did, and that guy basically called me a loser to my face and laughed while I asked why he was saying the things he was. I ended up telling HR because my manager wasn't helping me and I wanted to know my options (all I really wanted was someone to tell him to stop). It ended up being escalated to the legal team at the company against my wishes and turned into a ""huge deal."" I wasn't trying to get anyone fired - and even if I did get these ""popular"" guys fired, it wouldn't have looked good for me either - and the confidentiality agreement I had with HR was completely violated. I didn't want this to be as big of a deal as it became, and I realized it was a mistake to tell HR.

I stopped the legal investigation because I couldn't handle something so extreme but then tons of other people at the organization found out about it (people I've never really talked to much) but then they ostracized me even when I did start to work and talk with them. I'm basically never invited to coworker hangouts, and get a weird ""vibe"" from a lot of people as well as suggestions they've heard people ""talk shit"" about me."" Again, a lot of people at the company are friendly, good people, but I feel like I'm always on the outskirts despite doing well at my job and being friendly. It's really tiring to really get along with everybody who starts new at the company, and they openly question why I'm not really a part of the general social scene (this is not an experience I'm used to). On top of everything, one of the guys who was spreading rumors is an ex-friend of my current boyfriend.

BOTTOM LINE:

I'm left feeling stuck and confused for multiple reasons. On the one hand, I'm doing well at this job. I also now have a new manager who's awesome and I'm learning a ton from. I like the team I work with on a regular basis. The company I'm at is ""taking off"" and I have stock options that are vesting the longer I stay. I don't want to let my ""haters"" (lol) win by leaving the company. I'm saving a shit ton of money.

On the other hand, it is beyond toxic for there to be working at a place where so many people didn't have my back. I went through a period of extreme depression/anxiety and felt completely alone. I'm still on the ""fringes"" of the company social scene, and don't see that changing for as long as those guys are still around. Even when I feel myself getting happier and doing well, I also feel like there are people rooting for me to fail, for whatever reason.

I wish I knew what the right answer was. I've been sticking it out as long as I can tolerate it.",15Nov2019,1

When we first started to become friends she’d constantly initiate everything and ask me to hangout a lot. But she wasnt much of a texter.

Recently though, about a week ago she’d start texting me more and FaceTiming me a lot for a few days. Then the last few days it seems like she’s turned off or something.

I’ll ask her to hangout and she’ll barely make an effort. For example yesterday I asked when we can hangout next and she said whenever we’re both free again, so I asked when she was free and she said “idk”. And lately when I compliment her or something she’ll just straight up ignore what I say.

We use Snapchat to communicate so she’ll respond but it’ll just be a picture without text sometimes.

She has a bit of a controlling and over protective family so she has problems with them a lot and she really has some of the worst communication skills. But we’ve only been dating two weeks and stuff like this is happening so it’s making me contemplate breaking up already.

Staying up late, leaving my brother alone during the night, crying, asking people for money, becoming depressed and throwing fits after losing. Classic gambling addicts. I eventually moved out. My parents got divorced, sold the house, (because of trust and money issues). My mom actually fought to sell the house and spilt it 4 ways. My brother and I, and my mom and dad. So we all each got a large sum of money. 

Over the years, my mom seemed to show huge signs of improvements in her gambling addiction. So I thought that maybe both my parents were “better” now. Or grew out of it.

429,"I will try to keep this as short and sweet as possible without getting into a novel. Lets see how that go’s.

Mom and myself were living happily in a mobile home in a park, old guy (lets call him tom) moved in next door we become ferinds while I was helping him do stuff, and watching his place for him while he traveled south to AZ for the winter. He brought up the ideal of buying something like a house and land with a shop etc, a few times over the summer. For all of us to live on so I can help him out etc. All of us hated the mobile home park and wanted to leave but where making it work. So a large snow storm came dumped 3-4 feet of snow at once and partially collapsed the roof to the mobile home we (my mom and I) were living in. Tom agreed it was time to buy something and did so when he got back up in the spring. Tom is very kind and very wealthy, he paid 190K cash for the house and shop on 1/2 ace lot in town, close to his brother. He has also helped us out of a number of pickles, like I said tom is very kind guy.

Tom is a nomad of 30 plus years, and wanted us to live in the house. While he happily stays out in the shop with his travel trailer. During all of this moving and transition, he made it pretty clear that he wants me to end up with this house after his passing. That leads us right into problem number 1. We all have been living this way for 6 plus months and now it seems unlikely I will end up with the house.(frankly I did not honestly think I would, shit don’t happen to me like that). All along he was clear as day, this was set me up for my life etc. Come to find out he was in charge of his family estate and spent some of they're money to buy this house. Now I can’t even get him to sign a simple lease without talking to his brother and sister. But he don’t want to because he spent their money he says he can pay it back but has not as of yet. So that leaves me and my mom hanging here with no security should he decide to get rid of us or something happen to him. I told him over and over again I don’t care about the house or the money from it, I just want that security, sign something or set something up that says you can’t kick us out at random ( a lease) or if something happens to you I can stay here as long as I wish then it go’s to your estate, he still agrees with everything and still says he wants me to have the house but won’t do anything to prove it.

2nd problem is, Tom is very eccentric to say the least, and very very cheap, he comes into the house three to four times a day to use the bathroom including one at like 2am every night. My mom can’t stand that, feels like a stranger to her (he is really) creeping around the house at night. (the house only has one bathroom and he spends 45mins to 2 hours in there at night.) Often we have to wait. He has me doing the most bizarre shit all the time, totally weird crap he is so hell bent on saving a penny he will spend three hours to do so, he frankly drives me nuts, and I want to scream, he comes around and both of us or like oh shit what is it now. Her and I can’t rest we are both on edge all the time, he comes in anytime of the day wanting something done or help with something and no not normal stuff, something I totally would love to help him with.

I know you must be thinking, just setup a 2nd bathroom out in his shop, well that would require him to spend some money, he won’t do that. He won’t use the bathroom in his nice 2006 travel trailer and instead go’s in a plastic bag and pine shavings, when he can’t make it in the house. Just one ridulouses thing after the next with him. Oh and I can’t touch anything inside the house, he will come in and start picking on an ink stain in the bottom of one of the kitchen drawers, and make a huge fuss about it (left over from the past owner) but the kitchen counters are worn cracked and look like crap, that I will pay for and fix myself. Anything I want to do, and I will even pay for is totally out of the question. I can’t change light fixtures etc. But he does all kinds of changes to his shop major projects, of course I am the one doing all of the work but he was kind enough to help us buy 10K worth to furnish it. And yes he is happy with the work I do on his stuff. Also I am giving him 300 a month for half the bills on the place. 

We feel trapped and stressed 24/7, we don’t have any other place to go, but we do have a 40ft school bus conversion I built that we already know we can live in, and access to a small amount of money 7500-10K. My mom is not in good health herself and bus life would be hard. 

I don’t know what to do, are we the problem here or how would you guys feel about this or handle it.",15Nov2019,1

431,"My wife and I are having a slightly trivial crisis. We decided on a name for our child (not born yet) that we're really happy with months ago but just discovered that my cousin has a kid with the same name. We don't see this cousin much (self evident in the fact that I didn't know the name of their child), probably once every few years at the most, but our parents are obviously still close, and everyone has stays in touch and here's each others news, so would it be really weird if we give our kid the same name?",15Nov2019,1
432,"Not sure if I've phrased this right in the title but, my issue is that lately I've noticed this feeling that i really don't have anyone i could call a friend and its been like that for the last 5 or so years and i don't think i know how to make new ones.

&amp;#x200B;

To give some background, when i was younger i was in a similar situation from around 10 to 15 years old, struggled to talk to people and make connections and overall had to keep to myself. Then around 16 that seemed to changed and people were interested in what i had to say and all of a sudden, i was branching out everywhere and making new connections everyday, and they felt solid as far as i remember, ranging from general hangouts to full blown party's almost every weekend. The people i was hanging out with just always stuck together and from what i know, most of them still do in some way or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, i had gotten married, had a little one and have all the other usual adult things; job, house etc, but outside of these things I've just mentioned i don't talk to any of these people on any basis really anymore. the few times i see someone from those days, say at the shops or another public place, they either make an active effort to avoid contact with me or if we do talk, it will last maybe 2 minutes and that's the end of it and i just can't figure out why. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought on this a bit and i can think of a few factors it could be. One could be they were never really interested in talking to me in the first place and i was just that awkward 3rd wheel kid that was just always there but no one knew why.

Another could be that they have just moved on in life and i'm just over thinking this.

But a big one that stands out as a possibility is that due to getting married and focusing my time on her and supporting our lives together, i neglected people to much and now i don't know how to talk to people properly. one incident that strengthens this idea is one person i used to talk to actually in boxed me out of the blue after 4 years without a word to each other to ask a question, i answered them but decided to ask a little into it to see what it was all about. i got a couple of responses and thought it was going well, then didn't hear anything for a day or so and that's when i checked there profile...they had unfriended me....and damn if that didn't hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing reminds me of a line from Wreck it Ralph, i think it goes like this "" *One day you're gonna wake up and realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you...and that is the loneliest feeling...."".* i know of course i have my wife and little one and i love them both with all i am but i wouldn't have thought it would cost my whole social life.

433,"There aren’t going to be any gory details here, but still - if you’re triggered by these things (domestic violence and rape) please don’t read any further. 

I was in a severely abusive relationship in 2015. I was 20. 

We had a house party one night, and including myself and my ex boyfriend there were 6 of us. 

Something happened that night and he started smashing my kitchen up while I was sat on my stairs talking to my sister on the phone. He kicked everyone out. All of a sudden, he came out of the kitchen and dragged me up the stairs, threw me into my room and smashed everything that was in the room over my head. A 5ft mirror, a bookshelf, a printer. My bed actually snapped in half from the weight of everything he threw at me. 

All I remember is having a full bottle of lemonade being tipped over me and then I began vomiting a black tar like substance. My head was throbbing and I was losing consciousness. 

The next thing I remember, I was fully clothed in a freezing cold shower. 

After that, I woke up momentarily downstairs on the cold floor in nothing but a towel and two other men sat with my ex. 

I blacked out again and woke up alone. Understandably sore and confused. 

I let it go after that. 

I found out last night, that at least one of those other men and my ex raped me. The person has refused to support me in reporting it to the police. I have no recollection of the rape. I have no evidence at all. 

Just to add, my ex was arrested for domestic violence and I was granted a 3 year restraining order. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since the end of the relationship. 

I just don’t know what to do. There is no point in me reporting it. It’s not like I have any details about it, I cant say what happened that night. 

The police were aware of the physical assault that took place a few months after when I finally reported my ex for other counts of abuse. 

I always had a deeply dreadful feeling that something worse happened that night. Now I know it did and there is nothing I can do about it. 

I’m so lost here.",15Nov2019,1
434,"So, a little context... 

TL;DR at the bottom

I just graduated with a business degree. I got a job at a very small nonprofit about 6 months ago. At my 90 review, everything was great. I was constantly prised, I had plenty of work to do. I was fitting in (There are 2 other employees at this organization). They hired me knowing I had no experience in Nonprofits.  After the 90 review, everything went to shit. It was like they decided my ""learning curve"" was over and I should know how to do everything. Obviously I don't. I got 1, 1 hr ""training"" session with my boss about the business which was basically asking me questions and I guessed the answer then she told me to go read these things. One of which was an instruction manual. (How come it took 4 months to show me the fucking instruction manual?!  Like that's week 1 shit!) Anyways, one super minor thing happened at work and she really insulted me, in a very non-contructive way, and took all of my projects and duties away from me. For the past 2 months, I literally do nothing all day, every day. For example, I've sent one email this week and took one phone message and the rest of the time, I just browse Reddit and watch YouTube. I constantly ask if I can help, if there's anything they need, if I can I do anything and its always ""no."" This afternoon is my 6 month review. ( I think she made it up yesterday b/c it was never mentioned or written anywhere before.) 

I just don't know how I should act. I want to keep this job, I really enjoyed it in the beginning, but I want to actually work. I'm so bored and I don't know my place here. I don't know why they hired me and I feel useless. I dread coming into work every day. My firey side wants to just tell her all this shit she could do better for me, as a manager. The self-preservation side wants to be so fake and be self-deprecating and apologetic to anything she says just so I can keep this job. My self-respect wants me to just not take her shit. 

TL;DR: I need advice on how I could talk to my boss about being frustrated with her and work without being disrespectful.",15Nov2019,1

437,"I will try and keep it short. 

I grew up in Haiti and eft when I was 17 because of the earthquake in 2010. I came to the us and finished high school, graduated college, moved out in my own and worked for one the biggest tech companies worldwide. Leaving my partner behind and starting a long distance relationship. 

A year ago, I was enchanted by the idea of going back to Haiti and running my mom’s business—or at least helping her do so. I took the opportunity and went back down there and lend her a hand. In a little over a year, I was able to increase the company’s revenue and establish new processes and offer new services. 

In the meantime, my partner moved down to Florida so we can be closer as it is only an hour away. Also, in a year the political and economic situation in the country got worse. There are protests for weeks at a time, schools have been closed for 4 months now, the protestors burn down businesses, ransom individuals and often shoot at passing vehicles. 

The truth is that I am very unhappy there. I don’t have friends. The only ones that I do spend their days smoking weed and honestly don’t do much with their lives. I live with my parents and I get 0 privacy. My mom is extremely controlling and it’s extremely hard to work with her; I have to say that it’s more of a pain than a pleasure to work with her. As for my dad, he’s always been very controlling, demanding and extremely difficult to live with. Not to mention having to be in the middle when they are having their marital quarrels. 

I also don’t get paid on time. My mom just thinks she can give me money whenever she feels like it. And even after putting structures in place with the business, things never really work out with my mother as she’s had the business for over 30 years and is very reluctant to putting in new procedures. She also manages the finances of the company like a madman and it’s honestly very sad to see. Point is: it’s more of a pain to work with her then not. 

Needless to say, aside from working, I don’t have a social life. Even when I do go out, my mom is calling me incessantly as she is worried about the insecurity in the country. All I do is work, go home around 4-5 and stay in bed watching Netflix. I’ll occasionally work out and keep myself busy with my dogs but my depression is deep and I had to seek a therapist who has been incredibly helpful. 

Also there’s also the insalubrity, the poverty and everything else that can get someone very depressed being in such an environment. 

This past month, we were all stuck at home for 5 weeks as there were countless protests anti-corruption and I just couldn’t stand it so I left. I am currently with my partner and I am waiting for things to get better. The thing is... I don’t believe it will get better. It could be “calm” for a week and the next week it will be back to the same old. 

In my heart of hearts, I don’t want to go back. Not only because of everything I stated above but also my partner being here and I don’t want to back to a long distance relationship because I love her and I want to build a life here with her. She visited Haiti and she doesn’t see herself living here either for various reasons. She also sees how unhappy I am down there and it saddens her. 

Another part of me says that maybe I should find the courage and go back down there. I can’t leave something that I started etc. But if I go back, I will be back to being absolutely miserable and lonely. 

My parents are carribean and depression is not part of our culture so I can’t say that to my parents. I don’t want to hurt my mother by telling her I don’t want to go back because I know that she needs me in a lot of ways. But then again, she was doing it just fine before I got down there... 

Idk. I guess I’m just asking for some thoughts on this because I am much happier here in the states and I can actually have a future here. But then again, I don’t want to have the feeling that I gave up or left my parents down (and my dogs)",15Nov2019,1

443,"Okay so my husband and I have been together for 11 years, married 6 years. We have 2 boys together, 3&amp;9. And we currently stay with my parents. We’ve lived here for way too long...around 4 years. We both struggled with addiction for a while, but we’ve also both been sober the same length of time. We moved in here because we were struggling financially and my parents health wasn’t the best so we moved in to help. During this time we were also planning to file for bankruptcy to try to get our credit right. In hopes of buying a house in the next couple years. I’m a stay at home mom right now and this was a mutual agreement. He actually gets angry if I mention working. He thinks HE has to be the provider. 


He works for himself as a contractor, but the past couple years him and his dad have worked together. His dad’s health has gone downhill big time as he’s had knee replacements and also struggles with fluid in his legs causing them to literally burst open. Their job is pretty physically demanding as they are drywall contractors. My husband has the potential to make a lot of money in this field, but HIS DAD. His dad is just a special kind of person. Lol. It takes a lot to try to even like him. He’s perverted when he talks about women. Even me. And he thinks the world owes him everything. For example,  being stuck in traffic is like God saying a big F U to him. Everything revolves around him. He has 8 kids and relies on my husband for almost everything. It’s caused a lot of issues in our relationship in the past, but I’ve tried really hard to let stuff go and everything. 


But this is just eating me up. We live with my parents, right? So it’s not like we have money falling out of our ears. But my husband seems to think so. They will split jobs evenly, or my husband may get 50-100 more. His dad sits down every 5 minutes to take a break. He’s just not able to do the work like he used to. Not even near. But he thinks he has to work and my husband thinks it’s his responsibility to make sure he has work and take care of him. I can’t even tell you how many times my husband has been short on his daily pay because his dad needed to work too or because his dad bid a job too low. It pisses me off. Infuriated me really. I’m all for taking care of our parents if we’re able to. Hell, his mom lives off disability and has hardly any money for groceries, but yet he’s not making sure she has money every week. I dk, I’m just extremely frustrated. 


In my mind, I’m thinking we will never get ahead like this. Doing just enough or making just enough. I feel like I’m stuck in this spot and there’s nothing I can do. I’ve talked to my husband about my feelings. He thinks I’m ridiculous and just “don’t get it.” I’ve dealt with this for two years now and I honestly don’t know how much longer I can put up with it. I’m sure I sound awful. Or selfish. But I’m just trying to put my family and their needs  first. Not his dad. 


I also forgot to mention that his dad and his pillhead gf live together. She also collects disability &amp; money from the govt. He does, too. But yet he’s making at least 1000 a week with my husband. I am just not sure how to handle this anymore. It’s causing so many arguments almost daily.

446,"Hey all, 

So I was over my best friend’s place last night to have a good time. Unfortunately, things got pretty heated when he started to mention topics regarding politics and religion. To give a little bit of context, my friend has views that are far to the right whereas I’m more left of center. I also am a religious person but I am much more liberal in my Christian theology. He is much more conservative. 

I have known my friend for almost my entire life. He has been there for me countless times. We went to the same school and college together. However, I feel as if our polarizing views have put a dent in our friendship, and that we aren’t as close anymore since graduating together. I try to avoid taking about these issues as much as I can, but my friend keeps bringing it up in a confrontational manner. If I don’t speak out on a topic he brings up, he accuses me of not being on his side or being evasive. The heart of the matter is just that I either don’t feel like arguing or I’m afraid that what I say I believe in will get me in trouble with him. Sometimes I do have to lie to avoid him getting upset at what I believe in. 

Last night, I finally had to speak out for the first time. I told him that I was tired of him arguing and bringing these issues up. I basically told him that every time he gets angry and brings up these topics that it damages our friendship. He keeps telling me he “always wants to be my friend” yet I feel as if I’m treated like I’m the enemy. He responded by saying that he doesn’t view me as the enemy, but that I simply don’t have the right perspective. 

Honestly, I’m just seeking advice for what you would do if you were in this situation. I want to know if I handled it properly and if I did anything wrong.",15Nov2019,1
447,"For the last few years I've had this friend..if you even want to call him that.. Let's call him G. 

G is someone ive known since a kid. We've hung around the same circle and we've definitely had good times. Although G doesnt seem to take no for an answer and would either get mad, cause a problem or just full out try making me feel guilty if I wasnt available. EVEN when he got his own place and ended up in a relationship living with his gf. He still bothered me and would try to control things. He would say hes going away for the weekend with his gf to visit her family and than the weekend would come and I already would have plans with other people that I preferred being around. He would message me and say he didnt go and than get mad if I wasnt available and just blow up my phone and manipulate me into hanging out. Fast forward and his gf ended up leaving him probably because of the way he is. I was supportive and there for him. Me and him started hanging out a lot last year and he moved into an apartment probably 2 cities away. I dont have a license so sometimes I would take public transit to there which usually took almost 2 hours. He would constantly complain cause issues and ask where I was and how it shouldn't take that long. I couldn't take it anymore. I started focusing on myself. Going back to school. Looking for a job. He didnt like that. He wanted me to just smoke weed with him and always be available. 

It got so bad that from may - july he would literally try to get me to go to his apartment and town every single day. I wasnt able to do anything or spend time with my family or get things done. He would just want me there to do the same things - smoke weed, go to Burger King, walk around his city, call the shots and then just pass out. I'd be taking a bus pretty much every night for 2 hours and it was physically and mentally wearing me down. I think I did it because I was lonely or scared of the confrontation. 

He basically would ask to hang out and if I said hey man I dont have any change for the bus. He would get mad and say Bro it literally costs me 10 dollars to come pick you up. If getting a little bit of change is a problem I'm not gonna call you like that anymore. Getting change wasnt the problem. I just didnt wanna be around him like that anymore. He would even ask to hang out and not mention going to his city. I'd get in the car and he would Immediately go on the highway and I'd be like ""I dont have a way back. I didnt know we were going"" and he would say how hes going to a family members at 10 pm so he can drive me back. Mind you at this time it's like 1 pm so he just expects me to spend the whole day with him and do what he wants. 

Then in july I ended up getting a job offer that I was unbelievably happy for. I knew my life would change for the better but I only started out as part time with the company and would fill in or pick up any extra open shifts through out the week. 

I began working and feeling good. On my off days he would try to hang out and I was more open and willing to give things another chance but It was the same old shit with him. I began picking up extra shifts and working my way up within the company. He didn't like that. I told the head manager I was available all week so when the supervisor called me and asked me to come in. I immediately took the shift. I told him I had to work and he said Lol you're not on call bro i knew you werent gonna hang out this company is just gonna use you from now on. 

Or if we were in his city we'd go to the mall. If I asked to go one random day he wouldnt go lol but then the next day if I said I was busy.. he would be like ""I thought you wanted to go to the mall"".

At this point I'm frustrated and done with him. He ended up losing his apartment and job. On the last day he had the apartment he blew up my phone and tried getting me to come there and spend the whole day with him. He even offered to drive me back lol once he saw I wasnt responding. I didnt go. 

He moved back to my city and would basically just try hanging out every weekend BUT it was still the same shit. Controlling what we do where we eat where we go. It was fucked up. Our group of friends literally couldnt even handle it anymore and we always talked about how it was too much with him whenever he left. 

I've been living my life and working full time now and in a really good place. Happy I dont have to see him everyday but here's the weird thing now. He sells weed to make ends meet. He doesnt say a word to me at all throughout the week. Nothing. Not a hey man hows it going any plans this weekend.. nothing.. 

But on saturday at 1 pm ever since I started this job he says ""what's up"" and feels like I'm obligated to hang out and smoke weed with him. He does it on sunday. The last month or so I did hang out a few times and regretted it every time. He acts all nice before you see him but then when you're with him it's the same controlling toxic manipulative shit. My final straw was 2 weeks ago when he kept mumbling under his breath that he had to make a few drug deals.

I'm pretty sure he just wants me in his car so nothing bad happens. I'm fucking done. So we were in a plaza parking lot and he said he was hungry and gonna get food. I said yeah I'm hungry too but nothing in here is really that great I dont want McDonalds or subway I had it this week cause it's right near my work. He doesnt say anythin and goes into subway. I say yeah.. I'm just not gonna eat... he goes into his car and proceeds to eat subway in front of my face making smacking sounds and saying how good it is. I was pissed off and didnt say a word to him after that because he didnt even offer to stop at another place for him otw back to his place. 

He was asking me If i was good or it something was wrong because it was evident i was pissed. We get back to his place and he says how he has to make another deal. I tell him yeah I'm out dude and just left. The following week he does it again with the what's up at 1 pm on Saturday. I just said I was at work. He didnt respond then sunday he did It again. I just blocked him and didnt say anything. 

I need some advice on what to do. Should I keep him blocked or should I tell him I'm not available like that anymore.

So yeah my phone goes off and I quickly turn it off. 

Most turn around and look at me alluding to who’s phone it was that went off. The teacher asks why my phone spontaneously went off and how do you explain that you were listening to music (clearly going against what she said) and not cheating? I’m lost for words and I’m in fear that she’ll invalidate my test (not a state test btw) I mean I got probably like 2 questions wrong and I speed through it.

457,"My brother in law (12, high functioning autism) was diddled by his uncle (22, mental issues, violent, incel). Brother in law’s mother could care less it seems, when he told her about it he said it had been a year since the second occurrence, so she blew it off. Her reasoning was that no one should bother with it since it happened “so long ago”, but that’s not how crime works. My GF told her school counselor about all this and the counselor was obligated to call the police, she offered for her mother to do it first but she lied and said she called them when she never did, then she called the counselor and told her it was taken care of and not to worry about it, which was not a clever move.

Fast forward, last week brother in law’s parents (divorced) got interviews from CPS, then yesterday brother in law got a forensic test.

Uncle and brother in law are both mentally around the same age and they’re neighbors, so they’ve always hung out. Recently at a family gathering, Uncle was invited and sat alone with Brother in law. I was there and tried to separate them (calmly) but uncle’s mother asked the two boys to sit together with her instead, she knows full well what has happened and she doesn’t care. 

Now to my question, I’m afraid of how slow this whole thing is going, no one is in a hurry to get Uncle locked up or in a mental facility, or if they are they aren’t speaking up. Can I do anything more than just wait patiently?

458,"So there’s this creepy guy on campus (let’s call him Kyle) whose had a few *experiences* with girls on campus. Basically he’s very transphobic, very sexist, very incompetent with work (our major is 100% group work), and has some serious boundary issues. I’ve never personally had an experience I’d label as harassment with him but he’s definitely given me some weird vibes and it’s not a stretch to assume by any means. 

The transphobic thing I did witness but it involved someone else. That person left the school for other reasons.

I found out a few days ago that another student (let’s call her Reese) was compiling a list of things that Kyle has done with other girls and male witnesses on campus, because when Reese lodged a complaint to our department head, he contacted the dean of students, and now Reese is on a mission to compile instances to get Kyle’s behavior addressed. 

I knew that someone was searching, but I didn’t know it was Reese until last night when a friend mentioned how much Kyle sucked and that was brought up. So last night I contacted Reese to tell her about the transphobic incident and the other times I caught a weird vibe from him. 

Cut to this morning. Thank God I don’t have any classes today, but I have a text from Kyle that just says “Hey broskymchoesky, it’s Kyle. Mind if I ask you a question?” I have no classes with Kyle this semester, and he’s never texted me, so this is very much going to be about this situation. 

So reddit, I ask you this.

throwaway account because i’m paranoid. 

so something really embarrassing happened to me yesterday. i got pulled aside by my manager, who told someone had complained of my “smell”.

i suffer cystic acne and am on several medications for it. i wear clean dry clothes every day. i shower every day. my hair is always clean and i douse myself in deodorant (perhaps this is the smell they’re complaining off?). because of my acne i believe people have preconceived notions of how clean i am. 

i work in an office full of annoying middle aged white people. especially women. who think they’re gods gift to the earth. there’s an old woman who literally smells like must and i sneeze every time i’m near her. there’s tens of people who sit around our office block who could smell, i feel however they’ve chosen me to be the scapegoat because of my skin. 

am i in the wrong here? i’m very conscious about being clean as the slightest dirt/dirty clothes/etc on my skin can aggravate my acne even further. i’ve never been told i smell before. is this a management issue? a hr issue? i feel awful now and cannot concentrate. i wore a leather jacket into work today with no padding so that it smells of nothing and can contain whatever smell is on my body but now i’m freezing because it’s winter. what do i do??

Someone I know (my relationship with I shall not disclose) let's call them Jessica, has been in an abusive situation that I am aware of, at the hands of her mother, for well over 10 years (I've only known her for 3). Her father, who is unofficially divorced from her mother is also subject to such abuse. They are financially abused, emotionally abused, gaslit, love bombed and then broken down, mentally abused and many times physically abused. Recently there was an occasion which left Jessica's father badly hurt and Jessica distraught, her mother just decided that she didn't like the way Jess (who is 19) was acting for herself and put her down, when her father spoke up he was hit repeatedly until he could hold her down and they left. He has never physically attacked the mother nor has he attacked his daughter. This is not the first time this kind of thing has occurred and I doubt it will be the last. Jessica does not want any action because in her own words ""I would rather be known as the abused daughter than the daughter of no mother"". I believe this is a gaslit stigma that her mother has put on her (like many many others)

And I have no way to convince her that the already unstable person she is could die because of this. That she needs to get out (this situation has led to multiple instances of harm and suicidal thoughts before but they have been brushed off. She has asked me to respect her view of keeping her mother in her life and I understand that is what she wants, but there are obvious indications that if left unchecked this could lead to someone's death. 

It has gotten to the point where I have been able to predict within a 2 or so day confidence interval when something will happen and how serious it will be. 

On top of all this, my father is a police officer and is aware of the situation and is respecting their view to not act. But he never saw it happen so he had no burden to act as it was not his own knowledge. But he saw the damage done by the last attack and legally if he does nothing he is liable to be suspended or worse. 

There is also the chance that someone retaliates (the father) and hits back. In that case the court system without having any prior records of these events will likely side with a woman claiming abuse (not sexist it's just a sad fact for male assault victims in domestic abuse) and so without putting anything in now we could be ultimately leading the father into a position where he is charged for a crime he didn't commit and the abuser goes free. With Jessica. 


The abuse is so much deeper than this and gets so much worse the more you know and I would dare say extends into territory that is borderline sexual assault of a minor. 

Yet, Jessica does not wish to do anything and doesn't realise it but actually takes it out on me instead of her mother. She has often made me so afraid for her safety that I have thrown up our of fear. I also know that her mental health is fragile and I'm 99% confident that she is an undiagnosed autistic (multiple family members including my brother have autism so I am accustomed to the signs). She is becoming increasingly unstable and at times has been obviously suicidal and depressed. 

I want to respect Jessica's decision so badly. I do. But. The severity of recent activity and the fact that her mother is so clearly aware of her actions that she waits until people are gone before abusing tells me everything I need to know. They have said she will get better. She's only gotten worse. They said she can't be alone. But letting Jessica die is not worth the risk. They said that it's okay and there's nothing to worry about. He's covered on bruises and she rocks in the corner crying. 

I know all of this and yet I've done nothing for so long out of respect for Jessica's relationship to me. But I care for Jessica too much to let our relationship get in the way me attempting to save her life. I would rather never see her again and she be alive and well than to have her die knowing me and me being able to stop it.

I think I'm going to take all the evidence I have and go to the police. My father is already compiling a 'quiet report' in case we don't do that so there's something on record about the abuse but we don't take it further, so if the time comes that there is retaliation from her father then it will have a backing to support the fact that she was abusive and it was self defence.

Am I doing the right thing. I feel like I did the wrong thing many times and I've had 000 ready to call for so many nights. I've rocked and cried and thrown up out of fear for her and she's suffered worse. But her request to let it happen and my value of our relationship was put before her safety. The things I would do to me 2 and a half years ago when we got close. When I found out more. Why I didn't stop it there. This is my fault. I knew about it. I let this happen.

So I have to make ammends and to do that I have to take what I have to the police. Not for myself but to save Jessica.

However she also became a vegetarian (i think it’s great) a few years ago. For the past 2 years i have been really worried about her.  

She eats really bad food and she doesn’t eat enough and she is really skinny, sometimes to the point where she looks underweight. Obviously i don’t know about every little thing she eats, but she only eats 2 hard sandwiches (not sure what it’s called in english) and tea for dinner most days. The sandwiches she eats is a thin hard bread with usually cheese, which is very little calories. Then she also usually eats very small lunches, she eats salad or soup a lot, or she just drinks a smoothie for lunch. I have tried to tell her in the past that it’s not good to eat so little and that she needs to eat a proper meal, and that she needs to eat more, but she gets really upset when i bring it up. I’m not a vegetarian but i know that when you are a vegetarian you need to eat more food with protein and calories since you’re not getting that from meat. Maybe this isn’t a big deal and i’m overreacting, but i really think that her eating habits are bad. She also works out a lot which is also the issue with her eating so little. She works out at least 5-7 times a week and she usually walks 8km (we live next to a forest with a powerwalk track) and then she comes home and works out on our workout machine.  

She has a lot of issues with her back and has had to go to the doctor many times, and everytime her back is hurting i tell her to just skip the workout that day but she still keeps going, which i don’t think is good for her back.   

Sometimes she looks really thin, and i get really worried because she looks underweight sometimes. She has always been skinny but never as skinny as she has been for the past 3 years and it worries me.  

With her sleep problems, back pain, not eating enough and perhaps working out to much (too much for the amount she is eating and how much energy she has) i really worry about her.  

Am i just overreacting?. She has had anorexia in the past and it seems like lately food has been a problem for her. One time she said to me “i need to go up a few pounds” and that same day when we were grocery shopping she was looking at low calorie products.

I don't know what to do, but I don't feel like I can't look the other way here.

Dad (72m), his had periods in his life in which he accumulates a lot of dogs, specifically Chihuahuas. Right now he had 18 of them and he often claims they ""accidentally"" get pregnant, making him have to sell the litters. 

The sad part is he has 12 female dogs in a chain link enclosure that is about 6' x 6'. The dogs have warm houses to go into, but they often have to live in their own filth. The smell of their urine and feces makes me want to gag and even though he often picks up the poops, the smell of urine is strong enough to burn nostrils. 

The male dogs are allowed to roam his 10 acre farm.

All of the dogs are healthy, well-fed, but they never see the vet and none of them ever get spayed or neutered. 

I've always been an advocate for mistreated animals and I feel I'm betraying myself by pretending this isn't happening. 

Mom and dad fight almost every single day about these dogs, buy he refuses to do anything about it and says it's his farm and he can do whatever he wants with it.

I strongly feel he has a mental condition because they have a warehouse full of housewares they often sell at a swap meet. They buy way more than they can sell so there's always stuff all over the place. 

He has other animals which often go without water for a day or two because he doesn't check on them often enough. He says I'm exaggerating and animals don't need as much attention as I think they do. There is animal shit and piss everywhere and he doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. 

I'm requesting advice and kindly asking you to please not rag on my dad I think he is really sick and I want to help him but I don't know how. He refuses to go to the Dr and won't admit he has a problem. 

If I turned him in for animal cruelty I am certain he would never speak to me again and that is the most painful part, that he chooses money for mistreated dogs over the opinions of his children and wife. 

Any advice is welcome. I am visiting here for another week and am considering rounding the dogs up and taking them to a shelter around here. 

I mentioned this to him and he told me he would leave and we would never hear from him again. He has left before, for up to 2 months at a time and nobody ever knows where he is until he decides he is ready to come back, but only if we promise to let him have as many animals as he wants.

472,"I was never the type of guy to have a large, diverse group of friends. In fact, at 29, the only two friends I have are still from my school days. 

I am currently a father to a 9-month-old child. From the moment I told one of those two friends that I would be having a kid, all I heard was negativity. ""say goodbye to thousands of dollars, you won't ever be able to travel again, you will never have time for any hobbies"". 

One time about halfway through my partner's pregnancy he said that if he found out his gf was pregnant he would kick her down the stairs. He said this in jest, but it again reinforced how negatiely he saw parenthood. 

Given my small social circle, my friend's attitude about having a kid began to creep into my own feelings. In fact, the pregnancy wasn't actually planned; our contraception failed but we decided to keep our child. 

But I started to dread the birth of my own child because of the toxic beliefs I had developed from hearing my friend's opinions. I've spent much of my child's life so far struggling to cope with the loss of my former identity, and the transition wasn't easier due to the overwhelmingly negative things I've heard.  

In the nine months since my baby was born, my friend quietened the negativity down a bit. He never came to see my kid, which is understandable if he doesn't like kids. 

But today the negativity returned. We were having a normal chat on WhatsApp, catching up about each others' lives. He told me he had been in a bar the previous day and he got talking to a Dad who was out having a drink for his daughter's birthday. I replied that it sounds like something I'd do (because I'm known to enjoy a pint of Guinness). His reply was that if he had a daughter he would also be in the pub, but he ""wouldn't be celebrating that's for sure"".

I guess this has got me down because it is again more negativity. I've barely heard anything positive about having a kid. I don't know how to respond to these messages so I tend to just not reply at all.

473,"My grandma called me from the bank upset because she said she was hacked and she needed to change all her cards. When first talking to her, she made it sound like she really got hacked, so I worked with her to change her email and bank passwords. After some questions back and forth, it sounded like she got caught up in a classic gift card phone scam that I've seen on youtube videos. 

It upsets her to talk about it, and a little more detail comes out with each question I ask, so I need some advice on what additional things I should do. 

Details I was able to extract/infer:

\- She got a call from a guy claiming to be Apple tech support.

\- She successfully set up a gotoassist session with the guy. I was able to remote into her system and saw a couple windows he left open. Excel (but she doesn't use that), a TextEdit window with text ""Apple Diagnostic Report"" and some BS about hackers and a dollar amount. Theres stuff about supermarket cards and denominations. The third window that was left open was a bash window with a NETSTAT command run, and a nonsense command saying ""SECURITY WARNING: IP ADDRESS COMPROMISED..."" etc

\- He talked her into going to a supermarket and getting one or more gift cards (these details upset her to talk about because I think she understood by this point) and gave him the card numbers. Unbelievably, he stayed on the phone as she made the trip. 

\- She got a (real?) call from her bank about suspicious activity a few hours later. So, she went to her local branch and either she told them she was hacked or they told her she needs to change all her cards, file a police report, and talk to the credit score companies. I believe she did all this.

\- I also had her call the gift card companies to try to explain that this scam happened so that maybe they could cancel/refund the transactions

Abuse
Assault
Sexual assault
Etc.

This and my likely next post have been made to be as clean and watered down as possible. The events that occur are far more distressing than what I will write but I feel it won't help to describe in greater detail. None the less this will still be quite distressing and I advise to read at your own discretion. Thank you








Someone I know (my relationship with I shall not disclose) let's call them Jessica, has been in an abusive situation that I am aware of, at the hands of her mother, for well over 10 years (I've only known her for 3). Her father, who is unofficially divorced from her mother is also subject to such abuse. They are financially abused, emotionally abused, gaslit, love bombed and then broken down, mentally abused and many times physically abused. Recently there was an occasion which left Jessica's father badly hurt and Jessica distraught, her mother just decided that she didn't like the way Jess (who is 19) was acting for herself and put her down, when her father spoke up he was hit repeatedly until he could hold her down and they left. He has never physically attacked the mother nor has he attacked his daughter. This is not the first time this kind of thing has occurred and I doubt it will be the last. Jessica does not want any action because in her own words ""I would rather be known as the abused daughter than the daughter of no mother"". I believe this is a gaslit stigma that her mother has put on her (like many many others)

And I have no way to convince her that the already unstable person she is could die because of this. That she needs to get out (this situation has led to multiple instances of harm and suicidal thoughts before but they have been brushed off. She has asked me to respect her view of keeping her mother in her life and I understand that is what she wants, but there are obvious indications that if left unchecked this could lead to someone's death. 

It has gotten to the point where I have been able to predict within a 2 or so day confidence interval when something will happen and how serious it will be. 

On top of all this, my father is a police officer and is aware of the situation and is respecting their view to not act. But he never saw it happen so he had no burden to act as it was not his own knowledge. But he saw the damage done by the last attack and legally if he does nothing he is liable to be suspended or worse. 

There is also the chance that someone retaliates (the father) and hits back. In that case the court system without having any prior records of these events will likely side with a woman claiming abuse (not sexist it's just a sad fact for male assault victims in domestic abuse) and so without putting anything in now we could be ultimately leading the father into a position where he is charged for a crime he didn't commit and the abuser goes free. With Jessica. 


The abuse is so much deeper than this and gets so much worse the more you know and I would dare say extends into territory that is borderline sexual assault of a minor. 

Yet, Jessica does not wish to do anything and doesn't realise it but actually takes it out on me instead of her mother. She has often made me so afraid for her safety that I have thrown up our of fear. I also know that her mental health is fragile and I'm 99% confident that she is an undiagnosed autistic (multiple family members including my brother have autism so I am accustomed to the signs). She is becoming increasingly unstable and at times has been obviously suicidal and depressed. 

I want to respect Jessica's decision so badly. I do. But. The severity of recent activity and the fact that her mother is so clearly aware of her actions that she waits until people are gone before abusing tells me everything I need to know. They have said she will get better. She's only gotten worse. They said she can't be alone. But letting Jessica die is not worth the risk. They said that it's okay and there's nothing to worry about. He's covered on bruises and she rocks in the corner crying. 

I know all of this and yet I've done nothing for so long out of respect for Jessica's relationship to me. But I care for Jessica too much to let our relationship get in the way me attempting to save her life. I would rather never see her again and she be alive and well than to have her die knowing me and me being able to stop it.

I think I'm going to take all the evidence I have and go to the police. My father is already compiling a 'quiet report' in case we don't do that so there's something on record about the abuse but we don't take it further, so if the time comes that there is retaliation from her father then it will have a backing to support the fact that she was abusive and it was self defence.

Am I doing the right thing. I feel like I did the wrong thing many times and I've had 000 ready to call for so many nights. I've rocked and cried and thrown up out of fear for her and she's suffered worse. But her request to let it happen and my value of our relationship was put before her safety. The things I would do to me 2 and a half years ago when we got close. When I found out more. Why I didn't stop it there. This is my fault. I knew about it. I let this happen.

So I have to make ammends and to do that I have to take what I have to the police. Not for myself but to save Jessica. 

Am I doing the right thing.",15Nov2019,1
481,"Not something I’ve completely had to deal with as I did move to a new city at one point in my life but was fortunate enough to have a few friends that had already made the move there, I have however due to just being rather busy with life lost touch with most and it got me thinking if i knew nobody when I moved I would probably have had absolutely no social contact since moving, which for me rather shitty, I’m decently social I guess but in my free time I enjoy literally anything if I have people to enjoy it with ya know, evencdoing nothing",15Nov2019,1
482,"I don't even know how to begin with this since this is my first time posting. First off, I'm \[21f\] and my boyfriend \[21m\] has an account here and I don't know if he'll ever get to see this. He mentioned to me like a week ago that he posted about this topic that I'm about to say, asking for advice as well but I didn't get to see it. 

So unintentionally my boyfriend touched our friend \[20f\] inappropriately while under the influence of weed that our female friend brought with her. I won't go into further details about what my boyfriend did to her but he just touched her, that's it. The weed had stronger effect on him than any of us in the group that night, probably due to him almost having fever and all of us were drinking alcohol. He told me he entered a dream-like state as he watched the things he was doing to her unfold. He didn't want those kinds of things to happen and he felt really sick about it. He felt like he was possessed. 

Though the way that I found out about it or the way he admitted to me what he did caused me to legit overreact due to the pain I felt as he was saying it. The first thing that happened was I witnessed our female friend crying and I asked my boyfriend and our other friend what happened to her. They replied that she got triggered by the name of our other friend who wasn't there that night that had touched her inappropriately way back then. So we sat down while our female friend was with our other friend outside the house cooling herself down. I was still a bit high and drunk at this point--I think all of us still are. I kept asking my boyfriend what really happened and he just kept saying sorry to which I got suspicious of. I told him to come outside with me so he could tell me what really happened. 

And I wasn't expecting anything for him to tell me since I thought it was legit that our female friend got triggered and reminded her of her trauma. Then he proceeded with admitting what he did, he didn't even get to finish his sentence as everything went blurred and I broke down in front of him. At this point I can't hear anything what he was saying, I know he kept apologizing but I got blinded with rage immediately. I know him completely, I know that he's the type of guy that won't do something like ""cheating"" in the first place. He's a kind and almost perfect boyfriend. The thing's that been bugging me every since that night was it's like I didn't know him and I let my actions get controlled by pure anger. I overreacted--I kicked him twice in the face and slapped him and kept shouting in front of his face as I was crying. I told him that we should break up. Our friends witnessed the scene as well which ruined the whole night. 

I walked out of the house with our female friend and decided to take a walk. And at this point shit went down. I was still mad as fuck and I had one goal: to ruin his life and make him pay for what he did. Which obviously is a fucking stupid idea and I manage to do it anyway just because I'm a person whose obsessed with revenge to those who wronged me. I whipped out my phone and sent a message to the head of his org at college, told her what happened and wanted my boyfriend out of their org. It was very much an asshole of me. 

It's been a couple of weeks since that happened and now realizing it, the incident made me change my perspective of things. I learned my lesson, I think all of us did. There's no going back unfortunately and we don't know how to cope with it exactly. Sadly, I think my relationship with my boyfriend got scarred due to what I did and what he did. We got back together but both of us are traumatized as fuck until now. Both of our mothers know about it already, and I took the blame as my boyfriend's mother got mad at me as well as towards our other friends and forbid his son to drink again with us. I understand where she's coming from. Now she let my boyfriend go into therapy and got diagnosed with severe depression. 

This morning my boyfriend and I got into an arguement through chat about what I did with me telling the org head since tomorrow he has to go to his university to talk with her and the other org officers. The problem here is that he should've just been apologizing to our female friend but instead he has to face people that wasn't part of our problem in the first place. That's what I'm so fucking guilty of and that's what he's mad about. I feel like an asshole and I just made his depression worse. I don't know if my feelings that night were valid since I got hurt. Though I know what I did was out of impulsive decision and out of pure anger. I assumed things quickly. The day after that night I immediately sent a message to the org head, taking back the things I said to her and apologized--at this point my boyfriend had told me his side of the story which I truly believed. But it didn't work, she told me she still has to talk to him since what I said was a serious matter. I wasn't expecting it myself either that she had told the other org officers. 

I asked my boyfriend if he wanted space and said yes. Though he told me I'm running away from my problems again and for once I should use my brain. His words are painful I know, but it's true. I feel like I don't deserve him anymore, I feel like a burden in his life at this point and I don't know what to do anymore to make everything go back to normal like before that night happened. I know he was still mad at me for the last couple of weeks but he told me he doesn't want any complications anymore. I feel like a fucking coward hiding and don't want to face him due to so much guilt for ruining his life. I feel like complete shit, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not surprised if he decides to break up with me. It's been a couple of hours since his last message which was he told me he got kicked out of their org groupchat and sarcastically thanked me for it. Everything makes me sick, what I did make me sick--I even forgot what he did and I just want to take every blame that I could get. It's like I want to apologize for even existing or even being in his life. What do you all think? Is space at the moment just right? I even feel so fucking stupid asking strangers for advice. I just want everything to go back like it used to. 

TL:DR - Boyfriend unintentionally touched our female friend inappropriately under the influence of strong weed that caused me to overreact and decided to ruin his life by messaging his org head at college and make him remove from something that makes him happy. I feel like a complete asshole and doesn't deserve forgiveness.",15Nov2019,1
483,"So just the other day I heard that my supposed friend has hacked into another girl's school email to copy her entire essay.

Now I wouldn't usually believe that sort of stuff, but there's a couple details that make me suspect that it might be the case.

1: even though she's a senior and the other girl is a junior, she mentioned that she'll need to take this class this year

2: she's always telling me to take it easy

 3: (most importantly) she used to constantly talk about how easy it is to hack the school emails, and how all you need to know is the ID number of the elementary school the person went to

I don't want to tell her or a teacher yet, because if it is a lie, then I'll look like a fool and make things awkward with my other friend who's also her friend. But I very much don't condone plagiarism and don't want to stay silent about it,what should I do?",15Nov2019,1
484,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now and we are expecting our first child in february. While we were really happy before, an unexpected pregnancy so early into our relationship really changed things. I have been very codependent on him since we first met which has made it hard for me to say enough is enough. I know that he loves me still and part of him wants to make it work but he just hasn’t been happy despite how good i’ve been to him and hasn’t been the best boyfriend because of it (lying, cheating, etc.). If circumstances were different and we weren’t having a child I might have given up trying to make it work by now, but if there’s any chance that we can work through our problems for the sake of our son i want to do it. I’m just not sure at this point us going to therapy is able to fix anything. Do any of you have any experience and can say if it did/didn’t work for you?",15Nov2019,1

My boss is the head of HR, and since I had a falling out with her best friend (my co-worker), both of them gossip about me and treat me like I'm stupid. I'm afraid that this has stunted my potential for growth, and the toxic work environment has really taken a toll on my mental health. I used to job hop a lot, so I'm afraid that my perspective may be skewed, and want advice on whether or not to seek employment elsewhere.


**The Conflict:**


Co-worker is rude and obnoxious, but everyone finds it endearing because she has worked for the head of the company (who is never here) for many years. We were close, and I reached a point during my pregnancy where I was zen and unphased by her constant inappropriate comments. Comments included: telling me that I had no choice but to breastfeed, that I will definitely have several more children even though I don't want any more, frequently and loudly cutting people off when they would ask me how I am to express her disgust for pregnant women and/or people with children, etc.


She came to me a few months ago to ""ask"" me to pull the cold cans to the front if I ever stock the refrigerator because she ""haaates reaching for a cold drink and getting a room-temperature one."" I laughed and said, ""Sure, I don't mind! But that kind of sounds like a first-world problem, right?""


I thought that I could speak to her casually, since she was free to be rude to me. I was wrong. It has since been made clear that she complained that I was rude to her to everyone else in the office. She cut off all communication, thus freezing me out of projects we were working on together. My boss began blowing up at me and turning our weekly sub-group meetings into hate fests, in which she only focuses on what I'm working on and what I did wrong. I don't know why the other two people even go anymore.


I went to my boss (again, the head of HR) to express that I felt like my relationship with Co-worker had dwindled, and ask for advice on how to mend communication. She commended me for being brave enough to come to her, but kept saying, ""You can talk to her, but be ready for what comes back"" and ""She tells it like it is, so just be ready for what she has to say."" She also expressed that I don't understand, and can't relate to, the stress that Co-worker is under. Because, apparently, no one else's stress can compare to her best friend's.


Things have improved a little bit, but I'm still getting yelled at for really stupid shit. Every time my boss loses her temper with me, she comes back later and tries to be extra sweet and chat me up.


I'm sick of being their punching bag.


**Job Pros:**


Great health insurance (includes vision and dental), but I could easily get on my husband's health insurance at no cost

$33,000 before-tax salary after health insurance and parking deductions

Paid holidays and time off

Large bonuses

Weekends off

I find the work very easy to do

I could potentially go back to school to receive a certain certification, and work more closely with another group in the office... BUT the last time I tried this (different job), my boss blocked the transfer and escalated her behavior until I quit. This feels like a similar situation; since my boss and co-worker both work directly under the head of the company, they can pretty much do whatever they want.


**Job Cons:**

The conflict and blatant bias

Because I find the work so easy to do, I find myself getting distracted more and more

When co-worker and I were still on good terms, she found out that Boss has me submit detailed weekly timesheets and couldn't fathom why

My husband can no longer work overtime because I can't make it to pick my daughter up from daycare before they close

My job is in a busy tourist city with a high crime rate. Yesterday, there was a false alarm when men were working in the garage and someone thought it was an active shooter. I could potentially find a job in the safer city in which we live to spend less time driving and more time with my daughter.

This isn't what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. I like what I do, but I'm very sedentary and stare at a screen all day, which doesn't help my mental health.",15Nov2019,1
487,"Tl:dr: my brother was evicted from his parental home because he keeps drink driving and doing coke, what can my family do? 


My brother (B) has behaved very erratically since my parents split in 2011. He is 20, driven, ambitious and also reckless. My bro goes after money over everything in his life. Everything went down hill when he met his ex gf, he works in construction and is good at what he has done so far for the past couple of years. 

His ex (K), was a drug user (Class A) and got my brother into using everytime they went clubbing, which was every weekend. They had a turbulent two year fling with multiple pregnancy scares, meanwhile he was living with my mum and in the midst of this was kicked out by my mums ex husband and forced to live with my grandparents. 

At this point B had been gifted use of a car by his grandparents which he sold to our mum without permission.. he was a named driver not the owner. He had also maxed three credit cards, which mt grandparents cleared for him, and also paid his petrol costs for miles and miles of driving during this time. Finally it culminated on him taking out an extortionate finance deal on a brand new car, which he didn't talk through with anyone. 

He is immediately kicked out and forced to live with our Dad. He doesn't understand at this point what he has done wrong and proceeds to co tine his erratic behaviour with K in tow. He maxes out his cards again, keeps promising he will change, all the while not doing so. 

So, about two months ago now, he left K after she faked a pregnancy, he traded in the new car for a BMW, crashed it into a ditch, knocked down a tree and destroyed the thing, completely wrecked and written off. B got out of this so lightly.. he had his step brother in the car, they were high, drunk and it was raining heavily that night, somehow they got out with no police action. 



He has use of our mums car, the other night he drank drove and crashed it. Point blank refused at first that he did it, blamed it on someone else hitting him, he didn't wake up until 3pm that day, so he must have been out all night. The car is fixed again but that was the final straw. My dad kicked him out with great pain, and remorse, my brother is not well, he is medicated for severe anxiety problems but he behaves so recklessly. 

B is staying with mum, for now. But it's not permanent. He will be on the streets unless he can be emergency housed.

490,"About a year ago I partnered with a schoolmate of mine and began tutoring the children of wealthier parents in our city. He had a huge network of clients and wanted to pawn off some to me. He said that in exchange for a 30% cut, he'd manage the clients for me and get me new clients every semester. 30% was a lot, but the money I got was ultimately worth it to me so I agreed. Plus he was a friend and has been generally good to me

For the past year this has provided me with a steady source of income. This semester I left another part-time job to focus on just this gig while at school. So this is the currently the only income I have. It supports me while I study at school and pays for my transit and other expenses. In about two months I'll graduate and begin full-time work at another company which will pay me more than I've ever been paid in my life, but until then this is all I have for income. 

The issue is that I'm waiting longer and longer for payment. I have a client that hasn't paid us in a month, and I've had 4 sessions with her. She has a history of paying us a little late, and is very nice, but this is an unprecedented delay. Another client is having an issue with her method of payment and will likely have to send my partner a check, which means I'll be waiting for that to get to him, for him to deposit it, and then for him to send my cut to me. 

In the meanwhile I'm running out of money. I've resorted to living off my credit cards to cover things like food and transit. I feel like I'm paying money to work and I don't how sustainable this is, and feel less and less incentive to go to clients when I'm experiencing these delays in payment. I don't believe my partner is intentionally screwing me -- it's not his fault if our clients don't get back to us on a timely basis -- but I do think he has less of an incentive to pay me promptly as he probably has some savings he's living off atm, so I don't know how aggressive he's being in requesting funds from clients. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I may have to give him an ultimatum and tell him that unless our more tardy clients pay me soon, I'll have to stop tutoring. I'm not sure how to navigate this.",15Nov2019,1

Maybe in the future when I'm in a better headspace I'll decide to enroll again, but currently I think I would be much better off with just getting a job and working. I'm afraid to tell my mom this, though, because she really wants me to be in school. I feel like I'm always doing what she wants me to do instead of doing what I want to do, and I want to break that pattern by dropping out because I feel in my gut that college is not the right choice for me at the moment.

When I was in high school, I was in a car wreck that I should not have walked away from. I had lateral compression and vertical shear pelvic fractures that were treated by open reduction and internal fixation, i.e. two screws through my pubic symphysis and one through left iliac.

I am 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant today with our first kiddo. I’ve had a total of 4 miscarriages before this pregnancy. I have a retroverted uterus, along with the abdominal scar tissue you would expect from having the surgery discussed above. I don’t smoke or drink, my blood pressure is 116/71, I am 30 years old, and my BMI is normal. I am 5’9” and weighed 9lb 2oz at birth. My husband is 6’1” and weighed 10lb 1oz at birth. Large babies run in both of our families, and everyone is tall. I am O negative, hubs is A positive.

I’m including all of that because I honestly want to know if my knee jerk reaction/gut feeling is accurate and reasonable based specifically on my situation.

I had my first OB visit at 9 weeks and the doctor was a tiny bit dopey, but whatever. I don’t have a choice who my doctor is because my health insurance is through the military, and I’m being treated at the Naval hospital on base. I told her I just wanted to do the best thing for the baby given my past medical history. Whatever the best thing is, I would do. I’ve had more than one doctor tell me vaginal birth isn’t in the cards because of the pelvic fixation. The OB and I discussed that surgery, and I asked what the delivery plan would be, specifically if I would be scheduled for a C-section, or they would wait until I went into labor and then perform one, etc. She told me “we know that the best thing for the baby is a natural, non-medicated, vaginal birth,” and I asked her how that would be possible to accomplish in my case since my pelvis is fixed. She told me that they could “try like a trial of labor first” before doing the C-section, because “sometimes the baby might not be too big to fit.” My initial reaction was thinking that that seems like a completely unnecessary risk! I didn’t argue with her because it didn’t seem worth it at the time.

She has since done other somewhat infuriating things, such as forgetting more than once to order the lab work we’ve discussed at the same time, which means that I have to go back to the lab days later for the forgotten panel or two after the initial draw. Ignoring the potential inaccuracies this may create in the various results, it’s kind of a pretty big inconvenience to have to keep going back because something was left off. The only reason the forgotten panels eventually get ordered is because I’ll look at the lab order while I’m in the lab and realize she forgot to include a test, like a liver and kidney function panel she wanted to have done, and sometimes the tech catches it because the lab order doesn’t make sense. Then they or I have to try to get ahold of her and wait for her to put the order in, usually days later. I asked to have nuchal thickness screening done with the bloodwork, and her nurse told me that they don’t routinely order those, despite the particular screening lab work not being as accurate without it. another time, it took two weeks to get ahold of her to remind her that the test she promised she would order the day of my appointment still hadn’t been put in. There have been quite a few similar incidents since she has been providing my care.

So again, my question is basically is it reasonable to be wondering about her competency? Is my reaction to her “birth plan” unreasonable? Advice?

TL;DR: I had internal pelvic fixations after a car wreck. Am now pregnant with first kid after history of complications, doc wants me to try to deliver non-medicated, vaginally first before performing a C-section. Same doc has made a series of mistakes so far that worry me that even if I agreed to a trial of labor, complications or a crisis that came up during said labor wouldn’t be quickly/appropriately recognized or addressed. Also, stuck with this doc for insurance reasons.",15Nov2019,1

505," 

Hi! I'm an undergraduate who is graduating a semester early, and I'm looking for jobs right now. I have a lot of experience in the field that I want to go into, and have relevant 3 internships/jobs on my resume. Normally, this would lead me to find a job pretty easily, but there's one problem-- I got fired from my last job because I made an oversight on a project and led to a costly mistake.

Whether or not I deserved to get fired is up for debate. I've talked to a lot of professors and advisors about the situation, and people's responses have been anywhere from ""I think it's pretty upsetting that you got fired for a single oversight without warning"" and ""Well, you made a mistake, and mistakes have consequences.""

When I submit references, I'll have references from my first 2 internships, + a professor, but I'll be conspicuously missing one from my most recent job. I was wondering how I should approach this situation for my future interviews. In one interview, the hiring person asked me up front why my time at this most recent job was so short. I explained the situation, and he seemed to be really understanding of what happened, and agreed with me that he was surprised that I was fired for a mistake of the nature that I made. For this job they narrowed it down to the final 2 candidates, and unluckily I wasn't selected.

Another interviewer I met with was highly impressed, and told me after the interview that she would check with my references, and if everything checked out, I was 100% hired. When I followed up, this person sent a short email saying that she didn't think I was a good fit for the position. My suspicion of what happened was either a)she assumed my 3 references were from my 3 jobs that were all highly relevant to the position and contacted the place I got fired from, or b) she noticed that my most recent job was missing on my references sheet and decided to reach out anyways.

So, what do I do? Should I be upfront that I got fired for a controversial reason? Should I not bring it up until asked? I can't help but feel like with the interviewer who said that I was essentially hired, if I had just brought up what happened then it wouldn't have been as big of a deal? But how should I even bring something like that up?",15Nov2019,1

So the other night I got slapped in the face. Just a little backstory, I play coed soccer with my husband.  There is a girl on the other team that is really just rude. Yells at the ref, her team, our team. She kicks our ankles and thinks she's being fouled all the time. 

Well, she kicked my ankles and I turned to shield her to win the ball back. I grabbed her hand a little so she couldn't go around me (yes a slight foul). She called me  really bad names, turned and slapped me. Now, I feel like I am not in the wrong in this scenario . And I know everyone who saw it doesn't think so either.

514,"I returned from working abroad a month ago, I had the best time there and returned to some hard to deal with realities..

I am in a huge fight with my sister, frustrated with my parents' behavior towards me, miss the amazing close friends I made abroad and my job there (summer job), in addition I have a huge crush on someone I met at the summer job and we text for constant 2 months but the chat is slowly dying, and last but not least: I got back to my old job- where there is a clash between my best friends there and my boss so I am torn in the middle (I had a great relationship with my boss), and everybody is in a bad mood there and I am always tired and its hard for me to get up as I used to.

Lately I noticed that all this frustration leads me to complain all the time, which is something that was never in my nature. I let little things get me and I just feel anger really often, I have this feeling that nothing goes my way lately. For example I am a waiter, and usually I am paired with bad staff (my boss never fires anyone) and I sometimes have to work way harder to cover for their slow working. When I worked there before flying I would maintain a good mood while working hard, now it just gets me pissed.

I get angry much faster, I am way less patient, I don't find joy in a lot of things anymore. I can't and don't want to live my life this way. I know the bad times will end at some point, but I feel like I mix everything together it makes me a terrible person that I don't want to be.

516,"Some backstory: 
I graduated in May with my Bachelor’s. I had an internship in NYC for the summer, came back home in August and got a boring, mind numbing desk job. I get decent pay and benefits but I absolutely hate what I do.

My plan was to always take a year or two off to save up money and go to law school. I took the LSAT last month but I don’t think I did nearly as well as I want to (I get my score back in a week). Part of that is because studying countless hours on top of a full time job is hard to do and by test day I was burned out. Now I’m wanting to maybe put in my two weeks soon so I can focus more on studying, spend time with my family for the holidays, and not have to stress about finding time to study for when I retake the test in February.

Also, my girlfriend’s mom works at a company that I would love to work at that does meaningful work, and I actually interned there a year ago and left on great terms. However, she has no idea when jobs will open up there as they are in the middle of managerial changes. 

Before I took this current  job I actually already interviewed with the company I wanted to work at, and it went really well. It just happened to be days before the huge managerial changes that put new hiring on hold. 

My ideal scenario would be to put in my 2 weeks in the first week of December so I can spend time with my family who I rarely get to see and haven’t lived in the same town as since I graduated high school, take advantage of my new free time to maximize studying, and after the holidays be able to get a job from other company. 

My hesitation is that I do like the people I work with, just not the job. And I get the sense that the holiday season is their busy season and I would potentially be causing a huge headache for them. Also, when I interviewed for my current job, I was asked the question something along the lines of “we aren’t looking to fill this job again in another 3 months, we need someone who will stick around”, and, being desperate, without health insurance and down to my last few dollars in the bank (NYC is expensive), I told them what they wanted to hear and I got the job. I had no other interviews or job opportunities lined up at the time, so I didn’t have much of a choice. So my conscience is weighing on me a little bit. And while I have built up my savings a good amount over the past few months, I could potentially back myself into a corner again financially if the job at the other company doesn’t pan out. 

What should I do?",15Nov2019,1

518,"So I’m a college student and I’ve been rooming with this girl who used my my friend since this beginning of fall semester. I had no idea she was a total slob and lazy ass before I moved in with her. 

Later on because of how dirty she is we had a few arguments about it. However, since she is extremely passive aggressive and does not think with logic, she does not voice any of her thoughts to me when she thinks there’s a problem and merely acts all passive aggressive. I’ve had enough of living in this shitty place and decide to move out next semester.

However, I signed a joint lease that’s a full year with her, and cannot get out of it easily. So I’m trying to talk to the landlord and school about wanting to leave the lease and not paying for the rest of it because It’s not worth the price + I can’t afford it. It’d also be very hard to find someone to sublease my room to due to the houses condition. Meanwhile, it needs my roommates approval, which only makes it harder for me.

Now the problem is, I know there is a chance that I’ll probably see her in some of my classes since some courses of our majors overlap, and I don’t want to make things hard for myself since I’m already sick of the shit. I do not know if I should I make up with her, especially if the school lets me leave the lease then she may be paying it alone, but that’s none of my business . Should I make up with her?",15Nov2019,1
519,"Okay so before I begin I will say that I'm gonna talk about something kinda sensitive to some people so, disclaimer, the main topic here is sex and potential sexual assault.

First of all, a little background. I am a Muslim guy, early 20s, not super religious or practicing anymore but I do believe in god. I had been with this girl on and off for 2 years, and I'm well aware that it wasn't the most healthy relationship in the world, if anything it's was rather toxic, but we believed we were trying to get better and in truth we were in a much better place than we were in our first year together etc...

Now getting into the actual question I have to ask is, is this sexual assault?

Before I got into Uni I was your typical 'good Muslim boy' I wanted to wait until marriage for sex and didn't drink and so on.  A couple weeks in, I ended up hooking up with a girl, which in and of itself made me feel incredibly guilty as I'd never done anything sexually with a girl outside of a relationship before but I did consent and that was that, and we ended up in a relationship. Now we had had conversations and I had expressed that I didn't want to have sex, but I was happy to be sexual if that makes sense. Like I gave a lot of head and was happy to do it but I did not wish to have sex, though she had expressed her desire to have sex but I understood that we had left it at that. 

Now one night, maybe 3-4 weeks into the relationship, we were in bed and things were getting slowly more and more sexual, she started grinding on me, and slowly moved towards my dick, grabbed it, and put it inside her and rode me for a little while. I was not into it, but I didn't know at the time how to stop it. I'm aware how it sounds, like I could've kicked up a bigger fuss and pushed her off me as a stronger person than her etc... but I genuinely had no idea what to do, I was inside her at that point and my naive 19 year old mind didn't know what to do.

Now after the fact 2 years later she had expressed remorse for the way we lost our virginity, she was also a virgin at the time, and i told her that it was fine and to ease her mind I told her that I consented but deep down I don't think I did. 

After this incident, we did go on to have consensual sex over the course of our relationship. As a matter of fact I felt like I loved her, maybe I still even do, in spite of a lot of things which, if I looked at it objectively would've and should've led to me leaving the relationship. For example, she'd continuously break up with me and string me along afterwards until we eventually got back together, she's cheated on me multiple times, there's a lot of things that before her I would've broken up with someone for, but even though we're currently broken up, I can't keep myself away from her so perhaps I do love her. 

But I can't help but look back at who I was before her and who I am now and be like damn. She really changed me, and I'm not really sure it's for the better? I'm in a place now where I have very little passion for the things I had before, I have very few if any friends left, I'm just not as hopeful or happy as I was before.

Now I try and look at things in an objective light, but with this relationship I find it very difficult. I haven't obviously divulged all the details here, but looking at it objectively I can't tell if that was sexual assault or not? I don't know if the relationship we had afterwards negates the initial sexual encounter. I don't know if I actually love(d) her is that just some sort of guilt attachment to my first sexual partner. I don't know if the change in myself is from natural growth over time or if that's related to the relationship. I'm not even sure if my conflicting feelings and general malaise is because we've broken up (we've been broken up 4 weeks, the longest we've ever been broken up for) and I'm agitated at our break up or because of a deeper more all encompassing issue.

I'm sorry for making y'all read all of that, and I would appreciate any advice or even criticism. Also happy to answer any questions y'all have. Thank you in advance",15Nov2019,1

522,"My (19m) little brother (15m) has recently started college in September (the American equivalent of high school) Normally college starts at 16 but he wanted to start a year early. This makes him the youngest by quite a big margin because most of the kids in his class are 17-18.

LB is quite caring and kind. He rarely gets upset and is very forgiving. He likes to hide his emotions and doesn’t like to make a fuss. He is the youngest out of four siblings and was homeschooled from the age of about 6 (partially because of bullying). he loves to cook and he is quite good at it. He has always been a little bit chonky but he’s not obese. Like 5ft 10” and 200 lbs. he is quite mature for his age and thus doesn’t subscribe to the social hierarchy of school. He is well liked by almost everyone including the teachers and he likes to help out other kids. Except there is this one kid I’ll call insecure cunt who I keep hearing about. 

LB was minding his own business in maths when IC comes up and just takes his pen out of his hand. IC then won’t give it back until LB gets up and retrieves it. When LB gets Up IC drops the pen on the floor and LB has picks it up; IC calls LB Mr Tumble (a fat kids tv entertainer known for slap stick) . Another time LB was trying to help IC with some maths and IC was ignoring him and waving his hand in front of his nose saying pooey over and over again. This kind if thing is a daily occurrence. 

LB normally cooks every day and loves to eat. However yesterday he did not eat at all except for a milkshake and today he would have done the same had my mum not got us McDonald’s. He’s been very quiet lately and more withdrawn. He has been spending a lot of his time in his room where usually he’d be downstairs. LB says it doesn’t bother him but I can tell it does.

My other little brother (17m) wants to kick IC’s ass (which he isn’t going to do and I obviously don’t condone) but I really feel like I need to do something.

Hi folks. I got permission from a non-reddit user to post this here for her,

Discord is a social media dedicated to connect with gamers. There is a verified (owner is related to the game devolpment) discord server with 6 moderators. A 15 year old girl went to me saying that she needed advice with a guy who was being mean towards her. I found out this guy is 20 years old and was sending the 15 year old sexually explicit messages including adult content, knowing well of the age. They met on that verified discord server, with the 20 year old being the head moderator. Me and the girl gathered links to the messages to report him and he got banned from discord. We told the owner of the server and she said to tell a moderator as she doesn't enforce server rules as well. The problem is, since the 20 year old is the head moderator, all of the moderators he recruits are his friends. The girl and I are considering telling the mods, and I told one mod who is a close friend of mine, who said what he did was illegal, but he's still a good person and won't even say what he did was wrong.

Recently we started a weight loss diet advised by my dietitian, it went well enough for the first few days but we started to slip alot back into old habits.My question is how can we balance our lifestyles with work or school and maintain discipline and enthusiasm to lose weight?",15Nov2019,1
532,"My (24F) fiancé’s (24M) dad is currently having a really rough time and I’m not sure how we can help. For context, my fiancé and I live in Arizona and his dad lives in Tahoe with a roommate. Fiancé also has 3 siblings (22M, 20F, &amp; 16M) and 1 aunt and 1 uncle (dad’s siblings) who live in various cities in Northern California, and has 1 aunt in Pennsylvania. Dad has been giving each of the siblings bits and pieces of info on how he’s doing and we’re all piecing together the story, whereas he has not told the aunts or uncle anything about how he’s doing. 

His dad is a chef and has had issues over the past few years with work. While he is a very hard worker, he has had issues with working too much which has caused him significant health problems. He’ll regularly work 80+ hours a week, and not have days off due to his work being understaffed, double booked for events, or due to not getting scheduled days off. 

Because of this his health has been relatively poor ever since I’ve known him (almost 6 years). Earlier this year his mom passed away (somewhat) suddenly. She was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on April 3rd and her health quickly deteriorated and she passed away June 18th. This left him very depressed. Since then his health has gotten worse and about 2 weeks ago, he lost his job after some issues with his boss when he brought up working conditions/etc. 

In the past 2 weeks, he has become severely depressed to the point where we think he may be a threat to himself. He has lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks and has begun drinking heavily. Fiancé has been looking for jobs for his dad in AZ but has had no luck. His sister has been driving to Tahoe to check on him and we made a family chat with all the siblings, aunts and uncle to discuss other options. 

Sister has been updating us saying he’s constantly having panic attacks and crying, he can’t calm down because of the stress of not having a job and having little to no savings. Fiancé and I can only do so much being in AZ and are at loss for what we can all do to help him or what we can direct those who are near him to do. We ultimately want to get him to AZ, but it will take money and time to get him down here (packing/selling his stuff, moving fiancé’s classic mustang somewhere in CA as it wouldn’t make it to AZ/would get stolen in the area we live in, getting dad’s car packed, someone to drive down with him to Az, preparing our office for someone to live in, etc)

Sister has to leave Tahoe tonight to go back to work and we’re scared of what he’ll do if he’s alone. Does anyone have any advice on what we can do temporarily or in the long run. Any help is greatly appreciated.",15Nov2019,1
533,"Struggling teen here! 
So from early on I loved to draw/paint/just create in general, but last year, when I finished art school (that I studied for 5years), i feel that I don't have drive. That driving force or motivation to even touch a pencil. Feels like I've burned myself. It's funny, because 2 years ago I was motivated and loved to draw(every single day) , but the last year of art school i struggled , no motivation at all .
And I want to start, to start drawing, improving, because I wish to study something with art and creating. But I can't make myself to even touch a pencil. What should I do?? Wait even more to find that motivation and lose touch of my drawing abilities or just start drawing and burn myself even more??",15Nov2019,1

542,"Okay, so I honestly have no idea where to begin or how to help, so my family and I could really use any ideas. This is sorta long. 

Today, while I am currently at work, my twin texted me telling me that my cousin, we'll call her Mariah, got suspended from school for making a joke about shooting her school up. 

Mariah's friend is currently running for some class position (treasurer, vice president, etc.), and said that if no one votes for her, she'd shoot the school up. Now, I know my cousin somehow thought it was funny and didn't think anything of it. Turns out it circulated all over the school, the police got involved, and she ended up getting suspended and her phone taken by police. They are threatening to have her removed from the school *completely*.

This is especially VERY bad timing considering there was just a school shooting in California the [other day](https://cnn.it/33O3RGe). The police, rightfully so, are taking this matter very seriously, and so am I. 

In addition to this, her grades have been slipping, she went from a straight A student to a failing one. So I worry that something may be going on with her that we may not be aware of. 

This is a lot, and I want to handle this situation as best as possible, without a long lecture because she's heard them before. 

How do I go about this? What can I do to:

1. Get her to understand the severity of her words.

2. Take her education seriously.

3. Make sure that whatever we do actually sticks? 

Thanks in advance, sorry for the long post. This is all just worrying me and giving me anxiety. I want to help, but don't know how. 

TlDR: My cousin got suspended for making a serious threat about her school and is failing her classes. She could be removed from the school entirely as this situation is very serious. How do I educate her the best way possible?",15Nov2019,1

(I  without any particular problem  the sense of what they say and the things they talk about, but I would like to improve my knowledge about these topics) I perfectly understand that most of it comes from the fact that people like them have been working in this sector for a lifetime and so I won’t be able to get a deep knowledge unless I myself get a practical experience on the matter for an extended period of time, but I was wondering where could I start to learn in an organical and proper way the subjects that they’re knowledgeable about since I’m just 17.

544,"For context we are (or should I say ""were"" :/ ) really really close friends and are classmates. Talking and texting everyday, inside jokes, memories... you name it. We've been there for each other at the hardest of our times. We only had a ""lethal"" arguement once, and we resolved it pretty quick, both acknowledging our wrongs.  


She became my crush quite recently. I only told a few, trustworthy people who it was. Since then on my Instagram stories I've been posting things like ""thinking about her"" and stuff that doesn't give out who it is at all. Crush was interested in who was it, but I quickly rubbed it off.  


One day my friend (who is also her best friend, but still trustworthy enough for me to tell about it to her) told me that she found out about it and I should do something. Since then crush has been not speaking to me, avoiding me and blocking on social media.  


I have no idea why, I am quite a handsome guy and my personality is pretty good (especially to her). You may think I am an r/niceguys tipe of a nice guy, but that is not the case as I am quite aware on such social things (trust me, like back way when we didn't even talk I was a really horrible person).

545,"Hey everyone! I'm in a bit of a spot. I really wanna move. I'm trans, living in a small west Texas town (which you can imagine isn't going well), and starting to really become bitter. The problem is my current job is the only one I'm remotely qualified for. I'm an admissions counselor for a small university and I hate it so much I've almost driven myself off the road in an effort to get out of talking to students and doing classroom presentations (an exaggeration I'm not doing that bad). I get made fun of by students for looking like a girl but sounding like a boy and it makes me wanna die every week that I have to do these presentations. I have an undergraduate degree in communication as well as a masters in liberal arts with a concentration in communication, theater, and music. Both are pretty useless. At least so far. I have debt so going back to school may not be an option. Especially since I don't want to get yet another useless degree from the joke university I work for. But I'm willing to sacrifice if that means I can go somewhere else and do something else. That being said I'm not sure what I can even do. Are there any jobs that pay more than $25,000 a year with my degrees? I realize now that I shouldn't have come here or gotten the degrees that I did. Am I screwed for life? I don't want to be in my 40s recruiting high school kids here. I have a few years of experience so I could even do another recruiting job, as long as it's in a more liberal place. But I haven't had any luck with all of the applications I've placed. What can I do? Will I have to work here until I can pay off my debt and go back to school? It just feels so hopeless.

547,"The ""slog"" is a plethora of issues, but instead of asking for individual advice for everything, I'm just gonna list my shit and ask for something at the end. Make it easier on you and me. 

1. I'm not as good as my coworkers. Every time I try my best when dealing with users over the phones, I'm always forgetting something. Everyone is better than me and they talk to me as such. I really try, I just never learn from mistakes. That leads to...
2. I never learn from mistakes. Everyone seems to adapt, no matter what it is that they are doing, except me. I'm the only person who doesn't learn from my mistakes. I'm a constant repeater. I try and strive to be better but there's always something. I try telling this to therapists but they don't listen...
3. Because of that I also feel I am not as smart as the others. 
4. I romanticize doing a lot of things, but when I go to do them, I hate the actual ""doing."" This is with anything. Learning Excel, making music, finishing a video game, etc. I can't bring myself to stay passionate. The times I want to passionate, I'm tired.
5. I always sleep. I am so tired all the time forever. I take 5 hour naps essentially. After work, nap. Eat, nap again. No energy to do anything.
6. I always forget to take my medication. Like I'll always skip at least one day in the week because I'm fucking forgetful (stupid). However when I skip I really can't tell a difference in the things around me or how I act. 
7. Can't seem to find a therapist that I can get consistent sessions with. Ever since I move and started working I can't get around to scheduling something with someone. 
8. I'm getting fat. I have a hard time losing weight because I have a hard time buying groceries just for one. I barely buy anything yet I find myself still being wasteful of food. Yet the reason why is because I eat fast food. I can't just keep eating the same damn thing. 
9. I'm always caught up in the past, with how people treated me. No one ever believed me, no matter what it was. I was weak, so I couldn't stand up for myself. Was kicked into lockers and held by my collar IN FRONT OF MY MOM (who said she didn't say even though I was screaming MOM). I couldn't ever co pare to my peers in anything I did (for real). Because of this I have thoughts of violence. I want to kill these people by finding them and bludgeoning them to death with something. 

I've been looking for some sort of ""magical advice"" to make my life better. Obviously that's not going to happen. I don't know what to do to get out of this slog in my life. I take medicine, and I've been to therapy for YEARS now. It all works. If I stopped taking the medicine completely I would be A LOT worse. Everything can only help so much. My problems still exist outside the medication taking. 

Is there anything I can do? I think about killing myself constantly because, really, what the fuck is the point. I can't compare. At all. I'm just a problem. This is just a fact. If you lived my life you'd understand.",15Nov2019,1

I put the kids (she owes money to a loading company and won’t get approved for an apartment lease until it’s paid off) on the lease so I would meet income requirements, (it was a low income kind of deal, as in there’s a cap on it, not a minimum) anyway, they required a $200 “courtesy hold” for the apartment in the process for the paperwork (which would have gone towards the security deposit) but they asked for proof of custody of the kids which obviously I don’t have. So I got denied at the apartments, and they gave me the money order back for the courtesy hold. So now I have a money order for $200 in someone else’s name that my bank already rejected because it’s in this other company’s name.

552,"NOTE: sorry this is longer than I thought it would be

My boyfriend (Bob) and I have been together since 2013 so this happened mid-relationship and is not up for discussion whether or not I stay with him.

Okay so the watered down version is my sister (Brittney) slept with my boyfriend early 2016. Bob and I were having a rough patch and both confiding in Brittney about what to do and she offers solid advice. They had a brief flirt, one day when we all were hanging out they got drunk (I don't drink) and Bob vomited and pooped in he bathroom. I had to clean up and sent him back to the room. I walked in on them sitting on my bed caressing each other's faces (I didn't say anything) - later on they both insisted on sleeping in the same bed for BS reasons and I agreed because I was in denial and stupid. Turns out Bob was groping Brittney before he passed out and Brit later admitted in an email I still have that she liked it. FF and they both agree they are attracted to each other and meet at Brit's place for advice on Bob and I's relationship- from what I hear she took a shower, said she had ""pictures to show him"" (nudes) and they started kissing and had sex. I found out about everything months later since Bob told Brit I couldn't handle it (despite those months being filled with her sick bullshit ""hints"" e.g ""What if Bob isn't as faithful as you think? What if Bob *likes* me? - it makes me mad because she was a grown ass woman who decided to not tell me of her own volition) later on Bob told me because Brit gave an ultimatum. I freaked, we broke up and I tried to kill myself (stupid I know). 


After months of therapy and talking about it, I forgave him- guys, he's different and doesn't drink anymore, is a loving and supportive partner and makes up for it every day. I'm honestly glad we didn't break up (not saying it's the solution for all toxic relationships).

After a year I talked to my sister again- things were as fine as they could be with her - she was always blaming Bob and making the F.R.I.E.N.D.S joke of ""you. Were on. A break! Ahahaha"" because she has never admitted wrongdoing. Tl;dr: from 2016 to now she has been in my life off and on again, we stopped talking again in February for 2 reasons: she accused our parents (who were by no means saints -mom was mentally abusive and dad had a gf who physically abused us) when they were together of grooming us sexually and my boyfriend of sexual assault. I was fucking flabbergasted at this rapid shockwave of information because it wasn't true. None of it. I stopped talking to her and said I would NOT have Bob apologize for **FUCKING ASSUALT** when in all her infinite glory she had sent me an *EMAIL* **AND** a *GIANT ASS LETTER* confirming it was consensual. Lol

So now after cutting off her bs - my mom called me and said Brit had advent calenders to give Nick and I for xmas. I told my mom that we won't accept them at all because she's slandering my boyfriend but I know my mom will water it down to ""she doesn't feel comfortable accepting them"" and not give a reason.


I seriously don't know if I should just message Brittney directly and tell her that the only thing we'll accept from her is an apology and an admittance it wasn't fucking rape or just let my mom say what she does and leave it at that.

***Long story short:*** I \[16 AFAB\] had (still have) a crush on an online friend of 2 years \[15F\], I called her ""daddy"" as a joke then it escalated to what I think I could call sexting. I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said she liked me back but didn't feel ready for a new relationship because of her last one (I think her and ex-gf were together for 8 months). We continued with the flirting and sexual topics for 2-3 days then she said we should stop and just be friends. Jumping ahead in time after she broke off the friendship because of our ""adventure"" but we started being friends again after a week and a bit.

I felt and still feel dirty and used after that. Now she realized she's aromantic (pansexual) and the feeling got even worse. She said she loved me and I don't know what to think anymore. I feel like I was just a toy to her. I know for a fact if we aren't thousands of kilometers apart something *intimate* would have happened and that makes it even worse. I feel like a wh\*re. This was my closest experience with a relationship and it's absolute hell.

I would try to ask her for clarifications but I'm afraid she would leave me again because I would remind her of what happened. I can't take that, I have bad anxiety and attachment issues. I feel like all of this is all my fault and even tho she assured me that it isn't.

I know if we dated it wouldn't have worked out because we are young, very far away from each other and because I'm an absolute mess (I tried to commit suicide 2 times 3 days ago but not just because of this), so please refrain from trying to help my reminding me that it wouldn't have lasted anyway...

He doesn’t like doing these because he told me when he was in high school he had told his friends he was gay. He was then bullied about it and shunned by almost everyone at his school. He was without friends for a year or so and decided to try to make friends online. If you don’t know where this is going, he was then taken advantage of and sexually abused by these people. Recently we have had an argument about hanging out and says I don’t get it. And refuses to get help bcuz he says it’ll just lead to more hurt and issues. So if anyone has anyways I can help him or anything please let me know. Thanks in advance.",15Nov2019,1

Id like to ask her to leave but dont know how to do it in the best, most polite way (knowing there is probably no actual polite way to do it).

Wake up. Shower. Get dressed. Go to work. Come home. Eat dinner. Go to bed. Repeat.

Who really enjoys living like this? You sleep and work taking up two thirds of your day then showering and commute leave you with what? Six hours of a day to do what you want? Most of the time I feel like youd be to stressed from working. How do people live like this and genuinely be happy?

569,"Our relationship didn’t have the best start. We were in an LDR and our first meeting wasn’t one of those fairy tale meetings you read about on r/longdistance. But we continued to be with each other for almost 4 and a half years now. We’ve gone through the motions, talked things out and I felt like we were in a pretty good place. I one day came up from behind him while he was on his computer and realized that he was talking to his ex girlfriend, which raised an alarm in my head. I knew she was around but he never mentioned talking to her, which I feel like he should have out of respect? Anyway, I try to brush it off but couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was wrong and I ended up caving and snooping through his phone. I went back to these text messages from the very first time we met in person and read things that just made me feel so worthless inside. He apparently didn’t want to continue the relationship with me and wanted to stay friends, wanted to get back together with his ex, went on to profess his love for her and then point out everything that was wrong with me. Like little mannerisms or even my weight. I felt so crushed after that and present messages are her saying she should’ve gotten back together with him and still loves him. Constantly says I love you. He doesn’t say it back and seems to evade it but now I feel insanely uncomfortable and don’t trust anything he says no matter how reassuring he is. I asked if he talks to her often and he said no. I asked if he still had feelings he said not really. I asked if she still has feelings and he said yes. This happened a few months ago and to this day whenever I see her online I just immediately assume the worst. I feel like he settled for me and is with me only because she didn’t take him back all those years ago. I don’t know how to move on, honestly. I lost my trust and don’t know if I should tell him that I read all of those messages or if I should just leave it be.",15Nov2019,1

We kept on talking and she told me she doesn't eat and whenever she does, she forces herself to throw up, she told me she's envious of skinny people albeit she's pretty skinny herself and yeah, I told her it's possible that this could be anorexia(she didn't know what that is) and she should seek professional help., I didn't mention how dangerous anorexia can be since I am not a professional to diagnose her and because I didn't want to scare. I told her I am always here for her and she can always talk to me about it and that I'll always do my best to support her, but what would be the right approach towards this? How can I help her?

574,"Hey,

Last night at midnight my mum came into my room, telling me my grandma passed away at the hospital. It was fairly surprising, she was about to undergo surgery. My first thought was ”thank god“ and I felt relieved. I tried to avoid her as well as I could, only saw her when I was pretty much forced to on birthdays and Christmas etc.

I have never been able to meet up to her expectations. She was disappointed I am a girl and not a boy, she never liked any of the choices I made, she commented on my looks and also let me know what a disappointment and disgrace I am to the family, especially as I am lesbian. On our family gatherings her words would go in at one ear and out at the other, I always ”had to walk my dog“, yes I always walk her for 5h straight, or study. 

She was also very right wing, exactly as you’d expect someone to be born in 1934 in Germany. She hated foreign looking people with a passion, even writing a letter to the municipal office how they should get foreigners out of her field of view.

Yet I feel so guilty, it is so devastating. Imagine you spend your life so disrespectful of other that you are not missed. Is this really fair? Should I have spend more time with her? What are my values in life and who do I want to be? 

Today I was in uni and when I told people what happened they were like ”why tf are you here?“. And I thought because I feel indifferent about it, why not go about my day? That’s saddening. I hope I will never ruin my relationships in such a way",15Nov2019,1

I know that is my fault I guess I should of tried to go to college and get a better career but I can't change my past mistakes. 

Well my mom is going through what I'd call a mid to late life crisis and in some spur of the moment decision she decided to sell our home of 20 years. On top of that she didn't even really tell me until after papers were signed and we had a set date to be out by. So basically I was given 2 weeks notice I won't have a home anymore.

I really don't have many friends by choice and the ones I do arent in any way good off to be able to help me. Now normally I wouldnt care I'd maybe get a cheap motel room.and figure out what I'm gonna do. But I have a cat hes about 5 and however sad it sounds he is more or less a son to me. I'd never give him up or away I just can't and wont.

What do I do? My only other family my 2 grandparents passed away 3 years ago. My dad is non existant and I have noone to help me even though I have tried to help others my whole life.

I guess its pathetic of me to come here and ask random people on the internet what to do. The mentality of most around me is.just be a man doesnt matter the scenario. Being a man will only get me so far in today's economy and cost of living I have no other choice but to be homeless.

How can I be homeless and make sure my cat is taken care of. I don't want to lose him hes all I have. I live in Pennsylvania and it's about to be getting really cold here. I don't want him to die with me on the streets. I would feed him before I ate anything. Maybe my poor choices and mistakes in life make me deserving of this idk. But he doesnt deserve this.

Where do I even start with nothing? Sorry if this sounds pathetic or I sound dumb or anything heck you're prolly right. I am just a human being who lost his way and really wants to just be happy and live life. We demonize drug addicts and homeless but they are someone's son or daughter too. 

I just really need any advice on steps I should do or anything really. I am begging from the bottom of my heart that someone reads this takes it serious and can maybe give me ideas.

581,"I’ll try and keep this short. I (F) live with two guys (one is my bf one is a mutual friend) and I will start this off by saying I like things to be cleaner than the average person, I am an absolute neat freak, and I know that I can’t ask friend to be on my level of clean, BUT it’s less “messy” and more so gross kinds of things. My parents also bought this house for me (I’m in college) so I think that’s why it bothers me more (my parents are putting money into this house, I will be living here for many more years than the friend, etc.). What I’m asking for advice about is how to go about the conversation because I don’t want to start drama with the friend (two of my other guy friends lived with me my 1st year of college and it was absolutely horrible for that reason &amp; they ended up both moving out &amp; back home). I do enjoy cleaning for some odd reason, but on my own time and not cleaning up after someone else. I guess I’ll give some examples so you can see where I’m coming from.

The kitchen is always a mess, I can deep clean the heck out of it and literally the NEXT day it’s messy, crumbs, dishes, etc., which makes me not even want to clean at all. 
The bathroom upstairs (friends) has gotten to be so gross (pee on the seat, dirty counter) that I can’t even use it because I have to squat if I go in there. I understand that’s “his” bathroom so I can’t really say anything but it’s just annoying having to go downstairs just to go to the bathroom. The half bathroom downstairs has throw up on the toilet from one of friend’s friends getting sick and not cleaning it, I also understand this isn’t friends responsibility but he was the one who brought someone into our house that made a mess (I am soooo not cleaning up someone else’s throw up). Which leaves me with 1/3 bathrooms in the house being usable. 
I could vacuum every day and there would still be dirt and whatever else on the ground. 

So, what do I say? I was considering suggesting we hire a cleaner every so often &amp; split the price, hoping that he wouldn’t want to spend the money and start cleaning up after himself, but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to do that just to get him to start cleaning up after himself.

So the problem goes,
Supervisor doesnt know how to speak to her employees and is very rude. Has made faces at me whenever i dont catch what she says at first. At this point it feels like she is purposely been losing my checklist, to say i havent dont them, have i missed a few, yes i have it was like 3 of them but other than that i have kept up with it.

I can admit my faults, and I know lately ive been late to work by like 10-15min. We spoke about this a few weeks ago and she still bring it up.i have been getting better since we spoke and she admitted to it once but then keeps bring it up and saying that im late. My reason for being late is that i have been under a lot of stress with stuff going on on my personal life and another job i have been having to deal with because the manager there  unfairly gets mad at us for not completing a task that is meant for the manager to do. Late ly we got into it and she was explaining to me something in the checklist to which she kept changing what she meant when she wrote the checklist and expected me to know both meaning. I would tell her that she was changing what she was saying and she kept denying it and cantradicting herself. Another complaint she had against me was communication with her. At first it was good back and forth, but the her making faces at me and speaking rudely by demanding things instead of requesting or simply making something known for me to fix, made me not feel comfortable speaking to her anymore. Then she goes to say we need better communication after she speaks with me on day and says “ not happy with you... not happy with you.. im not happy with you” and then proceeds to walk away without saying anything else. Becuase of the all we had recently as, which happened as soon as i walked in, i left making everyone else known why i was leaving including  my (GM) except the supervisor due to the fact i  wasnt comfortable being around her anymore.  Now she is pushing for my suspension.

586,"Idk why I’m like this. I am so petty about “keeping score” I guess you can call it. If anyone does anything towards me, good or bad, I log it away in my mind and let it determine how I treat them, and i always tend to interpret people’s actions (or non-actions) in a negative way, like it was done purposefully towards me. Even when I know I’m being irrational about something, I still can’t stop myself from taking shit personally most of the time. 

For example, I work in a call center and we’re expected to answer phones by the second ring. We don’t get lunch breaks, we just eat at our desks while still taking calls. It’s basically an unspoken rule that when one person is eating, the other person(s) pick up most of the calls just to let their coworker eat for a few mins. If I’m eating and the other person doesn’t immediately lunge for the phone and I end up having to answer it, I get super angry for some reason even if I logically know they didn’t do it on purpose. I don’t take it out on them, I just file it away and hold it against them in my head 

Or like, before I wish someone happy birthday or buy someone a birthday gift, I think back to if they did the same for me and if they didn’t, then I won’t either. 

I hate that I’m like this. Why can’t I just do the good or right thing regardless of whether other people have done so for me before? How do I stop being so petty and caring whether or not the other person “deserves” a kindness?",15Nov2019,1

588,"I apologize as this is a lot to read. I'm going to start out by saying I love my mother very much, I am the youngest of her 3 children and some how the most financially stable and most adult. My mother has a history of not telling the truth as well as not admitting to it. So, About a 9/10 months ago (Jan/Feb of 2019) my mother was hospitalized for a unknown ringing in her ears, when they discovered her thyroid levels are off, due to her having her thyroid removed years ago from cancer they assumed it was from her medication being off. Turns out her pituitary gland was inflamed and had a mass on it. It was at this time I was told by my mother that if she didn't have it removed she could die in 7 months. I was devastated, I cried all the time thinking my mother was dying, I told my boss incase something sudden happened so I could take off work. Fast forward 7months, mom's still alive, she had a change in medication she seeing this doctor who she loves and she is being put on and off of disability for work due to her migraines. They do another MRI and discover not only did the original mass grow, but another has appeared. I'm terrified, thinking this is it she's going to die. She is getting these injections from an IV a few times a week to help with her migraines and her doctor schedules her a surgery for late November, but apparently doesn't give her a time. Fast forward to October I get a text from her that she is going to get a second opinion after seeing her Endocrinologist because she told her all this terrible stuff about the doctor she is seeing and how he is just sucking money from her she apparently also told her she should be absolutely terrified about her gland. To which makes me terrified again that I'm going to lose my mom. The endocrinologist ended up referring her to a different doctor. My moms intentions at this time are to keep her surgery date just incase, with the hopes that this new guy can get her in for surgery sooner. During this she claims she lost her job when she had to refile for disability, however the weekend prior she took a trip to New York when she claimed she had a migraine (and went a concert there). My mother starts seeing this new doctor late October and she tells me how this doctor is baffled at what is going on with her pituitary gland, he tells her that if she gets it removed and it was cancerous then she would have 6months left to live. So he wants to run tests just in case to see if it can be removed (ok, makes sense I guess) she takes all these tests that same day and goes in to see him the following week (now November) he then tells her he wants to run a final test to predict it's growth projection. This test is scheduled for Monday November 11th, a week and a half before her surgery date. After getting this test done she tells me that she is canceling her surgery for the following week because she likes this new guy so much (I have requested off work for this surgery, told my boss I might need to spend a few days with my mother afterwards depending on how it goes). Her appointment to go over the results was that Thursday November 14th. To which she decided she doesn't like this new doctor, and she feels he is just sucking money out of her and how she is going to go back to the original doctor to reschedule her surgery date. There are numerous in consistencies with her situation that does not make sense, and when I try to question something it gets dogded. I feel betrayed, for almost a year I've thought my mother was going to die, and I've gotten to a point that I don't know if I can trust anything she says because nothing is adding up. If the gland was so crucial to take out why was the surgery scheduled for two months out? Why did she trust her Endocrinologist who completely bashed another doctor? To me that's unprofessional. Why did she cancel her ""surgery date"" if she was so scared? According to her she just called and cancelled it, is that even something you can do? Please let me know if you would like any history on my mother, or any further explanation.",15Nov2019,1

This girl and I have known each other for about two months. We go to the same college and met in class.

In person this girl seems REALLY into me. She’s constantly touching me, laughing at everything I say, and stays behind after class ends to talk to me. In fact, she’s the one who asked me for my phone number in the first place. Since then, I have texted her twice. The first time I didn’t have class so I asked her if she wanted to get food. She replied after two hours saying that she had just gotten to school. I told her that my class had just started and she never replied. I didn’t think too much of this because the conversation was pretty much over. The second time I sent her this video I found online which related to a conversation we had that day. She read it but didn’t reply. 

I just don’t know if I should continue putting effort into a relationship with this girl. We only have a month left in the semester so I probably won’t see her again after if she’s not interested. I can normally tell if a girl is interested or not, but I can’t figure this girl out. I figure a girl will always reply to texts if she interested but this girl doesn’t, yet she is all over me in person. She’s not one of those people who constantly checks her phone but she definitely checks her texts and social medias somewhat frequently.

The only problem is, my mother is absolutely insane when it comes to athletics. Now, I should disclose that I'm not on an athletic scholarship or anything. Hell, I'm actually on an academic scholarship. Now that I'm on my own, I'm just not that into my sport anymore. Going to practice is a drag. So are the almost immediately on cue, ""How was practice?"" texts from my mom every day, evidently hoping to hear that I'm officially considered a god who pisses champagne and shits caviar by my team.

My mother has been **extremely** manipulative in the past. This ranges from screaming about how I suck behind closed doors when I had a bad football game when I was 11 (don't do football anymore), to threatening to divorce my dad if he didn't support her notion of buying a family lakehouse and boat. My Dad, Brother and I have all put up with it for years in hopes of keeping the family in good relations with each other.

But, I digress. She's coming up tomorrow to visit me at my college. I intend to confront her with my wishes. She will, without doubt, be incredibly upset and God only knows what she might do. She may threaten to take me out of my current college where I'm perfectly happy (and well into the process of becoming an airline pilot), or she may just shun me for being ""a quitter"" and letting all of my previous coaches and her down. It's my dad who's paying regardless, so how she's gonna pull that shit on me, I dunno. I'm also willing to get a part-time job to make up for any scholarship money I would've potentially forfeited. But, she's found ways to be manipulative in the past.

I was only like 12-13 and I wasn't interested so I never pushed anything. (Although I think I was always polite about it?)  After I went to high school, I never saw him because he still had one more year in the middle school. After he started high school, it never happened. We never talked anymore. So now I'm 20 and graduated a year and a half ago. I saw him at my college with some other people. I didn't say hi to him because I didn't know it was him until right before he left. It took me a good couple of minutes to realize who he was because tbh I forgot he existed until yesterday. Now I can't stop thinking about it because of how much he's changed and grown up and I'll probably never see him again because he goes to a different University and was just visiting someone. He probably wants nothing to do with me too.",15Nov2019,1

596,"I fell in love with this guy (gay) from college and at first we hit it off well and we started dating. I was a virgin and my first time and first kiss were with him.

During these two months, I noticed that he was often cute but insensitive to me with his relationship philosophies such as ""boyfriend is a heavy title that I can only give to someone very deserving"". So I pretty much had a relationship that didn't allow any romantic stuff with him because I was not worthy. 

He often treated me like an object, made dirty jokes and one time said that he loved my butt. Not me, my butt.

I tried HARD to get the chance to be his boyfriend but he was unwilling so I decided to step out of the relationship. Now he insists on being close and asks me to vent with him and hug him. I said it was creepy to deal with the breakup using him as support and that I needed some space, he just said that we'll talk about that later.

I blocked him on social media but I have this feeling in my head that I did something horrible. What should I do to start moving on and effectively avoid him in class?",15Nov2019,1
597,"I don’t know if my experience is serious or I’m over reacting to my situation. When I was travelling a few months ago, I had plans to take a ferry and had just got there. Ferry had already just left and I was bummed I had to wait another 5 days before another left again. That ferry drowned and 60 people died. 70 were rescued. I am really thankful I survived and am happy to be alive (more happy than usual) but when I’m drinking I can’t stop thinking about it and feel anxious and sad for the people (many children died) who were on the boat. I keep thinking about all the ways I could’ve been on the boat (if I woke up early it’s possible I could’ve been on it, if my Airbnb wasn’t booked by someone else for extra day I would’ve been on it, etc).

599,"So to tell my backstory in as few words as possible, a little over 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar depression. For the most part, it's manageable, but when I have manic episodes, the mood swings I have are very extreme and hard for me to deal with. The mood swings are never directed towards anyone and I've never endangered myself or anyone else, it's mainly extreme highs and lows in a very short period of time.

I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years now. It's a very healthy relationship and I love him very much. We intend to move in together in the next year or two, and we're both on the same page about pretty much everything as far as long-term goals, etc. Because he has not had very much experience with mental illness (he doesn't have one himself and has not had many people close to him that have one), I was very transparent with him about my diagnosis before we began dating and have been ever since. I do not ask him to go out of his way to console me and I try my best to keep it to my self so as not to burden him too much.

The only thing I ask of him is that he text me back when I'm having a breakdown. I never blow up his phone, I generally text him once to say ""Hey, I'm feeling low"" or something along the lines of that, and then I let him take his time to text me back. I think that it's been a tough road to get him to understand how important that communication is to me, but he's trying and the effort means a lot to me. Last night, however, felt different. He called me during a time where I was being very impulsive and I told him I was probably going through a manic episode, and he seemed frustrated that I wasn't elaborating further. We've been together for 2 years, I feel like at this point I shouldn't have to keep explaining that to him. Nonetheless, when we got off the phone, I sent him a screenshot of an article outlining the symptoms of my condition in hopes that it would clear things up for him. I accompanied the screenshot with a message apologizing if I worried him and an apology if he felt I wasn't being very clear. He didn't respond. I know he was at home doing work and was absolutely near his phone. I waited 4 hours, still no response, so I texted him again an to get his attention. I asked if he got my last message, he said yes, he read it, and assumed I would be fine. I didn't ask why he didn't respond, but I just asked that he check on me next time. I'm honestly just really really hurt by the fact that I felt so ignored last night. I was having such a hard time and I feel like I have told him so many times over the course of our relationship that I just need to know he's there for me when I'm going through it.

I know that my wellbeing is not his responsibility, but if we're going to be together long-term, then I feel like I should be able to depend on him to text me back when I'm having a break down at the very least. I'm frustrated that I have to keep laying this out for him every time and I'm just trying to put things into perspective. Am I asking too much of him? I just want to understand, there has to be a reason why he's just not getting it. I know that this is not an easy thing to deal with for either one of us, and I just don't know how to proceed. There are only so many different ways I can sit him down and explain how important this is for me, and at this point, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse. I would appreciate some advice on what I should do moving forward, and I would love to hear some different perspectives on this situation if possible.",15Nov2019,1
600,"Hi, so I’m in a bit of a pickle. Im a senior (12th grade) in high school and I’ll be graduating in may 2020. I’ve lived where I live now for about 3 years now and ever since I moved here I’ve felt very disconnected from the people I’ve met and have become friends with.
Specifically  I’ve been friends with this one girl since I moved here and our friendship started out as pretty toxic but got better but now more and more issues are arising in our friendship. I don’t agree with most of the things she says and does and it really bothers me. I’ve talked to her about it but she never listens to what I have to say. I’ve wanted to cut her off multiple times now but we share a lot of friends and I don’t want to lose their friendship either. Besides she can be a lot of fun as well but I feel like she’s dragging me down but she’s my ‘best friend’.
I also have other friends but our friendships don’t really extend much outside of school. I would say I’m pretty social so its not that i have a lack of friends or anything i just dont really like them at all.
I’ve stayed in contact with my friends from where I lived before but they naturally have their own lives going on. I have also joined clubs and other activities to meet new people but it never really leads to any new friendships either. 
I kind of want to cut off all of my friends here but I don’t want to ruin my senior year by doing so and regretting it and being lonely even though I still am now.
I know this probably sounds pretty trivial and I’m sorry this message is so long but it’s been really on my mind and its giving me mild anxiety and getting me down a lot of the time too. I really was just wondering if anyone had any advice on what to do",15Nov2019,1
601,"Let me start off by saying I am by no means irresponsible with this topic which may seem ironic after reading the title. I'm going to go right into it, I'm 17 and I've been dating my girlfriend for a bit over a year now and I truly adore her and I would spend the rest of my life with her if I could. We have sex almost every day but I never finish, she's on birth control but I don't because of that small chance. After this year of consistent sex I finally fucked up and of course the day I fuck up is the same day she didn't have any. I had spent the day with her and I kept reminding her to tell her mom to pick up the bc and she had called, told her in person and texted twice. But of course she didn't get it, the pharmacies were closed around here by the time she went back so she wasn't able to take it the night of. The next day her mom got it and from my research and call to Planned Parenthood I was told she should take two. So after the day missed she took the two bc pills and I went out and bought a Plan B she took that also. This was also all the week after her period so looking at all of this you'd think there's a tiny chance of her being impregnated but I'm very very sketched. She's showing so many signs of pregnancy and it's not the ""I'm nervous about something so I'm noticing everything relating to it"" but it's things I know for a fact she never experiences. She's getting acne which hasn't happened since she was 13, she has light brown discharge, her breasts are tender and she has a bigger appetite which may be our imaginations. I bought a pregnancy test and it said to take it 10 or so days before when you should be starting your period but I was eager and made her take it, It was negative but I don't think it's accurate in anyway. Other than the fact that this would be a fucking life and I'm 17, her parents are a bit batshit and I know for a fact that they'd kick her out if they could and try to kick her out. To add to all of this they're very wealthy for this area and I can't afford a lawyer right now. I need legal advice without getting a lawyer. I don't care how shit my life is I just want to be able to care for and give my child the best life possible if it ends up coming to that. I'm sure the people reading this won't take it seriously because of how worried I am and how I said I adore my high school girlfriend but it's true. She's extremely scared and I'm trying to comfort her and make her not worry but I have an intense feeling that she is pregnant. Some other things to add, my parents would most likely support me, my dad may not love me but I'm 85% sure my mom will still aid me through it. I work from when I get out of school until 11/12 (3-5 days) a week. If she gets kicked out they wouldn't let me see the kid and I know they can find a lawyer that will give them complete custody. I am in PA and I don't know enough about Child Custody Law to know anything.  


TLDR: I (17M) think I may have gotten my gf (16F) pregnant and her wealthy parents would prevent her from speaking to me and letting me see the baby and probably kick her out.

I appreciate all responses thank you for anyone who takes the time to read through and attempt to help me. &lt;3

603,"So I will be in a small predicament in the near future, so I decided to reach out to this sub to what other people think I should do.

I \[M19\] am currently taking a few courses in community college, and my sister is attending a public university about 100 miles away. Twice a week, I make the drive there and back home so she could attend class because she has no way of moving closer to campus at the moment, nor a way to drive herself there on her own.  We leave early in the morning and return home late in the evening, so when I'm over there, have to find ways to kill time until she gets out of class.  I've been going to the park to work out or going to the library to do homework and study for my classes, but the majority of the time I have there is wasted. Next semester, she will have to take classes three or four times a week, which puts me in the position of potentially taking a break from community college to fit her schedule into my own.  Would it be worth it for me to take a break from college and get a job where my sister attends school so I can earn money while I'm there, or is there something better I can do?",15Nov2019,1

606,"Hi Team, 
I'm going to try to make this short - it's a pretty long one. 

My parents have been on and off the shit for 11+ years (that I know of), and I'm finding out that 2019 is one of those ""on"" years. 
My fiance and I are crashing in the basement right now as well, because rent is outrageously expensive in Colorado Springs - so, were pretty stuck. 

Here are my main concerns: 

-I have a 13yo brother living in the house. Not only is his well-being at stake, but he is also missing a lot of school because of my parents. They tweak out, oversleep and then tell him ""too bad"". He is currently on an attendance watch. My other siblings are all adults and either are out of the house or have a way out, so I'm not too concerned about them.
-My fiance and I are stranded here until we are able to get a place/save up the money for one. We are storing some stuff in the garage and I am worried it will slowly start to disappear (as has happened before). Obviously, the best option is a storage unit, but we cant really afford it. 

-My parents have been bold-face lying to me about all sorts of things: stolen money, missing objects, missing/moved items, items that have been missing suddenly showing up in obvious places, etc.  The reason I bring this up, is because my fiance has a lot of expensive/important/what-have-you things that I'm almost certain will be sold for drugs, and I don't know how to hold people like that accountable to recover my shit.

I know this is a lot, but any advice anyone might have as to where to go next, or even how to pricess/cope with these things, would be greatly appreciated.",15Nov2019,1

610,"Hi guys, not sure if I should be posting this here, but here goes 

Got all 4 wisdom teeth removed on the 12th, all of them but one seem to have healed more or less and have stopped bleeding. However, there was a large cyst under the bottom right one and it was was removed during the surgery. 

It’s the third day and that specific bottom right area is still slightly bleeding and is still swollen and when I wake up there’s a bad taste in my mouth.

Should I be concerned? I’m on antibiotics and pain killers, I’m not sure if the area has become infected or is just taking longer to heal since a cyst was removed from that location too.

613,"Hi All, I'll start with some quick background

* Currently 26 years old, making $52k as an executive assistant in an academic medical center. 4 years of experience doing this total working up from a customer service rep when I first got in here in 2015.
* Originally went to college to become a medical technologist, switched to health care administration when I realized it would take me longer to finish college plus the med tech program required a full time, year long, unpaid internship. I wanted to move out of my mom's house ASAP. Graduated in 2015. Currently living with my boyfriend of 1.5 years and paying him $300/month in rent.

I'm feeling pretty lost on my end goal for my career. I don't know how to figure it out. Right now I'm on a path of least resistance to making $65k before I turn 30. I work to live, and right now I don't really care what I do as long as I can provide myself and my future kids with a great life. I come from a divorced family and my mom taught me that I never want to be financially dependent on anyone. However, I also have seen the downside of being in a big leadership role, despite getting paid $200k+, and I don't necessarily need to have this huge legacy.

I'm a really quick learner so I am decent at a lot of things, and my job requires me to be the jack of all trades so it's a good fit now. I like the variety of work that I do. But I don't necessarily want to spend my entire career being the right hand of a top executive. My work ethic really helped me get to where I'm at, but my latest promotion to an executive assistant has made me slow down on my work output a little bit and question what comes next. Measly yearly merit raises is not going to get me to where I need to be, so I feel like I'll need to job hop again in a couple years. 

In the meantime, I'm supposed to be registering for classes Monday for an MBA program in which I'll get \~70% reimbursed for by my employer, with no long term commitment requirements. I feel like I should take advantage of this benefit and pay for the rest as I go while I can (especially before kids). However, I don't know what I'll do with the degree when I'm done. My company does need a lot of project managers and pays them well, but it seems to be a job for the well-seasoned in very specific specialties, and I'm getting very broad experience right now. I'm also interested in finance stuff but it seems like that ship has sailed because all finance people here have done their time as a billing and coding clerk, and I definitely don't want to go back to school for that and go backwards in salary.

I guess I'm just curious how you figured out what you wanted to do? Is there anything you would suggest to help me figure myself out?",15Nov2019,1

As far as I understand he wasn’t pretending to shoot anyone or anything like that. He just pulled it out of his pocket and was showing the other kids and his teacher freaked out and sent him to the principal. The principal called me and told me that she would not take disciplinary action this time just that we need to talk about it at home. She said unfortunately with the world we live in that they take stuff like that pretty seriously. My son is 5 in kindergarten and plays video games like Fortnite and cuphead. Should I not let him play those games? Should I not let him play with nerf guns? How can I explain to him why they were so upset with him?

627,"I'll be concise. 19yo M, I consider my high school years to be pretty okay, didn't go out much but I was happy. Time to go to university, my last summer before it I spent having my first anxiety attack and dreading life because of some life events, an the exact same day summer ended and I was supposed to start uni, my mother (whom I live with) moved to another city far away. What does that mean?

In my country, you go to uni during the week and in weekends you go back to your parent's house, high school friends usually hang out during weekends and it's a nice disconnection from the classes. But I can't because my mothers house is now in a small city, too far from my birth town, where I know nobody and where I can't even get to know no one because there's only kids and I'm just here like 2 days a week or less.

So my week is spent in the city my university is at, studying for a really hard degree that consumes me (although I've been doing good in comparison to most people in it) and my weekends are spent alone in front of my computer while all my friends are hanging out, going to bars, having a nice time, riding motorbikes and driving to nice places.

I feel I'm wasting my time. I only spend summer in my birth place and people are starting to grow distant from me because I'm the only one who's not there the entire year. And when I finish uni, I'll start working and no more summer, no more hometown, no more nothing.

I seriously don't know how to be happy about my life. Could you guys please let me know what can I do?

629,"\[Please note I understand this is not r/ Legaladvice but i feel my situation is not fitting for that subreddit.\]

I live in a townhouse apartment complex in Salem, Oregon for context.

About 3 years ago we got new a management company and so far the landlord/manager has not cared about anything us tenants are concerned about. Some time last summer (I'd say around late July 2018) people stopped picking up after their dogs when they go to the bathroom and its gotten to the point of there is dog poop everywhere. We have complained to the manager and to corporate. She just sent out a letter stating our pet lease agreement and didn't make any effort to clean up the piles or anything. I have even witnessed her not clean up after her own dog.  Just outside of my back porch there is several piles that do not belong to our dog (we always pick up after her) and the piles are also molding. My back porch also happens to be directly off the playground we have. 

I am getting very frustrated and worried this may be a health problem but every time we complain we get brushed off. 

We also have people dump their cat litter trays on the ground outside of the garbage cans, which I know is a health hazard and it disgusts me. (I had to throw away my slippers today cause of this)

So what I want to know: What can I do about this situation? I don't feel safe being around all the poop. Its pretty nasty. 

Note: We have proof of which households don't clean up and that hasn't gotten us anywhere.  
Note 2: I can also provide pictures of how much poop their is if anyone wants",15Nov2019,1

632,"Hi everyone, I'm at a bit of a loss here and really need some food for thought.

TL-DR: I recently realised that a friend doesn't really care about me. And while I don't want to share any personal stuff with her anymore, I also don't just want to ghost her out of my life, that's just not cool. What do I do? 

Full story:

We were very close in the past and I was there for her and helped out, when she needed it. She also really likes to overthink stuff and gets into drama often. Mainly because she doesn't establish boundaries. She complaines about it a lot. We never had any drama going, so it was more or less fine by me, even if I was sometimes tiring to hear the same stuff again and again. But still I tried to stay supportive and honest in a sensitive way. 

Now, I don't really talk about a problem until I feel I can't figure it out myself. And those are also usually problems that have nothing to do with other people. 

Now, the last few times I really had a problem and came to talk to her about it or if I needed her help with something, she was very insensitive, unwilling to help or had some kind of excuse as to why she can't make time for me.

I let it slide several times, since she was stressed. But I'm really full of it. So I stopped telling her stuff.

Recently she began trying to freshen up the contact and says she is sad that she doesn't know what is happening in my life.

So now, I feel like I can't really confront her with it, without her making a drama out of it. And I'm really not up for it. I know from listening to her endless ruminations on situations that were not worth the time she spent thinking about them. I'm pretty sure she doesn't even realise how she only seems to want a happy dumpster, not a person, as a friend.

So, welp, what to do?...",15Nov2019,1

Okay, so recently my closest friend attempted suicide and since that terrible day, I've always felt guilty like I might have been one of the reasons although he denied it. He left school and started taking some meds and since then he has been ignoring his other friends and family except his parents and brother, and me. It's been 5 days and he hasn't replied to my texts. We live far from each other. I understand how sad he is (also the meds which make him feel numb) but he's so important to me and actually he's the only one who I open up to. Also till 3 days ago, he played online games at the time when I was at school. I am going through difficulties too and i really need him, and I know that now he's ignoring me too. One part of me is angry because he left me through my toughest times but my other part thinks that starting a fight with him is only going to show my selfishness.

636,"There is a lot of backstory that I am going to have to skip for the sake of brevity but the short version is this.

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday I was getting food with a friend and someone I used to know (lets call her Jen) showed up. They acted friendly, gave me a hug (twice) and  invited me to a social gathering in the future. I invited her and group of friends so sit with us, and this is where the trouble started. You see Jen started hanging out with my ex after we broke up, and stopped hanging out with me. The first thing Jen tells everyone is that I dated my ex. She even reiterated it. Then she asked a few questions that almost seemed designed to knock me down a peg. Like ""are you still renting a cheap room?"" and ""how long did it take you to move all your stuff out of your ex's place?"" and ""I hear you've been living on top ramen and getting sick?""... all in front of my friend and her friends. Keep in mind, my ex is a lying cheater, who always undermined my self confidence, spread gossip, and tried to distance me from my friends. Meanwhile Jen was a person that I had bailed out of trouble multiple times and never done anything to hurt, and was by her own omission a ""good friend"". Anyway, I walk away from the table for a second and she starts to grill my friend on how we know each other and such. Then when I come back she starts to ask a bunch of questions to figure out my daily schedule. She also keeps complaining about her mel so i offer to take it to the waitress and have them fix it. She lets me, but when I get back she acts like I wronged her somehow. Then finally as we leave I offer to hug her again and she doesnt even look at me. I say ""call me"" and she says ""Ill think about it.""

Over all I feel like I got played somehow. I immediately felt ""dirty"" for lack of a better word, and Ive felt this imposing sense of depression and dread since, despite the fact that before this encounter I felt great and I really dont care if this person is in my life anymore or not. I feel like I am missing something, like some crucial detail, and I feel like something bad is going to happen.",15Nov2019,1

640,"This is kinda a long story so buckle your seat belts. So I met this girl at the end of the summer, by the third time we hung out, she seemed to take a liking to me. We became part of this new friend group of about 10 kids, and we would often have parties together. I think i took things too slow, and some other guy in the friend group basically snagged her from me and they ""dated"" for about a month before she broke things off. The friend group fell apart after that, and now all that remains is me, her, and two other close friends of mine. Shortly after she stopped talking to the other guy, she began texting me pretty flirtatiously. I'm not gonna get into the exact things she said cause some of them are pretty awkward, they're mostly about sex and her basically hinting that she wants something physical with me. The next time I saw her in person after she sent all those texts, she was acting different, always staying super close to me, staring at me when i wasnt looking, a few times walking away from everyone else to be alone with me (There are way more small things that occurred but thats the gist of it. Even one of my friends in the friend group whos known her for years admits that she acts odd around me. I never flirted back much because I assumed she didnt like me considering she dated that other guy for a month. I decided that I was taking too long to make a move, so the next time I saw her in person, I told her how I felt, and I was fairly confident she would feel the same. But nope, she didnt really say anything, no ""I'm sorry I don't feel the same way"" or ""I think we're better off as friends"". She basically just sat there and listened. I left heartbroken, and for the rest of the day she was distressed and quiet. The next few times we hung out, things werent awkward, she always greeted me with a big hug and i kept catching her staring at me with this look that I cant explain. I just don't know what to do, I know 100% for a fact that she likes me a lot as a friend, as much as some of her friends shes known for 10x longer. But I still get this feeling theres something more to it, I don't know whether to just stop talking to her, start talking to her more, start flirting a bit, I'm just so confused.   


Also another important thing to add is that she went through a really bad breakup that left her depressed before I met her, and dated two other guys but ended it after a month each time. So I don't know if maybe shes afraid to get into another relationship and possibly it not working out again. She also says she isnt looking for a relationship until college, but that doesnt seem to be true. I really think I have a chance but I just don't know what route to take.",15Nov2019,1

I was polite and I think he was drunk, but I just had small talk and refused to have a ciggarette with him because I was with my mates from college at another table. He said he had seen me with them, but when I scanned the room, he wasn't there- or at least not sat on a table in the same room. He later came up to me and gave me a piece of cardboard from a packet of filters and explained that he wanted me to have it. He said something along the lines of ""see, I wouldn't normally do this, and I just need friends. I don't expect you to or anything, it's absolutely fine, but yeah. I'll be off now"" and left. He looked quite nervous, but again, I was polite. It had his number on it. I turned to my friends who were still at the table. A lot of them felt bad for him, as did I, but then I asked myself if it was really a good idea. Maybe I've heard too many stories or whatever but I know how badly these things can go.

Maybe there's a reason he doesn't have friends? Maybe he's secretly an emotionally manipulative person? Or maybe he's just depressed.
I wouldn't know, I barely know him. All I know is that he sees his mother, and his girlfriend lives an hour's drive away from where I live... And that they were ""having problems"" so that's by he needed to visit her. That was probably 2 months ago or so. Other than that, we like the same music, and he says he feels alienated because he doesn't know anyone who shares the same music taste. I think what worries me is the fact he's a stranger.

651,"This is really difficult to get off my chest because I feel like I’m just being over dramatic haha, but I just need advice on what to do 🤷‍♀️

Basically, I’m in my last year of school and for the past few months a lot of my friends have been totally ignoring me. It used to be mostly when I was upset (which I know was wrong but tbh I wasn’t the easiest to talk to at times) but lately it’s been a lot more often and they’ve made absolutely no effort to involve me. I’ve also seen and heard a lot of people snickering at me or saying nasty things to each other about me. However, I tried not to let it get to me because I know that teenagers can just be like that sometimes and it doesn’t always have to mean something.

This week has kind of been awful though - my ‘friends’ got really angry at me and told me I was ungrateful because I didn’t appreciate them enough, I have family issues, and my boyfriend broke up with me. My ex-bf and my ‘best friend’ were on FaceTime when he broke up with me and they’ve met up every day since then, and they were also very close when we were together which I tried to speak to them about; neither of them see any issue with it. To top it all off, no one even asked me if I was ok (I get totally ignored, not exaggerating).

My ex and ‘friends’ have also told the school and my family about my problems and me being upset, which I asked them not to do as it’s humiliating and my family didn’t handle it well. It all just felt like they were doing it to upset me rather than help, because this has been going on for months and no one has ever tried to help.

I found out today that pretty much everyone in my year thinks I’m a ‘freak’ and hates being around me - I never really thought I was that weird. Yes, I’m not the loudest or most outgoing but I try my best to be friendly and I thought I got on quite well with most people, but it turns out they’ve all been talking about how weird I am for months.

I moved away from home to my sister and husband's place this july for college. Her husband had stage 4 colon cancer, so we knew what was going to happen but didn't know it what happen as soon as it did. He went to Italy a week after I moved in since health care was free over there, but due to some paper work complications, he wasn't able to get chemo for about 4 months and eventually passed away. Now my sister has all of his debts and bills to pay off, is unable to finish college, all while griefing.

It's been about two months since he died and I'd say my sister is coping pretty well. Of course she is still sad, but she has a lot of friends and support around her to the point where I know she should be fine.

As for me, college has been rough. I have to wake up at 6 to take the bus for an hour to get to school. I finish at 2pm and go to work at 5pm until 10pm and get home roughly around 11:00 to 12:00. My co-worker lives between my school and work place and was saying how he needed another roommate. He's really cool and living only 10 minutes from school and my work place would be really convenient  for me.

She pays no bills and works 35 hours a week. She literally spends all of her money on eating out. Which is fine, unless she wants to eat out with my best friend and one of us ends up paying for her. Then it is a problem. She talks about us behind our backs, she tries to tell us what to do, her voice is hard to listen to, and she is purely obnoxious. 

Suffice to say, I do not like my best friend's sister, however, I am I a situation where removing her is impossible. My best friend is too nice to get rid of her, and my friend group doesn't want to exclude her, so I need help and tips to be civil.

TL;DR: I need help being civil with someone I can't stand.",15Nov2019,1
658,"My parents have been (for the most part) happily married for 22 years. They have 4 children together with the youngest being 6. Today my mother came to me and told me that my dad said he didn’t love her anymore and couldn’t keep pretending for the kids. He is also kicking her out, taking their car, and already made a separate bank account where he has been putting all of his money. My mom was just diagnosed with Lupus and can only work part time jobs because she can’t be on her feet for long periods of time because of her health issues. But she keeps fighting, she’s quit smoking cigarettes, started eating healthy, and trying to go to the gym at least once a week. Now she is devastated, depressed, and doesn’t know where to live.  She’s worried she will never get to see my younger siblings because they will have to stay with my father and she’s thinking about just living in a hotel.

He posted about being lonely and his friends not wanting to talk about personal stuff (his depression i think), but he never brought anything like that up that in conversation with me and if he did i would be glad to help him. I don't know what to do should i bring it up to him?

Please any advice is welcomed

664,"First, background information. I adopted this dog four years ago when he was 1-year-old. Shortly after adopting him, his previous owner contacted me. From her I learned she surrendered him after he bit her granddaughter (not a bad bite, but he got skin and it was intentional). I also learned he was taken from his litter when he was 5 weeks old. I feel this really damaged his social development.

&amp;#x200B;

Other context: For the sake of this story, the dog I'm questioning is White. My other dog is Brown, and my cat is Marble. I am a stay-at-home-mom with a four-month-old baby.

&amp;#x200B;

The first issue is how territorial White is. If I let the dogs out, Brown will pee, and White will zip right to that spot and pee in the exact same area. When Brown poops, White runs over and humps him unless I intervene. When I bring something new into the house, all the animals come over to investigate. White will growl at the other two and post up as Guard of the Object unless I intervene. When I'm eating, I'll sit down, and White will sit as close as I allow him and keep the other two away. He will randomly pick a room and decide the other two can't enter. If I give the dogs bones, White will just stare at Brown. This makes Brown nervous, so he just stops chewing. So they're both laying across the room from each other, tense, not enjoying their bones. If I seperate them, White just sits at the edge of whatever room he's in, wanting to check on Brown. I just feel like he's the house bully.

&amp;#x200B;

The next issue is how he interacts with me and my husband. He will follow RIGHT behind us. Like, an inch. If I stop, he runs into me. If I need to turn around, I'll trip. This has become much more concerning now that I am frequently carrying a baby. Of course I'm aware of this behavior so I take precautions, but when I'm trying to accomplish my long to-do list every day, this really gets old. Another behavior is he will bark AT us. Like, I call him inside, he sits down and barks at me. I tell him to go into his crate, he barks at me.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to another issue. I constantly feel guilty. The huge majority of my interactions with him throughout the day are negative. ""Move,"" ""Out,"" ""Off,"" ""Go,"" etc. To counteract this I will give him rub downs or a quick training sit-down-stand session so he can earn treats and praise. I also take him outside to play, or use interactive food toys with him. But on top of all the other things in life, he is just so high maintenance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I come out of the room from putting my baby down for a nap, White has gotten into SOMETHING. Right now the damn diaper garbage can is strewn behind me for the second time today and he wrecked one of my son's toys. I know it's White because I often catch him, and Brown is just chilling on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

Before it's asked, I have him trained to the best of my ability. This is where I feel being removed from his litter really damaged him. He knows general obedience well. He is crate trained. He loves new people. But when he's just ""being himself,"" no commands or anything, he's a needy shadow who bullies the other animals, and he has been like this all four years I've had him.

&amp;#x200B;

My feelings boil down to: He makes my life worse. I feel he makes the life of everyone in the house worse. And that makes me SO SAD. No poor dog should have that much negativity on them, directly or indirectly. I feel he would be much happier as a single dog, so he could get all the love and attention. I just don't feel I'm the right human to offer him happiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

My trepidation is what if he ends up with someone worse than me? I am a very internally angry person. I don't yell at him or hit him. I really try to infuse his day with as much positivity as I can. What if he irritates his next owner, too, and they're cruel? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am nervous posting this because Reddit is so pro-dog (rightly so!). I just want to convey that this is tearing me up, and I really feel I have done everything in my power to help him. But that just isn't enough. I feel like garbage about the whole situation. I would love some advice on how to navigate this. Thank you.",15Nov2019,1

667,"I don't think I have any sentimental value to my trash. It's just trash. I'm a minimalist when I'm not building a landfill. I was in the military, I know how to keep my shit on point. I'm a professional cook, I know my sanitation. Yet, I live in a mini landfill. I clean, it comes back. Family pays for a company to clear everything out, and a year later I have my landfill back. I only own the most basic furniture, no decorations, but a home full of trash.



Best part is, I paid my therapist to tell me to just keep having someone throw my trash away. Because that totally fixes the problem. So I'm getting a new therapist.



The reason I hoard is because my trash is my shame. And growing up my mom and grandma would go through my trash, and then punish me for anything they didn't approve of. So I have a lovely feedback loop of trash is my shame, people can't see my shame, so people can't see my trash. And people can't see my trash if I live in my own private landfill, and never let anyone see it. It doesn't help that my grandmother was a hoarder as well, and my mom thinks stuffed animals are sentient.



I try dealing with my trash by thinking that the trash is my mom and grandma, or emotional baggage, and not my shame. It gets the house clean, but I'm not changing anything. It's no different that paying someone to throw it away.



How the hell do I stop? I haven't cooked in my home kitchen in 10 years. I'm a professional, and I live in a god damn landfill because I can't break the behavior despite knowing the cause. I don't want to die in a landfill, and I don't want to be that goblin lady from Labyrinth. It's all junk, but I still can't throw it away.



Cherry on the cake is I'm a tad agoraphobic. I can obviously get out the door, but I spend about 10 minutes dancing with the door before that happens. Some days I think I should just go back to the psych ward. I didn't hoard in the military, and I didn't hoard in the psych hospital. It's boring as hell, but at least there's no trash.",15Nov2019,1

673,"So. The situation I got going on right now is my sister and I got into a fight. But I went a bit extreme and said I didn’t want to see her when she came home for thanksgiving from Washington. (She currently lives with her husband there, as he is in the navy.) so I haven’t seen her in two years. She had a baby a few months ago. 
But before she moved, my mom put her cable bill in my sisters name. After almost two years of her being gone, my mom never changed it. And now, a debt collector is telling my sister she owes $500. My sister then texts me telling me she’s going to call the cops on my mom. I told her I’d pay for it because I didn’t think it was appropriate to get my mother arrested before thanksgiving. She then started arguing that I shouldn’t stick up for our mother. I told her if she called the cops, I would refuse to see her. And she messages me saying “I’m not calling the cops. But I don’t want to see you anyways”

674,"Ok so this is somewhat of a long story, but I will do my best to keep it concise. This girl started talking to me early in the semester, we found out we are basically in every class together. I developed a small crush on her but part of me knew that she wouldn't be a good fit since she parties a lot and does various drugs, and I don't. Anyway we sit together in most of our classes, tend to get lunch together after class, and help each other with studying/homework. As the semester went on I suspected that there was a guy that she was hooking up with, and that is fine by me because it allowed me to silence my crush a bit.  This week I had mentioned to her that I needed to figure out how to get to the mall via bus, and she offered to drive me to the mall since she has a car on campus. I needed warm clothes because I have practice at night and I am freezing my balls off. I needed these clothes by Friday, and I told her that what ever day works for her since she is driving. We came to the conclusion that Thursday would work. So on Thursday about an hour before the end of class we were talking about going to the mall, and I double checked that we were going and she said yes. Once class was over we were walking together and she tells me that she forgot that she made plans to see a friend she hasn't seen in a while. I give her a look and ask her did she actually forget, and she said no and that she had made the plan about 20 minutes ago. Now I would be okay with this if this was a friend she actually hadn't seen in a while, but it was actually just the guy she hooks up with. So basically she ditched our plans to have sex, and this rubbed me the wrong way. She promised me that we would go today, Friday, and we did. I am still pretty annoyed at what she did, but I am not sure if my emotions are being clouded or not. I was not in a good mood today, and she called me out on it but I gave her some excuse as to why I was grumpy. So how should I handle this situation?",15Nov2019,1

I’ve spent the last three years at university far away and always travelled home frequently(I got very home sick). There I met my partner, J, and we moved in together. Each Christmas we celebrated a few days early together then went to our respective homes for the 25th. His family are roughly a five hour drive from mine, we both lived very far from home at uni. 

Since finishing university we’ve moved into a flat in my hometown, round the corner from my family and I see them a lot! 

But I’ve got to make plans for Christmas. Because my partner won’t want to spend Christmas with noisy children (J has Aspergers) but won’t travel to his family home because he’s working around Christmas. 

I want to spend the day with him but I desperately need to spend the day with my family too. Even the thought of missing their Christmas morning makes me upset. But leaving him home alone is awful too. 

I understand that I could do the morning with my family and the afternoon with him but the morning is the most special part of the day to me. His family are older and don’t get nearly as excited about Christmas as mine do, but I want him to be part of the Christmas fun because I was our (mine and my partners) future Christmas’s to be as full of excitement as mine. 

I’m also struggling because visiting my family home while they’re in the midst of celebrating Christmas is something extended family do; and I’m not extended family. I’m their big sister.

701,"I’m in my mid twenties and recently moved out of my parents’ house. I had an enmeshed relationship with my parents, and I’m reluctant to rely on them again for advice, money, emergencies, or other more casual things people will sometimes accept family help for. I’ve also been pretty socially isolated, so when I need to fill out “emergency contacts” on forms or I need help moving furniture, I don’t know have a go-to solution. I figure out an acceptable solution, one way or another. But it feels like I’m imposing when I ask friends, coworkers, roommates, or siblings for help with these kinds of things. When I need help I’m often more comfortable hiring a business or asking support communities for advice. It is also easier to ask for help from friends in a similar position as me because they feel more open to asking me for things too.

The way things are feels lonely. I guess it would help to form more, closer bonds with friends and start being more neighborly.

It scares me a bit though that I don’t know if these people would be there for me “no matter what”. Like if for some awful reason I get hospitalized or something, a spouse or close relative seems like the support system I’m expected to have, but I’m single and on bad terms with my parents, so I don’t have that. I guess if that were to happen, I could rely on my parents, and possibly my siblings too but...

IDK. If I want closer bonds with people I guess I need to prioritize having them in my life. I tend to let it fall by the wayside. Socializing is something I’ve either disliked or seen as a distraction. Even now, I have trouble shaking the idea that socializing is the indulgent, irresponsible thing to do when work needs to be done. And I sure have work to do.

For the record, I have always had the intention of moving out, it's simply a matter of when.

My gut is telling me to quit my stupid job, find a full time job that doesn't drive me insane, and if this new job isn't career-related, work on finding one that is - all while living on my own or most likely with a roommate. The change of scenery might help me get out of the house more so that would solve my social life issue. 

I may have just answered my own question, but I'm interested in knowing if anyone else had this problem as well and overcame it by moving out. Any other advice is appreciated of course.",15Nov2019,1

708,"I have a friend who I have known in real life for quite some time, and she is honestly one of the sweetest, most down-to-earth people I know.

In real life she's one of those people that basically everyone likes.

She's very ""charming""

The problem is that she represses a lot of stuff and this manifest online in her adopting what basically amounts to multiple personalities.

She does not feel comfortable being herself so online she pretends to not just be someone else, she pretends to be a lot of other people. 

The one piece of good news is that she's never been harmful about it. She has never catfished anyone, she has not conned anyone for money or anything like that. So she's not being evil about it.


If she was just having harmless fun completely, and exploring other roles to take on I wouldn't really even have an issue.


Obviously I'm posting this because she's not just having harmless fun. These personas that she's made have pretty much taken on a life of their own, and they are I believe affecting her mental state.


An example of this is that both of us are into role play.

She has one persona where she is willing to do the dirtier kinds of RP, and another one where she's pretty much only SFW.

When she came clean to another friend about both accounts of being hers she was no longer able to role play with that person because now it felt too weird for her. As she could not separate her personas. 

I do gather that it seems as though the majority of her issues stem from thinking she does not really matter.

She has even straight-up said this to me before. that who she is, her opinions, desires, stuff she's interested in don't really matter when compared to everyone else.

I'm sorry for rambling so much. I probably could have just said my friend has low self-esteem, and creates different personalities to try and be accepted, please help.

I love my friend, but I sometimes feel like I don't know how to properly help her with this particular issue.

715,"
So I’ve been debating writing this a long time. As I get older I begin to realize more and more that my parents treat me (23F) different than my two sisters (17F and 20F).

Growing up as the oldest of 3 girls, I’ve always felt forced to have the biggest sense of responsibility. This is fine, I feel like this has given me the drive to do well in life and pursue things for myself. The problem is that I feel like my sisters are handed everything by my parents.
 
A few examples:

-my parents encouraged me to attend a private high school, pushed me to get good grades, and held me to a very high standard academically. I got into a good college 6 hours away from home to study biology. My sisters went to the public high school, earned average-sub par grades without consequences, and coasted into the party college close to home. They aren’t sure what they want to do with their lives yet, and just fill their schedules with easy electives and partying. 

-My parents were constantly on my ass about earning scholarships. I submitted multiple applications and got about 75% of my college tuition paid for. I took the last 25% out in loans under my own name. My sisters never applied for a single scholarship. My parents took out 100% of both their tuition money in loans under my parents names. My sisters are not expected to pay this back.

- I worked two jobs throughout college and sold my plasma to pay for rent / food / clothes etc. Neither of my sisters have jobs and my mom pays them through Venmo for anything they need 

- I bought my own car after months of saving and cutting back. My car payment is manageable but kind of holds me back from building my savings back up. I had to buy a car to be able to get to work when it snows. My sisters were both gifted cars for free by my parents

-This one is probably due more to distance, or at least that’s what I like to tell myself. My parents visited me when I was in college once a year for a football game. When it comes to my sisters, they attend multiple events a month and have never missed a dads/moms weekend. 

I want to talk to them about this but don’t want to seem ungrateful for everything they have done for me. I also don’t want to put a strain on our relationship or the relationship with my sisters. How should I bring it up?",15Nov2019,1
716,"In my class there is a girl I had a crush on in 5th grade. I thought I got over her but then had a crush on her in 6th grade. After that I really tried forgetting her, or atleast getting over her. I even told myself she is a bad person, which she is not. A couple of weeks ago it turned out I still am in love with her. I already told hery but now it reached the point where I am jealous at her having fun with other people. I also sometimes drobe across her house, in hope of meeting her. Why am I posting it here? Because she said like 2 years ago PUBLICLY she isnt liking me at all. It could have changed, but she sidnt make it clear. She already knows I an into her again. U stull love her. Like really love not just 'dang boi nice butt' like real love, but I dont know its only from me and not from her too.

I'll try keep this simple. 
So I am employed as a casual in customer service and have been for nearly two years, the rare occasion I need to call in sick they request a doctor's note. I'm very confused though as I am expected to have $80 to simply see a doctor, they don't reimburse me the money for the note as I am casual and also don't give me any shifts to have money anyway. 

There is no where in company policies that state if a doctor's note must be provided for casual members, though it does state that each manager can have different rules to this.

721,"There’s a child in my family (we’ll call them Sam) who I believe to be autistic. Sam has not been professionally diagnosed, but a few child care workers in a program that worked closely with them have suggested the possibility. I want so badly to be close with Sam, but their behavior and lack of conventional emotional responses are hard for me to understand. There are even other members in my family who dread having Sam around because of their constant meltdowns. I have recently caught myself saying out loud that I’m *trying* to love Sam, for which I feel so horrible about. I feel like love should come naturally and that I shouldn’t have unintended reserves about it just because Sam is difficult. That isn’t fair to them at all. This is why I’ve decided to ask for advice.

Sometimes, Sam is violent and my kids are beginning to fear them. Sam has even gone as far as to intentionally(?) kill an animal before. Sam showed no remorse or understanding of the situation afterwards, so it may have been an innocent accident and they just didn’t fully grasp the magnitude of what they had done. There are also frequent incidents where Sam exhibits extremely inappropriate behavior, such as touching and even trying to put their mouth on peoples breasts, butt, and genitals. It makes me so uncomfortable when I have to call Sam down for these things, and their parents just laugh it off and act like Sam was just trying to be affectionate/funny. Sometimes, when I’m talking to Sam, I feel like that child is looking straight through me. It’s like I’m not even there. They’ll listen to what I say and sometimes respond, but it’s like there’s just no connection between them and reality. It’s the strangest thing. There are even times when Sam will cover their eyes when I look at them. Maybe they’re afraid of me? And I know this will sound terrible, but even on the rare occasions that Sam gives me a hug, it’s like there’s no connection or warmth there. I don’t know how to explain it. It’s like hugging a mannequin. I have come to realize that there are a lot of people on the spectrum that use reddit and also their loved ones, so if there is any advice you can give me on how to be closer with Sam I would appreciate it so much. I would normally use the internet to research this but I would rather have real people offer advice to this kind of situation.",15Nov2019,1
722,"So the past couple of weeks, my girlfriend and I have been having a rough couple weeks. We haven't been talking as much since she wanted time to work on school stuff and she wouldn't get any work done if she was texting me, which is understandable. I think the space and lack of talking has caused us to kind of drift apart cause I noticed that she hasn't been as affectionate over text, but every now and then it returns and I'm beginning to think it's just cause she's stressed over school. I got into an accident on Tuesday and I was pretty shaken up, I talked to her a bit and she said I could spend the night. We stayed up for a bit talking and I thought things were good between us. I even asked her multiple times if she was upset or if she was doing good and whatnot, and she always said she was doing alright. Drove home the following night (Wednesday night) and the weather was shit again, she was saying things like ""Drive home safe and text me when you get home"" and it was reassuring that she cared. I texted her a little blurb when I got home and I never got a text back. Figured she'd fallen asleep and I'd hear from her in the morning. Nothing. Sent her a cute little message on snap in the morning just saying how I appreciated the fact that she let me spend the night and what not. She just left that on read. I didn't think too much of that, but she typically responds to those. And then I texted her asking if we could talk about some stuff between us and she didn't respond to that (She did open some insta post I sent her previously so I know she saw the text). It's kinda outputting cause she's not one to typically ignore my texts and stuff, although it's been happening more and more since she wanted space for school and whatnot. I kinda figured I'm gonna give her the space now and let her come back, but I did want some third party input. Am I thinking about this too much? Should I just let things be? Should I follow up later? I just don't know what to do right now.",15Nov2019,1

726,"I am 21, F, but I feel like my life just ended. I have nothing to achieve anymore. I live aborad where I moved three months ago, I work part time job and can't afford extra language lessons and I fail to teach myself or study with my boyfriend (native speakers usually are bad at teaching...), without a language I don't have any chances for a better job, and even if I became somehow fluent it would still be unlikely, because my polish papers from highschool aren't accepted here unless I pay for it, and I didn't finish any University, so my qualifications aren't the best anyway. 

I don't want to commit a suicide, but I really want to die, living makes me exhausted, I am not enjoying any part of it. I can't make friends here, I hate my job, I hate that I can't afford to furniture the flat the way I'd like to, I hate that I can't buy myself even a winter coat and I have to count every cent while shopping... 

I won't be able to visit my family on Christmas, because I have to work, I'll visit them in January though, so that's at least something, but to visit them I had to spend 150€, which is a big chunk of my salary.

I don't have any goal in my life. I don't want to have kids, I am antinatalistic, I don't believe in God, for me it's just worthless to do all these things that I am forcing myself to do, because at some point I'll finally die, and whatever I did won't matter anymore. That's so exhausting... I want to skip through my life and finally have it behind. Sometimes my suicidal thoughts make me cry unconditionally, and I feel real pain because of the sadness that accumulates every day. 

I sometimes think about getting professional help, but, once again, I can't afford it, and even if I could I'm a foreigner in this country. The choice in therapists that speak my language is very little... And I don't have a car so I can't be picky. 

I don't understand how people can enjoy their life. I see my boyfriend who spends 9h at work, then comes back home to watch some series and play games, and he says he likes life. I don't understand how spending 80% of my concious time at work would make me happy... 

I don't know how to handle my thoughts anymore. I know I won't kill myself, two years ago I tried to hang myself, but I chickened out and I now I know that I'll never have the guts, but I am hoping to be hit by a truck every day...",15Nov2019,1
727,"He did it because he dropped his McDonald's. I think of him as a friend.

For context I am 21M he is 22M. Currently, I'm in my senior year of college- the friend dropped out a year ago. The McDonald's probably just set him off, he's the type to keep things inside. Admittedly, I am too. But I'm not nearly as bad as him. 

I believe his blueprint has not gone to plan, and he's not taking steps to fix it. The friend does not come from much money and has family history of drug abuse. 

Our relationship has been hard. We've known each other a long time- shit happens. I trusted him with a housekey in high school, he was peer pressured into throwing a party there while I was on vacation. I forgave him. A year later he was hooking up with my girlfriend while I was on vacation (admittedly it was one month &amp; I was planning on breaking up w her). They dated for 2 years. Took awhile, but we made up.

I've messed up too. When we all graduated and went to other colleges I was sad. Unclear why. I really wanted to move to a city- particularly the one we grew up by. I asked him to come with me. Another of my friends wanted to come too. He actually came. The other didn't. We were both transfer college students.

I worked hard to meet people. The friend was a homebody. In retrospect I can see why. He had just broken up. (The two year girlfriend from before) Unclear why they ended, but his move to Chicago didn't help. At the time, I wasn't so understanding. Stressed out by the difficulty of the move, I blamed him for a lot. Told our high school group. He found out I was talking behind his back. No confrontation. I feel guilty.

A year later we moved in with two other guys from high school (they did not know one another, both in college). One is a recluse. When he gets drunk, the recluse gets very aggressive. He has traditional views and I resent his taste in humor sometimes. We get along when we're both sober. The other is an artist. The artist is nice, but is not an effective communicator. Sometimes he comes off as condescending or passive aggressive. I don't think he means it. We've been living together for 1.5 years. The artist &amp; the recluse don't get along much.

The recluse &amp; the friend love to get drunk together. They put away cases of beer a night. They watch TV and hardly ever leave the house. The friend gets livid at his videogame opponents. He is furious with athletes. The recluse is sometimes taken aback by him. 

The friend has been drinking every day. Sometimes at noon. The artist and the recluse do not want to talk about the issue. He is not doing well. I am comparatively in a better position. I suspect he feels insecure about that.

I've tried to approach the friend by offering help to find a better job. I talked to him last year about his drinking. He gets very defensive when I confront him.

728,"I had a really really bad high school experience. I went from being popular and loved by everyone to being severely bullied because my former friends started spreading false rumors about me. After 2 years of high school, I had to start taking my classes at a college so I didn't have to go to high school anymore. I took depression and anxiety medication all through the rest of my 2 years of high school, and after I graduated, I noticed that I cannot remember little to no detail from my 2 years in high school. I couldn't recall what happened, the people involved, faces, and not even names. I had to be reminded of what happened by a friend, and even when she showed me photos of people involved, I couldn't recognized any of them.

After that, I dated someone for about 6 months and broke it off with him because he abused me sexually. About a month after the breakup, I noticed that I couldn't remember anything from that relationship either. I only remembered his first name. My friend who helped me after high school helped me try to remember some things this time too.

Now this is where it's becoming an issue. My boyfriend and I broke up recently after dating for a year and a half. We were planning our engagements when We broke up on good terms and already have plans on reaching out to each other when things are better since both of us are going through big life changes right now. Even though it ended on good terms, the 3 months leading up to the break up was very difficult.

It's only been about 3 weeks since we cut contact, but I am noticing that my memories with him are already starting to fade. I only remember what he looks like because of the last few photos of him I have on my phone, and I only remember his name because all my friends are talking about him. I barely remember what we did together or what conversations we had. I only remember some from the screenshots I have or letters I wrote to him left my Google Docs.

729,"I currently suffer from Major Depressive Disorder, and have been for almost 10 years. Even after countless therapy sessions, trial and errors with meds, being put in a psych ward twice, and having a great support team at home and work, I still have this underlying feeling that my life isn't going anywhere. I'm almost 30, and am nowhere closer to fulfilling my dreams than when I was 20. I have even fewer friends since then, and I've always had trouble making new ones. The friends I do have are too busy and far away to hang out with as much as I'd like to. I have a good job with a livable wage and nice co-workers, but it's far from what I got my degree in. Jobs in my field are scarce, and are mostly in a state that's ungodly expensive to live in (CA.) I've lost almost all interest in hobbies I used to enjoy, and seem to only have the motivation to sit around watching YT videos or gaming while self-medicating on sugar, leaving my health and apartment to deteriorate. A messy living space is depressing to look at, but it's the depression that keeps me from wanting to clean it up. With all this in mind, it feels like, at this point, the only interesting thing I've got going on is the next anime convention in Spring. I really don't see my life going anywhere beyond the status quo. The A-hole part comes in with what should be THE biggest motivator in my life: my family.

I love my family very much, and have been close all our lives. My parents have been together for +30 years, and have been total champions for me and my 5 younger siblings. I still turn to my parents for support when we're both available, and have given me excellent advice on how to deal with my problems. If I were really honest, though, it doesn't motivate me enough to make the changes I need to live a healthier lifestyle. I'll feel good at the moment, but then go back to my bad habits once I'm home. The fact that my family isn't enough to get me out of this rut makes part of me feel like I'm being selfish and ungrateful. I'm afraid to tell my parents how I really feel because it might sound like everything they've said and done for me isn't good enough; that I'm ready to throw away years of love and care for something as illogical and fickle as my feelings. My parents have invited me to dinner tomorrow night, so I know this is gonna come up sooner or later in conversation. I'm a terrible at lying about things being ok when they really aren't.

What do you think? Would being honest help me get better, or am I just ungrateful? Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, and it's just the depression talking?

731,"I am a Chemistry major at a particular Christian university in the Pacific Northwest. I am a year and a quarter into a BS degree, and I've managed to remain debt free so far. This place requires *18 religion credits* to graduate, and if I transfer out, most of those would be useless. I am not anti-religion, but being familiar with science, I disagree with most of what they teach here. The quality of education seems sub par, especially with tuition being \~$30,000+ a year. I really want to go to somewhere like University of Washington, but I don't know if I could make it with my current standing. 

I had a 3.72 GPA last year, and this quarter is probably going to be a 3.5 or so. I had a 3.49 in high school as well, but my last two years were both 4.0's. I reckon that may help in landing me somewhere different. However, I am concerned about my indecisiveness. This is kind of a two-in-one plead for advice.

I love chemistry, but the department here seems lacking. Maybe chemistry just isn't for me, I don't know. The math department is excellent, and I have enjoyed every moment of calculus. I also have a strong interest in programming and computer stuff, but I haven't taken any programming courses. I don't want to jump the gun and change majors if it's just bad teaching. The chem department uses Pearson's Mastering Chemistry exclusively. I hate Pearson with all of my soul, and it feels like it's helping me use google instead of helping me learn chemistry. It's just frustrating watching the thing I loved become something I despise.

I am hoping that if I stick with it, I could maybe get a math minor with a BS in chem, or if it's not too late, just switch to computer science. With where I am now, would changing to CS hurt my graduation date? I am more than willing to take summer courses, but I don't want to drag my BS degree into 5+ years.

Lastly, if I transfer out, how would that affect my current scholarships? Most of my aid comes from scholarships given by my university, but I also have a couple scholarships that I got while transitioning into college from high school.

Sorry for the word vomit, I am just frustrated, confused, and worried. I have a deep urge to get out. This place seems like a waste, but I don't want to sacrifice the possible prestige boost by going to community college. I am under the impression that where you attend college affects your career prospects in STEM fields. Any advice would be much appreciated, and feel free to ask more questions.

732,"Sooooo I have found myself in a predicament. I was offered two jobs which is awesome and exciting, but as an extremely indecisive person, I don't know what to do!!! I'm scared that by choosing one over the other I'll make the wrong decision. I'll give a description on each job: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Leasing agent at the community I currently live at (this also has pro's and con's) Base pay would be $11 per hour. Commission would be $50 per signed lease. Additional $25 per ""5-star survey"" I receive from residents or prospects. Up to additional $100 bonus each month for completing training courses. I would only have one weekend off each month. 
2. Leasing agent at a community 5 minutes away from where I live. Base pay would be $13 per hour. Commission can range from $25-$125 per signed lease depending on occupancy percentage. Office closed on Sunday and I would only work every other Saturday. The current assistant community manager there used to be my boss and she's not a very good person.

Since then he drinks frequently, and for all the wrong reasons. He recently blamed trying to email an old flame in the middle of the night on alcohol, and says its the only thing that calms him down. 

I’ve obviously expressed to him that this is unhealthy and wrong. He doesn’t want to listen right now. I’d like to give him a chance to make it right on his own and get rid of the bottles. Until then, he’s so new to drinking, he’s not gonna notice if his drinks are suddenly a little more watery. (His brother is already an alcoholic. I’m not dealing with an alcoholic.)

Although they are in the state over my internship has been mainly in the city where I am from. They have just offered me a position at their HQ but I would have to move from my current and most favorite city to a new city in a new state with nobody I know besides a few guys at work who are roughly twice my age. What should I do? Like I love my current city and want to live here the rest of my life but the opportunity over with the other company is great besides the location.

She absolutely flipped out telling me how ungrateful I am, and that my dog absolutely needs to gain weight in summer. I can’t leave him with anyone else, as my sister’s response to all this was “yeah, of course we should kill him we never should have got a dog”.

Hi guys,

I wanna ur advice for managing my two jobs. 

I am currently an engineer at a company full time job, and i hate my work there as shit. But i need it for the salary (good enough). 

And  i got a new opertunity at new job in startup company in a field that is leterly is my passion. The issue here is the salary is low compared to my current job and i don't want to take the risk and quitting my current job. 

So I will work there as a part time engineer 

but i don't know how to manage my life, where in my current job starts from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and my next job from 5:30 to 10:00. And also i need to go to gym to workout almost daily.

Do u see it possible? And who to manage my time? 🙁

746,"I'm F/17 and in the past 2 years my life went from being ok to being a complete mess. I'm severely depressed and I have literally no one to talk to. Everytime someone offered to help me get help it just fell flat. I'm just tired of trying to open up to people and then being let down. Due to my current situation it's very complicated to get help on my own.

Also I'm really exhausted all the time, school is stressing me out  and I'm somewhat of an outcast at school and I'm not making much progress in getting my driver's licence either. My biggest passion is drawing and I really hope that won't change but I feel too unmotivated to even pick up a pencil even though I'm a very creative person. Being unproductive like this makes me feel like a failure.

I developed an eating disorder last year which causes me to be undernourished to the point of not getting my period anymore, nobody is taking this serious but I'm being praised for losing so much weight and ""looking Ill"" because I'm ""so skinny"" now. I've never been confident with the way I look. I've never had a boyfriend before, I know that I'm not exactly unattractive and I'm also very hygienic but I feel unlovable due to my mental state.

To top it all off my family is breaking apart right now too. My mom and dad have been very unloving to each other for a while. Now my mom has debts over 8k Euros because she's a shopaholic and that was kinda like the final straw for my dad who always tried to support her financially. They both come to me to rant about each other but they don't do ANYTHING to solve their problems themselves. Then when I get overwhelmed and show emotions my mom makes fun of me. My little sister isn't helping me either. She makes me feel like a monster because of my aggressions. I love my family a lot and they have done so much for me, especially my dad but it's just so complicated.

I know I'm young and inexperienced but this scares me even more. I mean, I already feel overwhelmed with all of this and I'm only about to turn 18. I don't have experience with ""adult problems"" yet and I honestly don't know how my life is supposed to continue. I don't want to live but I don't want my life to end like this.",15Nov2019,1
747,"Ok, this is a Throwaway, German is my native language and I'm writing this on my phone so sorry for all that shitty English and crappy formating coming up. 

Ok, lets start. There are 5 main people involved in this. Me, a somewhat below average, really small guy who reportedly looks like 12. My best friend, let us call her S, a lesbian girl my age, who is the only friend that hasn't beaten me and kept contact with me on her own, I don't know why but I somehow seem to attract really shitty friends, I've only had so called friends who either beat me till I was red and blue or who just ghosted me after a while, but she is different. There is my previous crush G and her BF B. Then there is the dude who has a crush on S lets call him L.

Ok, lets start with the actual story. So I went to my last year of school. The last year is actually a separate school in a seperate building if you choose to do so in my country. So I got to the school and all the characters are also there. I had briefly known S from the previous school, but she just switched to it 3 months before the summer holidays and I hadn't talked to her at all. I've found G to be really attractive from the beginning and she turned out to also be intelligent, funny and social. I developed a really heavy crush on her really fast and didn't know how to cope with the fact she got in a relationship with B that seemed to be really stable. So S turned out to really care for me, we had hours together playing video games, going out eating or just talking on the phone, our friendship seemed to develop really quickly and was the best thing that had ever happened to me, she made me forget about G when I was having fun with her. Ok, so end of the year came rolling around super fast and I got super depressed as G and B were still a couple. I once broke out crying in front of L, S when we were at the house of another dude. They all asked me what's up and I told them it was because of a girl. All but S joked about be for crying which ensured me in the decision to never tell anyone about my crush because they'd just take it as a joke and not keep it for them. Ok, so a few weeks later that dude at whoms house we were asks me again who it was and in the need not to tell anyone but not to be constantly reminded I choose the only person who cared for me and where they couldn't say I should make a move because she's lesbian anyway so there's no need to make a move. So I told him it was S. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. From him it got to L in litteraly under a day, even though he promised he would keep it a secret. Well he obviously wasn't happy but if I would come out with the truth B would catch note of it real quick so I kept the lie going in the hope the two would keep it to them, which they did till now, 4 months later. Ok, so S works together with L in the same company and so they naturally do things together even though she knows he has a crush on her. So today S invites me to go to the city to eat. She didn't tell me L was going with us till 5 minutes before. Ok, I was scared, I didn't mention till now how much time I had spend keeping up that friendship, it had slowly turned into the soke thing keeping me alive and without S being there for me through some other shit I could not even write this, so that friendship is worth to me more than anything else. Ok, so after we went through some stores joking bout some random stuff L pulls me back from S who I was currently talking to and asked me if I still had a crush on her. I obviously said no as I had luckily finally gotten over G and so it didn't matter. He didn't seem to believe me and pulled me back multiple times, even making some rather imposing gestures. I got scared, if he told S, what would I say? She surely wouldn't believe me, who keeps a lie up for months, it would surely sound more plausible to her that I just had a crush on her and she would probably think the only reason I'm always overly friendly to her is because I still have a crush on her. This would break me, I wouldn't have anyone else and it looks like he's gonna tell her, he was already playing it out so obvious and even indirectly telling her at points which she luckily didn't cath. I don't know how I'm gonna tear down that structure of lies without tearing down my friendship, I'm just so scared of being without anyone to talk to again, like it was before, what could I do, I'm scared of losing her.",15Nov2019,1

750,"(CW: Childhood Sexual Trauma) About two years ago when I was a sophomore in high school, I was caught sending nudes twice. I haven't done anything like that since then, and I immensely regret it, but I got into an argument the other day with my mother, and brought up how she treats me differently than everyone else in the house. She brought up the fact that I've ""done things that nobody else in this house has,"" but I kinda thought that all of that was done and over with. When I was 8 I was molested, and the person who did it was looking at naked pictures of women as they did it, it seriously fucked me up, and gave me a pretty bad habit of watching porn from then on to when I was 13.  I think this is partly to blame for those bad habits, along with my mental issues. But I'm done with all of that now, and have been pretty clean since then. Has anyone else been through this?

I've also had knee surgery some years ago which still acts up if I move my leg wrong and my hip has started to hurt, which I read might be because of inner buttocks muscles getting weaker (I was also born with a dislocated hip so I'm predisposed to hip problems to some degree).

It would be great getting a PT to start off with who could show me all the equipment and teach me how to do the different exercises right so I don't hurt myself -- but I don't have much money to spare and the options around me are very expensive. Free gyms have a bad reputation here and are predominantly men-only, I'm too scared to use them.

I don't have any friends I spend freetime with. (I get along with people at work well, I'm just kind of like this). I think many people get the know of the gym through a friend or something? So that's not an option either.

**Any suggestions?**  
One very basic thing I noticed is that I've been walking the stairs wrong all my life, basically on my tip toes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20, and I currently live with my parents. They have been together most of their lives throughout the good and bad times, however, growing up my father has been very abusive towards my mother and I, emotionally scarring me and making it hard for me to even say ""I love you"" to him.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents spoiled me A LOT growing up. So bad, that I had no idea how to live in this world on my own. They made me rely on them so much, often TOO much it seems. I taught myself a lot of the things I currently know today.

&amp;#x200B;

I still live with them, and currently find jobs back to back (theyre just low paying 8 hour shift jobs). I don't know what I want to be, even being asked in school by teachers and the whole deal. I still have no clue, and thus I am gathering as much money as I can to save up.

My father currently helps my mom pay the rent and bills and they both end up with nothing. They use any excess money they have left on their addictions. Newspaper, unhealthy foods, cigs, beer. Etc. Im working hard for money, and we cant eat due to the lack thereof. I try to offer to do a cheap shop at a local grocery store for a week to keep us fed, but my mom wants fast food. My dad is willing to eat what we have left, but she refuses and throws it away and threatens to starve herself if she isnt fed what she wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had a stroke in 2017, and ever since then her mind took a turn for the worse in terms of morality and all she wants to do is smoke or eat unhealthily. I try so hard to talk her out of these habits to no avail. I feel my mental state dwindling day by day and cannot afford to move out. I love my mom, but she guilt trips me and says that shes cared for me my entire life and that im selfish and shes just going to smoke herself to death.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do not know what to do. I just want a second opinion, since everyone I know tells me not to give her money. But what else can I do?! My father isnt feeding her, so its my job to. Look, I understand that I should help my parents out since they did take care of me, but what they want to eat is unreasonably expensive and they will not settle for cheap.

Days/times, teacher, etc. Our department at my job does work for hundreds of clients, with many different contacts for each. We do hundreds of projects for different clients, per year. However, if I'm given the name of an individual, it's very likely that I can tell you what agency they're from, and specifics of their request, even if months or years old, and even if this is a client we only do minimal projects for. I remember things like timelines very well- I've been at my job 3 years and can easily name the month/year of employees leaving, getting hired, etc. These are just examples  and of the types of things my memory is particularly strong about.

The problem is, is that as convenient as it is to be able to remember these things, it sometimes causes tension with coworkers because I think I come off as a know-it-all sometimes. This is hard for me, because I truly do not intend to be. In terms of knowledge of technical components of the job, I'm always willing to admit the areas I do not know as strongly, and I have no problem owning up to being wrong. Where it causes most tension are instances where I remember things that fell through the cracks for my other coworkers. For example, down the road if I remember that one of my coworkers was supposed to call back a client, knowing that they forgot to, and then asking if they ever did. It causes the most tension with my manager, unfortunately, because my manager has a particularly bad memory. So, she will completely forget things that I know for a fact happened, and when I am able to prove these things she has no memory of, she gets frustrated with me. (For example, her saying that we never ordered something, me remembering that we did and it had arrived months ago much to her denial, and then me showing her our receiving log proving that/when it was received). 

I don't want to be a know-it-all. I don't ever want to come off as rude, or difficult. It's just hard for me to navigate certain situations when I have such a strong recollection of things, especially when it's with someone who has very poor recollection. Any advice for how to navigate this with less conflict????",15Nov2019,1
769,"I'm 23 years old and have wasted a lot of money on app games. I worked a lot as an engineer intern and almost done my college career in engineering. I wasted a large sum in this app game and feel like I'm becoming more of a gambler. I love this game, but I don't want to delete it since I wasted 6k on this game. Any advice will help, thanks in response.",15Nov2019,1
770,"We got nothing in common and I genuinely have no idea what they're saying 99% of the time. I've lived with them for over 3 months and I still don't understand them. They have an extremely southern ""black""(sounds racist, but idk what else to call it) accent. And I'm northern white. They also randomly begin singing which I find weird as fuck. They listen to different music, do different drugs, talk different, watch different things, and go to different places. I tend to keep to myself and read books and watch netflix. But fuck am I beginning to get lonely sitting in my room by myself. Also when I was high as shit my roommate once invited over a girl to have casual sex with and I seriously just don't like them. He also has like 3 different girlfriends(which he's cheating on with his main gf)? So apparently we don't share the same values either. I honestly don't even know why I care. I just need some advice here.",15Nov2019,1
771,"Long story short, I met this absolutely perfect guy. 6’4, managed a local gaming shop, incredibly good looking. At first we talked back and forth and I didn’t feel much, not overly attracted to him or anything like that. But the more we talked, the more flirtatious he got, and the more it was clear he was dropping direct hints he was into me.Several nights ago, things wound up escalating and getting sexual. It turned out our kinks were incredibly compatible and we had a mind blowing night, like something out of my wildest dreams. The next morning I woke up, and it was like a switch had flipped. I was incredibly attracted to him and thought about him all day, and that night it happened again. Everything I saw reminded me of him and the things he liked. I got that feeling in my chest I get when I completely fall for someone, and began picturing a future relationship with this person. I wound up checking out his Facebook, and it publicly lists him as engaged, as well as on the girls page as well, although she didn’t appear to be wearing a ring in pictures. I feel honestly really crushed. I didn’t mean to catch feelings like that and I never would have never gotten sexual with him if I knew he was engaged, and apparently expecting a child!

How do I get over this, and what should I do moving forward? I feel really crushed being left in the dark",15Nov2019,1
772,"So I had the weirdest morning. I’ve been a resident at a property owned by a large property management company for 2 years with no issues. This morning around 8:27am I had received a phone call from the leasing office notifying me that there had been a theft of an item at the property (I believe that she had said a flower pot or a centerpiece- quite frankly the conversation was a complete blur as I was so shocked) and that they had reviewed video footage and it appeared as though the suspect had a pug dog (I have a pug) and apparently “looked like me” and she had asked what I knew about it. The call was incredibly accusatory in nature and I could not believe it. I did not, nor would I ever, take an item that was not mine. 

Shortly thereafter, at 9:18am, the leasing office called back to inform me that they had narrowed down who the suspect was and apologized for calling me to ask about it. While I felt relieved, I am quite frankly very unhappy and embarrassed with how unprofessionally this was handled. I feel embarrassed walking by the office to bring my dog outside while knowing that I was a “suspect”.  While I understand her eagerness to find the culprit, it is important to not make a false accusation without being sure as that can be very insulting. I now feel uncomfortable at my own home.

I’ve been considering filing a complaint to the regional manager because I feel like this may have been handled inappropriately. I’ve never experienced anything like this and just feel weird about it. Should I even bother? Am I being unreasonable? Thanks for reading.",15Nov2019,1
773,"So I was going to a friend's house, and had to pick my cousin on my way there. I took a taxi and it was fairly cheap. After 100 meters or so I asked him if it was Ok if we could pick my cousin on the way and he agreed(since it was on the main road). After picking my cousin up by about 7-10 minutes, a call started going from behind the back seat(probably the trunk). A CALL WAS GOING FROM THE TRUNK. My cousin and I were scared and surprised. The taxi driver told us to check the area once we get to our destination. We came down and started searching for phones in the hind seats in the taxi, but when we tried going for the trunk, the taxi driver told us to not search as nothing is there, we came down and left,. Thetr was no other sound in the trunk, but that call going creeped the shit out of us. We want to call the cops, what shall we do? Please help",15Nov2019,1
774,"My friend invited me over for 8 days in a different city to stay at her parents house. Her parents are amazing but she is becoming annoying when i say something she does not agree. From saying i dont prefer olives to i enjoy reading a book (like i simply said i really enjoyed reading GoT and she sould check it out she said well watching is more fun.
