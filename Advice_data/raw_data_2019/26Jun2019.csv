3,"I’ve been friends and roommates with this girl for over 4 years, but she’s proven to be flaky and absentminded. Not good with details I guess. Especially since she turned into a huge stoner I noticed. I love her to death but I’m just so done getting screwed over because she made an *oopsie* like, she didn’t pay her cable bill for 9 months not due to money, she just forgot even though I reminded her literally every month. We almost lost that apartment we lived in because she forgot her security deposit and they were going to end our lease so I covered $1200 for her until she got her stuff together. That was more of a minor nuisance then a thing that hurt but it just is kinda an example.

So... We’ve been planning a beach vacation with our friend group for months since she has a place down there. I can only get off certain dates for work, so we blocked out 3 days, and I told her to be 100% certain that those days work because i have limited vacation days. 

So, a few days before, she told me she was actually busy for the first day, which would have been today, but I can drive over tonight for dinner so I figured if I leave at 2 and it’s a 4 hour drive I’ll make it. So it’s 1:30, then AS IM PACKING MY CAR, she tells me I can’t come tonight and should come tomorrow so her plans aren’t rushed. Bruh. I have plans too....... like my whole vacation day..... Now I guess I have to drive on the turnpike tomorrow at 6am to make it, and I’m scared I’ll get into an accident because I suck at driving when I’m not awake like, drowsy driving causes so many accidents and now my anxiety is tripping me out about that and this little vacation is barely 2 days, 8 hours of driving included. And for some reason now I’m worried she’ll be like oops sorry don’t come there’s no room;/. I sound so uptight but like.. bruh I was looking forward to this all summer I don’t get to do many fun things anymore as a young adult. Like all I do is work bussing tables lmao.

I guess I should be grateful she’s having me but flaky people man... you have to accept that they aren’t being malicious and are good people at heart but every time you make plans it’s a coin toss. My parents are telling me I shouldn’t be this bent but I am. 

Like I’ll still go but should I just keep being disappointed by her or distance myself? Or should I just accept her and chill? I’m being dramatic but yea",26Jun2019,1
4,"I hate my dad now that I'm 28. We never really had a connection when I was growing up, he was/is abusive ( emotionally and physically ), a meth addict ( clean since mid 90's ), and left my mom for my friends rich mom all for the pursuit of money. And now that my mom has won a law suit he's been trying to get back in my mom's good graces. Now I've never cared for him, when he left I just shrugged. It felt like someone visiting just left and in time I've grown to hate him. 

But now, my family wants me to be polite around him. But I don't feel like I should. My mom says that her brother was the same with their dad. And when he passed my uncle had a lot of regret. 

Should I follow their advice or just stick to my guns about how horrible of a person he is?",26Jun2019,1
5,"I hate that I get the urge to cry every time I’m disappointed by things that most people would just shrug their shoulders at. And yes it happens at every point in my cycle so I don’t think it’s hormonal. It makes me feel emotionally immature that I do this; how do I stop having these child-like reactions? 

I can seriously get emotional about stuff like missing out on a fun party or going to the store and finding out my favorite flavor of ice cream is sold out. It’s embarrassing.",26Jun2019,17
6,"I work at a summer camp and something really bad happened to kid who is currently fighting for their life. What happened was the result of the negligence of a certified individual who was not able to perform the duties they had committed to. There were many people involved and with the lack of preparation or responsibility many were put in danger. The local newspaper caught hold of one version of the story that significantly favored the negligent individual. I was present for this tragic event and I know what happened and why it happened. At worst I risk shutting down the camp or at the least having this individual fired. I’m supposed to put more children in the hands of this individual and there are traumatized campers and parents looking for justice. I know the truth of what happened but the police, the directors and everyone else there are trying keep this under wraps. What do I do? I can’t consciously let these kids in this persons care and then lie to their parents. If this were my kid I wouldn’t stop until the place was shutdown but is the service this place provides worth more then that? When does everyone’s self preservation become more important than the life of those influenced by it?",26Jun2019,20

9,"This is a completely serious question. I think I know someone who has a serious problem. He is a chronic cheater an he uses pity to lure girls into being with him. He has always been controlling and uses girls. He dates this girl, and when he tries to get with another girl he complains and bitches about his girlfriend who treats him really nice. He says she's abusive and such just to get a pity blow job. The worst part is, he's one of those guys who won't admit anything to anyone. He even denies it to his friends after he bragged to it about them. What is this? Is he a sociopath? I honestly think he may have a real issue, that's why I'm asking. I know that not all men are like this. I also know that a lot of women are like this. I just don't understand WHY.",26Jun2019,1
11,"Hello! I’m a middle school student (eighth grade) I live in Canada, and live in an area which uses a number system when it comes to grading. 1 meaning below grade expectations. 2 means that you’re work is grade level and overall ok. 3 means above grade expectations, and that your work is pretty good. Last but certainly not least, we have a 4. This means that your work is excellent and above, above grade level. I’ve always wanted to become a doctor ever since I entered elementary and am currently working towards that. However, there are 2 main high schools that I live close too. One being okay and the other being pretty good. I of course want to go to the good school. Here’s the problem, I don’t live in this schools district and have to participate in the IB program fully. I have no option of doing partial IB. I managed to get a glimpse of my report card and was generally pleased. All 4’s however there were two 3’s. My mother said that because of these two 3’s I would not be accepted into the IB school. Apparently they only accept the, “best if the best” and that the 3’s I received won’t let me get into this school. This school is very full. I can tell my mother is disappointed in me for getting two 3’s on the report card (may get a couple more) To end of, I would like it if someone could tell me if these two 3’s will ruin my dreams? Can they actually be the deciding factor in if I go the IB school or not? Keeping in mind the rest of the card is mostly 4’s. Thank you.

She'll have to move back into her parents house, but her mom is allergic. I feel she'll try to give him to a family member until she has a place of her own, she'll probably do anything to keep him and not allow him to continue living with me in my/his home out of spite. Is there some way I can become primary owner without her involvement if things come to an end?

17," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on this was a week ago she hasnt talked to me since",26Jun2019,0

Yesterday, an incident happened and I saw my step sister in person and well she’s definitely not doing very well... however even though I’m not involved in her situation, I still feel bad for her. I really do. I want to help, even if it’s just have to someone to cry to, but thing is idk if it’s appropriate to ask her if she’s doing well and what’s going on exactly.

20,"So we have been best friends for almost a year now and we talk hours and hours every day. There's times where it's literally all day from 7am to 10pm (with small breaks for food or something). Everyone always says ""Oh y'all should date"" or ""Are you getting together?"" But we both know that it doesn't work like that between us. We tried to make that work a while back and it failed. She means the world to me and there are some times now where I don't even know what I am to her. I don't wanna just flat out say ""What am I to you? Your friend? bestie? Someone to talk to?. I've put myself through emotional hell it feels like. Helping her relationship work at times when she didnt know what to do or say. Helping them see the best in eachother and truly giving it an effort. They are both happy now. And she is the happiest i've ever seen her when shes with him.  Like we know almost everything about eachother and really do have a lot of fun but I get mixed feelings sometimes.

27,"It's an odd question, I know, but this has been burning up in me for a while. Five years ago, my father passed away. But ever since I could remember, he had been going to Europe for 2-3 months at a time, working on some nebulous project. All I know about it was that it was related to Solar somehow; he'd been funneling money and asking his friends to invest - and he took me to the Czech Republic, where he had an apartment. I never saw his workplace or met anyone he worked with there, though. Apparently he was having some difficulties with it by the end.

  
I'm deathly curious to what he might have been doing. On his deathbed, as far as I know, he didn't talk about what had happened there. How do I trace what he was doing there? I want to know what happened.",26Jun2019,1
28,"A friend of mine had a troubled time with drugs and depression from which he is thankfully recovering right now and finally met a nice girl at work he likes and she have him her number. 
Turns out, the girl he likes used to visit my school and I know her. 
Unfortunately, I know some stories from her past where she seemed quite ""psycho"" (sending boys pictures of cutting herself. threatening them to kill herself, if they don't want to be in a relationship with her, etc.)... 
Now ofc, everyone has done crazy shit in their past, but I also know, that she has an on and off relationship with a boy, in which both, her and the boy, break up, date someone else, hurt them and break up with them because they still love each other, frequently (another friend of mine got hurt due to that before, but not that direct). 
So I told my friend what I knew, due to the pure fear of him being hurt by that girl, especially because I know that he's a sensitive boy, eventhough he acts tough, and because they work together, and I am really protective of my friends. 
Unfortunately, he didn't react that well to that and somehow misunderstood my intentions with telling him, as if I I'm just trying to tear other women down and don't want him to get happy. 
I can tell you, that I love my friends more than anything, and him assuming so really hit me hard, eventhough he told me that it was good I did so later that day. 
But that's just an example. 
I have a really good intuition towards other people and can tell from the start if something's ""wrong"" with them. It also happened a lot of times that I had a not rational explainable gut feeling that something is a really bad idea of that it's a bad idea for my friends to talk to someone (not even in the dating kinda way) and it always proved right. Therefore I sometimes seem like I'm crazy (I guess) but I was never wrong with anything I said and never meant to harm anybody, I can't stress enough that I want him to be well more than anything else, and him assuming that I'm not, hurts like shit.

30,"For several months now, I've been pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADD. I started a new full time job that's serving as the first step in my career but these symptoms have really been effecting my work. I'll have to stay 3, 4, 5 hours after work to get things done due to constant distraction and inability to get things started/organized. I have trouble starting even simple tasks like writing an email. I zone out when people are talking to me. I also tend to fixate on things I really enjoy, like games, movies, etc. for months on end. 
My girlfriend, who is a psychology graduate, says I meet a lot of the diagnostic criteria for ADD.
I finally saw a doctor about it, and after I filled out two surveys (one for ADHD and one for Depression I think), he concluded that I do meet the criteria for having ADD, and gave me a prescription for methylphenidate (aka Ritalin.) He told me to try it for about three weeks and then report back to him.
When my family found out, they instantly denied all of it, saying I didn't have ADD and that everyone exhibits these symptoms nowadays. My mother also pointed out the fact that I was evaluated as a child and was not diagnosed (which is true.) They're completely opposed to me taking the prescribed drug, saying I should try anything else and that they think it's all in my head. I feel like they're gaslighting me which has me feeling shitty.
I'm really torn. I'm a male in my mid 20's, and I've never taken prescription drugs before but I think I could use it as a great tool to get myself organized and establish routines (such as working out) in order to combat my symptoms. After talking to my family, I'm kind of freaked out about taking Ritalin. I still haven't been formally diagnosed, and the jump to prescription drugs does seem a little sudden. 

TL;DR I've been prescribed Ritalin for what I think is ADD and my family is strongly urging against taking them. What do?",26Jun2019,2

The thing is, I'm not pregnant. And if I were pregnant, my mom would be the first person I would tell. My stepdad said he ""heard from someone"" but didn't tell my mom who. My mom was too upset to keep talking to him, and just left early for another appointment she had.  


I would like to call my stepdad and confront him - who told him this? Why would he ask my mother in such a hurtful way? If I were pregnant, maybe I wanted to do something to surprise my mom. Also, what if I'd had a miscarriage and was upset about it? I'm 29 years old, in a long-term relationship, so it wouldn't be scandalous if I were pregnant, but I'm just not, so I don't want people going around saying it, because other family members could get upset that I wouldn't tell them myself.

37,"Throwaway because too much personal info i guess.

Also i'm sorry if this doesn't technically fit on this sub


Idk what the fuck is wrong with me but I've been freaking out over small things. Like something will cross my mind and then i'll think and think and freak myself out to the point i cannot sleep. 

For example, i don't use tampons, theyre uncomfortable and i just don't like them(and havnt touched one in years). But i have obviously tried to use them before, but took them out immediately after putting them in because of how uncomfortable they are. Well a few weeks ago i was reading a story on reddit about a nurse having a patient that had come in because she had a tampon stuck in her for years, something extreme like that. And i didn't think much of it, yknow people are crazy. But i guess the next night or so i was thinking, ""oh god i MUST have one stuck up there!"" Even though theres no discomfort, smell, and period comes out just fine. I kept telling myself there was no way that anything was wrong. But i kept freaking out about it and having full on panic attacks. 

Another thing is i am basically convinced there is something horribly wrong with me health wise. Realistically i know that i am most likely fine, but at night i cant help my mind racing and telling me i have cancer, or a brain tumor, or whatever. 

If i feel any tinge of pain in my stomach i think i'm internally bleeding and run to a mirror to check if im bruising. Now, i guess what fuels that fear in particular, i do suffer from bulimia. I have since i was in 8th grade and i am a senior in hs now. I know of the health risks bulimia can cause and that only fuels my anxiety of impending doom. 

Something i think the cause of my horrendous night time anxiety could possibly be childhood trauma. My parents are divorced(i was very young), and i live with my mom. My dad is a deadbeat alcoholic drug addict, who was also abusive physically and mentally. When me and my sister would visit him for the summer he would make us do all kinds of random drugs, mostly that crazy ""synthetic weed"" people buy at sketchy gas stations that is composed of random chemicals and doesn't actually have anything to do with weed. We also drank a lot in those summers.  His reasoning was that if we were doing it too, we wouldn't tell on him because we would get in trouble too. And it worked, because we were gullible kids. 

Anyways, i feel like a fucking schizophrenic or something because i always feel like someone is out to get me or that i am very slowly dying. And i don't know what to do..",26Jun2019,1
39,"First off, I just want to preemptively say thank you for reading this long post and offering advice! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been currently employed at a fairly cool job for 3 years now. I have been promoted twice and given several raises. I get a week of paid vacation and 6 paid government holidays. There is a kitchen stuffed with snacks and refreshments, sometimes they pay for lunch, and we get paid cash for overtime. Last year for my birthday, the family that owns the company flew me to Washington DC with them to enjoy a concert for a band we all like. We have inside jokes, lots of funny moments, and have fairly lax rules. (We can vape inside, jeans are okay to wear every other day or so, etc.) Tomorrow my boss is bringing me a kitten to keep the rats out of the office. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I work in a Devil-Wears-Prada-Esque environment with tons of money, pressure, and responsibilities are heaped on us. It is a family owned company and I work directly under the CEO &amp; CFO. Because it is a family company, there is a lot of drama, a lot of yelling, and absolutely no HR. I have witnessed several fist fights between the two sisters. I have stayed late for nights of putting the office back in order after fights. Their father has a secret bathroom kept under lock and key with racist art in it. They are offensive, racist, and can be extremely mean people. In the first year, I left the office crying more than smiling. I was told I was too incompetent to handle a basic request, talked down to like a child, disciplined and publicly humiliated several times, including just 3 weeks ago. I have been talked down to, spoken about behind my back, slandered, bullied, and mercilessly teased at least once a week. There are no health benefits or 401k offered. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the sisters spends about 80% of her time smoking weed or on her phone. She does payroll once a week and every week there is an issue with pay. They call her the HR Manager for legal reasons but she makes lewd and rude comments often. Some quotes: ""Daddy long dick"" (about a new hire), ""she's a scunt and I'm going to fucking bash her skull in when I see her"" (about a former employee), and many more. The rules of dress code (think diamond teeth implants, tattoos, pornographic or drug related t shirts, flamboyant hair, ripped jeans, wearing sheer, low cut shirts), phone conduct, and the shirking of most responsibilities onto her assistant do not apply to her and she is also paid handsomely. The other sister is the brains of the operation and has an intensely oracle-like nature to her in that she knows  every facet of the company like the back of her hand. She is also a ruthless, micromanaging, bullying, controlling tyrant that always gets her way. (Side note: she totally should since it's her company and she runs everything) She slanders employees against each other, talks a lot of smack about key employees that work 70 hour weeks to complete her impossible demands. She can and will berate you, scream in your face, tell everyone lies or secrets you trusted her with, is extremely aggressive, and completely destroys my self esteem often. She can also be a very kind, understanding woman with impeccable taste and business savvy. I consider her a friend as well as a boss. (It's complicated) My other coworkers respect me and go to me for everything. When we have a conflict I do my best to resolve it and keep our team strong. I have tried speaking with my boss in the past and she is not interested in my concerns or 'whining'. They are paid triple the income at 40 hours a week than that of their employees that do crazy labor and work 80 hour weeks in a non air conditioned shop. The other front office employee, and the back office employees have a different standard they are held to and more lax rules than I do.

In the 3 years that I have been employed, I have learned a lot and grown so much, but my patience grows thin. I was hired as an administrative assistant and am now in a role with a fancy title. The actual responsibilities have remained the same in theory but the workload has increased. I now do the job of an administrative assistant, office manager, purchasing agent, assistant project manager, light bookkeeping, and more. I not only buy expensive equipment, write company policies, schedule, and manage several databases, but I also do the dishes, schedule vet appointments, and babysit when their kids are present. But I am so bored and there is no more room for growth. I have lost all interest in my actual job duties. I find no satisfaction is perfectly manicured spreadsheets or well written prose. I have become snappy at times with clients and vendors. Waking up for work has become harder, the excuses on my mental health days have become thinly veiled. I can no longer hide my disdain for every fibre of the job itself. With all of the responsibilities that I have, I have no real power. 

&amp;#x200B;

My new job offer came out of the blue. The company had found my resume on Indeed and asked me for an interview yesterday. I was shocked to be approached! I went to the interview prepared, and everything went swimmingly. The job is in the same field as I am in now, but with less duties. It pays the exact same, comes with health benefits after 60 days, and has an HR department (a real one). I was told I am over qualified for the position, that they will match my current pay and expect me to rise to a higher role withing a few months, in which they will pay me more. The job itself does not seem intimidating to me in the slightest, but I am interested in learning new skills and software in my field. There was even a mention of possible compensation for continuing education (I did not finish my degree and there was talk about me returning to school). The owners and managers that interviewed me were incredibly well spoken, knowledgeable, and professional. I am thoroughly impressed with their facility and profit margins. A bonus is that I live 1.1 miles away from the new office as opposed to the 20 miles I am now. I accepted their job offer today and they want me to start in two weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that tomorrow night, the family I work for is going on a family vacation for 2 weeks. While they are away, I am in charge of the front office and they have assured every client that I am their point of contact. I need advice because I couldn't make it halfway through my resignation letter without crying. I love the family that I work for and respect their hustle. I feel like leaving at this time will be a Brutus moment, a Fredo if you will. But this opportunity presented itself out of nowhere! My boyfriend has seen me come home crying or miserable often. He said I have retreated into myself, that the depression is overwhelming, and he can no longer discuss work with me because it makes him so angry to see me treated the way I am. My friends have tried convincing me to quit on multiple occasions and while they understand my job can be cool, that they see how much it has affected my life. My dad works in the same field and works with my company often, so he would like to see me stay as he thinks I have a very comfortable position.

40,"I’m not exactly sure how to process this. Before we became a couple, she mentioned that she was bisexual. I was okay with that, but also imagined that sometime in the future, a scenario like this one would happen.

He was banned, and then he came to the server I manage, and put a screen cap of the photo in a channel, and everyone proceeded to flip shit and attack him.

54,"To preface this, if you could avoid telling me I should burn in hell and other creatively awful things I'd appreciate it, I already know I screwed up.

Background on me, I've had 4 guinea pigs, the one that was mine died when she was 8yrs old which is pretty impressive. I have 2 dogs that are 9-10yrs or so. I've never had a cat before.

A bit of background on my cat, I adopted him, he hopped into my lap at the shelter and decided to take a snooze so I took him home. He was a super sweet lap cat that liked to take naps on my lap when I got home from work. I doubt I'm the first one to have heard the term ""cats understand what you're saying, they just don't care"" or something to that affect...so thats kind of what prompted this fiasco. Anyways I decided to change the ""I understand but don't care"" thing, which I have learned only makes them fear humans, wonderful thing to discover.

Now onto the whole problem I have, it probably sounds like a stupid problem but it makes me cry (Im a 25yr old guy), he's exactly the same as he was before except he stopped being my lap cat and Im in tears over that. I don't even remember what he did that really annoyed me. I'm not violent (he says while writing about when he was violent) I don't have anger issues, I don't take things out on my pets. It was my stupid idea of ""you're arrogant until you get smacked"" which is a stupid idea that only really works on adult humans doing arrogant stupid things.

Now of course because I've already tried to find the answer to my question I can already list off reasons hes not screwed up. He always uses his litter box, always eats his food. In fact yesterday he decided his box was not perfect enough and meowed loudly so I just dumped it out and refilled it. If he doesnt like his food I give him something different. I've spent probably $200 a week since I got him which is maybe $1,000 and probably $200 a month or so, to say hes pampered is an understatement. He has a tv that plays classical music for gods sake. I don't have a high income, just basically no expenses.

And to anyone who says I should just rehome him, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to hit him again and if I can't somehow get my old lap cat back I signed up to take care of him for however long he lives (hopefully 20 years) I know most cats arent nearly as affectionate so I'd basically end up with a cat just like a huge amount of other cats, I'll just have to live with the fact that I lost my little snuggle buddy.

As for him being adopted, the shelter of course had virtually no background information on him. I believe they finally said he was surrender due to pet rent being to high (his diet is probably as expensive). With that being said, I have no idea what environment he was in before hand. He loves hiding under my bed to the point I feel like I should turn it into a real cat house. He will also scream like hes being dismembered in a meat grinder if he goes outside, if you've never heard a cat scream at the top of its lungs, its quite the experience and nerve wracking.

I did record him for maybe 1.5hrs in incredibly low quality before he knocked over my webcam and he seems to have separation anxiety of some kind, or hes just being a cat. He doesn't really purr when I pet him, of course this is when I'm actually listening for a purr. Oh one important note is that he wasn't neutered until 2-3ish months ago so I have no idea what effect that might have on him. He would (still does) lift his hind end up like hes going to spray or something (I presumed that was the purpose) but nothing ever happened so I have no idea if its leftover from pre-neutering or just a quirk he has.

Yeah so that was long. The entire point of all that kind of pointless detail is that I'm hoping to give a fuller picture of my cat. I made mistakes, I love this little guy. I'm not going to get bored of not having a lap cat and stop giving him the pampered life he now has, I would just like to undue the damage I caused (or think I caused, I was specifically told he might not be a lap cat forever, maybe that phase lasts a month or something I have no idea.) I do plan on doing something about his separation anxiety, actually in general hes kind of an anxious cat, I was told ""brave"" was not something that describes him. Anyways, as far as his personality is concerned, imagine a comically affectionate cat turned into more or less an average cat that's slightly above average in affection. Hes currently sleeping in his cat tree like 2ft away from me so I don't think he hates me. He sometimes seems like he wants to bite my arm, hes not very good at it.

56,"I have this casual friend that I’ve known for a year, let’s call him Teddy. We recently started hanging out a little more, however we’re still not super close friends. One day we were hanging out in a group &amp; he was using my vape. It was a pretty cheap one just from the convince store, he was actually with me when I got it. While he was using it, it died. So he apologized, and I told him it was okay I could just charge it later. Then we started talking about how I wanted a different vape, like a JUUL or a stlth. He was like “oh I could pick up one from downtown when I’m at work tmrw.” I assumed he meant I’d etransfer him for it but he didn’t mention anything about that. The next day he didn’t mention anything about buying one, so I just assumed he forgot about it which wasn’t a big deal.

I ended up buying a STLTH because I thought he forgot about it. About a week or 2 weeks later he sent me a video of him vaping so I said something jokingly about him being a vape god. Then he was like “oh it’s for you!” Again, he said nothing about me paying him for it so I was confused. I was just like “oh thank you so much,
you really didn’t have to do that.” I had no intention of accepting it, I just kind of hoped he’d forget and keep it for himself. However, he kept messaging me asking to hang out and pick up the vape so I got it from him. Again, when we hung out he didn’t mention paying for it. 

So I texted him when I got back thanking him again &amp; I asked if he wanted me to etransfer him and that I felt bad. He said it was okay and that it was an early bday present. I’m probably making a big deal of this, but I feel so so bad and guilty. Juuls are expensive and we’re not super close friends or anything. I’m just super confused, do you think he wanted me to pay for it or was it meant to be a gift all along?? I just assumed it was a gift but maybe it wasn’t?

60,I was talking to a guy off and on for 2 years and we finally decided to meet a few days before I move back home for the summer.

He was very sweet and caring about the situation and I think I started to have feelings for him. Side note I'm demisexual so it takes a lot for me to feel comfortable with someone enough to have sex with him. We continued our relationship and he would drive about 30 minutes to my school about 2 times a week to hang out and have sex. He is one of the nicest guys I've ever met and I started to feel like we were in a relationship so I decided to ask him. He said that he does not want to get into a relationship right now and he enjoys hanging out with me and that us having sex is a plus. This confused me because he acts like a boyfriend but doesn't want a relationship with me. He would take me out and does things he knows I like. We continued our sexual relationship until i had to move back home again. He then told me when I was moving out that he will come to visit me. This confused me even more because he told me before that he would not drive a long distance for any girl he's only having sex with and I lived 2 hours away.

61,"throwaway for obvious reasons

i have been seeing therapists and psychiatrists since i was in elementary school due to stress and suicide attempts sparked by family.

im past that, but now i have been stuck with the problem of falling in love with my best friends. it has happened twice.

in both situations it seemed like it started with them first, but when reciprocated they back out and it feels like i get stuck in the hell hole that is unrequited love coupled with me losing the ability to simply go back and look at them as just friends.

the way that i have handled stress for a while is suicide. i have been hospitalized in several attempts. i understand this is extremely unhealthy, and im working on it.

i got past the first one when college happened and we dont talk much now, which is nice.

because of this i know that i should really just move on and find love somewhere else, but i dont want to. i am using this post as a means to confront the problem myself, and i know moving on will let time and experience heal my heartbreak, but it is a difficult choice to abandon

anyone have any advice, encouragement, or knowledge? someone i trust suggested tinder. any tips?

Can't make an original title on this subreddit.

So I(16 M)'m very anxious, kinda overly heady, reserved and not very social in any groups larger than a few close friends. But I have a really supportive, non judgemental, but loud and funny family, so I can be kinda bubbly once in awhile. IDK, just thought I should give you guys some reference for my personality.

I feel totally alone . I have a few close friends, and I'm feeling better on the platonic front recently, but romantically I feel totally hopeless. Haven't had a relationship in nearly 2 years. I take that back -from October of last year until late January of this year, I had a girlfriend, but she dumped me and revealed she never really had feelings for me but didn't want to say no. In the past 3 years or so, I've been rejected or friendzoned or whatever over 20 times (all different people too). I get feelings really easily, but I've sorta come to the realization that I'll probably not get to express them or have them be reciprocated in the near future (or ever maybe), so seeing couples even in movies is excruciating. A couple months ago I developed feelings for a girl in an intense way for the first time in a while, but said something she thought was kinda mean and now won't speak to me at all. So that really sucks. I feel like anyone I get close to romantically just ends up wanting nothing to do with me. It makes me feel like I'm an alien -not a sexy alien in a sci fi movie, more like one no one wants to be around and I have no idea why. I don't feel ""off"", I don't feel like a pariah. I've always felt different than most, but never like this. I mean I'm not ugly as far as I know. Not super attractive either, but idk like a 6.5 or 7? Not that I'd want to be with someone who cares about that too much, but I thought I'd just make that clear I guess.

I've started to develop feelings for someone else. We have a few mutual friends and game together a little bit. We see eachother irl at school, but we've only conversed on discord. Not even very much, just like one time. I probably shouldn't develop feelings that fast, but here we are.

How should I talk to her? How should I talk to anyone? How can I feel more confident and figure out what's wrong with me that every one wants to move away from? I don't have any friends I can talk about this stuff with, so this is my only hope really. Thanks",26Jun2019,1

I'd held a candle for him since we first broke up, and only recently had made real progress toward moving on, when he asked for me back, expressing regrets over his life's direction including of women he was involved with, involvement with online dating, etc. Recently he had a mental breakdown and I went up to visit for the better part of a week to his parents', where he's been staying (previous to our first getting together he had also had a major depressive episode which resulted in his parents putting him on meds). He was displaying signs of paranoia, saying that there was a govt conspiracy against him, that a nurse at a recent checkup had injected him with poison which would kill him within the year, would look at all these depressing links about people who died young, people rumored to have been injected with AIDS (Eazy-E), working out every single day, lifting heavy weights, and never eating more than a few bites of food, claiming that he was unable to digest and that his organs were shutting down. I did my best to help because I felt like he needed an ally around his somewhat overwhelming parents - - 2 accomplished deans at an important college. While I was there I warned him that I believed his parents would not be opposed to committing him to hospital--- his response was always, ""I will not die in a hospital. I will kill myself before they are able to take me to one.""

It's two days later and he's in hospital according to his mother. I'm not saying that this is not the best option for his recovery however as someone who has been in a hospital in an involuntary hold and a mental health care facility, I know how scary it can be and how important being surrounded by loved ones is. I feel that his mother is the more overbearing of the two professor parents, but hers is the only number I saved. I asked if he was in any shape to be seen by me tomorrow, my only day off of the week - - her response was, ""No, please don't think of coming. Things are much too serious at this point.""

First of all, what does this mean? I've started to get nervous again. And also, how should I feel? I won't be travelling an hour and a half away if the mother (a somewhat scary woman) disapproves, even if I feel she may in part be a contributor to his illness.

69,"My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about four years now. During this time we were in different universities in different states. The long distance wasn’t even the major tension in our relationship. Instead it was my family. I come from a religious and far more cultural background, so it’s expected that I marry into the same religion and culture.

Of course I never took this seriously and pushed off telling my family until earlier this year. It went terrible, and I was forced to choose between them and him. I could tell the emotional turmoil it brought to my house, so I decided to lie once more and tell them we broke it off. 

Here we are now, months later and of course my boyfriend has been patient throughout this whole ordeal but he needs an answer/decision and timeline. I’m indecisive and lack the confidence to make a decision on the matter. 

My parents not only disapprove because of our different upbringings but because they see him as selfish, evil, and manipulative. My friends though they love him also have their doubts that they can’t express when I ask them to. They urge me to take time before making a decision that will result in me losing my family. 

But these past four years have been amazing with him. We’re best friends and we understand each other deeply. He’s always there when I need to cry or talk things out. He makes me laugh.He’s intellectually stimulating and encourages me to pursue things I never would have thought to pursue.

70,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So I have this cousin, who is my age, and whom I love dearly. He generally acts pleasant, but he has his off moments. He is generally very snarky, and has this ""it's common sense"" attitude towards everything. He generally gets angry and makes fun of people when people make mistakes, but gets all defense when he slips up. He doesn't have a close-knit relationship with his dad, like I do. When my Dad had to be taken to the hospital, I was freaking out, because we didn't know what was wrong with him. My cousin tells me to get over it and to come and play. I wanted to say ""You don't love your dad enough to know how I feel"", but I wanted to keep the ""peace"", as well. He is a very competitive person who, of course, LOVES to win. I am almost the exact opposite (I like to win as well, who doesn't), as I am not athletic or competitive. He knows this, but always wants me to compete with him or whatnot. He tells me try my best, and I do, but seeing as how I am not as athletic as he is, he gets mad at me for ""not trying"". I do, but I guess my best isn't good enough. What do I do?

Thanks",26Jun2019,1
71,"I'm a 22 year old guy who has spent most of my life from the age of 15 by myself. I am fine when I am in between relationships, my emotions are generally a flat line with little bumps of sadness or happiness. But I find that when I enter a relationship, I start experiencing radical shifts in my ability to manage emotions. It's as though everything that I feel is multiplied by 5. Is this an indicator that I keep my emotions wrapped up too much and I'm only able to do that because I've been alone for so long? I want to be as in control as I am out of relationships when I am in them. I would be golden if I could learn to do that. Thanks!",26Jun2019,3

76,"So I recently graduated college in California. I've been job hunting and it's going ok. My dad keeps pushing me to apply with the state. I looked into it but the process of getting a job with the state of California is a lengthy process. You have to take a test for the division of jobs you are applying to, and a lot of them require not only a degree but experience as well. I told him I looked at a lot of the available jobs and that I wasn't qualified for any of them because I didn't have experience but I did try looking into it. Even for the entry level jobs, I'd have to wait to take a test. He asked if I applied to anything and I said no, considering I have to wait to take the proper tests to apply. He said since I didn't apply I'm not trying. I told him I've been applying to other jobs anyways so it's ok, I'm sure I'll find something and I'm ok with not being paid a lot, but he was still upset. He said it doesn't matter if I don't have experience and that my degree will let me get my foot through the door. It actually sucked, the way he said what he did to me. I'm not sure why he's so upset. I'm not asking him for money or anything, and I don't live at home. I have savings and have an upcoming interview, so I'm self-sufficient. Is he right though? Should I apply anyways? I feel like it would be a waste.

79,"So my grandad, who I loved, passed away a month ago after being bedridden and unable to talk for 2 years after a stroke. Shit sucks, I know. In my country it's usual to have a ceremony a month after someone has passed (tomorrow), this is important to the story.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background, my dad was born from my grandad's first marriage and had me and my brother. He didn't have a really nice childhood as my granpa cheated on my grandma and this ended up destroying their marriage. He then married his second wife (the one in OP) and had two children (both are in their 40s now). My dad and granpa had a falling out which led to him being left out of the will. Besides this, me and my brother (his only 2 grandchildren) had a very good relationship with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Granpa was always oscilating between wealth and near-broke, but when he had money he was very generous to everybody. He once offered me a car, but went broke before I could get my licence. Apparently, he had some lands he had inherited, which he was planning to sell for a lot of money (around $20m), but he had the stroke before selling them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I found out that the lands were sold and that his wife owned everything. This is ok, I always assumed that she would get everything and we would hardly get anything.

&amp;#x200B;

What pisses me off and the reason I'm here asking advice is this: When I got home today, my dad was in tears and asked me to have a talk with him. There was another ceremony last week, to which neither my dad or me or my brother were invited. He is not going to the ceremony because he is too hurt, he learned all of what i have written at the funeral. His own brother posted on facebook about how he was coming from abroad, and didn't even answer my dad when he asked him why he was coming a week before. This wasn't even a secret, the extended family knew and said nothing. The last thing my dad told me was that they were probably going to feel guilty about leaving me and my brother nothing, so if they offered us money we should accept it (we struggle for money).

&amp;#x200B;

So this is what I'm asking. I'm positively going to take the money if they offer it, because I need to help my brother get through college. Am I doing the right thing? How should I act with this people after I've learned what I've learned? I thought they were all my lovable uncles until today, I'm honestly moved by how bad my family is behaving.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Grandad passed away, left everything to his 2nd wife and we aren't even invited to the ceremony, dad in tears from being treated like shit by his brothers. I'm bad at summaries.",26Jun2019,2
80,"I’m a university student, and I made some pretty good friends when I moved for school. That being said, when I’m back home for work during the summers, I feel very alone &amp; anxious about the possibility of having no close friends around once I’m done school.

My roommates and I get along really well, but they are both (unfortunately) bad at communicating when I’m not there in person. I’ve tried to reach out and start conversations many times before, but with little success. 

I know that they don’t hate me (and that they’re probably just busy with summer courses/work), but this seems to trigger a lot of anxiety surrounding life after I graduate. Should a situation arise where my current friends and I lose touch when we move back to our hometowns after school, I’m genuinely terrified that I’ll be all alone.

My place of work (and where I’ll likely be working after I graduate) doesn’t really employ many people my age... and even though I try to get involved in sports/other stuff outside of work, I haven’t really managed to make any lasting friendships. My greatest fear is being all alone after I graduate, and that my friends will forget about me regardless of my attempts to stay in touch.

I feel pretty stupid for worrying about this so much... I genuinely don’t think I’ve been concerned about making friends since like 7th grade (lol).

89,"Hello all, hopefully I can get some solid advice/help on this because I’ve been dealing with this for about 3 years or so. (Also, sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.)

Anyways, I’m (21/M) and I’ve been dating my current GF (20/F) for 4 years straight. Around the year mark I joined the military straight out of high school. Ever since joining the military my family (in this case just my mom and dad.) have been very selfish towards this relationship. Every time since coming home I am constantly reminded how I don’t spend enough time with them (I normally spend 2 weeks home and pretty much evenly balance out days between the 2 weeks.) for example, yesterday my girlfriend surprised me with a 1 night stay at a water park and downtown area visit/tour. So we did so, I then came home to her (my mom) bitching that I wasted away one of her days off and how she had plans for us today (that she didn’t tell me about.) and now it’s a constant awkward vibe around my parents and girlfriend, although I don’t tell my girlfriend because I don’t want her to not feel welcome around my house. Keep in mind, this is a girl I plan on proposing to soon and want to be with.. what the fuck do I do? It’s been 3 years of this constant and it drains my energy every time I’m home because I constantly feel like I’m not spending enough time with either party.

90,"I know this sounds like something simple or even not worth looking at but this issue has been making me miserable ever since I got there.

I've been studying engineering and programming for a few years now and it's been a really rough path for me since I have not been doing well in the recent semesters.
My parents have noticed that I've been dealing with depressive thoughts and see that I don't even want to get up to go to school.

I hate studying in my school, the teachers are mostly shit and the classrooms are disgusting.
Not to mention that when you fail a subject, you've got to pay a good amount of money to retake the subject.
In all of the failed subjects that I've got, the price revolves around a 800$ (dollars) and my parents have complained that they spend lots of cash on my studies and that makes me feel terrible for them.

I want to admit to them that I want to quit and study something else since I don't like what I'm studying at all, yet I can't just tell them for I'm worried that I will be a disappointment to them, seeing that they (they as in ALL of my family, uncles, aunts, even colleagues) have great expectations of me simply by being an engineering student. 
(Engineers are a big deal in my country)

I know that I should not care for what others think of me or the expectations they have for me, but it's truly easier said or written than done for me, I simply don't know what to do, I get the feeling of being adrift since I entered engineering school because I made that decision without thinking straight about it, now I regret it.

Another thing is that my parents have that little habit of comparing things. Mother and father are loving and caring, yet they often compare me to my cousins which they are older than me and almost finishing their studies, yet I fell behind and I'm often told how my cousins earn loads of cash every month and how I'm not by failing my classes.
 
I know this can be taken as pathetic or embarrassing, but I just want to vent out my frustrations anywhere and I think Reddit is the ideal place for that.


I'd appreciate any serious good advice. :(

The reviews are awesome, but most just talk about how it looks and the material it's made of. I can't tell if that means it'll be good for applying makeup.

Hello, fellow redditors. First time posting here, and first significant post I've made on Reddit.

Back in elementary school, I had this friend (let's call him A) I was very close to. We used to hang out all the time and we always got along very well. My parents became very good friends with my friend's parents, so now not only did we hanged out at school, but we would see each other every weekend too. We went to summer trips together, we spent holidays together, we played the same video games, we then went to the same middle school, etc. We were good, close friends. I always felt like the reason he always liked me was that his parents were really wealthy, and me, as a kid comfortably living in the middle class, never really cared much about his possessions. This friendship went on for a couple of years until I moved to a different city. As the socially awkward person I am, I found it really hard to keep in touch with him. I always knew what he was up to because my parents still talked to his parents, but I never actually tried to reach out to him neither him to me.

Today, my mom called me with some devastating news. Someone very close to A committed suicide. This person was someone A used to spend a lot of time with. Again, I know about him, because my parents are still close to his parents, and I know how much this person meant to A. My mom told me it would be nice if I reached out to him and tell him I felt sorry for what happened.

Now, here's the issue: I don't want to say anything to him. He is no longer part of my life and neither am I part of his. At some point, he was very important to me, but that was years ago. I do feel terribly sad and it sucks someone has to go through that but right now, I feel like I am not the one to write to him about this. I know what is like losing someone under similar circumstances and I remember I never really cared about what people had to say to me. There are no words in the world that can help you in these moments of darkness. I told my mom this and she was furious and disappointed. I don't even follow A on social media, but my mom told me it would be good to just send a short message to him through FB. I feel like my words would be meaningless to him, although I might be wrong.

Reddit, am I overthinking this by deciding to not to reach out to him? Or do you think this is a good moment to show him that even though the distance and time pulled us apart, that he was someone important in my life and I feel sorry he had to go through this?",26Jun2019,1

Today is my birthday, I'm 19

I just started a new job as a cashier on Monday as like my ""official"" first real day. 

But then literally everything went to shit within like this whole day....

Basically I've been living with my parents still because I'm a college student with no money and I am still a kid honestly. I don't have my license or a car so I have to take the bus everywhere. My family has like no money at all. My entire life has been...bad. 

Which is why I'm used to evictions, but this one is bad like really bad. I thought my dad was going to work something out with the landlord, but I guess not because today he came with a police officer to do a ""walk through"" which was literally terrifying. Today has just been the absolute worst birthday ever. I cried so hard I felt like I was going to throw up. 

And there is a possibility we will be set out tomorrow morning. I'm supposed to work tomorrow morning 11 until 5. I'm a cashier so I'm supposed to be friendly and happy and I know I cant fake that happy shit not when I know my stuff is being put out on the street. My parents are going to a motel or hotel and my boyfriend and I are going back to stay at his house again but its further away from my job and my commute on the bus is going to be weird and long and I don't even know the route. I have to pack all of my stuff tonight and it's already late so I'm probably going to be up late packing but even if I didn't have to, my anxiety levels are through the roof right now and I dont even know if sleep will come. 

I just dont know what to do. I feel like work is impossible tomorrow because of everything going on but I dont know how to call off when I just started. I'm in a state of mind right now where I dont even care if I get in trouble because everything is going so bad right now but at the same time I do because I want to keep working there because I want to at least work the summer, I'd have no money at all if I didn't. I just dont know how to call and tell them I can't come in because of an eviction that isnt even my fault? I dont know??

103,"I'm 17 years old. My parents divorced when I was in fourth grade. Ever since they split, my two younger siblings and I have had to go back and forth between the two. My dad is unemployed; my mom makes all of our money and gives half of it to my father for child support purposes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of one of my sibling's medical conditions, both of my siblings will be staying with my mother for a few weeks. I am still going forth between my mother and my father.

I can't take going back and forth anymore. I don't want to do it any longer. I want to live with my mom full time for until I go to college next year. (I'm a rising senior in high school right now.)

&amp;#x200B;

My dad loves me, I know that. He pays for my car and my car insurance. He pays for my music lessons. Whenever I want something he buys it for me (within reason). He'll do anything for me, and I appreciate him. But, I'm uncomfortable around him. He was abusive when I was little, and I've always been afraid of him since. And I just don't want to live with him anymore. I want to be with my mom full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared of taking this further because, as stated above, my dad clearly has a temper. You know what he also has? Depression. Untreated depression. He already knows my siblings prefer mom. If I were to make the switch—which I apparently can do now that I'm 17—to full time with mom, I'm afraid he might commit suicide. And I don't want him to take his own life. I don't want that on my conscience, either. He doesn't work. He sits around all day watching T.V. He likes to write books. I could totally envision him killing himself, and I don't want to wake up one more to discover that he has because I stayed with my mother full-time.

Okay, I am so confused by our car issues this past week that I no longer know what to do. So I am breaking my lurker status with this cry for help and clarity.

Last week Wednesday, after a catastrophic morning, we found out that our only car needed a new transmission. In the two years we’ve had it, we have spent $12000 on a $10,000 car (which we still owe $5,000 on), including a new engine. I don’t drive, but my husband needs a reliable car for work(works for hospice). Now, we don’t have much money, so my MIL has helped us by putting things on her credit card in the past, so she plays a vital role. 
The mechanic sits us down and tells us that it’ll be $3,700 to fix...OR, he has another used car in working order for $4,500. The four of us discuss it and we wind up paying $4,000 for the new car, as is. He also agrees to take the one with the broken transmission off our hands, a job which he valued at $600 off the original price. Following me so far? Okay, good. 
So, we get the car late Thursday and our MIL’s boyfriend looks at it later. He says that he sees something wrong by the radiator, possibly. We top off the coolant (important later). On Friday, my husband drives his usual 80+ miles. Come to find out,  he had to refill the coolant halfway through the day, and it is now half-empty. We fill it again. Saturday, we don’t use the car. Sunday, coolant is still full, and we drive to the next town over, 20 miles away. Driving back, it starts overheating, but still with coolant inside. We tow it back to his shop. Monday, we get confirmation that it’s the radiator. Tuesday, we get the call that it’s fixed...for a couple hundred dollars. Now, he stuck his neck out for us, is super friendly, and I know him from around our town. It would do him no good to screw us, in such a small town. But he sold us a “working” car, and it obviously isn’t. So should we be paying for the repairs? Who’s in the right? What’s going on?
 Thanks so much for reading this...any and all advice welcome! Especially mechanics!",26Jun2019,1
107,"I acknowledge that my judgement at the moment is clouded by what happened recently. It doesn't help that I am going through a severe bout of depression as well. I am unable to meet my partner's needs for about a month now and I can see the frustration building up in her. She doesn't pretend to empathize because her views on depression are a bit outlandish, but at least she doesn't lie about it.

A week ago, after returning from work, she decided to go off on me and tell me exactly how she felt. I have never been good at standing up for myself so I was taking the verbal beating as usual. Once she calms down, I usually try to have a conversation and try to validate her feelings. Sadly, she brought up something that in retrospect, I made a mistake of sharing with her. She said something along the lines of how I cannot be a victim of sexual abuse because I have a penis. How I need to get over it because a lot of girls who're actual victims of sexual abuse do. I couldn't hold back my tears, which I was mocked for as well. I feel like i've reached my threshold with her and am unable to see us together anymore. She hasn't apologized ever since and is behaving like nothing ever happened.

I've been doing some research on Reddit but it is leading to subreddits like /r/MGTOW and /r/MensRights, which I have reservations about. My depression is only getting worse, and while I love her, I can't let her treat me like this anymore. I want to be left alone. How should I go about this? I don't want to lose our friends or her mom, who's practically been like a maternal figure.",26Jun2019,10
108,"Hello,

I’m an IT and business student at a university in Ontario, Canada. I’ve been applying for internships since early December, and couldn’t find anything. I ended up applying to work at an amazon warehouse, and easily got the job. It ended up being one of the worst experiences. It’s physically excruciating, with almost no mental stimulation. I feel like a robot working here. I’ve already called in “sick” for so many days because I just absolutely hate working there. I’ve become a negative and cold person over the last few weeks while working at amazon. 

I’ve been applying to jobs endlessly on indeed, but it feels like there’s no point anymore since no one will hire this late into the summer.

Any advice would be appreciated.",26Jun2019,1

110,"So about a month ago, I had visited my girlfriend (she lives 3 states away). We have been dating for a year and a half now. Afterwards, we were doing well but I incorrectly felt the need to always be strong and to essentially hide my emotions. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation for over 10 years and I was going through a really, really bad episode. A girl I had had a fling with a few years prior also texted me around this time and sent me more and more lewd and suggestive messages while also being a ear to listen for all the suicidal bits. The week before I went to meet with the girlfriend, I went to go see the other women, just to hang out as this was before the suggestive messages started. Long story short, we got to third base while I initially protested, but made no serious effort to stop. I wanted to feel guilty and do something that would make me believe I was the bad person I always saw myself as. I was devastated and wrote a suicide note that night. I decided that I was going to kill myself. But first, I would go see my girlfriend because it felt selfish for me to take my own life when she was celebrating a big life event. The next weekend I was going to end it. After rewriting my note multiple times, I started breaking down and felt like I needed to push myself to go through with it. The other women was texting me multiple times a day with lewd and suggestive messages. So, I went over, we went all the way and I came back on Friday, around 3 am. I went to work the next day and at around 2 pm, I thought I was ready. But right before I went through with it, I read the note one more time and realized that it was the way I should go. It would be way more selfish for me to take my own life and hurt my family, my girlfriend, and friends who only love me despite my flaws. I had a long talk with my girlfriend that day that I was in a bad place mentally, but I did not tell her about how close I got. She offered nothing but support.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past month, I've been in a state of shock and have not fully comprehended the infidelity or the almost attempt that much. I have been active (even well before all of this) in trying to find a counselor to help me with my issues, been trying to practice meditation, smoking and drinking less, connecting with those who I love, and taking care of myself. I want to marry this girl and be with her for the rest of my life. I have tried to be the best boyfriend throughout the relationship to her and we have never really had a fight and have supported each other through everything. She's says she will be here no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am scheduled to see her this weekend for a short trip. On Sunday, I just had a hardcore realization of what exactly happened and I feel overwhelmingly guilty. I have obviously cut off communication with the other women (who knew I was in a committed relationship) and she understands, promises not to tell, and even says she wants things to work out with my girlfriend. I have no reason to distrust her in this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about just taking it to the grave, in that I know my girlfriend will blame herself and she doesn't deserve the hurt. But I also know it would be right to tell her, and let her make the decision on our relationship. I was selfish once. I don't know if keeping that guilt and that secret and that hurt away is more selfish or, if me telling her since I feel all over the place right now, is just a way to absolve myself. I also don't want her to stay with me just because she's afraid I might still commit suicide. I know this will never happen again and I want to be better and I'm really trying, but I just don't know how to try in this situation.

111,"Hello everyone!

I'm almost 16, about to get my drivers license. I have all a's in school, I do some academic extracurriculars, and overall care a lot about my future. On top of that, I consider myself to be super responsible. I help around the house all the time, clean up messes, do laundry, etc. The most important thing here is that I've never done anything illegal or associated myself with anything bad, like going to parties with illegal shit going on or something like that. 

Despite all of this, my parents don't think I'm trustworthy enough to not lie to them about where I am. Today my mom told me she was going to put a tracking app onto my phone so she could see where I was at all times.

I know some people might say ""well it shouldn't matter if they track you or not, since you're honest"" but that's not the point here. I'm really upset that my parents don't trust me since I've literally never done anything to lose their trust. Also, I feel that since I'm literally almost an adult, they should trust me. I feel like they're treating me like a baby.

They've always been helicopter parents, but I feel this is overstepping a personal boundary. Do I not deserve some privacy, especially since I've made an effort to be a good daughter?

So, I guess my question here is; how do I explain this to them? am I overreacting?",26Jun2019,1
112,"Back story; Parents got divorced; mom met the new guy; the new guy has a dog; the start dating for 4 years new guy officially moved in about 3 years ago; my mom and her boyfriend are now engaged and about to be going on 7(?) years I think. His dog barks her lungs out anytime she hears the tiniest fucking peep and it drives me insane. Mind you I like my mom's boyfriend we just aren’t that close, my parents got divorced when i was 12, i’m 17 now. He’s cool but just my moms boyfriend if you get what i mean lol

She is a 10(?) year old Lab, super sweet and loving dog, I just cannot fucking stand her when she barks. It wouldn’t be so bad if she was like some big bad dog and would protect us but I know she wouldn’t do shit if that time ever came. She barks at everything, and when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. I would never hit her but I just can’t help to scream at the top of my lungs for her to stop but she just won’t stop. Like if someone pulls into the garage and doesn’t come inside in .2 seconds she just barks and barks and barks and barks and barks as if it’s going to make the walk any faster or magically appear. It’s literally driving me fucking insane. I don’t know what to do because of 1. I will never ever been mean and hit her (which shouldn’t and would never even be a solution), and 2. she’s not “my dog” my stepdad hardly ever says anything about it, he will just occasionally yell at her to stop but other than that he always uses the excuse “she’s protecting us” from what the cup I dropped on the floor???? It’s just driving me insane, she does it all day every day, 2 am? 4 am? 3 pm whatever fucking time, and doesn’t stop for anything.

independent study at that. So we got together march of this year , I was 15 then, and the first couple times she came 

over like towards the end of the day I kinda wanted her to leave, a week or two passes and like I enjoy my time with her 

more and more. Also I felt she was more clingy at first but I really didn't mind. I remember her going to Coachella and 

telling me a guy slapped her ass, and at the time I was a lil bothered but didn't like get mad, and I remember like I think 

a week after she showed me a convo on ig of her and sum guy from ig and he was like a total perv and even sent a vid of 

him pulling down his pants. At this point I was like fuming because like she talked to this guy since even before we talked

 and I didn't show it but I said y don't u block him. Another week goes and the same shit with another guy happens, 

asking her for pics and she sends me it on imessage and like I was sooo uncomfortable and pissed. So 2 weeks pass and  

I told her that I didn't like how she talked to guys like that and she said she would stop talking to guys period, which then

 I told her idc as long as they were cool. So from then too about a month and a half later things r going very good, my 

bday passes on the 29th of may and like she told me a lot about her going to cancun for a week and like then like the 

realization hit me there. I was ok until the 7th a Friday came, like I became real sad and like angry bc like my family could

 never take me to a place like that. So over the 7th to the 14th I couldn't sleep for shit and the first couple days went by

 so slow. I had gotten no more than 13 hours of sleep that week. So for the like 2 weeks I cant go like two days around 

her, and while she was in cancun I couldn't stop thinking about her and I kept making myself thinking she was getting 

raped and dumbshit like that, like I never thought id be so invested in a girl within the first year, and here I am like 

stupidly in love with her. like Amanda said she loves me too and had sum problems going to sleep in cancun, but I think it

 was jus the climate change, and change in surroundings. Shes told me a lot of how she loves me and misses me, which I 

do believe her, but I feel like pathetic for how I am at this moment in time. So I need some advice...thanks for reading

117,"I'm 19 and a freshman in college, Been working at an AC Moore for about a month now.

Last week my manager and the assistant manager called me into their office and said they saw me using my phone and that no matter the reason I shouldn't have and if its an emergency to tell them. Later that shift it was about 30 minutes from closing and the store was empty so I looked at my phone for about 15 seconds and got caught in the act by the assistant manager, although she didn't say anything. Fast forward to today the manager fired me. I definitely fucked up to be honest didn't care because this is a dead-end minimum wage job, I got too comfortable. Manager has been a control freak from day 1, really annoying person but the job was so easy I had to stay. I could definitely tell she was power-tripping off of firing me.

Were they too rash with firing me this easily? I notice they're going through employees like crazy, constant layoffs even one woman who seemed invested in the job got laid off, probably for pissing off the manager.

I really wish I could've told the manager how much of a control freak she is and that she'll be stuck in this dead-end job living a mediocre suburban life until the day she dies. I would've even pulled out my student ID just to rub it in since I got to a very prestigious uni. Did the smart thing and acted fake nice, shook her hand and left.

118,"So, I’ve been living in my car for almost two months now. With a string of bad luck and bad choices, I ended up resigning from a good paying job (to avoid termination) just weeks after financing a vehicle for the first time(biggest mistake, unemployment would’ve helped so much). Because I have very little credit history, my APR is  ridiculous. I have a 17k dollar car, but a loan just under 30k. This was with a $2,000 down payment. Being male, under 25, and in an urban area, my insurance rates are also ridiculous. In total my car costs me around $800 a month. After losing my job, I struggled to find anything that could keep up with rent and my car, and after being a month late on rent, the owner of the house I was renting from changed the locks and tried to ransom/sell my belongings. I had to show up with police just to get my things back to put in a storage unit. There was no legitimate lease (she had me sign an obviously fake one and I pretended I didn’t know because I liked everything else about it, another big mistake), so there wasn’t much I could do that I knew of. I cut my losses, landlord was horrible for other reasons too and I took it as a sign to start somewhere new. I finally managed to find a stable job after moving into my car and just caught up on all my debts. I got a gym membership to have somewhere to shower, but struggle to motivate myself to work out every day. I got food stamps, but apparently do not qualify for general relief because I’m told I have to be homeless AND unemployed, which imo defeats the purpose of a government aid that’s supposed to help you get back on your feet. I’m just starting to save up for a room, I am $40 in the green but have to make that last until Friday. I make $400 a week unless I get lucky with overtime, but the upcoming holiday is unpaid because I am a temp. On the 5th $200 goes to insurance and $60 goes to my phone bill. My next check will go to savings, then the entire $400 from the next one goes to my car payment. Then save, pay, save, pay, until I have $1,100+ saved up to rent a cheap room somewhere nearby this job. 

After writing it all out, it looks like it’s going to take me another couple months to finally be out of my car and in a bed and with a bathroom I don’t need sandals to shower in. I’m getting very discouraged, because I have no outside help other than moral support from coworkers who know of my situation, but that only goes so far. I already suffer from mental health issues that severely impacted my life even before this, but I find myself getting extremely depressed, in ways I haven’t felt since I was growing up. My third week in the car, I had a dream of shooting myself in my back seat. I won’t hurt myself, but I still think about that dream. I find it hard to force myself into the gym even if it’s just to shower. I feel embarrassed because I’m sure the employees know because nobody goes to the gym just to shower (at 4am, when I get ready for work.) I try to sleep as much as possible to make the time go by faster. It’s so hot and living in a black car doesn’t help. I have watched hundreds of YouTube videos because I can’t find anything else to do. Maybe find an anime to binge on funimation? I don’t know. I’ve made a doctors appointment for my old therapist and PCP, hopefully that will help. Maybe getting back on meds. Maybe get a second job to make money and keep me busy in afternoons. I can’t even think straight. I go days without eating or only eating a pre made sandwich from the wal mart I sleep at. I am always angry and sad and tired. I think about how much I despise people. I am so bitter and angry, but always put up a happy face to remain professional, but now even my coworkers notice I am acting. I think of how jealous I am of people who have it easier. I tell myself it could be worse, but it still is so bad. I feel desperately lonely, yet I push people away. Maybe this was just a rant/vent, I don’t know. I am suffering every day. I have no friends or family and am constantly alone with my thoughts, which are usually negative. I am tired of hearing it could be worse. I am tired of hearing it will get better. I know these things, but it doesn’t change how painful and hard it still is.  What should I do? How do I stay positive? Thank you for reading.",26Jun2019,13

I’m sure there are many many people who have it worse and I’m grateful for what I have. Backstory on what’s happened recently in my life. About a year ago I quit baseball which I’ve played for 12 years because I simply just got tired of it and no longer enjoyed it as much. I had a relationship that I put all my effort and happiness into. We hung outsell the time , I bought her a bunch of stuff I knew she wanted for Valentine’s Day, I tried my hardest to make her feel beautiful and realize her worth. I truly put my everything into this relationship. I began to realize that I was always the one asking to hangout, she started talking to me less, never started conversation, replied with short texts and she treated me better when we were friends. I asked her out and she told me that she didn’t think a relationship was the right thing to do even though we were essentially dating without the title. We got into a fight and she said we needed to take a “break” I was and still am crushed closer to 5 months later. She regularly posts stuff about wanting a relationship and someone who shows her effort and cares for her after that’s exactly what I tried my hardest to do. I’ve come to realize I was simply just not good enough. Im always the person who’s there for everyone else but I have nobody to talk to about my problems and that’s why I’m here. My friends don’t invite me places anymore, nobody talks to me often, I feel super lonely. You’re probably thinking so what it’s just another young kid who got his heartbroken thinking his relationship was permanent but she was more than that she helped me through hard times and made me the happiest I’ve been since forever I think. My friend committed suicide super unexpectedly on December 19, 2018 2 days after his moms birthday and 6 days from Christmas. My whole school and community was absolutely shocked and crushed. My “girlfriend” was really close with him and I was one of the first people to know about his death since it literally happened maybe 200 yards from my house and I heard the gunshot.Me and him did lots of things together as young kids. Playing in the woods, fishing, riding bikes, playing football, frisbee, making water slides, doing lemonade stands, everything young kids did together.  I ended up telling her the news that night and we helped each other through the grief . She was the person who was truly there for me and helped me but now we don’t talk at all.

I’ve recruited my male best friend, another male good friend of mine, and my girlfriend to go with me for four nights of rent camping and airplanes. I knew that my parents wouldn’t be super down for me bringing my girlfriend and the conversation finally happened tonight. They definitely don’t support it and came up with a lot of their reasons for why I shouldn’t bring my girlfriend. They said that if I choose to bring her they’re not going to assist me with the trip at all (car, fuel, camping supplies), which would make things a lot more difficult for me.

131,"Hey, just wondering if these feelings are  fair of me to feel. 


Just a little background information first. My boyfriend and I met when we were both living at our parents working on our careers (his has skyrocketed, mine has sidestepped). We've been living together for 2 years and together for 3. Despite prompting and asking and wishing (not often, just when I feel like the time is appropriate), he still doesn't regularly talk about our future together - I'm mostly talking about whether we'll get married or have kids etc. 


My feelings towards him have gone from hopeful to disappointed to hopeful to annoyed to just...apathetic, like not expecting anything in return for all of my dreams of being ""2gether 4ever"" with him. I think that's a bad thing.


But this guy is here for me in every other sense and for the most part he has my back when I get blue or whatever. He recently started paying the rent all on his own because he makes a heck of a lot more than I do, and in return I help him out in many other ways. We're a team. But I'm really starving for that talk of forever with me and him. And now that I think of it he's not an outwardly affectionate guy but hearing the ""someday""s and ""when we""s is sort of what I feel like I need for closure. 


We are a healthy couple in many ways, we are a part of each other's family lives, and we work together on keeping the house, meals, cleaning, helping each other out during dark times etc. One important aspect of any relationship is the sex life, of which I feel like I've taken the lead. I've done so much for him to satisfy his desires while my own are so simple to fulfill. All I'm saying is I love him, but I also go above and beyond for him while expecting very little. But recently I haven't been feeling it, like I'm just playing the part. It would seem like what I need to get me going is the romantic part of it all. 


He never talks about growing old or having kids, doesn't even mention marriage. I am open minded in a lot of ways but I'm traditional in the sense that I want to get married to someone(him) someday. I want to feel loved, like as selfish as it sounds I want to be someone's queen. Someone's ""one and only, forever"".


I've made futile attempts to get him to talk about it more. A while ago I seriously considered selling my horse and I got a lot of serious offers. I came up to him in tears and told him if I were to sell my horse I'd need to know if he wanted to be with me forever or else I'd just keep my horse and be single, fuck it ( not that I was breaking up with him). I told him I hated how he never aspired for a future with me out loud, and i resented that. He assured me he wanted all of those things and convinced me not to sell the other love of my life (my horse). I thought going forward we would be more open about our future. But he hasn't brought up our future once since. Even when I had a few too many drinks last weekend and showed him my wedding pinterest. He said nothing and it was like reading poems to a horse.


Meanwhile, I go above and beyond my own comfort zone for him in bed. We have normal sex and we also occasionally have crazy sex that I'm not super into, but do it for him. But lately I just feel totally turned off. Like if you cant talk about me like your someday wife, maybe you're just another bang after all? 


So in a roundabout way I'm asking for advice on whether or not this is normal, and what I should do to get him to see my needs or gauge whether or not he wants to meet my needs?


I've had a lot of ahitty boyfriends before him. Not his fault, but I've felt sort of used by every one of them. While I do feel like I love him, I feel sort of no different in the sense that he's not planting seeds of hope. That's just honestly turning me off and if he doesn't want me as a forever partner I want to know that information right away instead of wasting more time. 


Tl;dr my boyfriend never talks about our future together. I go above and beyond for my boyfriend, but I'm turned off by the fact that he isnt telling me that he wants to be with me forever. I've even told him that I want him to talk about our future more and my request was overlooked. Is this normal? What should I do to make him see that talking about our future is important to me, and not talking about our future is a turn off?",26Jun2019,1

The day after my graduation ceremony, I immediately packed up for college orientation and lost contact with my high school friends.

I have since then improved on my social skills, mental, emotional, and physical state; however, some emotions from my high school days remain tucked inside one part of my brain.

Should I still feel bitter about not attending graduation, not fully experiencing high school, and leaving people behind?

My mom has prevented my sister from any free time on her phone and expects her to study the entire day. Today my mom mentioned that my sister's free time was the Air Conditioner and her dinner.  

My mom's logic whenever my sister is doing remotely anything fun is to escalate the situation and make it only two choices; you can choose to do whatever you're doing now and drop out of high school or study and stay in school. My sister wanted to have fun cooking food once and my mom got angry saying she can choose to immediately become a culinary chef and go to cooking school or go back to studying.

I can have friends support her in whatever she needs, I’m just not sure of what she and her family needs. I want to know what you think she needs now, over the next few days, and long term. Any in-person help she needs I can help arrange through mutual friends who aren’t inconveniently 1700 miles away. Does her family need meals prepped and put in their freezer? Someone with them at all times? Support at the hospital? She is not responsive over text but she is safe and with friends and neighbors and the brother and parents are at the hospital. I can’t ask them what they need because they don’t need me texting them asking them what they need right now, he just went to the hospital 20 minutes ago.

138,"Hi everyone! Ever since I was a child I loved reading, writing, speaking, and everything about English. Everything was fine and dandy. In eighth grade we had to give speeches, informative, persuasive, and stuff like that and I loved doing it. And also when I was young, my voice was really high. Whenever I would answer whoever is calling my mom or my dad’s phone, people would call me ma’am. It was very stable.

Last year we had to give an emotional speech and I was very surprised that all that would come out of my mouth was a croak. And I finished the speech and my friends all asked me what happened to my voice. I didn’t know and it was very embarrassing. My voice got deeper but still higher than others but there’s a catch. It isn’t stable. At all. Whenever I talk there’s a croak. I can’t talk loud because somehow my voice will be very soft and more often skip sounds. Now every time we have to talk in front I get anxiety. I thought it was because of my asthma but I highly doubt it. It’s never happened before when I got asthma. It’s like my voice is one big voice crack. I’m trying to make it through but I don’t know if I can. I guess what I’m asking is if my voice will one day stabilize or will it always stay this way.",26Jun2019,2

140,"Before I begin I just wanna mention I don't wanna hate or anything, if I'm posting on the wrong subreddit I apologize, if I am please help re-direct me somewhere else, please and thank you.

Hi, sorry about the long post but hopefully someone out there hears my story out. I don't want to share my name on here just yet, but I want to make a post about this because this has never happened to me at a job. A couple things about myself is that I love to work, and I'm a hard worker myself. Managers across jobs I've worked at have always seen me as a hard worker, and I myself have received call after call if I could come in and cover a shift for someone that either didn't wanna work that day or that couldn't show up for their shift. I always ask for more hours, and I always get the job done no matter what. Anyways, back to this topic, I need help with the current situation I'm stuck in. This new job I was working at was great and I loved working there, I always got along with my co workers and everyone else around the facility. Managers have even encouraged us to come in and order something upstairs at the bar or at the restaurant. In my opinion, the food there was pretty good, at least better than the other places I used to work at. This one day I decide to come in and order something. I was with a couple friends hanging out with that day. I tell them to wait for me in the car, I casually went up stairs through the elevator, saw a couple co workers that day and said Hi and they seemed pretty happy to see me. Once I head into the tavern I go ahead and make my large order for 5 people. Once that's done I sit and wait near the viewing area where I can see people racing, having a chill time. Again, co workers come along and say hi. Its been about 30 minutes or so and the food should be ready, so I go ahead and head back up but I don't see any orders there, so I go around the corner to see if the food is ready. Its on plates as if people were there to eat but this was to go remember my friends waited for me in the car. From there I politely let the cook know, ""Hey by the way its to go man."" He looks at me and rudely says, ""The boxes are up there and paper is right there, do it yourself I have too much shit to do."" From there I didn't wanna argue and did it myself. I leave my food in the kitchen and then proceed to wait outside, from there I wait for my last food order. Its been at most 20 min so it should be ready, I go around the corner and check back inside and see that hes putting it in a to go box, at this point I've taken way too long and I need to leave, he hands me the order and says ""I don't mean to be a dickhead but I had too much shit to do."", I reply with, ""Thats fine man but theres other ways of talking to people, but thats fine I can talk to someone about you."" He then proceeds to get fired up and cuss me out telling me to ""fuck off"" and other kind words he said, in those he mentioned ""Come on fight me, we'll both lose our jobs right now I don't give a fuck."" I ignored him and told him to ""back the hell up"" as he kept harassing me and kept getting close to me. He follows me up until the viewing area where he stops and finally leaves. I walk downstairs, outside to my friends car, hand them the food and let them know I'll be right back I just need to talk to my manager. They tell me to hurry up and I do, no other managers were available except for one since the others had a meeting, which I spoke to about the incident and then I left, the manager said not to worry and to go on about my day. I leave knowing that they will speak to that cook about what he did, I would have never imagined what would happen next. Days go by and its finally time for work again, I head there like I always do to clock in, except once I do my manager tells me to come to his managers office for a second to explain what happened that day. I explain the whole situation and let them know that I never once laid a single finger on him nor did I want to argue with him. They then switch the situation and start bringing up mistakes that I have done. **For example, I forgot to put wristbands on 2 people which was during my training as I was still new there, instead of a write up I got one (1) verbal warning and that was it. For the second example, I was checking people in and got them into a race, at my job walk-ins cannot be put in a private race. I've always known that the minute I was taught during training. Except that a track marshal, a manager of course, called me over the radio asking if I could come into his office for a couple minutes. So there I go and I see a piece of paper on his desk, tells me to close the door and take a seat. He asks if I put the people I checked into a private race that night, I said ""No"" because I didn't ever recall putting them there, he says that under my name I checked those people in so I'm going to have a 60 day probationary period in which they will monitor my skills at work. Again, at this point in time I was still very much new I mean I have only been there for 3-4 weeks now, my manager even knows I'm working hard with all this overwhelming information. I let him know how I know that hes been a good guy to me and that I won't sign anything and then explained how I'm trying my best asking my co workers constantly (I feel like I'm bothering them) bothering them with doing certain things on the computer. He then tells me that he understands that he will talk to my manager (Front of House), tells me he ""usually doesn't do this"" and instead will write me up, still at this point I feel bad because I feel like I don't deserve a write up. He doesn't say anything except smile and shake my hand. I leave and start working on bathrooms, I hear a knock on the door mid-cleaning and its the track marshal letting me know that he ""jumped the gun too quick"" and that he won't write me up or do anything anymore.** All in all, my ""past history"" contains nothing but one single verbal warning sent from an email. Okay back to the meeting, both my manager's boss and my manager sit there, his boss brings up my ""past mistakes"" and how they don't see me as a good fit for the position. Again I'm so confused as to my ""past mistakes"", they then proceed to call in the cook, as you can imagine it didn't go well because the cook said to ""tell it how it is"" that ""to tell the truth"" and that ""to stop being a liar"" and we kept going back and forth about what happened. He himself (the cook) knew what he did wrong and said ""Its okay its fine I can look for another job"", from there they end the conversation, both my manager and his boss tell him to step outside, and they go and talk somewhere else with the cook. Another manager comes and just sits there waiting until they come back. Once they're done with whatever they're doing, they come back in and my managers boss begins with, ""Us as a company should part ways with you as an employee because we feel that you two won't create a safe environment here. We won't tell you what is gonna happen with the cook but we feel like this isn't gonna be a good position for you or for the company."" This next part made me feel bad because he says how my manager had to come in one day and work extra and get paid extra because he asked if I could come in earlier for some more help. Yes, he did text me one day that I was gonna work if I could come in and get more help. He didn't have to do that, he himself wanted to because no one forced him to. At this company, I've done things I was never supposed to do and I explain this to my managers boss. This other night a customer came up to me worried and told me there was a pool of blood on the elevator and that someone spit everywhere in there. Over the radio I tell my manager ""Hey (name) theres a customer here that said theres a pool of blood and spit everywhere on the elevator"". The manager that night then tells me ""Put some gloves one, get some cleaning supplies and go clean it up yourself."" So I did he what he said, and I actually got some on my pants and honestly, I felt so disgusted and horrible I didn't know what to do, there was no kit for cleaning up that mess, I literally sprayed the elevator with Lysol and cleaned it up with paper towels and I also sprayed my pants a million times to get that off of me. Once I head back, a co-worker tells me ""You do realize that you weren't suppose to clean up that garbage, right?"" and I replied with, ""What do you mean?"", he tells me, ""Only managers are supposed to clean that up its against Colorado state law and regulation for an employee, which you're not a manager, to clean up bodily fluids."" At past jobs thats what they have taught us which was not to clean up any sort of bodily fluids, we have to phone up a manager and he/she has to do that. After I explain that to my managers boss, his response is, ""Okay."" and proceeds to ignore me and explains how I'm not a good fit for the position and that the company and me should part ways. I have since been looking for some legal advice and for some help on what to do because I feel like I was unfairly terminated for the following reasons: (1) I have never gotten a write up, and that verbal warning was during my training and even that manager himself knew that he rushed to quick because he himself knew that I was a fairly new employee. He goes on to explain how hes done so many write ups for people, how its not a big deal that it doesn't mean anything. (2) They switched the situation from what happened the day I was off ordering food and how that cook harassed and followed me up until the viewing area to ""my past mistakes"". Again it still doesn't seem clear why I was terminated. (3) I already got the hang of everything I was supposed to do as a worker, I wasn't struggling as I was before during my early weeks of training. As of right now, I'm still shocked and frustrated that I lost my job, I'm a young hard working college student that helps support my family, if anyone out there can help me with this situation I'm currently stuck in, please and thank you.

I have seen sources say that the world is at it's breaking point and that we have very little time before we enter a state where the majority of coastal regions and entire sections of the world will be swallowed by the rising sea levels. I have also seen that we are working very hard to combat climate change and that these accusations are clearly the work of blowing things out of proportions.

149,"I’m in the US, Michigan if that matters. 

My mom has small cell lung cancer and despite being told she was all clear about two months ago, is now doing much worse health wise. The cancer that was “gone” is now back and has spread. She’s in terrible pain where it has settled in her hips and is struggling for air when she exerts herself even in the slightest. 

The odds with this cancer are not good at all. With it coming back as quickly and aggressively as it did she probably doesn’t have much time left. She is very depressed because she can barely function on her own and she’s always been an incredibly (to a fault) independent woman. 

My mom lives alone and while my brother and I are close, my brother doesn’t make her the priority he should for whatever reason and I have four small children of my own and I care for my nephews during the day as well, so I cannot stay with her. I do go by at least every other night and we talk throughout the day. 

I feel like, with her diagnoses, hospice care is right around the corner. As of today, she wants to continue the radiation to try and lessen the pain in her hip but ultimately she just wants to die. She did tell her doctor she was open to palliative care so we’ll see where that leads, but what can I/should I do in the meantime when it comes to those things?

153,"Long story short, my father-in-law, who is not in the greatest of health moved in with my family. He's been living with us for about 8 months frequently has little mishaps around the place. The one that pushed us into an argument was today after he backed into the neighbors mailbox and just acted like it didn't happen. This lead to an arguement and eventually after some unforgivable dialogue, we told him he can't live here anymore. He stormed out without grabbing anything.

This was mainly to make sure that it was just out of the picture. Well 2 hours later he returned to get stuff to stay somewhere else for the night. He went into his room and packed a small bag and left. The troubling part is that after he left, he sent me and my wife (his daughter) a text saying he is going to call the police about a theft (referring to the gun). The troubling part is why did he look for his gun that was safely locked away and stored? I feel like since he noticed it was removed, he actively looked for it.

I alerted the recruitment agency to my change of mind (I said it politely) and they tried to make me take the job by saying things like ""it is very serious that you accept the job but then reject it"" and ""it will leave a bad record"". I have not signed any contract, neither have I explicitly accepted the job. I only said I was interested in accepting it.

So I asked who it is and found out the girls name matched someone I worked with that I dont have a crush on but later found out it is the girl I like who goes by that nickname. The problem is me and my cousin are quite close and I  feel like if I ask her out and she says yes it would create a distance between me and my cousin he might even hate me and never talk to me again.so what should I do",26Jun2019,2

161,"Hi, I’m a server in a brand new restaurant. I’ve become friendly with all the cooks, and a new one started about two days ago. He’s probably in his 40s, very open about his drug history, talks frequently about how he went to prison, etc. etc. Tonight, it was slow, so I was back there chatting with the cooks. He asked me if I smoke weed, which occasionally I do.  Then, he motioned me to come see his bag, and proceeds to show me a ton of weed cartridges and CBD stuff. He hands me a cartridge and tells me I can have it for free. I was kinda shocked and everyone in there was watching. I didn’t really know what to do so I just took it and we all joked about how I thought I was getting punk’d. 

Now I’m just super paranoid. I’m 20, so even though weed is legal in my state, it’s still illegal for me to have it, much less in a kitchen of a restaurant. I’m super nervous about cameras picking up the exchange or someone ratting me out. Also, he’s just super obnoxious in general and I can see him getting fired if he’s that loosey-goosey with showing it off inside of the restaurant. I couldn’t stop thinking about it for the rest of the night, and couldn’t give it back to him because he left shortly afterward and I don’t work for the next two days. 

The cooks seemed chill with it too and generally really like me, but I’m just really freaking out and overthinking. I don’t want to be a snitch so I don’t really want to tell management (also out of fear of also getting into trouble). There’s not much I can do, so I thought I’d just write it out and put it into existence so maybe someone could relate it to a similar situation or give advice.

Am I freaking out too much about this?",26Jun2019,7
162,"So I’m 16(f) and my best and only friend has gotten a boyfriend and is experiencing all these new things, I’m super happy for her but I can’t help but be jealous... because of mental health issues I havnt been going out much to meet anyone. I havnt even had my first kiss, and I can’t help but feel sad and worthless that I’m stuck being left behind while my my bff has the time of her life with her bf ): I hope I don’t sound selfish, what do I do?",26Jun2019,1
163,"hey so my boyfriend of about a month (we have been seeing each other since april but made it ""official"" last month) came to me as i was leaving his house saying he thinks we should not be together anymore. he went on to say how he is just scared moving forward due to his past experiences, which i completely understand. (hes only been with crazies like real crazy people)

however when he brought up the fact its hard for him to be intimate with me i started to breakdown because i know this is an issue of mine. he went on to explain it feels like hes fighting with me to do anything. he has been really patient with me in terms of sexual stuff (which is a whole other thing but doesnt really apply here) and i am really grateful about that but i know i lack the desire for regular intimate stuff like kissing, hugging, cuddling etc. i have been trying to be more comfortable about it but clearly not enough. im not really sure why i dont have the desire for this stuff, ive always been very to myself and even with family i dont hug them or anything. i think maybe it has something to do with the lack of touch i had a baby/kid, my mom had always told me how she was afraid of me as a baby and after my dad died when i was 6 she just really shut off. i know its usually the opposite in that case, like my brother really craves affection but i feel like it has to be kinda because of this?

i do very much like him and he said he doesnt want to end our relationship because he likes me also, so he came to the conclusion to take a week to figure out how he can resolve his side of the issues (like to be able to trust me emotionally and whatnot) and i agreed to figure myself out. so basically im just asking if theres other people who also have similar feelings (or lack thereof haha) and also what i can maybe do to get the ball rolling for me",26Jun2019,1
164,"Throw away account because... Ashamed.  


When I was about 4 years old, my oldest brother (12 at the time) invited me into the bathtub with him while my parents were out gambling. Long story short, I didn't understand what was going on and I had given my brother oral sex. I told my parents immediately and he got his ass whooped.  


Ever since this happened, I had become distant with my oldest brother. He was out and about with his buddies growing up and eventually left for the military. I, on the other hand, had this nagging feeling of shame because it was my brother, I was young, and I didn't understand what was going on. I trusted him. Even as an adult(24F), I feel ashamed.. I've only told a couple of people I trust to relieve some stress and to make peace with it. It never did. I remember everything so vividly and it has been haunting me my entire life.  


My oldest brother has recently moved back into town after 10+ years due to a divorce. He wanted a friend and someone to comfort him through these hard times, and he chose me. The few times I've talked to him since he arrived, I'm under the impression that he believes I don't remember what happened because I was so young. I'm still apprehensive about being close to him, I understand what happened was the past and he wouldn't dare doing it again.  


Should I try to create a friendship between my brother and I? How do I rid myself of this such shameful feeling? I would love to talk to a therapist, but as a very broke student, I have no means to pay. I do plan on getting one once I am able to. The close friends who I've briefly spoken to about this are either no longer in my life or I feel very uncomfortable bringing it up again. It makes me uncomfortable even typing it anonymously...

166,"I've moved around a lot as a kid so never had friendships that lasted very long, but I've had this friend group for a little over a year (one of the people being my best friend of about four years) and we're all thick as thieves who have seen eachother through a lot, especially when it comes to me. I had this bad run in a year ago and had serious thoughts about killing myself but my friends helped me through it and now I still feel like I owe them my life. But recently we've not talked much and I'm a naturally paranoid person but it hurts feeling like I'm trying to hold on to what was and they're all moving on in life, I'm the only one who tries to make plans in our GC and then I'll get left on read and it's not a big deal but it feels like I'm trying to put in effort and they're not. I love these guys as my brothers and it kills me feeling this way and then getting mad at them for not reaching out. 

A family member recently passed and another who I'm on rocky (to say the least) terms with came back into town and I couldn't rely on them or reach out with things I desperately wanted to say. What I want more than anything is to wake up with a message saying ""hey let's go grab a drink today"" or something to show I've not been completely left behind. I'm tired of trying to make the effort but my fear of losing them is so much worse and I feel completely powerless. Has anyone gone through this and managed to get through it with their friends?

169,"My 14 year old son was hazed by senior football players.  I don’t know what to do - I heard all practices were cancelled due to an incident.  He told me he didn’t know why.  Then another mother called me to say his name was brought up as a victim.  She knew very little except that they were held down and did inappropriate things.  When I calmed down and directly asked him- he said I’m so sorry, I don’t want to get anyone in trouble or disappoint you!  He’s sketchy on details, but basically 4 seniors shoved 4 freshmen into a classroom, filmed it and hit them with a “massager” - I’m guessing a dildo/vibrator but he didn’t say that or know what it was.  I had to ask &amp; was terrified, but he claims they had on clothes &amp; didn’t get raped.  Some other seniors came in a broke it up.  Apparently 2 other kids came forward.  My son is scared, but willing do so as well.  I just don’t know what that means - talk to the coach, the principal, the police?  I’m jumping ahead so much in my head - is he lying about the details of the abuse? Will the school cover it up because the seniors are star players with scholarships lined up?  Will there even be a football program?  Why was there no coaches around?   How can this happen to him in this day and age? Should we move schools?

171,"So I have both dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, and looking back at a few scenarios I have this feeling that my dependence on others and lack of social awareness might have made me look like a creep but I don't know if I'm crazy paranoid or actually creepy. So here are a couple of scenarios i have felt creepy in:

&amp;#x200B;

1) My bother's G.F came over for the second time and we smoked weed and my brother's eye got awfully red. As we were discussing the redness of his eyes, and how red it had gotten relative to us, I asked his G.F to see her eyes so I could juxtapose the redness of her eyes to his (he was looking in the mirror at this point) then I told him his eyes were redder than hers. Nowadays when she comes over I try to avoid talking to her as much as I can because I think she feels creeped out by me, though neither her nor my brother has said anything about me acting creepy. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) I tend to have an ambiguous half-smile on my face whenever people talk to me, and once one of my co-worker who asked me why I am smiling, and since I didn't have anything to say, I said: ""do you want me to cry?"" I don't know what impression I left on her, but I feel like her initial comment was because she thought I was acting creepy.

&amp;#x200B;

3) This is Muslim lady at work, who has helped me \[and others, but particularly me \] with a lot of things, and I once emailed her about some information I needed and she didn't respond back. A week after that this lady made a mistake at work, and one of our co-workers was mad at her, and I said since we can't do anything maybe we should let go, and after one of the co-workers laughed me for making idiotic comments, I justified my action by saying the Muslim lady is feeling bad, and we can't do anything about it. The Mulsim co-worker didn't look happy, but she was already upset because of her mistake. Probably the worst happened the week after that when I spontaneously in the middle of the work told the woman in question ""You doin well"" \[ This something I usually tell my friends at random; it's some sort of an inside joke\], and then she responded with her broken English ""Why do you always..."" she did't finish the sentence, and though she was fully smiling when she said that I feel like she felt uncomfortable. and today again I made the mistake of emailing her asking for someone else's email Which she didn't respond to, which led me to ask someone else for that email.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone here tell me if I being a creep or not? Or do people just think I'm dim-witted \[I have no problem being seen as a moron, just I don't want to make them uncomfortable by acting creepily\]  Or am I just being paranoid?",26Jun2019,0
172,"I’m 22 and I e been in community college for 4 years now. I’ve switched majors several times and was doing fairly well the first year and a half.

173,"Oh boy. Another “I hate my job thread”. 

I had no clue what I wanted to be when I got out of high school. Literally all I knew was what I saw on tv. I had no exposure to anything. My strength was writing. Really good English student and I was comfortable with it. Business seemed more practical though so that what I majored in. I get a degree in Business Admin. and had no clue what to do. I ended up working in tv broadcasting. It didn’t pay well but it was peaceful. I became really good at my job and had a fairly stress free work life.  It was a job where a had a lot of freedom and my daily tasks were very focused. 

I felt like a flop though. I spent a lot of money to get a business degree and in my head, that was a more respectful profession. I worked hard.  I left after more than 15 yrs to take a state job. Pay was slightly better and the hours were good. However, I don’t fit. In broadcasting, I could solve any problem because I was competent. Now, I’m clueless. I now realize what I knew all along: I shouldn’t have majored in business. I stink at it. I’m in my 40’s though at a job a hate. I dread going to it because I just can’t grasp it all. I make mistakes because I don’t always consider everything. My boss changed my work duties after a year which made things worse. I just don’t know what to do now.  I’m a terrible fit.

175,"Hello all. I am currently a 27/m living at my parent's house just for a month, but i really live by myself since I go to grad school else where. 

My brother abused me in the past, you know slamming my head with a remote, insulting me and calling me all sorts of names, insulting any sort of medication I took (I take psych meds for depression, anxiety). Lets just say it went on for months/years.

And now he lives with his wife in our parent's home. I really don't like the fact that she lives here but I try to be civil.

Me and him never talk or say hi to each other, regardless of whether I come back home after any number of months. 

There was something that happened where I felt disrespected by my brother. He removed food from the microscope when it was done microwaving to warm his drink, But I had something important to do elsewhere. I told him to put the food back in the microwave because he took it out and he just said 'The microwave is not a plate to temporarily store stuff. I got really pissed and then told him and his wife 'please do not say hi to me or talk to me anymore' because the internally get upset when she tries talking to me because i don't like her since I don't like my brother.

I then told my mom what happened and she didn't say anything. Then my brother came down and said 'Don't talk to my wife like that' And then I said 'Yeah because you really care about me? What about how you abused me in the past.' Then he started insulting me in front of our parents saying 'This is why no one talks to you or wants to have anything to do with you.' 'This is why 'So and So' doesn't talk to you.' I then told him this is why you abused me in the past? My parents were just very upset about him and just like they didn't do anything in the past , they didn't do anything but cry.

The thing is that I don't want to have a relationship with my brother, he was abusive to me and No I can not get over that. He and my parents basically say 'Forget what happened' right just like how they did before.

The fight is over but I am here crying about I feel no one understood me before and still do not understand me. Advice?",26Jun2019,1

181,"This story may take a bit, so make sure you’re in a position to read it. Let’s call me.. Riley. The main characters in this story are me, Jason (fake names), and Austin.
So let’s begin.
A while back I was looking on an anonymous subreddit, when I noticed a post from one of my favorite artists. He was wounded because of bullying, which caused him to not be able to draw. I decided to message him and talk for a bit. His name was (not real) Austin. Austin was a little shy, but I always talked to him whenever I could, because he didn’t have many friends. I promised him that I’d always be there for him, and we talk more.
Later on, I meet someone in another anonymous subreddit. His name was Jason. He was really flirty and could conversate well, so he usually kept me company. Eventually, the topic of Austin comes up. I show Jason his account and later along, he messaged Austin. One day, I noticed neither of them were talking as much. No big deal.
Jason brings up the fact that he was comforting Austin. That’s fine, he’s really lonely and I’m glad he helped. Eventually, we all stop talking regularly, and talk every few days or so. I’m worried, so I ask Jason about Austin. We talked about how he was depressed and I told Jason that I couldn’t replace him when I talked to Austin. He talks about how he tells him that he would always protect him (even though that’s impossible because of time zones) and I soon realize that Austin likes talking to Jason more than me because he feels safer when he talks to  him more than me.

I felt like I was kicked in the gut. I started this, and our friendship was getting weaker by the day.
I need advice on how I can get my friend Austin back. I really miss talking to him, and I’d like to make him feel as safe as possible when talking to me. Anything is appreciated.",26Jun2019,1
182,"I started a new job at Debt Collection agency (literally handed this job by a friend who works there).

I show up on Monday June 17 and Tuesday June 18 for training. Then I've gone every day, including Wednesday June 19 for an 8 hour day. 8am to 5pm, one hour lunch and two tens.

Here's where it gets weird. Recently (My first day) 3 people quit, and another is leaving. They recently hired 3 new people, and none of us have been entered into the payroll software. Today was my 7th day, and when the other two have been there for almost a whole 30 days (business not including weekends). So when I get my first check, it's only $173 for 16 hours. My boss said I'd be getting paid the other 40 on the 10th, the next scheduled pay day.

How can they expect me to live off $173 for a 27 days? They're the second floor of a big building, with a proper parking lot, and they don't validate for their employees. So it costs me $12 per day to park at work, unless I want to find street parking in the busy city of Glendale Los Angeles.

So it's going on Day 8 and I'm still not in the system. Should I be concerned?

TL;DR -- Worked 56 hours, and was paid for 16 hours wage, and is expected to work another 94 hours until the 10th, before I see another penny. I'm expected to PAY out of my own pocket for parking FOR work. Work Day 7, and still not in the pay roll system. Old Employees clock in and out with finger print, ""new"" employees don't (30 days isn't new in my opinion). I work full time, but I'm not granted any benefits, TPO, or sick-leave.

(NINJA EDIT) It just occured to me, this might be paranoid thinking, but does anyone thing perhaps they physically don't have the money to pay me? Everyday they post daily collections on a visible to everyone screen with the totals for the month, and the quota is $12,000 per person, and like $80,000 as a team. This month, the total is less than $12,000 among ALL of us. Also, remember, I'm looking for any red flags, and I'm looking for reasons NOT to quit...",26Jun2019,1

187,"This is going to be long. Sorry in advance.

I just moved into a new apartment that I picked out with my husband for us, our toddler, and the newborn that's due in just a few months. After being laid off at the start of my pregnancy, I decided to return to work after delivery due to some medical complications from the pregnancy that require rest. However....

1) Husband bailed without warning, notice, an explanation a few days before the move.

2) The apartment that looked nice turned out to have a rodent problem. I've caught mice, but something lingers, and both my toddler and myself have been bitten in the night, despite nothing else being caught in the traps. Large teeth marks that have appeared in furniture lead me to believe there's at least one rat in here. No droppings found in the last week.

3) It turns out \~5-10% of mice and rats carry a virus that causes miscarriage in the 1st trimester and birth defects in the 2nd and 3rd. On the off chance I haven't already been exposed, you can catch it from breathing it in, and the CDC recommends that if you're pregnant you shouldn't even be in the same room as where the rodent dwells, let alone cleaning up their droppings or urine (I've found urine spots on freshly laundered clothing, and the whole place smells a bit of urine after less than a month). 

4) The landlord is willing to let me break my lease. I'll have no assistance to move, pack, or clean my belongings outside of 1 friend that can help a little that has a truck to move larger items...

5) Despite calling 10 places available 'now' per Craigslist, Trulia, and Zillow, only 1 has responded. They're telling me I need 3x the rent in monthly income...I only get \~1.5x in unemployment from the layoff. I've a family member willing to help me pay if in an emergency, but they aren't willing to co-sign as they've been burned in the past by others. I don't live in a state where I can hire a guarantor. I've offered to put down a few months in advance, but I haven't heard if they'll accept that-the management company suggested I apply for rental assistance, which I'm doing tomorrow morning, but from my online research it doesn't seem like that will bridge the gap and get me to 3x the amount they're asking for. Also, my credit is pretty crappy after a bankruptcy I filed that was the result of an ex racking up huge charges I couldn't pay, and in the years since I haven't been keeping up on my student loan bills (not that it's a good excuse, but I figured since the bankruptcy already destroyed my credit, there wasn't much point when housing, food, and child care costs were the priority). 

6) My husband is aware of the situation, but refuses to speak with me outside of contact he initiates via e-mail, so there is no having a discussion where he realizes the gravity of the situation. His attitude expressed in e-mail can be summarized as ""sucks for you, but you're a single mom, so you're going to have to get used to figuring this stuff out."" He is waiting for me to file for divorce, and is refusing to provide any support for our current child (so things like having him even watch our child while I try to arrange for cleaners, or if I were to strap on an air mask and clean myself aren't options).

So here I am, in a place I need to leave, with nowhere to go...I'm afraid to put my stuff in storage and rent a hotel in the meantime, and then not find another apartment, or go into labor before I can find something. Even if I did store the stuff, it needs to be cleaned of mouse/rat urine. I haven't lived here long and I don't have a large network or friends...and it's not reasonable to ask or expect an acquiantance to come clean hazardous rodent waste off my belongings. I don't have much, and I don't have more in the bank than 2 month's rent. 

Our pediatrician gave me the numbers to a few shelters-I called several, and were told they were full or that they only assist women fleeing domestic violence. Although the relationship would have qualified as domestic abuse of the emotional and mental sort...I'm not going to lie and insult DV victims by saying I'm fleeing a situation like that (plus I can't really flee from someone who isn't here...even though part of his MO is to disappear for weeks or months without explanation so that when he comes back I accept shittier circumstances or face shittier consequences and no help with our child...). There isn't any family I can ask for help-I have a small family and the family I have helps in the ways they can (they offered to pay 2 month's rent but that doesn't look like it'll be enough for the place that I'm looking at....). 

Anyone know of other options? Grants that address this? I don't think the emergency housing assistance I applied for will be nearly enough for the 1 place I'm seeing is available....I will be going back to work after this baby, but it'll take a little bit to find a position (I""m looking now...), so it's not that I'm worried about paying the lease, I'm just worried about finding an apt that will take us. Hotels aren't suitable long-term since they are too expensive....

Also, clearly I need a divorce. I've filled out the paperwork myself to petition, but it looks like I'll need a lawyer for the child custody portion? I don't think he'll want custody, but he'll want to drag it out and make it difficult to cause injury, if he can do so....even if that injury is just financial and thus injures his kids, I don't expect any other behavior...Given retainers start at $2500 and the rest of my financial situation, I'm not really in a position to pay that....but if I don't file, I don't receive child support (which apparently even a temporary order for it usually takes 3-4 months in this county)....

Should I just give up now and jump off a bridge? Or do I accept that I've probably already been exposed to the birth defect causing virus if the rodent colony has it, and accept it, and try to fight the infestation and just focus on the divorce? Sell my soul to the devil and buy a lottery ticket?

&amp;#x200B;

TL, DR: No job, poor credit, MIA husband, 1 kid + another on the way, new apartment is unsafe, need to vacate ASAP, can't find a new space that will accept my situation even though I'm confident I could pay the rent. Need a divorce asap, and could use advice on keeping it cheap and expediting child support if there's any way.",26Jun2019,1

189,"I recently graduated college. For the entirety of my senior year I assisted on a research project with another senior in addition to completing my capstone project. I applied to graduate school to continue working for the lead professor, but he waited until late April to tell me that he “didn’t have the funding” to support me through grad school when I thought it was a sure thing. I had even resigned my lease in anticipation of the offer. The senior I was working with was offered a position instead. 

Okay, so no grad school. I started applying for jobs in the area. My range was pretty limited since I don’t have a car and am locked in a lease, but the first place I interviewed with offered me a job within two weeks. Excellent! I start mid-July. 

Then, a different professor emailed me to say, you didn’t get in? He said, he’s in the middle of writing a proposal for grant funding, and was I interested in helping? The grant funding, if secured, would be to support the project and to pay a stipend for a graduate student researcher- me! And THEN a third professor said, if that doesn’t work out in time, come work for me - so grad school is now a legit possibility. 

My dad said take the job. The amount they’re offering is enough to buy a decent car outright within a month or two of working (and before student loans kick in at 6 mo.). I would be very comfortable if I accepted the job. But my mom said get the PhD. Everyone I’ve spoken to seems torn over the issue. The PhD project I’m working on now is about plastic pollution. There is a lot of opportunity there imho. 

So, grad school is right here, doing something I think I’d excel at, but without much money for the next four years and I might fail out after a year (if I don’t pass my qualifying exams). The job on the other hand is around 30 minutes away, I’d have to rely on friends and family till I can purchase a car, but after that, I’d be set financially and the job itself doesn’t really seem that hard. Every day I work on the PhD project I’m preventing another qualified student from joining the project, and every day I don’t turn down the job I’m preventing them from finding an alternative suitable candidate. 

What do I do?",26Jun2019,1
190,"I made a really great friend online who has tremendously impacted me and is now my significant other. We have never met in real life still, and there currently isn’t a way for this to happen. We used to talk on Snapchat everyday, but he has been going through a lot of personal stuff and he does not want to have social media any longer. He said he only kept the ones he does have to communicate with me. We planned on calling every single night before we rest so we can talk, doesn’t matter about what. He told me as soon as he sent me one specific message on Snapchat, he was going to deactivate his account and immediately call me. His account was gone seconds later, and now it’s been about a week and I haven’t received anything. We’ve texted previously, so I know that the number is his that I have and he has my number. He told me he had an iPhone so we could play iMessage games, but just with him specifically it never worked and everything sent as text message and FaceTime would not work. He told me he has tried to FaceTime me multiple times almost everyday in hopes it would work, but it never has. Having not heard from him is scary, especially regarding the emotional situation he is stuck in. I want nothing more than to talk to him. It doesn’t make any sense for him to tell me he would immediately call me and then just not do it. For about two or three days, every call I attempted, it said “call rejected” without ringing once. I have no idea if he has received anything. I don’t think he has, as I have told him he can get his Snapchat back before it is permanently deleted so he needs to help me figure it out on there, but it has never happened. We are a couple and he tells me how much he loves me every day, which makes me wonder if he thinks I’m not talking to him and he has actually been trying to send me messages. Now, when I try to call, it rings but I have never gotten an answer. The voicemail box says “the text now subscriber you are trying to reach is away” or something similar, which is confusing as he said he has an iPhone as well as iMessage. Is there any way I can reach him? Is there anything I can do? It’s killing me not knowing what’s going on and if he’s okay. If he blocked me, it would be going straight to voicemail; henceforth, I have no idea what’s happening. Can anyone help me?",26Jun2019,1
191,"So I'm a recovering alcoholic and I have just found out that my community health center hosts a ""young people in recovery"" meeting every Friday from noon to 1pm. Thing is, I very recently just switched up my schedule with my supervisor at work, and asked her if I could work remotely in the afternoon on Fridays from 12:30 to 5pm (which she said was fine). I also have weekly work meetings (a different job) on Fridays from 11am-11:45am, which my supervisor knows about (if this is relevant in any way lol). 

How do I go about asking her for this time on Friday? I'm very new to this job (student intern), and I'm especially concerned because this is so soon after we already reworked my Friday schedule. I also can't really be straight up about it because I don't want to tell her I'm in recovery. So I don't even really know what to say nor how to ask--should I say it's something for my other job thing? personal matter? Idk. Here's what I was brainstorming (plus you'll read some other details about the situation):

.....

*I have a (personal?) meeting that I would like to attend, which meets every Friday from noon to 1pm. I am wondering if it would be possible for me to work from 1pm to 5pm on Fridays, rather than beginning my shift at 12:30am. I would also be happy to work morning hours on Thursdays instead of Fridays, if that is what you would prefer. Please let me know if any of these options would be possible.* 

*I would also like to note that if I were to switch to Thursday hours, I would not be able to work a full shift this Thursday due to a doctor's appointment at 11am.* 

*I apologize for all of these changes to my schedule. Please let me know what you think would work.* 

*Best,*

192,"first off i want to keep things vague. i want to protect people because i have no idea what to do. 

so essentially my friend (f17) is most likely in a relationship with a teacher (f28). as you can tell that’s somewhat of an age difference, and the closer the two get the more mentally unsound my friend becomes. 

here’s where the dilemma comes in- we have never caught them... physically in the act shall we say, but my other friends and myself have seen very suggestive text messages, and behaviors (groping, and general closeness that’s inappropriate for the environment) 

if we     a) step in we don’t know for sure if this is even a sexual relationship (although it is still clearly effecting my young friend) but also since our school is small charter and full of conservative people it will most likely be ruined and many people will lose their only source of income.

but     b) if we choose to not say anything, i’m worried how negatively this will effect my friend. because she haven’t been doing good since they have been hanging out. (i’m just going to say her mental health is affecting her physical health)",26Jun2019,1
193,Sorry for the long post but I (20M) just need some opinions. I meet this girl in my one uni classes in February. Turned out she was in 2 of my classes and we became friends. Like a month in I was going to ask her out but at the time I had school and other stuff going on so I didn’t have time. We were friends for the next couple months and I asked her to lunch around finals time and she said she had a lot of studying to do. Which I completely got. After the finals we were talking and she mentioned how we should hang out sometime during the summer. Couple weeks into the summer I texted her cause I had like 3 weeks without work or class to see if she wanted to hang out. She said she was busy with work that week but she will let me know. Some family stuff happened and I forgot about it but then realized it was 3 weeks later so I thought I was just ghosted and she was just kind of done which I was like aight shit happens. But then yesterday I was leaving this place that she was at and she like yelled my name across the place to wave so now I’m real fuckin confused. I didn’t know she was there so if she was ghosting she probably wouldn’t have said anything so I’m confused. Like I haven’t texted her in like 4 weeks so what do I even text her now that I kind of know I’m not ghosted. Like “hey how’s your summer going” or something. I still want to ask her out but we are taking the same class in the August semester so should I just wait till uni starts back up and try then cause it’s easier when we both aren’t living at home for the summer?

197,"Hey Redditors, straight 20F here. 

So I’m a part-time waiter in a restaurant where I work with six other peers(half girls, half guys). There’s this one girl(20F) I’m particularly close with, and things have been weird with her from the day I started work. 

I’m a friendly and bit of a touchy person - so I naturally make a lot of physical contact when talking to friends, like grabbing hands, side-hugging, fixing stray hair strands, etc. I also make a lot of compliments and jokes that may come off as flirty.

I never thought anything of this because frankly, because I didn’t think there were actual LGBTQA+ people around me. (I live in a conservative country and openly gay people are very rare) But with this particular girl, I felt the slightest bit of tension whenever I did my usual thing with her. It was the first time I ever thought ‘Am I being flirty?’.

It turns out my gaydar was right, because she came out to me last week while having an after-work beer. She was pretty drunk and told me she often gets turned on by girls when they do certain things - coincidentally, every single one of them was what I did to/for her at work. I don’t know if she intended it. Then she proceeded to tell me I’m ‘pretty and it’s frustrating as fuck’, and passed out. 

It seems I have been unintentionally flirting with her for the last few months and she was lowkey turned on by it. I’m trying to tone down my ‘flirtiness’ down now obviously, but I can’t seem to stop. I keep doing the same shit and realizing I fucked up too late. I guess personalities are hard to change.

I really want to stop confusing her because I’m definitely straight and isn’t attracted to her in that way at all. She is a good friend and hurting her is the last thing I want to do. Any advice for me?",26Jun2019,1

203,"My mother is going for surgery next month and wants to come to my apartment for the 24-48 hours you are supposed to recover before you drive and I dont want her to stay at my place

I told her no multiple times during her first call about staying at my place and she just kind of kept laughing it off that I was joking. I was not.

The problem is my mother loves to push my buttons and guilt trip me. Like I am very peculiar about cleanliness and I could see her being gross just to horrify me.

I only have one bed and a couch (that is not designed or comfortable for sleeping on) and I dont like being touched. She has already made jokes about sharing the bed and cuddling so that increases my no to a hell no.

Because of how she has been in the past I also know she would also try to guilt me into letting her stay longer and essentially being her slave for the weekend.

I thought I had a legitimate excuse of going to a convention with a friend but she cant make it anymore and I dont want to spend the money or drive 10 hours (each way) to go by myself.

So even though mom doesn't know that yet and has started making arrangements to stay at my sisters I feel guilty that I don't have a good excuse why my mom cant stay at my place but I know if I tell her that my trip is cancelled she will start pressuring me to let her stay at my place again.

I know its selfish of me not to want to take care of my mom but we have always had a rough relationship and I do not want her stressing me out or bullying me in my own apartment. I also dont want to be tricked into becoming her caretaker or something in the future.",26Jun2019,3

205,"Hey a lot has happened very recently in my relationship so I think I’ll just get right into it. My girlfriend (21/F) has been lying to me (21/M) about having contact with her insane ex.

Here’s come context:

We’ve been together since January and I truly love this girl. we waited a while a while to take things serious because she wanted to take her ex’s feelings into consideration, since they had been together for 5 years. I won’t lie it bugged me a little bit but I went along with it because I’m generally a laid back person. Throughout the beginning of our relationship she did speak about her ex a lot (just experiences, she went through a tough break up as he was very controlling and manipulative to her and she broke up with him and she seemed very genuinely happy to be with me). It got to the point where her ex started driving hours to show up to her house and her place of work to confront her about the breakup at random times to the point where it was very inappropriate and could be considered stalking and harassment. Me and all her friends got together and let her know she needed to cut this guy off so she for a couple months. Besides this our relationship had been near perfect.

Fast forward to last week. She indicates to me that she’s added her ex back on all social media’s and that they even spoke on the phone. We argued for days about this. I tried telling her why it upset me for a couple reasons 

1. The insecurity of always having an ex linger when it was hard enough just to win her over and get her to commit was weighing on me
2. This guy has anger issues and acts irrationally and I thought her safety would be at risk

She failed to see my viewpoint on this, and the only reason she changed her mind is because she spoke to her mom about it and her mom immediately agreed with me. At that point she cut him off once more blocking him on all social media’s and blocking his number.

That was all the context, now onto the real drama where the main dilemma arises

A few days later we hear a knock on the door of her apartment, it’s her ex. He drove hours to get to the place and began yelling and saying things outside. I’m guessing he snapped when she finally blocked him on everything again. He tried to say that we were both having sex with her, that he had been over multiple times, that he even took care of my dog while I was away and that he had been seeing what I text her. He was able to read a text message that I wrote word for word from memory from weeks ago, and it was genuine because it was something I remember typing and something only I would say. I won’t go too into detail about what happened next, but let’s just say it made local headlines everywhere where we live. He busted down the French doors of the apartments, broke in, assaulted me (luckily I stayed in front of my girlfriend to keep her safe for the most part) and then he stole things he thought were his. He was charged with multiple felonies.

After everything was settled and the cops left and it was just us I asked her about what he said and I asked if any of it was true. She told me that they did talk for a month or two from before what she said, but very infrequently, as in rarely ever, and plantonically only because he’s a loner and needed a friend and she genuinely seemed concerned for his mental well being. I asked her if they had done anything and she immediately denied they had done anything intimately. I asked her if there was anything else I didn’t know because if there was I needed to know now. She said he came over twice in the past month in a half, one of the times being right after I left the place. She said he was there to visit her at work and he also helped her clean her apartment. He also paid for her car fix last month more than $1300. When I asked her about the text messages he saw she said he must’ve taken her phone when she went to the bathroom. She said he’d never been over while my dog was over there. I asked to see her phone to see her messages with him she said she deleted them all when she blocked him. It all just shocked me and overwhelmed me and I had her take me home. I’ve been somewhat distant since then but I’ve been there for emotional support if she’s needed it. The break in and assault was never an issue to me I’m just glad I could keep her safe for the most part.

There’s currently an order of no contact between her and him and she’s working towards a restraining order. 

I guess my question here is where do I go from here? I’ve been lied to so much and I honestly feel like I’d never been able to trust her for a long time, and even if I did I still don’t know for sure what’s gone on behind my back.

I was lied to about:

- Her having contact with him
- Him coming over multiple times
- The text messages he had read between me and my girlfriend
- The $1300 he paid for my girlfriends car
- Who else knows what more I might not know?

She means a lot to me which is why it’s especially tough to deal with. We both say we love each other and care for each other a ton but I don’t feel like I can trust her right now and the big thing is I’ll never be able to know for sure if she cheated or not. Some of her stories are just hard for me to believe like the text message one about him reading them while she was in the bathroom. I just don’t understand why she would hide her ex coming over from me. Before this I never had any real reason not to trust her. I thought we were extremely honest with each other, we both have Touch ID’s on each other’s phones because we both feel like we have nothing to hide and we pretty much let each other do whatever we want which makes the dishonesty just that much more alarming. However she’s been super apologetic ever since and she’s been nothing but understanding of the boundaries I set despite the emotional trauma she just endured. I don’t know what to do. Is it really that bad and are my standards just too low? Or is it no big deal? Am I a fool? Do I break up with her and just move on? Do I stay and try to work things out? And if I stayed how would I even go about working things out?",26Jun2019,2

208,"18 going on 19 in a month, and to put it simply, the world finds a new way to anger me every day. Constant political turmoil, people being treated unfairly, big corporations getting away with their corrupt antics, climate change, and much more. The earth will apparently be uninhabitable in three decades' time and I really do feel like there's no way to stop it. I feel like I'm so upset all the time because I care too much. Maybe I should grow up to be just like those people who say and do whatever they want without any forethought as to who or what they hurt in the process.

212,"I've been writing since I was thirteen, though I could argue that I've been a writer since second grade when I wrote poems and letters for my loved ones or even at four years old when I created my own plot lines for my playing sessions with my dolls and stuffed animals. Anyhow, writing is a passion I can't escape from. I've admittedly tried, back when I convinced myself at twelve that I wanted to be a writer but then realized how unsafe of a career choice it'd be, so I deemed it a hobby since then, and it really has been just that. A hobby I'm utterly in love with. I mean, what fourteen year old stays up until midnight more excited to start writing her first novel for NaNoWriMo as opposed to being excited about her birthday?

Oddly enough, I'm also in love with Math. People often don't understand how I can be in love with such vastly different subjects. I don't see it that way though. Over the years, I've managed to pinpoint that understanding and making connections as well as the thrill of self-reward is why I adore both subjects. However, as fate would have it, I managed to convince myself Majoring in Math also wasn't the best decision. Though it might be a better market than Writing, Mathematicians aren't as common as other jobs. I'm a realist, and I've dealt with disappointment and an unstable mind for so long that I require the comfort of a safe future, making sure I make the decisions that will best influence my financial stability and that of my parents. This is the mindset I've been in for almost a decade now, mostly as a defense mechanism against the demon that is depression. Also, it convinced me not to kick the bucket so young.

Cue my decision of choosing Civil Engineering as my major. Engineering isn't a subject I hate. If anything, I barely even understand what it is exactly on a day to day basis even after years of STEM camps from my school. I took an Engineering course my last year of high school, and I enjoyed the design process it involves. However, it's not my beloved passion, but I'm open minded, and it's something I'm willing to try first before giving up on it. I can see myself as a civil engineer in the future, so that's a good sign.

However, I feel like I'm experiencing some sort of imposter syndrome right now. It's weird. Everyone thinks I'm this person deemed for success, but I'm not so sure about it. I graduated Salutatorian just about a month ago from a high school ranked in the top 10 in Texas, so the expectations for me to have this wonderful amazing future career are high. But where that career lies? I have no idea. I don't consider myself to be as good as people paint me to be. If anything, most of the time I feel sort of inferior. That is when it doesn't have to do with Math or Writing. My pride definitely shines through in both subjects, but now that I'm heading to college and planning on Engineering, I feel so lost.

On one hand, I KNOW I will continue to write just for my sake and maybe by chance get published. I've already written several short stories that have won some titles, so I'm confident that I can at least accomplish that. I also want to keep learning math--theoretical and applied and everything in between because I love it. But now that I'm heading into college so unsure of how to go about things, I feel extremely anxious of where life will take me. I'm scared that I'll stay lost for so long that I'll waste time.

I guess I don't even know what kind of advice I'm seeking. Suggestions? Reassurance? Opinions? Or even just some insight on your experience in feeling lost and how you overcame it? I feel like anything would help. I'm just so unsure at the moment. What should I be doing right now to make sure I secure my future?",26Jun2019,1

218,"Hello, I am a very recent college grad that is leaving on a Fulbright Fellowship in a month. For the better half of a college I was going steady with a girl but we broke up last September and my emotional availability took a major blow. In December I started sleeping with a friend and we established a very laid back relationship where we would hang out, cook, or study together and then spend the night like once or twice a week. This went on until the last day of college. Not exclusive, never defined the relationship at all, no talk of feelings. It was miraculously chill. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am living at home now and working part-time until I leave. We got the idea to meet halfway and camp for a few nights in a couple weeks. So I am flying roughly 900 miles north. We are currently only corresponding via email every to every other day.  It's fun and I find myself greatly anticipating her clever emails. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: How do I maintain this type of relationship while abroad for a year? What do I say while camping? I'm by no means head-over-heels and still quite emotionally unavailable but I love hearing from her. Is it finally time to talk out our feelings? Do I just email this girl for a year?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I moderately like a girl but don't know how best to talk to her for the next year.

219," I work as an engineer in a large firm (5000 employees). We are working in a remote office with a minimum monitoring from the main HQ.

I recently started noticing that on a few of the projects my boss's father comes as the external contractor or sometimes shows up as a sperate entity working on the same project.

I started feeling that my boss provides internal information of our office to his father or heavily bids on projects that would benefit him. I don't want to bring it up to my boss as it might be super uncomfortable. I don't have any specific evidence (other than his father showing up a lot in our projects), but something feels really suspicious and I don't want myself or the rest of the team to be dragged down with this issue if anything happens.

-It pays more.
-It’s an “easier” job. 
-Huge Upward Mobility, especially with my skill set. 
-The area has a lower cost of living, so with the pay bump, my dollar goes even further.

226,"Yo, this might be a bit long so I apologize. Anyways I’m 17, and my girlfriend is 18, I go to a private school and I just graduated grade 12 last week. 
So, Me and my girlfriend have been dating pretty steady for a while, almost 7 months. Shes my first real relationship and easily my go-to person. She’s fuckin gorgeous and hilarious and totally my type. She told me she loved me and I believed her, I love her too. 
But Last weekend I went up to a cottage with my buddies to celebrate my graduation, and my girlfriend wanted to stay behind. Everyday we snapchatted each other, she told me she missed me every day, sent me cute pics, and she just was generally normal and cute. The last day I was up there, she texted me that she had some “worries” she wanted to talk about. I know that she’s got anxiety, so I just thought she needed some encouragement and support or something. When I got back, turns out these “worries” actually mean she’s been talking to another guy, and she decided she wants to date more guys and have an open relationship from now on. She hasn’t actually cheated on me, as far as I know she hasn’t had sex with this guy or anything. Well, I asked her if she was breaking up with me but apparently she still loves me. Idk if I believe her. Look I guess I don’t blame her, the guy she’s talking too is a good looking dude, he’s got a serious six pack and probably a dick that’s bigger then mine. And I’m scrawnier then a fucking twig. I want her to be happy, but this is crushing my soul man. Well anyways, I asked her if I could at least be her “side-boy” and she agreed, because she “doesn’t want to lose me.” Which even though it isn’t my first choice, I’d prefer to at least have SOME of her rather then none, I don’t want to lose her either. 
Problem is, even though I’m her side boy, I’m starting to think that was more out of pity then something real. We haven’t been communicating much in the past few days, we haven’t hung out like we used do, and when we text all I get are one word responses. Look I’m not an emotional dude, and as much as I fucking Hate to admit it, this has been the first time I’ve cried in a very, very long time. I fucking hate myself for going on that trip, I fucking hate the fact that I’m not good enough for her. I’ve graduated and I’m about to become an independent adult, and now I have to do that alone, without her. Without her all I have is myself and I fricking hate myself lmao 😂 so please somebody tell me what I can do to bring things back to the way they were, I don’t know what to do, or how to react.

We have lived through graduating together, living in Asia (but 1000km apart) for a year, living separately with parents during our first job, living through more than a year of soul-crushing joblessness and finally now living and working together in Asia. 

She's a very beautiful, intuitive and emotional person,  I'm a little 'boring', introverted and detached person. 

We have always done everything together. It was more for her sake, because I have a stronger need to 'feel' independent. She has become more and more dependent on me and relies on me for a lot of things. She likes to go out, but not without me. She has also become more and more scared of everything. Scared of pressure, responsibility, being alone, her place among friends and family. Above all she is scared about whatever she has said to people or has to write and how all this might be used to her detriment. I have to answer all of these fears. I fear she is developing a dependent relation with me and slowly developing an anxiety disorder. I always have to be there for her, for her fears, all the things she either imagine or blows up. This has caused to me withdraw more, become more critical of her and in turn she becomes more critical of me. I'm more of an introvert, being there for her takes up a lot of my energy and sometimes I'm tired, hungry and I don't have the energy. She will never cut me any slack and will eventually accuse me of not loving here, never being there for her, abandoning here if I don't relent. I've always been there for her the best I can, yet it never suffices. 
Am I perfect? No. I can be silent, distant. Don't often share feelings. I've been getting frustrated about banalities more and more often, but I do everything for her, yet she still makes me feel like it's not enough. She'll always get her way and I'm happy if she's happy. I've been her friend, her boyfriend, her best friend, her girl friend, her father, her psychiatrist, her manager, her partner,... 

Sometimes I feel that rather than making each other the best version of ourselves, we've been making each other worse. 

I'm not a confrontational person. She's my first girlfriend, it's been five years. I've had my doubts before, but didn't want to give up on us. I don't know how to tell her. I don't know how to deal with our rented studio, our stuff, our families, friends,...

Apologies for the long post, will try and be brief:

So I've been with my partner for 2 years now and its been really wonderful. We just got a new place and are planning a vacation. I have an ex friend, who I unfriended due to our one way friendship. Anytime they wanted to talk about something bothering them or needed help, would come to me but would never show me the same respect, even when I really needed it. My partner and ex friend were not friends before I ended the friendship. Both my partner and I are friends with the ex friends brother and their brothers gf (its a smallish friend circle). A few weeks ago, my partner and my ex friend started hanging out. I explained to my partner that I felt like they weren't on my side because they are hanging out with someone who hurt me. And they stated that they needs more friends (despite the fact others in the circle have expressed desire to hang out with my partner), wants to expand their friend circle and wasn't overly bothered because the ex friend hasn't treated THEM poorly, specifically.

Am I wrong for being upset by their hanging out? Or is this an issue I'm valid in being annoyed by?",26Jun2019,1
230,"Okay, I'm not sure this is even the right sub and I know this is strange, but I seriously think I'm stupid. 

Let me explain. I am the youngest of 6 children and I was always the ""smart"" one. I have succeeded in school my entire life and I just graduated high school with honors. And next semester I'm going to start at an honors college. However, I seriously think I'm an idiot or that something is wrong with my brain. 

I know there's a difference between booksmart and street smart but in my head I'm generally on a very smart path. But I'm often doing things like an idiot. 

For example, I just started a new job. I had a fantastic interview and they told me they expected me to learn fast and thought I was very intellectual. Which is grrreat...  I was trained for about a week, much longer than they expected, and I still have to constantly ask the same questions. Over and over again. Am I supposed to do this? To double check, I should do this right? Blah blah blah. And what's worse is I am constantly making mistakes. I'm about to have been there for almost a month and I can't go a day without fucking something up. And I can tell everyone thinks I'm an idiot. They get irritated and repeat themselves and talk to me different. I suppose they don't often get new people and I am much much younger then all of them (I'm 18 and most are 40+), but they seem to be kind women until I ask something. It's very frustrating. But that isn't even the most frustrating part. 

I most often know what I should or shouldn't do and I always do the wrong thing. Almost like it's physically impossible to do the proper thing. I can be pretty sure what I'm about to do is wrong and fully conceptualize that, but somehow I still do the wrong thing and embarrass myself as the new girl. I cannot fathom how I manage this. I also can't remember the last time in my life I did the right thing instead of the stupid thing. Because this isn't just new girl syndrome. 

I always ask the obvious question. Or I say the wrong thing. And I always know what was right but it's like I wasn't sure so I just do whatever I want. I can barely explain this.

Perhaps my brain is funny, because I also often stop speaking in the middle of my sentences. And I almost never realize I do it. I also forget everything. This is big. Because I mean everything. I don't remember physically doing things like grabbing my keys. I don't remember what I said or if I said something to someone. And it could be seconds after. 

I seriously think I'm stupid. I cannot retain information. I do the wrong thing even when I know better! Somewhere in my head I do but I still do what's wrong and I have no idea why. How on earth do I stop being an idiot? How do I train my brain to do what I know is proper?",26Jun2019,0

I get 8/hr there, and I recently applied and was offered a job at a geek store with 9/hr, and it's a store I feel I would really excel in, liking geeky stuff myself.

Problem is, I live with my parents still and upon bringing up quitting to them, they tell me ""But big\_fella672,"" you're making good money there (moot point, I'd make more at the new job), and you can really move up the totem pole at your current job."" I have zero interest in a career with a damn fast food joint. They're telling me to work both jobs or only the fast food one.

I don't understand their obsession with it. They just don't get that I'll make more money at the new place, they tell me it's because the mall it's in may close down, but I asked the manager and he said they would move to a new suite if the mall shuts down.

Rant over, how should I approach my parents about this? I can't work two jobs at once. I did that last year, and it really stressed me out.

238,"im a relatively introverted guy and ive only had 2 or 3 close friends in my 17 years of life. Two of which i havnt spoken to in over half a decade.

i have a rather unorthodox way of perceiving things; im objective in almost all arguments, conversations, etc. the problem is, it’s difficult for me to talk for “fun” or to show emotion. because of this, i rarely surpass the minimalistic small talk despite wanting to get to know people.

the real problem is im just shy. nonetheless, somewhat because of my weak voice, but mostly for other reasons, i have to articulate my thinking to people in simplistic phrasing and jargon as to keep them with me. this consequently feels like there’s a wall between me, and the me i present to others.

im exceptional at reading people and those who make efforts to unethically persuade/coerce me, but im nonetheless awkward in most conversations. for instance, i can predict what people will say, but overthink what to say. i used to be the funny kid in school, but my wits to rust and confidence to dust.

246,"throwaway account 

ok to start it off, i’m 17F and this friend is 17M. we started talking in 9th grade and we’re now heading to 12th grade. 

earlier this year, he told me that he was sexually abused during 10th grade when he first moved to a private school. he has only told this to me, and because of this he was extremely antisocial in school and had no one to talk to.

my first reaction, when i heard it was to tell the authorities about it, as the police or teachers. however he objected and said everyone will found out about it if he told people. starting in 10th grade, while talking to him, he was very depressed and I had to talk him out of seriously harming himself a couple of times.  only now i found out it was because of this. even though he was finally able to tell me, he didn’t tell me anything about the person that did this to him, not even their gender or job. 

ever since then i’ve been increasingly worried about his mental health condition, because even before he told me this, i was afraid he was going to harm himself by our conversations. however he said telling the story  to me was him getting over it, and he doesn’t want to go back and re expose the person that did this and relive it again. he didn’t say this but i also sensed he held a very large stigma against himself, being sexually abused, because he was raised strictly catholic and have a lot of traditional views. 

we haven’t talked about this incident for weeks because i’m seriously afraid reminding him of it will send him down to a depressive spiral again. i know the correct course of action is probably to report whoever did this, but it’s also likely he’ll start to hate himself more and more because of this and be a danger to himself. i cannot fathom him just moving on from this either and i feel like there must be some closure for this. it’s also possible that this person is still out here harming someone else. however, i don’t know anything about this person and i don’t want to put my friend in danger. 

what is the right thing to do now? every time i talk to him i feel like i cannot converse normally without this event going in the back of my mind. the only thing i’ve dared to ask was if the person was someone working at his school and he said no, but he could’ve been lying.

Whether it was peer pressure or just from getting frustrated with another demographic, I have made some of the few people I care about (a black family who I lived next to) weary of me I think. 
Back in school I was bullied by the black kids. I guess i was an easy target. Fat, quiet and gothed out ...it got to be too much so I eventually dropped out. But during that time I developed an attitude toward black people like they were all bullies and I had to walk on eggshells around all of them. Except for the family I made friends with. They were welcoming and liked me for me. I started dating a guy who I later discovered was a wannabe neo-nazi. He was older so i thought everything he did was cool 😐 in time I started to lash out with a post here and there about those kids I hated in school and to those with the same mentality. And of course racial slurs were used. I look back and see how reckless I was and I hate it. Now my old friends(neighbors) who would once e genuinely happy to see me in town or what have you seem, idk, weary. Like theres a big wlephant in the room. I hate it.

262,"Before I begin I want to establish the relationship between the people in my family. My uncle (mum's brother) is only 12 years older than me (which is young considering he was only 12 when I was born) and he has lived with my parents and I for most of my life. I've always considered him as a sort of father figure and we were very close. He would be the one I would open up to about problems that I couldn't take to my parents. 

After he got married, he moved to a different part of town but because he works with my father (the office is on the floor above the house) he comes home everyday. When I was 18, he had a little boy that I also grew very fond of and I'd constantly visit them to babysit or play with the kid. When he was three (I was 20), at a family gathering my (actual) brother and I were watching some of the kids including my uncle's son and generally playing with them all. At one point, we were blowing raspberries on all the kid's tummies and they'd come one after the other, giggling away and ask me to do it again. At no point did it even occur to me that this might be inappropriate because 1) they're all babies and that's how you play with babies and 2) I guess I didn't feel like I had those boundaries with this particular kid. 

My uncle came into the room when I was raspberry-ing his son and he lost his shit for a split second. He shouted ""what the fuck are you doing?"" and grabbed the kid from me. Only a second later he sort of figured he might have over reacted and laughed and handed the kid back, pretending this never happened.  It all happened so fast that my brother didn't even notice (he was playing with all the kids - including the kid in question - in the same way). My uncle over-compensated but being especially nice to me for a few days and never brought this up again but the damage was already done. 

I was in shock for a long time. I always thought my uncle thought of me as a daughter and that if something were to happen to my parents, he would take over. And I felt the same about his son, that if something were to happen to him and his wife, I would adopt and raise the kid. I was in shock that my uncle had drawn boundaries between me and his kid. It's been 6 years since that happened and I've never lifted/carried/played with/touched another kid since. I shake their hand, that's as far as I go. Most people just think I don't really like kids but the truth is I'm terrified that I might cross a line that I didn't know was there. I even worry when my brother plays with kids because I'm just thinking of all the ways this can be misunderstood.

My brother noticed recently that I don't play with kids anymore and asked me how come so I explained the whole story. He was pretty angry because of how close I was to my uncle and his family and he said that it was definitely an over reaction. I don't know if my uncle has noticed the change (it's pretty apparent if you ask me) but he never addressed it.

On the one hand, he was looking out for his kid and we've been repeatedly told that sometimes kids need protection from their own extended family members (from molestation). On the other hand I'm really hurt that he even for a split second considered I would in any way violate this kid that I loved, especially because my uncle watched me grow up and played a huge part in it.

I don't have the right to be angry with him but I still am. I stopped visiting so often (it helped that I moved away for a while) and I especially never ever even touch or sit next to his kid (who is 8 or 9 now). The worst part is that any time the kid and I in the same room together, alone, i start to panic. What if his dad thinks I planned this? What if his dad is at this very moment running here to make sure I don't touch his son? I'm pissed and hurt that he got me feeling like this.

I don't really have a question for advice but I want to know if I was really in the wrong and how do I deal with it. Talking to my uncle about it is out of the question because we aren't that close anymore (because of this).",26Jun2019,2
263," 

Throwaway account for reasons. Names have been changed.

I originally attempted to post this for AITA but was stopped by the 3,000 character limit. As I was trying to edit the post I could not help but feel that the details were important to the situation and so I am trying again here. 

This is going to be background heavy.

**Background:**  A little more than a month ago I started a temp job at a call center.  There is myself (late 20s), Sammy (late 20s), and Libby (early 20s) as  the three people actually taking calls and various e-mails for this  center.

When we were first informed on  this job we were told that it would be a normal 9-5 gig. Its a bit of a  drive from my place but I knew that going in. It sounded by no means  ideal but I don't want a gap on my resume after being let go from my  last job. Upon actually starting the job the three of us found out that  the person who had initially hired us had left the company and that now  we would be expected to work as late as 9:00 PM some days. Now, this was  a far cry from what we were initially told and none of us were happy.

This  is where the supervisor, Abernathy (early 20s), and the actual boss,  Betty (mid 30s?) come in. Abernathy has been temping at this call center  for the last three summers as her aunt used to work for the company and  nepotismed her in there. Despite her using family connections to  acquire her role I do believe she knows more about the call center than  anyone due to having worked there the longest. Betty was hired slightly  before our first day to replace the person who actually hired us. She  seems ambitious but pretty understanding.

It's  important to note that Betty works remotely in a time zone that's three  hours behind than the rest of us. To her credit she is on point with  her online presence to answer any questions that we have despite having  other work responsibilities on top of being a single mom. That leaves  Abernathy in the actual office but due to being in community college she  only works part time and is not in all too often. Abernathy is also  pretty good about being online to help with any questions.

Our  work space is literally in a small windowless closet that's within  another office. This closet is weirdly cold for being the summer months  to the point where we actually have a space heater to keep the three of  us warm. Although Abernathy sat with us in the closet for the first few  weeks of working at the call center, she has since moved out to an empty  desk in the main office with windows and normal temperature.

Due  to everything we actually doing being web based (even the call service  is via a website that you can access through any computer), the  windowless/cold workspace, and the fact that the closet is small enough  that when 2/3 of us are on a call at the same time it becomes difficult  to hear the person that we are on the phone with, i decided to ask Betty  if working from home would be an option. The truth is that we rarely  get calls and spend most of our days watching netflix. If I would be  able get things done from home while monitoring calls then this would be  decent gig. The thing that kills it is the work space, commute, small  pay, and weird hours. I acknowledge that is it far better than what  others have but I can't help but come up with harmless ways to improve  it (at least from the perspective of myself and my two co-workers).

**The Conflict:**

Abernathy  clearly came into this job expecting to be top dog. It was clear from  the first few days that she resented Betty for being above her. There  were little comments when she would come in like *""Our goal for today is not to go to Betty for help!.""*  which was weird because Betty is the actual point of contact with the  company, she knows the day to day changes and operational  minutia of  the company. Abernathy has worked at this call center for a longer  period of time and knows a lot but Betty has her finger on the pulse on  things that we need to know. Telling us to try to avoid talking to her  about our job came across as strange to the three of us. She also had  made a few comments about how she did not want people to think that she  was not a ""call representative"" like we are. As if she was trying to  prove something. I determined for myself that she might have a bit of a  complex. She's the youngest person on the team, Libby and I both have  higher degrees than her, and so i can't help but wonder if  subconsciously she is trying to showcase that she is indeed higher than  us on the totem pole. I could be wrong but it's just my read of the  situation.

As time went on her  authority complex seemed to shift from Betty to us. For example on a day  where Libby had asked about working from home all of a sudden Abernathy  ""forgot"" her laptop charger, went back home to work, and proceeded to  apologize that she missed one of our questions because she was grabbing  dinner. It came across as a petty way to flaunt that she was above us  and had the ability to do things that we requested.

There  have been a few little incidents that have annoyed the three of us. For  example Abernathy took the time to call out that there were multiple  e-mails in the shared inbox and insisted that we get to work on  answering them. The only issue was that the leftover e-mails were things  we had pinged her and Betty about that they had not answered or e-mails  for Abernathy herself. It seemed like she saw a means to show off her  authority without even bothering to pay attention to the subject matter  of which she was being authoritative about.

Things  peaked last week on two occasions. One morning when Sammy had literally  just walked in the door to start her shift, Abernathy sends her a  private chat message to come outside and see her once she is all set up.  It seemed strange to have something so urgent just as Sammy entered the  closet. Sammy comes back MAD and explains that Abernathy had belittled  and embarrassed her in front of the main office (the one that resides  outside of our closet). Abernathy apparently pointed at the computer  screen and curtly said ""Tell me what you see wrong with this"" and left  it for Sammy to find the error and explain it. It has turned out that  Sammy had misspelled something in an e-mail.

Now,  I fully understand wanting to address an error. I simply do not think  that Abernathy went about it in a professional way. I would even go as  far to say that she was unnecessarily rude.

Every  Thursday the main office has a thirsty Thursday party as they don't  work on Fridays in the summer.  There is normally alcohol, food, music,  and people from the other offices in the building come and socialize.  The people in the main office are very nice and always go out of there  way to invite us to join in. It would be awkward if they didn't as the  music gets pretty loud and we reside within their office.  This has  happened for about three weeks and we've all (myself, Libby, and, Sammy  have all gone out together as we don't really interact with anyone in  the main office in any meaningful way. Each time we have done this we  have made sure to constantly check back into our closet to make sure  that we are not missing any calls. I will even give Sammy some  affirmations for being absolutely on point with checking in and making  sure we are not missing any of our actual work. Considering that we are  held up in a cold, windowless, closet for 8 hours a day and sometimes  until 9:00 at night when even the entire cleaning staff for the building  has come and gone I feel like taking 10-20 minutes to eat, have a  drink, and socialize a little is a really nice perk.

**The breaking moment:**

This  last week was the first Thursday that Abernathy was actually in the  office during one of these thirsty Thursday events. Myself and Sammy  were around as Libby was out that day. Sammy was consistently checking  into our closet to make sure that we did not miss any calls. Abernathy  apparently saw a call coming in and flagged down Sammy to take it. I  went back in the closet too just in case another call came in while  Sammy was on the line. The call did not last long.

We then received a chat message from Abernathy that said the following:

*""Hey guys*

*I'm   not mad or reprimanding or anything, but if you guys want to come out   on these Thursday's let's please have it be one by one or something so   the phones aren't abandoned. ""*

Considering  the events from earlier in the week where she belittled Sammy and her  constant need to assert her authority over us I was not happy. We did  not miss a call. Sammy was checking in constantly. This just seemed like  a needless way to make the situation more unbearable. At the very least  I thought she could come in and actually talk to us about it than what I  saw was a passive aggressive message. The first Thursday she decides to  show up for she rains on our parade even though it was not hurting  anyone. I felt the need to respond.

I wrote back the following:

*""Sammy  was consistently checking in and we came in because she saw a call go   through and I went online in case another came in while she was on the   on the phone. We were not outside any longer than if one of us was alone   and went to grab lunch or went to the bathroom. Considering (the Boss  in the main office who we do not work directly with) came in  and  informed us things were happening we would look rude or anti social  if  we did not go out for the short amount of time that we were.  ""*

Besides  my poorly constructed sentences I thought what I had said was pretty  tame. I had a lot more to say that I deemed not appropriate to work. She  never bothered to respond and so I just left it as that.

Today  things came to a head and we all had it out a little bit. I referenced  the above exchange as an example as her not communicating well and her  being needlessly passive aggressive. She claimed that she never  responded because she was *""so angry""* and that my response *""shocked her""*.  Now, for context this is someone who upon seeing the linkedin profile of someone new that Betty was going to hire said *""Ugh another old black guy""*.  I brought it up at a later date as her comment stayed with me and made  me a little uncomfortable being that I am mixed myself (I am very much  white passing though). I felt that considering her behavior and what she  has said in the past I do not feel that she is justified to feel  ""shocked"" or ""so angry that she could not respond"" but sometimes I get  so caught up in my own feelings about situations that I can't see my  actions for what they really are. So reddit, how do I move forward here. I'll admit that I am angry with Abernathy, the situation, and it's come to the point where this job might just be effecting my mental health. How do I proceed?",26Jun2019,1
264,"I'm a pretty lonely person. I have friends but most of them don't share the same interests as me. I met a group of online friends a few weeks ago that I really like. We have a lot in common, like we play games and generally have the same sense of humour. They're up at the same hours as me so I spend a lot of time with them but most of the time I'm quiet.

Problem is, idk why but I'm so shy around them. I'm normally a very social and easy person to talk to but I feel scared because I want them to like me. I hesitate before I ask questions. Lately, games have been kinda boring or we played them through already. 

There's not a whole lot you can do online besides play games and chat. I'm not sure where to get the courage to just ask questions that aren't too invasive. Is there a game or something that we can play that will help me be more comfortable with them?

I want to get to know them better but I'm not sure how to bring it up? How do I make this awkward part of me go away?",26Jun2019,2
265,"Backstory; I started gymnastics when I was about 7. I did it up until i was 11 or 12. I was at least 9+ when this all happened. During training, we would put pink chalk on the bar and if it got on your Leo it meant you messed up (not doing the skill correctly/no hollow body.) Our coach, who is also the owner of the gym would make us kiss him as a punishment. We did many different things like this but on other events, all with the same punishment though. I never really thought of it bad when I was a kid, more so like an ”ewww cooties” kinda thing and that it’s just training. If i didn’t want to kiss the old coach I had to do better. Now it's just an ew. Like any normal coach would make you do sits up, jog, maybe push ups idk. It doesn't bug *bug* me that much but just the thought of it now that I'm 17 and he was making little girls kiss him on the lips just sorta bugs me and grosses me out. He is still a coach and the owner there. It just makes me wonder what else has he done? does he still do this “punishment”. The more i think about it, it really does sorta bug me. I could’ve had it much worse thinking about it though. Just the idea of a coach taking advantage of little girls like that is just ugh. Someone we are supposed to look up to and get guidance from... idk maybe it’s not as bad as i think it is. Does anyone else think it’s as gross as i do? Is it to late to report this? It’s been over 6 years. Would they think i’m lying/don’t really remember it fully since it was so long ago.  Am i over reacting?",26Jun2019,5

272,"I need help. My father about 8 years ago got Lyme disease. Ever since then he’s been different. It was a very slow change. The first thing I noticed was he began having a love of alien conspiracy theories. He used to watch ancient aliens like it was the Bible and would be constantly looking up ufo videos online. He believed 2012 was going to be the end of the world and wanted to buy a shelter. Then this behavior began to die down and we thought it was a phase. 

Then a couple years ago my father’s kidney began to fail and he had to go on dialysis for a year. It was bad, he was bedridden once he got home and despite my family’s attempts ( I could of tried harder) was very isolated from the rest of us.

This is when things got really bad. My dads conspiracy theories went full tinfoil. He believed the government was hiding everything from us, that aliens had already came to earth with miracle drugs but we can’t know about them. He believed everything video he saw online,  that science in textbooks were fake. thought Reptilians ruled the world, illuminati etc. if theres a conspiracy theory, he believed it.

Then it got even worse as religion played a role in it. My fathers mother died in the same time he got off dialysis and had a new kidney. My dads a very stoic person and although we knew he was sad, we don’t know how much it truly hurt him. Granted he knew she was in pain for many years so he knew it was coming and that she was in a better place.

Either way, my dad was never a religious man until around now. He got into some weird religious group ( i think its a cult or at least cultish). He began following them while he was on dialysis. They were a weird mixture of christianity and alien. From what i can understand they think god sent aliens to help us. He began having hallucinations, seeing Christ appear before him. Compulsive almost ADHD esq behavior, constantly talking about his beliefs. He literally steered every conversation towards it, EVERY one. He told me that this life isnt real, that none of us exist. He believes hes  the reincarnation of Bartholomew and that his leader of his rieligion on facebook is Jesus Christ reincarnated. He will meditate really late at night, he used to join a skype call everyday and listen to the man running the group.

Honestly this religious group in general could be a whole other post. He only believes what they say, EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY. He writes daily posts on his facebook translating some bible he got from them on amazon. He has crystals and little jewels around the house, even under his pillow. He sees angels in the clouds ( he used to stop his car abruptly when he saw them)

He’s driven all his friends and family away. Although in the past year he’s shown improvement ( my mother thinks it is at least, I disagree)  he no longer talks about it to us, although if you try to have a real conversation with him it will at some point devolve back. He seems normal, no more hallucinations and the crazy mania stuff. He still is deep within this cult, its like the only thing he gets enjoyment out of ( besides being with us, specifically my mother). He seems almost like he was before except he seems more unhappy and I KNOW it’s because of this cult which ai know got him in due to some mental illness.

As you can see, its bad and im tired of letting it go on. My family has basically given up on him. My mom and brother don’t play along when he starts ranting about crazy stuff but they don’t him. My mom has begin saying its just a religion and that she can’t attack religious beliefs ( which is some bullshit denial). As for my relationship with him is strained at best. We used to fight, a lot. Over regular teenager stuff and then later his mania stuff. Ive always been against all of it, I’ve tried to have mini interventions with him. Ive shown him the hypocrisies and pyramid scheme of his cult, ive told him I don’t know him. Ive pleaded in tears for him to get help but my dad has always been stubborn. I know its hit him however because he has become very upset after our arguments when he sees me in tears.


I just need an extra judgment on what to do because im lost. If i had a better understanding of what im necessarily dealing with “disorder wise” or just general guidelines for helping someone get help, id be so grateful.

276,"I was working a long shift at work, towards the end we're finishing up and my workmate had left her phone on the side. I'm not 100% sure how but her phone ended up getting knocked over, might've snagged the precariously adjusted cable or something. Needless to say, her phone ended up on the floor.

I pick it up and the screens cracked, she walks in just then so my immediate reaction is ""I didn't touch it"". I'm still processing the situ and hadn't really figured out what had just happened.

Now I'm accused of breaking her phone. They watched CCTV and can understand it's an accident, although I haven't seen the footage myself... 

Thing is, I feel it was very careless to leave the phone on the side like that. She's saying that I have to pay for the screen repair, which i can totally appreciate but at the end of the day I'm not careless with my possessions like that. If I paid full price it'd be £80 which is too much to part with. 

How do I play the situ?",26Jun2019,2
277,"Hello people. So I've live in this house since I was born, we are like the first family who's been living here for a long time. I have at least 5 neighbors and throughout the years they come and go. This woman has been living here for quite a while, I would say a few years, we know her before living here because she's the mother of my sister and brother's friend.
She also has shown she can't be trusted because she talks about other people's lives to other people. So I have 2 cats. One is the daughter of the other. The daughter is very friendly and she will let you pet her. Months prior to what I'm about to mention, she started feeding my cat. I thought well ok it was a one time thing until it became something that would happen every day as soon as she arrived from work. I lost my mind and I ler her know that this is wrong, she has food at our house and the cat doesn't know that she's not supposed to feed her. This woman has cats as well FYI. When I told her to stop feeding her she looked at me with this stupid face and went home. I thought maybe she will stop...
Yesterday my father was passing by her house to go to his greenhouse (we live like in a closed condo, not the rich type just like the owner built all this houses with a big garden and a gate lol) and he saw our cat in her house e asked her what the cat was doing there e she had the nerve to say that the CAT WAS EATING. he immediately started to scream that she was basically telling with her actions that we didn't feed out car, that we don't have food in our house... And she just looked at him.
I feel like going there and scream at her face because she must be dumb or something to not understand that she can't feed our cat. She has cats. What the fuck is she doing. Of course the cat is getting used to go there and eat. I'm so mad.
I've tried to lock my cat indoors but both are cats that hang around outside the house during the day...

TL; DR: my neighbor keeps feeding my cat even after being advised not to do it at least 2 times.",26Jun2019,1

279," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",26Jun2019,0

Recently on a site I saw a MacBook Air that has been used for 3 years being sold for 422 buckos... I don’t know much about computers and such but I’ve had horrible experience with them. I really want this computer (not gonna lie—-&gt; because my school friends all have MacBooks ) it seems fairly new and looks barely touched even. I’m not sure what to do about the situation, I’m a student so $422 is a lot of money for me to invest in but I need a computer soon.

282,"So this is the classical cheating story. 

I moved in with my friend J a few months ago. Prior to moving in we didn’t really talk. J was always on the phone with a guy and later on told me his name was R and that it was her boyfriend. I was super excited to hear she has a boyfriend and brought up the idea of possibly double dating with my boyfriend and me. Weeks went by and I still had not met R or had heard of him coming over or anything. 
I asked J one day when D would be coming over and asked how they could stand being apart for so long. This is when J lays it on me, in the whole year they have been “dating”, not once have they gone on a date or hung out. She blames it on their schedules. 
I immediately smell a catfish. I tell her that the situation sounds kind of weird and if she’s sure she even knows the guy she is talking to is even actually named R. She tells me that they met when she was working at a grocery store and he got her number. 

Still the whole relationship was weird. There were many more weird parts of their whole relationship but it basically boils down to a few weeks ago. 

One day J is bored and home alone and decides to put in R’s name on instagram. R has previously said he doesn’t have any social media. After looking for a good while, J eventually finds R’s instagram. R doesn’t have anything interesting, BUT in his tagged photos there is one of a girl. 

This girl is named A. J clicks on A’s instagram and learns that A and R are in a relationship. A is also trying to become a YouTuber so J finds her channel and there, there are videos and videos of A talking about R and even videos where R makes a guest appearance. 

They are in a full fledged relationship together where they actually see eachother in person. 

J gets mad and sends R a paragraph of a text message and R never responds. 

J tells me everything and shows me all the accounts. Now A also has a daughter. It is not J’s but it is obvious that J spends a lot of time with said daughter. And after watching a lot of A’s YouTube videos, I realized that she is a lot like us and she’s genuine and funny and caring. 

I told J that she should consider messaging A to let her know R is cheating but she is completely against it. I told her I would do it for her and to just send me screenshots of messages but she’s totally against it and says she wants nothing to do with it. 

I know it’s not my business, but as someone who has been cheated on, I wished someone had told me. And I feel like the fact that there’s a little girl involved makes the situation worse. 

I have tried pushing J to message A, that if it were backwards what would she want? But J will not budge. What should I do? 

TLDR: friend got cheated on but refuses to tell other woman that shared boyfriend is shared.",26Jun2019,2

We recently had a baby and things started going south after, in the sense that I am expected to raise this child essentially by myself (he does not help with baby at all, just the occasional 10-20 min of playing with him during the day) and still do everything around the house, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and spend time with my husband and be able to stay up till God knows what hour of the night to have drinks or watch movies with him and so on (you get where this is going). I never feel appreciated. I never have a break.  Ever! We discussed it multiple times and he agreed to allow me a couple hours by myself here and there but it never happens. Husband works and on his days off he likes to relax, but blames me and baby for not being able to do so at home. He is always tired and moody and takes it out on me, mostly by ignoring me for the day. I'm at a point now where I feel it would be easier being a single parent,  at least I wouldn't have the stress, negativity and having to take care of another person in the home.

288,"I'm currently 25. I live with my mom right now in Canada. My girlfriend lives in Sacramento. I visit her when I get my money right, but it's been a struggle. We're making it work at the best of our ability. I haven't been able to get back on my feet and stability since I was fired from my first job two years ago. I graduated with a high school education but wasn't gifted in academics. I never enrolled in college with the fear of being in debt. I currently have $3,300 in credit card debt I've been trying to pay off since 2014. I feel pathetic sometimes even suicidal about it, but I keep moving forward. I don't drive which I can't tell if it's limiting my opportunities or if it'll just be another debt I'll have to carry.

Luckily, I don't drink or smoke as I know those dependencies can hurt the poor man's wallet. My splurges are really 3.00 for a bite at the coffee shop. 

I won't lie. I'm afraid. My go-to is going on Indeed and applying to ten jobs, working 2-3 of them at the same time, saving up, burning out, quitting, eating off my earnings/visiting the states to see my girlfriend, and when I go broke I repeat the cycle. 

It's only now where I'm growing weary of this routine. A proper mentor may help or if I just not spend my money. My current monthly expenses are around $1300 CAD which isn't bad, but personally, a struggle. These dead-end jobs are exactly what they are but I need to start anew. 

I'm employed at an amusement park which is a seasonal gig and sometimes I get on my bike and deliver food. Both have been getting me by but by paycheck to paycheck. I have single digits in my account almost nearing my bi-weekly.

I don't want to be told I'm a fuck up (I think I can admit that to myself respectfully to my poor decision-making skills) But this is the first time I'm putting myself on blast for my insecurities in hopes to be in a place I want to be. 

I do want to be with my girlfriend and someday even my wife. Not long distance but face to face. I want to work a job with mobility to make that aspect work. My strengths are in writing and communication and weaknesses for science and math. I don't know if I should go back to school or try getting into policing and making the best for myself and the community. 

I've tried graphics and charting a step by step but seeing my immunity to success I fear I'm going to end up in a deeper pit of my problems than before.

My fiancé and I have some friends who want to come visit our city, and we know they'll expect to stay with us. We're close enough that we'd definitely love to see them while they're here, but we're not comfortable having them stay with us.

We've had them stay with us in a previous house and we found them to be incredibly awful house guests who left a hurricane in their wake. They were messy, rude, inconsiderate, and just generally not pleasant to have around.

How would you recommend we tell them we're unable to have them stay with us? We're aware it could damage our friendship (and potentially a business relationship) if we flat out tell them why we don't want them to stay. Any advice on how to approach this would be very much appreciated.

291,"Hey Redditors,
Before i start, i'd like to mention that english is not my native language. So I apologize in advance for any mistakes. 

I started having issues with a person 2 days ago.
2 days ago i talked someone i haven't seen in years. He texted me in the late night and everything was fine so far. We exchanged social medias and started talking through one of them.
Though, stuff started to change. Within 3-4 hours he started throwing a pity party. First i tried helping, but it seemed useless. Everything i tried to turn positive, turned back into a negative topic about his misery. Though he said he doesn't want to talk about his life, he kept on teasing it. I had none of it and backpaddled, explaining i had a hard time myself a while back and don't want to associate with negative impact for now, since i still need to learn how to deal with it.
He showed great interest in my miserable life a year ago, to which i denied telling anything, since i don't know him and want to move on.
At this point i started getting overwhelmed and went to bed.

Next morning rolls around and the whole deal starts again. Again, we tried holding a conversation which again, he started turning into negative. Then, a new topic and everything turns the same. At this point I am not enjoying texting him anymore. It's not fun.
The conversations felt forced, which started making me uncomfortable. And after hours of back and forth he started the whole misery thing again. Once again, i am telling him i don't want to talk about his misery, because i don't know how to deal with it and it overwhelmes me. It stopped for about 2 minutes. At this point i started getting exhausted. We have nothing to talk about and he starts to whine for the next 3 hours that he wants to talk to me, but doesn't know about what. First i tried explaining that forcing conversation isn't nessecairy, but it kept going. In the end i stopped the convo. I told him to relax and we'll continue talking tomorrow. He sent me one more message, apologizing for being annoying. I replied with a message explaining that he is not annoying, just very negative, which is unhealthy and quite exhausting. In the same message i gave him advice on how to get more positive, that i learned with my therapist. He had none of it. He replied with a message stating he doesn't need my help, he doesn't want it and he knows his issues and refuses to change. This started upsetting me. I tried explaining that if he continues he'll have more issues in life. I recommended getting professional help, since he always stated how miserable he is. He then texted me his entire life story and told me he doesn't want help, just someone that understands him. Once again, i started getting overwhelmed by the whole situation, sent one more message and went to bed. He sent two last messages in one he stated he'd rather kill himself than getting help. He doesn't want my help or anyone elses and he doesn't want to change.
This started stressing me, so i didn't bother replying and just distracted myself.

Now, i am already overwhelmed by his attitude and we didnt even talk for 24h. I don't know how to deal with any of this. It's a big case of oversharing. 
I am thinking of giving him one more chance, but if he continues being negative like that, i don't want to associate with him. I had professional help and am at a point of my life where i feel great about myself and i don't want to be reminded of how shit everything is on a daily basis.
Can you guys please help? Should i cut contact or talk to him. I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Thank you for reading.",26Jun2019,1
292,"Trigger warning for childhood sexual assault and content.

I'm going to simplify an extremely long story to my best ability. Please note that details will be left out. I'm indescribably sleep deprived and emotional, please excuse typos and messy text. I also wish to mention that I am not looking for pity. Pity doesn't sit right with me but that's a rant for some other time. Of course I approve of empathy as a natural human emotion, but it would be greatly appreciated if pity wasn't something I'll face - advice is what I'm after.

Background, I was molested by my foster father for an elongated period of time almost daily when I was nine. This has shaped me as a person tremendously, left me with crippling ptsd that comes with very aggressive symptoms I have trouble controlling despite therapy. For example I dissociate a lot. I've always wanted to be quiet about this. My worst nightmare is this spreading. It's such a shameful memory for me I'd honestly rather be raped again than hand that knowledge to the people in my life. I do understand on some factual level it wasn't my fault but it doesn't translate into anything comprehensible in my mind, emotionally I don't register myself as the victim. I'll also add that my parents were heavily abusive, physically and emotionally, contributing to my issues as an adult.

This story will include three people; myself, my soul sister and my nightmare - the person blackmailing and tormenting me. SS and N for short.

My SS is the best person to ever walk this earth - kind, gentle, true and the only person I trust with my whole heart in this world. I miss her more than anything. She's beyond pure and has had incredible patience with me, never judged me for a single thing. She only deserves the best. I miss her so my heart aches, and I can't stop worrying over her, I want to go to her every single day but can't...

I met N through SS. They're friends, and SS was always going on about how amazing N is - creative and talented. She truly is, I was impressed by her. But it quickly became obvious how attention hungry she was, feeding off of superiority, openly jealous and bitter if anyone was to showcase qualities above hers. She had to sit on her throne and peer down at us pests - she h a d to appear a goddess. So, SS talking about me with affection as well didn't sit right with N at all.

N contacted me in private to ""just get to know me."" I later figured out it was to invade my mind, lower my self esteem and find my weak points. I've seen PMs she's sent to other people - the tone is drastically different with everyone. If I didn't know, I wouldn't believe they were written by the same person. She's emotionally intelligent and picks up on people's insecurities and the twists of their minds, coming up with the best tactics to ensnare them. It's truly frightening.

She destroyed my self esteem and fed my inferiority complex without me having a hint of suspicion. She made me see her as some kind of angel who could only be flawless. There's so much here but it could be a book so I'll spare myself and you. Just know a l o t happened... It got to a point where I was compromising my sleep, health and schedule just so I could reply to her messages instantly and she wouldn't be upset. It was essentially grooming. I'm an adult, I should've known better, but with her skillful manipulation and my abusive past I must've been the easiest victim she's ever had. I have confirmation I'm not the only one, unfortunately...

Fast forward to what lead to this conflict. N and I were talking about sexual expression, for example through fiction - or more so she was talking, disregarding everything I say while buttering her own ego, building her moral high ground as usual. She asked if I enjoy age gaps in this context, to which I said I'm open to them, but inappropriate ones such as a 30/15 are a no no. She got a little defensive. She was into writing, and threw a comment in the air; ""It's not like I'd ever execute an age gap dynamic poorly."" I instantly told her of course she wouldn't... She's talented. I emphasized that I'm a very sexually open person, there wasn't much that could shock me and I advocate for freedom of sexual expression. So if she wanted to write about an age gap such as, she should, it simply wasn't my cup of tea. To me, a 15-year-old is emotionally a child and a relationship with an adult is heavily unbalanced, but this was fictional, on the level of a fantasy. I didn't have the courage - in front of this greater wise being - to assert that it does make me uncomfortable. She could whip me with her words, act exactly like my mother used to and make me believe that I'm not deserving of the air I breathe.

N dropped a bomb. Upon hearing I wouldn't judge her, she decided to casually state that she has many fictional works containing child sexual content. A 4-year-old getting fucked by his teenage brother, 10-year-olds having bdsm threesomes and a son doing his adoptive father. She drew art for all these as well.

You can judge me for this all you want but this is the reality of it all: I fell into a state of shock. I was triggered, all I could feel was the hands of my foster father all over me - phantom sensations as I sometimes get. I wanted to throw up my guts. My instincts were telling me no, no, no, she's going to come for me, she's going to hurt me, she wants to destroy me and violate me. I wasn't rational in any way, I was scared to all hell.

So what did I say?

I said it's okay.

I did not mean this. I don't stand behind this. I was terrified. I understand if you want to judge me but my traumatized brain took over. I had to please her or she'd hurt me... That's what my shattered mind has learned to believe.

She went on and on. I ate it all up like a good girl, shaking and crying, irrationally fearing she'd do something to me despite living across the globe.

Eventually, this got to be too much. My fake approval started to crack, I became evasive of the subject spiraling into terror unable to hear any more. She picked up on this and came to the obvious conclusion. She asked me with all this fake pity in her tone if someone had done something like that to me. I naturally denied this. This went back and forth, but the harder I tried the more she pushed the truth.

""There's nothing to be ashamed of, it's okay, I won't judge you, I'm here for you, you're safe...""

She wouldn't let it go, I caved under pressure. She told me it was all going to be all right, she'd help me walk through it. I declined. She insisted it'd be good for me. I hesitated, told her I'm too scared to.

""You need to talk about it to get past it. It's like you don't trust me. I'm pushing aside all my important projects to be there for you, I'm very busy... You don't appreciate me as a friend it seems, you don't appreciate my time. It's your own choice to dwell in this and not take a chance to get over it, such a shame when I'm generously offering. Sorry for trying to be a caring friend ""

A classic move from N. My frightened mind gave me no choice but to comply because I felt guilty. I felt like the selfish, ungrateful asshole. Again, judge me all you want. I know I could've said no - but trust me it was an option out of my reach.

First, she tried to convince me that I actually enjoyed it since ""children are more sexual than we're aware of"" she said. I tried to deny her, but didn't have a chance. She pressed for details about how my foster father approached me, how it all started, how he acted... She p r a i s e d him for being gentle, taking things slow and comforting me. After every answer N made sure to praise me too, saying I'm doing good and that this is very healthy. That I'll come to terms with it and see it wasn't that bad. Eventually, she even got down to degrading terms such as ""good girl."" She asked me how it felt to have him do specific things to me, not as in how it felt emotionally but physically... She asked about specific acts and details god I'm crying so much typing all this down. Whenever I got scared she encouraged me to just go on, I was being such a brave and good girl - the things my foster father used to say, massive triggers. I regressed into having the fearful mentality of a child. I let this woman halfway across the globe violate me mentally. I despise myself for that. I should've been stronger. I had come too far to let this happen.

I was her private source for first hand child porn with all the details she could thirst for.

Eventually I snapped. I told her no more. I can't do it. I was falling apart, I'd rather die than let her in on another shameful detail. This was my darkest secret that I was hoping to take to my grave.

She was furious, I don't have the energy for detail but she hinted towards it being a shame if the fact that I ""whored myself out to an adult man"" got out there. Note she knew my full name and address since I sent her a gift once, I was more than just a nickname online. She could ruin me.

We didn't talk after. For a while. A few months later she kicked me out of this one group, playing the same cards - it'd be a shame if the info leaked. She didn't appreciate me supporting other artists, she had to be the most admired.

It's been eight months since then. I haven't healed, I 100% blame myself for allowing it to happen. About a month ago, my worst nightmare came true. It came to my knowledge that despite exposing my belly to her like a dog, N had told two people about my secret. In her own twisted manner, with screenshots showing that I ""approve of"" child sexual content and that I enjoyed ""whoring myself."" All taken out of context, painting me as a despicable deviant.

There are no words to describe the distress. I was in physical pain.

My SS knows of my past, including the molestation - but not in detail unlike N. She's special, an angel beyond this world and I'd die for her. But N... She said that my SS is exhausted with the weight of it. I'm a straining negative force in her life, sucking her dry. N said if SS was to hear any more - as in the detail N holds - she'd reach the point of a mental breakdown. Apparently I already keep her up at night, how grotesque and nasty my molestation is gets to be too much. Hell it is grotesque and nasty. SS couldn't deal with it anymore if she heard it all, I've already pushed too much onto her. I've always seen the relationship between SS and I as extremely balanced. We share everything and support each other. But SS is almost too much of a jewel-hearted empath... I can see this happen, she'll help everyone until she's in despair herself. How much weight can she carry..? I have every reason to believe this would be the true outcome. I also fear she'll find me disgusting upon hearing about the gruesome details. N made it crystal clear I better stay away or she'll tell SS - I am 99% sure she already has.

I retreated.

I deleted all apps and whenever I receive a call  I dissociate and don't remember what I do in that situation. It's so scary that I don't remember. I'm scared people will yell at me for being a burden, whore, pedo apologist, tainted... N has ruined whatever little was left of me.

I've gone as far as looking into changing my name, moving to the other side of the country and dyeing my hair, even if none of these people live in the same country. I feel like everyone will know sooner or later.

If I make a public statement I have to reveal I was molested, carry that label for life, I'll be a frail little molested girl so people will tiptoe around me. I won't be human anymore, they'll know my foster father stripped me of that and if they as much as exhale my way I'll shatter. Goodbye normal interaction, being anything but a victim - being seen as ME. Many find friends with heavily troubled pasts a burden, so they'd avoid me, scared of the weight. Personally, I couldn't look anyone in the eyes anymore. I'd lose my friends anyways since I couldn't face them, so what's the point. I couldn't even talk to my SS anymore.

If I leave things be, I can never speak with anyone I used to know again, I need to disappear and start a new life of solitude somewhere no one can find me, as someone who doesn't exist. I can hardly exist with myself because I despise myself.

I let this happen, I dug my own grave. What do I do..?",26Jun2019,1
294,"I honestly hate having to resort to go here, but I’m at a complete loss and I cannot for the life of me comprehend the emotions I have right now. My friend, we’ll call him Donald, has been one of my best friends for over half a year and he’s honestly an awesome guy. I invited him to another friend group of mine and now we all talk and hang out and just have fun being social with one another. The problem with Donald is that he has this mentality where he’s assertive and he doesn’t have to listen to any moral codes because he follows one that isn’t too ideal. (At least to me and what I’d imagine to every decent being on this planet) 

An example of this would be him completely ghosting someone for the fun of it. Or him making fun of someone for no real reason. He started doing it to me a few days ago by making fun of me because he feels like it. And when I’d confront him about it, he would just go along with it. An example would be:

“Hey, why’re you being a jerk all of a sudden?”

“Because I feel like it. And you’re not going to do shit and in the grand scheme of things it really doesn’t matter.”

I predicted he’d do exactly that to me, as I would see him picking on others, but I didn’t expect this to be as bad as it feels? I want to know how to combat it. I feel like he’s gaslighting me by calling me a piece of shit human being for things I have trouble with. Yeah, I’m underweight, among other things, but does it warrant that kind of behavior? 

I’d like to say that deep down I know he’s not a bad person, but I don’t know what to believe. I resented the things he did to the others before me and now I can fully grasp the kind of jerk he is. 

Now, onto why I mentioned the close friend group. He perfectly assimilated his way with us and I feel like he’s making the group toxic in a way. Earlier today we were hanging out and he pinned me down and laughed because he knew I was too weak to do anything. My friends were recording it and when I asked them nicely to not send anything out they just gave the silent treatment to me/dodged the question. Donald gave me a handshake after the “stunt” to signify that there were no hard feelings, but there were a LOT of hard feelings. I think a bully has been cultivated within our own group but I can’t bring myself to be too mad at him. 

I can already see him finding this post and calling me a faggot for even being this emotional. He’s a piece of shit, but I became friends with him for the right reasons. I can’t confront him and, if I’m being honest, I don’t think I can talk to him one on one. He’s going to refuse to FaceTime with me. He wants to talk when there are other people so he has an audience that can hear him calling me a piece of shit retard who stutters. Oh, and is also a faggot. This is coming from a guy who says that he wishes he was a girl so he can date other men, which I find a bit ironic. But if I bring it up he’ll dodge the statement.

I don’t know if I have another friend group to fall back on. I’m tired of being dramatic, too. We’ve all been in feuds with other people and at this point I’m emotionally exhausted. I’m dealing with a bully who I can’t talk to and I just want to either wish for him to stop being an asshat or for me to shove a hat up his ass. 

There’s more to this I have to say, but can’t because I have a hard time putting my emotions on record.

295,"Hello guys and girls. I was just wondering if anyone here has ever or does struggle with confidence and seeing your self worth. All throughout high school and where I work, people have always told me I was really funny and easy to talk to. Like I’m always able to get people to laugh easily and open up to me. That said, I never really view myself as people tell me. I feel like I’m a terrible person and just useless. Like I’m hated by everyone. I know it’s probably not logical, but I can’t escape that thought a lot of the times. This has led to me never pursuing any girls really although I know some have tried to with me. I don’t know how to not feel this and I feel a void in my life. Like I know I need a wife and kids, but lack confidence to really go for it. How do I obtain confidence and not feel down on myself?

298,"I’m typing this on my phone, which may cause for some errors, so I’m sorry in advance. 

Let me just start  off by saying 2018 was the absolute worst year of my life, especially in the two months of March and April. I was in my freshman year of high school (which was sort of going fine, i just have horrible panic attacks and anxiety in general) when one my dogs attacked another dog. My dad and his girlfriend (divorced parents) had to make the tough decision to put our beloved dog down. Now this was extremely hard because that dog was my absolute LIFE. She made my life so much happier and I looked forward to being with her because she literally could read my mood and adjust to it. She was the most comforting being i’ve ever had. A few days before my dog was planned to be put down, my grandpa had numerous seizures and was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. My family and him made the tough decision to fight it and go through with the surgery to try and remove as much as possible, while after going through chemo. The recovery process and stress put on my family was so extreme, I can’t put it to words. And while he was practically relearning to walk and more at the hospital (along with more seizures and even heart problems), my other dog which belonged to mom had congestive heart failure and had to be put down, within two week of my other dog being put down. This just felt like the cherry on top of everything. My life was crumbling in front of me at the age of 14. I’d never realized how much I’d taken for granted until it was stolen away from me. 

flash forward a 5-6 months when I was finally starting to get into a groove of a new chapter of life, More kept coming. My grandpa’s chemotherapeutic treatment failed, and he choose to no longer treat the cancer. My family again falling into a deep dark hole full of stress due to having to take care of him and support my grandpa and grandma. In no way am I saying that they didn’t deserve it or anything close to that- because they did, but nothing could be planned or looked forward to because of the potential he could pass soon. In December 2018 as well as the stress from my Grandpa’s cancer, my best friend along with another close friend and I got into a car accident. It was my best friend who was driving (in no way do i blame her for what happened) and we got t-boned. Everyone in the car was fine- but I’ve found, another piece of my shattered life was broken. I felt so lost. I feel like I’ve been a decent person all of my life, why have I deserved this? 

After the accident, I’ve had to face my fears of driving and sometimes I find myself being anxious when even being in the car because I feel so out of control. My grandpas brain cancer has progressed, alas he has made it past his 2 months into almost 7, now being the end of June. It just feels like everything is beginning to fall apart again.

Although it is not even in the same extent of grief or loss (yet) I feel so out of control. My best friend has been pretty unsupportive of my mental state and often ditches our plans for others. I am so tired of being put on the back burner and always expected to be there for her when she just needs it. I really need support from her with my grandpa and just the overall stress I’ve got going on right now, and she isn’t here. It’s hard to give an entire explanation of how I feel when it comes to my friendship with her, but I can’t allow myself to be treated like a second choice anymore- it hurts a lot. Along with the worst feeling of being unsupported by her, I have been arguing so often with my mom. She and I have had such a rocky path in the past few years (maybe i’ll make a different post for her, it’s really complicated) I feel really unloved and worthless because my mom is constantly telling me negative things I do, and how shitty my dad is (my dad is overall usually supportive of me). My 16th birthday is next Tuesday, and with all of this stuff that is going on around me, my mom is constantly telling me “get a job, you need to get a job”. I have an interview set up this week, but i’m so scared it won’t work out because of how i mentally feel. My mom NEEDS me to get my license due to her having a low paying job and she can’t afford to keep giving me rides when she has another 30 minute ride back to work. It’s all just too much right now.

I basically have this huge pressure on me of getting this job, and my license straight away when i’m not even 16 yet.

299,"My husband of two years has always had a bit of an ""anger issue"", as in he would get unnecessarily frustrated over the smallest things (like someone spilling something next (not on!) to him or missing his bus). He used to be better, as in have more control over his emotions, but nowadays it has gotten to the point that it's starting to affect our relationship in a bad way.  
For example, I would forget to get him coke from the store and he would start an argument with me over it, saying manipulative things like ""you always forget what I want"" or ""you never do things for me when I ask you to"". He also gaslights me sometimes in order to come out as a winner in an argument, for example he would say that he asked me to do X the other day and I didn't do it when in fact, he never asked me for X in the first place. He would also pout and get super frustrated with me for hours because of said small thing, while in the same position I would just forgive &amp; forget instantly. When I try to discuss this with him, he either ignores me or starts cross-blaming me.   
What really hurts is when he does listen and does respond like an adult. We discuss this, he agrees he will do better - I agree I will do better too about whatever it is that we had a fight about. And then he just does the thing all over again, as if we never discussed it. He doesn't even try to prevent it - the moment something slightly offends him, he refuses to discuss it or dismiss it, he completely gives into the anger and blows up at me. And this repeats again and again and again, to the point I couldn't take it anymore and it was making my day to day life hell. I asked him to go to therapy, which he finally did in the last month or so but that hasn't changed anything at all. Life is still, pretty much the same as I described.  
What should and what can I do in this case? We have a baby together, so I want to make this work for the sake of it and I do love him with all my heart, he is the person I ultimately want to grow old with. I just feel upset, lonely and chronically frustrated, because it's like he doesn't hear me or try to get better for the sake of us or our family and just prefers life in this constant corrupt cycle of fighting.  


PS: I have explained love languages to him, including showing him mine and his, our compatibility, etc. It didn't really help much. I have also asked him to go to family therapy, but it was a struggle to get him to go to individual therapy, let alone couple counselling.",26Jun2019,1
300,"Hello everyone.  So as the title suggests I have a friend who's a pretty good artist, and I like her art quite a bit.  9 months ago I paid her to make me a drawing that I was going to use as my Twitter banner and she still hasn't finished it!  What's more frustrating is that she has completed other full pieces of art in this time and done drawings for other people but mine still isn't finished!  She said that this piece would be her magnum opus so I don't know if I should cut her more slack or...?

I've seen some wips and a substantial amount is done on it; the drawing itself is complete and mostly colored, but the shading and background aren't even close to done.  I don't really want to ask for a refund as I still want the art, and I don't know if pushing her will make her work any faster or just make her mad at me.  I thought about calling her out on Twitter but I just don't know if that would do any good and I feel like it would affect our friendship.  The last time I asked her about progress she gave me attitude even though I hadn't asked in many weeks.  I started to relax because she said she had more time off work now and would finish soon.  That was 25 days ago.

302,"Hi guys, I'll get right to the point.

My brother is a functioning alcoholic, and is addicted to coke.

I'm the only one in the family who knows about the coke. Everyone knows about the drinking. He and I are close, and he doesn't want me to tell anyone. His concerns about our family knowing are valid, my parents are good people but can be very difficult as well. If I told them, I feel like he would never forgive me.

Where I live, there is a sweeping fentanyl-related overdose crisis. People are dropping like flies in our city; I myself am an overdose survivor. 

My brother often uses alone and I am very worried that he is going to die. I often go onto messenger and see when he was last active, just to see if he's still alive.

I want to help him, but I don't know where to start. I even have counselling training, but this is too close to home for me. I don't know what to do. 

Any advice, from people with lived-experience, training, or job experience would be so appreciated. Thank you",26Jun2019,2
303,"I teach English in south east Asia (Vietnam currently). Last October I was working at an English center, the way this center works is each class gets a 10 class run with a foreign English teacher. I had this one class I would teach at night 3 times a week, I taught the first 8 classes no problem, just like any other class I liked the students they seemed to enjoy lalala everything completely normal with all of these students from what I could tell. Then after our second last class one of the students (Let's call her Amy) approached me as I was packing up. She started telling me some really weird shit I was taken so off guard from what was coming out of this girl's mouth, who seemed completely normal to me through all our other classes. Now keep in mind these students are by no means fluent in English so maybe some of what she said was a strange translation (stay with me now this is about to get weird) but basically she told me that she has native american blood and she's ""that girl"" who sees ghosts and enters the spirit world and all that, and she was asking me about our encounters we have 'apparently' been having in the spirit world, she started telling me that I have been speaking to her in the spirit world and she sees my spirit in her room in the middle of the night, communicating with her I presumed. She started acting like I was mentally speaking to her right then and there and I was telling her, ""I'm not doing anything I have no idea what you're talking about."" She was completely blown away by my response to all this (like she seriously thought I was gonna be like ""oh yeah totally all that stuff I've been intentionally telling you in the spirit world."")
Anyways, she continues on and tells me that her 'boyfriend is also in her room (in spirit form) and that his spirit told Amy that I would help her find him, she then explains that she's never met her 'boyfriend' before, but apparently she chats with his spirit and his spirit says I can help her find him so they can be together forever happy ever after lalalala. She then shows me his Facebook account, photo's and she told me the address where he lives. She said she went there but no one was there. I'm thinking this girl is nuts, but I just wanted her to go away so I said ""ok ok I'll send him a message and see what he says,"" of course this was not gonna do it for her, I had to ""contact him in the spirit world."" (She also told me some really random shit I cant quite remember about me meeting him in the future at Harvard university, and that apparently i know him and were friends, so weird idk...) Anyways I told her again Idk what shes talking about and said I'd message him and eventually I just left and went home.
She messaged me after saying pls let me know what happens etc... So anyways the 'boyfriend' never messaged back, (I just said, hey do you know Amy?). Next class I had to tell her after the class when she approached me and I basically told her, sorry I don't know what you're talking about I can't help you.
Over the next few days she started spam messaging me asking for all this information and trying to get me to help her and eventually I just said ""Leave me alone, don't talk to me."" and blocked her.

Fast forward maybe 4 months and me and my GF are spending the winter back in my home country with my family, I get a message request from a guy I never heard of on FB saying its her and shes using her Dads FB to contact me cause she thinks I blocked her.
""Why did you block me? Please talk to me i need to tell you the real truth."" Something along those lines is what she said. Obviously I never accepted the request and just blocked again. Fast forward 4 more months and We're back and I'm teaching again but for a different company.
One of the teachers from my old company contacts me after I haven't talked to him in months out of the blue saying
""Bro, I know this is weird but I gotta call you.""
Ok
So basically he tells me that he was going for coffee with one of his students, something he does all the time, and she started asking him tons of questions about me, where i live, what im doing, asking to see my facebook profile. Thankfully this guy gave her nothing and got outta there, but he was calling me to warn me ""yo whatever you got going on with this chick just know shes still out there trying to find you.""
Great, I had almost forgot about this chick and here she was showing up again (10 months since I last made any communication with her!)
I was telling my GF about this and obviously she started creeping this Amy on FB and we found some crazy disturbing shit, like huge long posts filled with my name and words like, love and forever and updating her statusus saying shes married to me. I kid you not this wall is packed with my name its fucking freaky. Also the other guys name (her boyfriend) came up in another post along with words like ""kill this person"", and some other dark shit. We checked and her account has 0 friends and she just likes all her own posts and posts frequently. It's mostly in vietnamese so it took me a while to translate  and figure some of it out, but from what I got this girl is utterly crazy and obsessed with me and I'm feeling concerned for my and my GF's safety if something were to happen and she managed to get some of my info from another former student or something like that. I'm quite private so none of my personal info is on my social media like where i live or work and I almost never make posts/have checked my privacy settings. Any advice appreciated I'm not sure what I can do about any of this/tips to stay safe?!?!

I recently found a great girl-friend. She is an orthodox jew. Great home-maker, great family values, just an all-around traditional woman. This combat's the racist conspiracies that Jew's are against this and push a narrative against this. It kinda has turned my life up-side down. The only problem is she wants me to be an orthodox jew. I am willing to do this because of the woman it has made her. I see many positives of the religion in juxtaposition to Christianity. However, their is a lot of mysandry and misogyny involved in the religion because men have a greater religious burden then men. But, in my heart of hears I agree with them. My family wouldn't agree with my decision to convert, but I honestly feel like its a religion that makes more sense to me.

Furthermore, i just got fired from my job. I am in IT. Don't have a degree, just knowledgeable with computers. I thought I was doing fine, not a hic-up in 6 months. Didn't drink on week-days, literally changed my life for this job opportunity.  Then they fired me. Looking for work and it has been almost a month. A few answers but nothing set in stone yet. Filed for unemployment but I live in Texas so we don't have great laws for this. I don't know what to do. I'm falling back into my alcoholic ways. Staying up until the sun rises drinking. Spend my days scrolling the internet. My girlfriend and I have to make rent and she has taken up a second job to compensate and I feel horrific. I never see her.

Look, I love my mother more than anything. she's the sweetest person I've ever met, and I'm just posting it here to see if I can get someone to help me.

my father died on December 24, 2017. He died in confrontation with the police, after shooting my mother three times because she wanted to part with him. She survived and managed to get through this very well, though.

After that, we had to move (my mother and sister had occasional panic attacks in the old house) and my problem started a month or two later. Look, I was 14 at the time, about to turn 15. Somehow I got an apprentice job at a company near here and got 700 reais (about 180 dollars) as a salary. with all this happening my mother asked me for this money because the situation was difficult, I lent it to her and she promised to give me back when things stabilized.

Listen, I'm not going to use this to justify what I did, just to explain, because I ended up getting two reais (almost 50 cents) in her purse eventually. I used this for the stupid thing, I do not know, to buy candy, probably.

I entered a new school after that, full-time, which was not compatible with the workload of my job, so I had to stop working, and so the money she borrowed was the only one I would have in a good time. But she didn't give it back to me.

I kept getting money in her purse. no big notes, little thing. in the conversion I think I've never taken more than 3 dollars at a time.

Eventually I stole even from my aunt.

began to become something compulsive. I just did. It was not like I needed the money, or it was for revenge, no, I just picked it up for no reason. And I continued to spend on ridiculous things. mostly crappy foods

in my school there is something related to projects that the parents have to give 10 reais (3 dollars) every month so by the end of the year the students organize a dance festival. I told my mother that it was actually 20 reais. And I started to get half of it for me.

Today I got 12 reais.

2 reais more than I had ever taken before. And ... I do not know, part of me wants her to find out, wants her to get mad at me, you know?

The problem is that I can not stop. Almost every day I end up buying candy or some snack at school and it seems like I got addicted to it. a day without and I can not bear to stay in school, I do not know why but I can not concentrate without it.

I want help. I'm almost crying with guilt now. I **need** help. but I do not want her to find out. I do not want to disappoint her that way. She means the world to me and yet, I keep doing it.

Honestly, I do not know how to end this text, I just needed to get it out of myself I guess. Comment wathever you want, I think I deserve the worst for it. but I also, i need advice, how can i stop?",26Jun2019,0

Well that was a lie

321," 

When I first arrived in Shanghai. I was 22, inexperienced and fragile. I had no friends yet, aside from my roommate who was my longtime friend but that’s was it.

My boss who was 18 years older than me, started fancying me. Long story short we started dating. She was a local. A successful businesswoman, charismatic, who had experience, friends and money.

I, on the other hand was just starting out in Shanghai. It was my first time leaving my family and friends by myself. I had always lived in different countries. However this was the first time I was leaving alone. Leaving my family and long established friends behind in France.

Needless to say, I was kind of vulnerable. My girlfriend/boss was the only one person I had and I got attached. I was telling her. That if we were to breakup, for obvious reasons. 

I would have nobody and she would just go back to her normal life with friends and in a country she was born into. You can see from what I just wrote above that I made a few mistakes but that’s not what we are talking about here.

323,"So, I am moving in with a buddy from work. The current issue we have is that one bedroom is twice the size of the other, and the bathroom in the bigger bedroom is private, so i.e more privacy overall. The issue I am having is that we both agree that the bigger room should pay more since they have twice the space. I said that the bigger room should pay $150 more (we both pay $1,050 a month), and he didn’t have a problem with that. The issue is that I am the one who brought up the fact that the bigger room should pay more, and he says he doesn’t care who gets the room. Would I be in the wrong for turning down the bigger room after I was the one who renegotiated terms? I broke my lease to move in with him, so I’m already $1,300 in the hole. I moved in with him in the hopes of saving money, so I kind of want to take the smaller room to save money. Help please",26Jun2019,1

326,"My female best friend has been in love with a guy for apparently over 10 years. It never worked out between them. Since last year they are involved with each other again. He is never really there for her and they don't see each other very often. But she is so madly in love with him and it hurts her that their relationship isn't working out cause he doenst put any effort into it. Now to my problem. Since him and her are seeing each other again she's constantly depressed, crying over the phone, not talking all day and sending me texts about how much she is suffering, being indecisive, moaning about him, or how awful everything is and tells me she can't make decisions anymore. Her guy wants to forbid her to do things she likes, like going to festivals. Her and I love going there, but he's against it. My friend told me she will quit going bc he says so. She was never some to obey, she is a strong woman, but this guy has her in her hand and he doesn't let her go but he also doesn't care enough about her to have a proper relationship. How can I at least make her understand that the constant change of mind is super annoying to me and I don't want to deal with that anymore. I've been understanding for so long. I buy festival tickets, the next minute she doenst want to go anymore, then she changes her mind again and again. She's been indecisive for months now and I'm done with it. I feel like the depression and the indecisiveness will disappear when he's gone, but he won't leave and she won't open her eyes. What can I do?",26Jun2019,1
328,"(I’m on mobile and this seems kind of long looking back at it, sorry in advance) 

Context: I work at a relatively fancy and popular restaurant as a busser (cleaning and resetting tables, helping waitresses, etc.) when I am home from college. I have worked there for several years now, since before I went to college.
 
The busser(s) get about 10% of the waitresses’ pooled tips. On most days we only need one busser at a time, but on Fridays and Saturdays we typically schedule two. When two bidders are scheduled, they split the 10% portion of tips.
 
Every single shift since I finished this past semester, I have been scheduled with the same coworker, I’ll call him S. I’ve never really liked S, due to his general sleaziness (he regularly hits on my minor sister while he’s in his last year of college...), but never really had a problem working with him until recently.
 
My problem now is that he literally does only the bare minimum of what is expected of him. For example, the other night I did all of the pre-opening work (folding napkins, restocking the bus station and the kitchen, etc.) while he just hung out at the bar at chatter with the waitresses. He also planned his break another night for the exact time that a party of 18 and a party of 8 would be leaving, actually mentioning to me that they were about to leave right before he went on break, so I had to do all of the work. Even when I’m hosting and he’s the only busser, he still slacks on his work and I have to help him (and I don’t get to share those tips, he gets them all!).
 
It’s so bad that one of our bosses (not the one in charge of scheduling, but the head chef, married to the scheduling manager/co-owner) mentioned it the other night. Our tips had come out to $38/$40, and he asked to split a 10 to make it even, and my boss told him “So give her the $40, you’ve been on your ass all night.” I went in to the kitchen to try to find a dollar in my purse, but when I came back he reluctantly told me that I could keep the larger tip.
 
I really want to tell my boss that I don’t want to be scheduled with him anymore. His poor work ethic frustrates me so much that I no longer enjoy going to the job that I loved and missed so badly while I was at school. My fear is that he’s worked here for longer than I have, so even if he really isn’t doing his work I’m afraid my manager might take his side or tell him that I made a complaint. Most of my coworkers have their own gripes with him, but nobody has told our boss so we aren’t sure if she’s noticed.
 
I know I’ve been dragging this out but essentially I’m just looking for some advice on if/how I should approach this with my boss. I’d likely have to do it over text because her schedule hasn’t aligned with me lately. Any help would be greatly appreciated, mostly I’m just nervous that I’m overreacting but it’s really frustrating.",26Jun2019,1
330,"First off, I really do just want advice on how to sneak out. Not people telling me I shouldn't sneak out.

I can get out of my yard by climbing a storage shed we have, but idk how I'm supposed to get back inside of my backyard fence. My parents put a lock on the gate because my dogs kept nudging the handle open so I can't get inside that way. 

There is a tree in my front yard right next to my fence that I could climb and get inside, but that may make too much noise considering there is a junk pile on the other side of the fence behind the tree. I would rather get into my yard via the back of my house (I live on the side of a stree with no house behind me, just a sidewalk and some road). I thought about putting a cardboard box on the prefered side of the fence because it wouldn't be out of the ordinary really, but that would crumble underneath me. 

What could I do?? Please can someone help me?",26Jun2019,0
331,"This post could also be ""How to fire someone?"" but we're in college.  I have a group thesis and we're 4 members total. The thesis spans 2 semesters (so it's like thesis 1 and 2) and this one person hasn't been pulling their weight since thesis 1. He wouldn't respond to messages, his outputs weren't up to standard, we meet 8 hours a week to work together whereas he only comes in 4 hours a week. We tried to be understanding with meeting up because we can work over the internet but how can he work over the internet when he doesn't respond to message. He doesn't even try to make effort to communicate or offer to help. I've pulled him aside once before to talk about his communication but not much has come up. I IG storied a passive aggressive story about ""being useless"" and he sent the group chat a very insincere 'apology' or 'excuse'. I showed my therapist and some friends and they agreed that that wasn't sincere. We wrote him back messages and he didn't even see them for days. He started responding to one of us and doing a bit more work now but he's acting like nothing happened. Also there's not much work for him to do because we're near the end of the thesis. It's like 90% complete.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my thesis advisor and the dean said we have to call with him tomorrow. We have to tell if we'll kick him out or give him a chance. The thesis advisor will be there to mediate. 2 of us feel like we should just kick him out. We already carried him through thesis 1 (with the highest grade in our batch!) so that's enough.

so for a little background, i’m a boy crazy girl about to enter college. as i said, i’m boy crazy, so i’ve been following cute boys on social media that are going to matriculate into my college. i was feeling really brave one day and i PMed this one dude and he was a really sweet guy. after a few weeks, i finally mustered up the courage to tell him that i liked him. and surprisingly, he actually admitted to liking me back. 

it’s been a few weeks since we’ve confessed and we text regularly now. college only starts September 2 so there’s a ton of time before i get to see him in person, seeing as we live in different parts of the state. i know it’s unconventional to like someone over text but if i don’t like him in real life i’ll call it off. i think right now though he likes me more than i like him. i feel like i’m leading him on sometimes when we text cuz i’m losing interest. what do i do?",26Jun2019,1
335,"Okay, so this is a bit of a long read. So grab your popcorn.

So i started a new job at a large prepaid phone company that was recently bought out by a larger company whose name starts with a T.  I’ve been there for two days and my trainer today was explaining how if i wanted to make commission at this job and reach my quotas i would have to charge people for add ons to their bill that they would specifically request to not have.  For example customer comes in for a 50$ plan and the free phone, customer appears to have some money so my manager applies a bunch of different add ins such as insurance, international calling, etc. without the customers knowledge in order to cash in on the commissions you make off of each add on. 
Another customer came in for the same phone and plan setup and payed almost 60$ less because he appeared to be “poorer” in my managers words. The customers have NO CLUE that’s what is being added to their bill as it isn’t itemized like a grocery list. 

I don’t know what to do and i do not want to be liable or involved in this unethical probably illegal practice. What should i do? I really cannot afford to lose this job for the time being but i plan on getting the hell out ASAP. I’m honestly super tempted to try to report them to the FTC to see what they say about it.

336,"Long story short, I don't talk to very many people. I live in a rural area and it's just me and my husband most of the time. Most of my friends are online and we talk in Discord and stuff and with those friends I can say whatever and it's no big deal. We all joke about even intimate things like sex lives or whatever else.

But then I have this issue of getting excited around people I don't really know. Like, *Yay new people to talk to for once!* kind of excited. A topic will come up and my brain just spills out a reply. Someone said it's hot out? I start with what's a generic ""Ugh, I know. It's been rough. It's like 90 degrees in our livingroom right now and I'm miserable."" That on its own isn't too bad. But then someone comments about how that's crazy and then I just go on about how our landlord is being worthless and won't fix our roof which is why the AC can't keep up and blah blah blah. I don't even realize I've derailed the conversation until it's too late. Recently someone called me out for it and while I've always known I talk a lot, I didn't realize I was so annoying.. And I hate it. I want to fix this. I try to hold my tongue but I just immediately react to things when I have room to respond. Someone brings up rain, suddenly I'm going on about how insane the rain from hurricane was last year. Someone talks about lemonade? I'm suddenly explaining how morning sickness has made me unable to enjoy citrus anymore. Which.. Isn't really normal appropriate conversation unless it's with some other moms or something (no one wants to hear about vomiting lemon pie). And I totally get that, but not until it's too late.

So has anyone else ever had issues like this? Where they just.. Blurt things out and overshare? People have called me out and someone has said they're tired of me being an 'attention whore' but that's legitimately not the case. At least, that's not why I'm talking. I'm just talking because it's nice to talk when most of your day is being a stay at home wife with no one to talk to. I just don't want to feel like I'm annoying when I hang out with people.",26Jun2019,2
337,"Hi,
I am not really sure how to phrase this, but I’ve recently realised I might have issues committing. Nothing big, I’m not talking relationships or anything, more general things.

For example: programming. I’m currently learning Java, and have been learning it for a few months now, but I’ve recently taken up an interest in game design. I want to get stuck into game design, and the temptation to just switch to C# so I can start making games is becoming strong. I love Java and have no qualms with it, but every time I watch someone making a game it makes me want to start C#.

Another example is video games themselves. I’ll often start a video game, get partway through it, then start playing a different game and get part way through that, then start a new game etc. etc. I seem to keep starting games, but not finishing them. 

I am not sure if this is an actual “issue” or if it can be passed off as just curiosity or whatever, but I know it would be detrimental to swap to C# from Java right now, and think it would do me some good to learn how to commit myself more or stop this cycle of constantly changing through things.",26Jun2019,4

340,"Over the last few months I've noticed that my ability to cope is slowly deteriorating. I experienced extreme anxiety starting in March, and it lasted for a month and half. I left my job, and it helped greatly, but it's been slowly getting worse. I started worrying about my health, thinking that I might have a stroke, get cancer, have a heart attack. After this, I began picturing the world falling a part and our way of life ending. I also have a flight coming up, and I keep focusing on dying on the flight. My confidence is starting to break down, and I've noticed that I've begun projecting my fears onto my partner - fear that she'll leave, fear that she'll lose attraction in me because I'm falling apart. I recently went on a camping trip and I wasnt wable to stay in my tent cause I heard noises and thought something was going to kill me. I'm sure anyone can pick out a pattern, so I won't add anymore details. For a side note, I've gone the medical route and psychotherapy route, both were great mitigating factors.

Apparently he wanted to keep that group of friends for himself, as a get-away from me for when I get ""too much"" for him. Iv been going to this game for a few months now and am now friends with all the other players who seem to like me.  J seems to want me to quit going to this game. Also, in the same text, he had a go at me for running my own RPG game at my house and inviting him to play. Apparently that was selfish, inconsiderate and rude of me. I should have considered that hes a busy man and cant manage the ""commitment"" im forcing on him. Although he didn't say it outright, I got the impression he wanted me to stop running my game for my friends. Why he can't just say ""im too busy"" and not come to my game, i dont understand. 
Im of the opinion that he is way out of line for trying to control what I do with my free time, that he is also crazy in some way for getting angry with me for inviting him to play in my game, and im tempted to tell him to fuck off.

344," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/


Edit: what I’m saying is to people like this because I’m ugly it means I’m automatically stupid and incompetent and even getting a bar job is as I did a huge surprise as I’m too ugly for that line of work to her, that’s how I took the multiple repeated ‘well done’.

Well the thing is
My residency in where I currently am is currently over so dad wants to make me travel to sudan he already made an official exit document to the ministry of interior

The problems are the following
1- the current state of the country isn't good in the slightest (the amount of people dying daily and the terrorism by the janjaweed (some cunts)
2- the internet blackout (this is a problem because it's the time everyone is applying for a university and me going in there without internet might cause me to miss an opportunity if by any chance I got accepted)
3- this going to sudan thing is happening very fast that I have not even prepared in a lot of ways (its in 20-something days)

361,"It's a really complicated situation. She broke up with me after changing completely in a time frame of 3 weeks. She was suicidal and then 3 weeks later she told me she has never been that happy in her life. There weren't any changes whatsoever. Then she got angry at me for absolutely no reason. She really started to hate me and then she broke up. I never saw her like that.

She had mental health issues. 1 year before the break up she was tested by a psychiatrist to see if she had a bipolar disorder. She lied on the test and told me it described her perfectly, but she didn't want to have the diagnosis. We both thought bipolar meant being a little bit more moody than other people, so I didn't really care about her lying on the test.

After the break up I did a little bit of research about the bipolar disorder and it's way more than just mood changes. It's mania and everything fits perfectly. I also looked at the relationship and was able to determine how long her depressive episodes last and how long her manic episodes last. I messaged her 2 more times after the break up, but like I said she was irrationally angry at me and she only tried to hurt me and then she told me I should never message her again.

So now I'm stuck. Her manic episode will most likely end in the next 2 months. The last time the manic episode ended (and when I didn't know that she was manic yet) she called me to tell me that she just overdosed on painkillers and other stuff and I was able to call an ambulance. That was before our relationship however. This time she treated me like shit, so she might not message me out of shame. I would say the chance that she will attempt to commit suicide if nobody explains to her why she behaves like this is about 90 to 95%. So really high.

It's not like I want to have contact with her or anything, but I feel like it's my ethical responsibility to at least let her know about my suspicion. I mean maybe I'm wrong, but maybe I'm right and this can save her life. The problem is I don't know how. I could just text her a message explaining it, but if she is still manic there is a good chance she will react aggressive and maybe this will cause more damage. Her parents also don't care about her and neither do her friends so I can't even tell anybody around her about it. How do I let her know about my suspicion ?",26Jun2019,1
363,"For context I live with at my mother's house (I'm 20) and my father is only around for about 2 days a week. They aren't divorced or anything, his job means he travels a lot.

Whenever I hear my parents moving about the house, I get scared. I don't know if it counts as a panic attack or something but if I hear something I immediately freeze up and feel like hiding.
Other triggery things are loud footsteps (really old wooden floors) stairs, doors and if I don't have headphones a car pulling up.

Usually I can just sit it out and it ends when they settle down (either to sleep or watch TV) or if I leave the house, which I almost always do if they use the vacuum. Whenever that happens I just want to cry.
I can't think of any particular traumatic moments involving sounds of people moving around. Also it's pretty bad when they BOTH start moving independently (like my dad doing stuff in the kitchen and my mum going upstairs) My mother is obsessed with cleaning stuff sometimes to the point of tearing up carpets to clean under them and checking my room while I'm at work. (To be fair it isn't the cleanest place and I dislike her doing this as I'm 99 percent sure she does it for snooping too)

364,"Sorry if the formatting is bad! I’m on mobile right now and it’s 5 AM.

Hello. I’m in sort of a dilemma right now, and I have nobody else to talk to about this. I’d first like to give some background information.

Both of my parents are immigrants coming from Africa. I (F15) was born in America. My dad left around a year ago to his hometown to start his own business. At least, that’s what my mom told me. I never questioned her too much, since the last time I did it made her uncomfortable.

Back to what happened. My mom asked me to get a few documents for her. We have this designated cabinet where we put important papers, so I go in there to get it. While I was looking around, I saw an application for asylum. I was really confused since my parents never once mentioned anything about asylum or their citizenship. After reading through it, I found out that my dad actually might have been deported for some reason, and now I’m worried that my mom is in the same situation.

As said in the documents, the reason why they’re applying is because they don’t want me going through FGM, since their in-laws have been pressuring them to send me over to get one done. I know the basics about it, and how common it is, especially since my family is mostly from Guinea and Senegal. 

Reading through it just made me scared and nervous. I’d rather not live in Africa, since I can only speak English and very broken French. I’m not familiar with most of my family living there, and I’m not sure how they’d treat me.

Since I now know about this, I’m not really sure what to do next. I want to ask my mom about it, but there’s a part of me that just wants to never mention it acknowledge it ever again and hope that nothing happens. Should I ask her about it? And when would be a good time to ask?",26Jun2019,1
365,"I'm 19 and I've moved around a lot in my life. I don't really have a best friend that I could go to right away if I had a problem, or someone to constantly keep in contact with. This is mostly because of the move. I had a bunch of close friends in my old country, but it's hard to be invested in each other's lives if you're so far apart. I also have friends from college now, but they have their own best friends that they've grown up with. It's also hard to hang out with them often because we live very far apart from each other and traffic is horrible in the city.

I was with my S/O for almost two years when I broke things off with him. He turned into a different person in the last few months of our relationship (cheating, lying) and I've cut him out of my life. He used to be my best friend, someone I could tell my insecurities and shameful  secrets to. He was the person I'd tell the most useless shit to, but I still did because he cared. He would always ask how my day was and care about everything big I do (like going overseas or a final project).

I don't want him back because I know nothing good will come from it. But I feel really sad that I lost a best friend. Nobody cared about me as much as he did and now I  don't have someone to talk to all the time. 

I know I still have friends who deeply care about me, but losing someone that I was so invested in, and was so invested in me really hurts.

372,"Hello r/advice ,

Recently, me and one of my closest friends had a breakdown of our friendship.

What happened (summing up): was I went through a dark period of my life and I was awful to be around. During that period I would rely pretty heavily on my friend. It created an atmosphere where I wasn't fun to be around.  
Being out of that now - I understand. I understand that being negative so often would be a detriment to be around me.  
We talked about it months later, and I owned up to the mistakes I made, and I thought we had cleared the air.

But as the months went on, I noticed they were pulling back again. So I asked if there was something wrong, they said there wasn't.

But it got to a stage where I would be waiting weeks for text replies, I'd be rejected any time I asked to do something together.

I thought they were just busy, so I ended up leaving it for a while.

But after hearing stories from mutual friends where they maintained snapchat streaks of a few hundred days, messaged daily. 

I know how petty this sounds, but I felt both jealous and hurt.

As we don't really see each other outside of work, but we work at a supermarket so it's not appropriate to bring up things there, I messaged them asking to talk to me about whatever issues there were, or if there weren't I would like it for them to make more of an effort.

After about 2 weeks I got a response which stated that they felt incredible anxiety around me, due to our past, that spending time with me without the whole group is something they aren't interested in. That we could message or snapchat ""occasionally"" but not all of the time.

I stated, that I wish that I were given an opportunity to prove that I was much happier mentally now, but that I don't believe a friendship is something that has all of these restrictions, and that they were just tolerating my presence rather than being my friend.

So the friendship ended.

But now, a week later, I still feel incredibly hurt because this person was one of my favourite to be around. I know that it was my decision to end the friendship, but I felt I was forced into that option.

Not just that, I work with this person every week, and we share almost all of our friends mutually. 

I HATE the idea that we will never be friends again, but I don't want to always be the person that apologises and owns up to their mistakes.

If I cave, then that person gets to believe that they did the right thing.

So, to sum up, what are my options? Do I give it as much time as I can before reaching out? Do I never reach out? How do I move on?",26Jun2019,1

376,"I’m 20 and bought a dog 2 years ago. My family was upset about it, yet they grew to love it. This week My neighbor asked if he could take her with him to his retirement home. At first it was a easy no but now I’m not sure. All my siblings are moved out and I also plan to move for the school year so she would just be left with my parents who work 9-3. My neighbor has 3 dogs who she loves and have a blast playing with everyday. She also currently has anxiety when going on walks (due to our grandpa trying to walk her but losing her). I have a feeling it would be selfish to keep her in a house that she is afraid to go outside and that will be gone a lot. I also think it would be selfish to make her leave a house that loves her very much and she knows so well. My siblings say I should not do it but they aren’t home enough to make a decision.

377,"I am so confused and I am having trouble on what to do. I have never had a girlfriend before and I've never taken a date to a dance before.

But let me start from the beginning which is about a month into 2nd grade and I'm the new kid at school. It's a small private school from k-12. Most graduating classes are anywhere between 25 - 60. Our class has about 30. Anyways, as a 2nd grader, I noticed this one girl, for the sake of anonymity let's call her Kim, and I catch a crush the first time I ever talk to her. It's the 2nd crush I ever had. Fast forward a decade, I'm in 11th grade. For the past 10 years, I have liked Kim at varying degrees, but have never given any hints to anyone whatsoever as to how I felt. 

One day, in September, I spontaneously tell 4 of my friends this secret and a month later, I decide to ask Kim to a Fall Dance. I was not entirely sure whether the method I chose was adequate, so I ask one of Kim's friends and she says something along the lines of ""yeah that's a great idea, super cute. You should go for it."" So I wrote a rhyming poem note and passed it to her before school started, middle school style. Her answer was something like ""this is the sweetest note I've ever gotten but no because I promised Minty we would both go together without dates."" Minty (not her actual name) is her best friend. That really hurt and I will admit I cried a bit, but I still went to the dance with a group of my friends. The whole night, I was kind of sad because Kim looked stunning, but I still had fun.

Fast forward again a few months and it's the last day of school before Winter break. Ever since November I have been carrying around this necklace in my pocket trying to work up the courage to give it to Kim as a present, but every day since November, I chickened out. A little backstory, the necklace was composed of 2 parts. The first being the chain part which used to be part of a fish hook necklace I got as a kid, but never really wore. The 2nd was a siver star which I used to put on top of my mini Christmas tree every year. The star was to represent how Kim gave me hope whenever I was sad, like a star during the dark night. I did end up giving her the necklace, however, I never told her the hidden reason behind it. I've always had a hard time talking to people, but I find talking to Kim even harder. I guess I'm always scared around her even though she's one of the kindest people I've ever met. Anyways, she accepts the necklace with a huge smile and we talk a little.

For Valentine's Day, I give her a bag of M&amp;Ms. Eventually, Spring Break comes along and I go on a school field trip of sorts to Europe along with a few dozen other students of varying age. While in Europe, I purchase a €99 Swarovski necklace. A guy in my class, who happens to be really good friends with Kim, asks who the necklace is for. I tell him either one of my female relatives or Kim. Of course the guy takes it as Kim as the only option and by the time I get back to school the whole grade is excited that I'm apparently giving Kim the necklace. So I give her the necklace and she politely turns the gift down not wanting to ruin our friendship. Yes she used the word ""friends.""

A month later, Prom arrives, but she didn't go because of a golf tournament on the same day. A few weeks later, I ask her out on a date. She says no again. She said something along the lines of ""I don't think I'm ready for a boyfriend and I should just focus on myself. Plus I don't want the drama."" I'm pretty sure this is true because she has never had a boyfriend before. Of course I got really sad after this.

Now, in the middle of summer break we talk via Instagram once in a while and I send her cute dog videos every 3 days or so. For a while, I thought I had moved past Kim. I used to think of her as this perfect goddess now, she's just a friendly classmate. Just to clarify this is not the issue I want advice on. I get that Kim and I will never be a thing, I just wanted to illustrate how impactful she has been in recent time.

But here's my actual problem. It sounds strange, but trust me I have no control over it. Kim has been showing up in a lot of my dreams lately. I have this dream journal where I record any of the dreams I remember and I've counted how many appearances Kim has had. She has been in my dreams more times than anybody else I know, including my family. So how do I stop this from happening? I know and have come to terms with the fact that Kim and I will never be a thing, but I can't help but feel great whenever she talks to me. It's like a cool breeze on a very hot day. How do I get over this girl? Also how do I get better control of my dreams?",26Jun2019,2

 I'm not getting any reassurance about anything I do in life. Like being reassured that everything I do will even be worth anything or lead me to some form of happiness.
What's the point in loving if you know in your heart that they don't feel as strongly as you. What's the point of working towards a goal if you are going in circles. I've waited, listened, watched, learned, cried, felt, suffered, dreamt, but after all this time I'm getting tired of losing. I'm sadly, just tired of believing in any hope here on earth.

381,"My job has been good to me. When my car broke down last year the general manager lent me a company truck to use while i looked for a new one. A year before that when i got out of a long term relationship the owner of the company lent me $700.00 to put a deposit down on an apartment. 
However last fall the owner sold the company and since then new owners have slowly been changing things for the worse. Trashed our yearly raises to nothing, we have been working 50-60+ hour weeks for months and its going to get worse soon cause we just lost two people from our 8 man team.

383,"Sorry for the long post, I'm in a bad headspace and don't know what's important so I'll just post a lot of it. 

My girlfriend (25) and I (also 25, M) live together and she has been having severe anxiety and OCD issues and panic attacks for the last couple of days.  She's struggled with these issues for the past several years but in the last two days they've flared up worse than I've ever seen, and about as bad as they've ever been before I knew her. She also has a history of self harm. She started a new job about a month ago, which is the source of most of her stress; she's also coming up on the anniversary of the death of a close friend. 

Yesterday we went to the hospital after she harmed herself for the first time in about a year, to my knowledge. They increased the dosage of her meds and sent her home. Luckily I haven't had to work for the past two days, so I've been able to be with her during all of this and give her whatever help I can. 

This morning she called the suicide prevention hotline and they advised her to go to the hospital. I was reasonably sure that she was at risk if harming herself or trying to end her life, so I brought her. They decided to admit her. Right now she's in the emergency center and can't receive visitors, but at some point today (hopefully) they are moving her to a more stable area of that hospital or to a different one. 

When I left her, she was crying and saying she didn't want to be there and she didn't want to put me through all of this. I also couldn't stop crying which I don't think helped at all. 

So my question is, did I do the right thing? And what do I do next? I'm not a counselor or anything, but I do have some experience helping people with similar issues and I suffer from some of the same things myself. I love her and want to do whatever I can.

384,"I like her a lot. Originally we met on a hiking trip. Long story short, we had a great time and got to know each other pretty well. Then I organized another hiking trip and that went well for a little while until she started feeling sick. She asked me to walk her to the parking lot so she can order a Lyft home. That's when I started to really like her.

A few days later, she starts a short convo on snap and I do my best to show interest. She likes the idea of us hanging out as friends during the Summer.

Later we decided to meet up at her place (with one of my friends). My friend had to go home and I ended up staying the night at her place (I don't want to get into details, but there were drugs involved). So for several hours it was just her telling me her entire life story (on a stimulant, I was on an edible). She definitely showed signs that she liked me and I became really interested in her. But I've never asked a girl out before so I didn't know what to say.

About a week goes by and I work the courage to ask her on snap if she likes me. She tells me she likes me ""a bit"" and then proceeds to explain why. She tells me we have a lot in common. Then I tell her I'm open minded to start something and that she can think about it. She left me on open. It's been several days and I can't get her out of my head. What should I do?",26Jun2019,1
385,"I have lived in the same apartment for going on 4 years now and plan to be there at least a few more. We have had the same carpet since we moved in and its looking dingy, even though we've cleaned it. I also have 2 cats and they have torn up 2 spots under the bedroom and bathroom door about 6 inches long each. 

I have noticed that most apartments are getting this floating wood vinyl flooring when people turnover, and I would really like to have that instead. 

We have already had rent increase twice, first year for $15, third year for $30. I also have paid $800 in non-refundable pet deposits as well as an extra $30 per month for both of my cats as a fee. Would it be appropriate for me to ask for this flooring replacement and negotiate to not have an increase in my rent?

The apartment is 735 square feet and probably over 500 of it is the carpet (kitchen and bathroom are tile.) I know for sure that they get deals on things they use in the apartment, like contractors. We have also always tried to take care of repairs/replacements ourselves when possible so I feel like we are in a good place to negotiate.",26Jun2019,6
386,"My friend and I realized we've been friends now for 20 years. I suggested we do something big to celebrate and offered to pay for our plane and hotel tickets to the Bahamas with my bonus money because I knew she might not be able to afford it if we split the bill since she's paying her way through school. I've never been outside the U.S. and it was the week of my birthday, so I was willing to pay to have this experience together.

It turns out my friend needed to get her passport updated so we didn't want to get caught in a situation where her passport didn't come arrive in time for the 1 week she has off between semesters. I suggested we go to the U.S Virgin Islands as an alternate to that. She agreed at first and got dates that could be approved with her work.

After doing the legwork of the research to get ideal plane/hotel tickets ready to buy, I sent it to her and asked if it looked all good before I hit confirm. She then said she's concerned about it being hurricane season and would rather go somewhere else. She quickly sent me 3 alternate destinations that don't interest me as much to front the money for.

I understand her concerns but am frustrated to now be on option 3 and still having to pay/do all the cost based research over again for places I'm not as thrilled with. I feel like maybe I'm being selfish because the intent of the trip was supposed to commemorate the two of us. However, since I was paying for it, I felt more like I was gifting the destination of the trip to us.

387,"I have this toxic habit of not following through with my promises while also ignoring the same people I make these promises to when I can't fulfill them. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate these people or have anything against them, but sometimes, I just...bail out. I'll give a light example. While writing something for a client, I'd take a break. This break would become procrastination, and then the procrastination becomes neglect, and eventually I ignore them and become afraid to talk to them whenever they ask for updates, so I basically ghost them out of fear or shame.

 The worst part is, even when I know I'm wasting time at the expense of other people, I just keep on going. And when I feel like I can't actually do my promise, I lie about working on it, even when they urgently *urgently* need my assistance.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know why I do this, but I do it, and every time I do, I come off as an asshole, and I deserve it.

I was surprised and curious because he's always been staring at me weirdly ever since my boobs started to grow. I know it's a toxic behavior and I shouldn't have encouraged it. I don't want to bring it up and make it awkward - it won't happen again. Just needed to tell someone and maybe get some advice on this.,26Jun2019,1
390,"It was two days ago, late at night -- I guess in all reality it was like 36 or so hours ago. Police involved, took statements. I didn't have anything taken; maybe telling the guy I was in the military and standing my ground and remaining calm made him and his friend rethink the decision to rob or shoot me. Both guns were about a foot from my face, and it was one of the most surreal feelings I've ever felt.

Well, its over now. Maybe they live in my neighborhood -- I suspect they live a few buildings over in the apartment complex, but I was just outside late at night so there should be no reason for me to do that again. I am usually fairly disaffected by things, and even by this I have been calm. Lots of people think its time to move, but I refuse that idea; I'm too stubborn. 

However, inwardly, there is some... shift in my thinking. There's an anxiety that hangs over me now, and as I enter my neighborhood I am checking my surroundings, wondering if I'll see the gunmen again. Yet I know realistically, even if I did -- what? They going to shoot me in broad daylight? I was more frustrated than afraid, then and now, hating that sense of powerlessness, the idea that my fate was beyond my own control in the hands of some idiot with a gun.  Even when I try to watch a show, play a game, something -- there's this weird feeling, this distance to it. Like a nagging thought that I can't place, but it tugs at me.

I think its stupid to feel any stress or concern over this. So why does it hang over me so?",26Jun2019,67

392,"So, I had this interview on Friday and it went pretty well. It was not too formal, more like a casual conversation about the job and my experience. At the end she said she’d text me on Monday and let know when we can start the training. On Monday I’ve been waiting almost till the end of working day and eventually texted her myself asking about her decision. She said “yes, I want to see you at the training, I’ll let you know tomorrow when you should come”. Again, I didn’t hear from her nor yesterday, neither today. I was so excited to get this job since the place is nice and the schedule fits perfectly with my current part-time job.

395,"Hi guys first time posting on this sub and tbh never thought I would but I now find myself in a position that I've never been in. [Very long, tldr at the bottom]

So bit of backstory, my parents met each other through their parents. My dad started out very poor and never got support from his family. My mum was also from a poor background. When they met my Dad really wanted to start his own business so my mum would work extra hard and ask for money from her family to help my Dad's dream come true. Fast forward to today and we live a comfortable life thanks to their hard work (which I am eternally grateful).


Recently my parents hired a middle aged lady [50ish] to work at their company and my Dad for some reason caught interest and cheated [to what extent, i'm not sure]. My mum caught wind and after being tipped off + checking his phone, confronted him. He denied it even though everyone in the family (myself [22] and my sister[25]) knew it was true. 

My sister and I's first thought was for my mum to leave him, but it pains me to say that my mum loves my dad and she still cares so much about him even after all this. My mum is trying her best to make it work (cook good food, try to make conversation, clean more, etc on top of running a company). Additionally, myself and my sister are trying to create a more family-esque feeling around the home. This has kinda helped however my mums informed us that when they're at work, he bullies her and blames her for things that are out of anyones control. It seems to me like he really wants to break it off so that he can do his own thing. 

Also, although the lady they fired is no longer at work, it's highly likely they still see each other. 

At this point it feels like my dad is only staying out of obligation to my sister and I, however it hasn't stopped his shitty behaviour and treatment of my mum. 

The advice i'm seeking is:
1) should I confront my dad and ask him how tf he could do this to someone who gave her lifes work to build a business together. Also ask him if he realises the pain he is causing her (and us)? (maybe this will change him? [I doubt it])

2) How can I try to convince her that divorce is a very real option given my scumbag dad is showing no signs of making things better? Inside I feel as though it may be best for them to divorce, but because my mum has devoted all her time and energy to this business, she has no close friends and no hobbies at all. I'm scared that my sister and I cannot give her enough time and company to help her through this time. Also she can't tell her family (who live in another state) because she feels it'll break their hearts and worry them (they're 50+ years old and have their own issues). 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Please lmk if I missed any info that may help with the understanding of this issue. I honestly am very lost and feel so helpless and it pains me so much to see my mum cry and not be able to do anything. It's gotten to the point where I worry about this during work/study. I have a good relationship with my dad but have always been closer to my mum since I saw her the most growing up. 

tldr;

Dad cheated and is still cheating on my mum after she devoted her life to helping him fund + setup a business. He's been confronted but treats my mum poorly (in effort to force her to divorce?). Mum still loves him regardless and is trying for the best. Need any sort of advice or guidance or anything at this point idk :/ if u read up to this point i love you and thanks for listening to me complain about my life since it feels good to be able to tell someone.",26Jun2019,1
396,I'm dropped out college. Now I'm at home since almost 1 year. I don't have any friend. I can't go get a job because I'm preparing for college again. And I'm bored at home right now. I don't know what to do. Any advice?,26Jun2019,1
397,"My wife is from Tokyo originally. We met here in the US as it was always her dream to come here and learn English, so she has been here for about ten years already. However, her father died a few years ago and she is missing home. Her mom who is now alone, her friends, etc.

She is not forcing me into anything. I am quite adventurous myself (lived in abroad in my early 20's) and have visited Japan with her three times now and am not opposed to it.

My worry is this- keeping a good job. She has promised that if I go back with her she will get a good job utilizing her bilingual abilities which is great, but I am currently in sales here in the US and love it. I would not want to change careers. However, Japanese is not easy to learn as you may imagine lol. Feel free to tell me if I am being soft here, but I had a tutor and was learning with my wife an hour a night a few years ago until out daughter was born and my job started getting more intense. To be honest by the time I get home from the office and play with my daughter, I am wiped and I have dropped off recently.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? I have a very well-paying job here in the US and a young daughter so I can't exactly feel great about moving to Tokyo with no plan. I am saving as much as I can which is great, and I do want my wife to be able to go home...and we both agree it would be a great place for our daughter to grow up. 

We are not rushing things- our daughter is only 1 and a half, but my wife would like her to start kindergarten there. Tell it to me straight- is this plan disastrous? Has anyone here ever heard of someone moving to another country and being able to get a job and if so, where do they start? And I think I know this answer...but do I just need to suck it up and learn Japanese?

Thanks to anyone that read this whole thing !!",26Jun2019,3

400,"I volunteer for a charity that’s mainly run online and I spend most of my waking hours sending messages to coordinate things for this group. There’s a bunch of us that became friends (probably through sheer frequency of contact) and we’d go out for drinks together etc. 

One of the ladies within the org lives near my work and we caught up a few times and were friends.  Out of nowhere her messages to me stopped and even in group chats she was ignoring my messages. If I spoke to her directly I’d get one word answers.  I asked her if I’d offended her somehow and she changed the subject.  Occasionally I sent messages just saying “hey how’s it going?” to start a conversation but got nowhere.  Finally I snapped and sent a message asking her what her problem with me was.  She never replied but a week after that I got a call from the guy who runs the org to tell me that there’s nothing wrong and she’s not angry at me and she didn’t reply because she didn’t know what to say given she’s already told me several times there’s nothing wrong (I checked our message history and that’s just not true).  I nod and smile and leave it alone because it’s not worth it. 

The next day I clicked in the wrong spot on my damn computer screen and unfriended her on fb. I honestly didn’t mean to, but I know how this looks.  Another person I deal with exploded at me and said that she doesn’t see what the other lady has done wrong and I’m just targeting her and maybe I should see someone about my mental health. 

She also said I’m great at what I do and she hopes we can move forward.  


Honestly I don’t know if maybe it’s just time to move on and find a new organisation to help. It doesn’t feel like it’s salvageable at this point.  

Is there something I’m missing? A way to save this situation?  Is it even worth saving with people like that?  Volunteering isn’t meant to make you feel like this right?",26Jun2019,1
401,"So I'm new here but I'm truly at a point where I need some advice. 

I'm currently in the process of leaving/loosing my job (position is being terminated by end of year so I'm looking to make a move now vs wait due to no severance). 

I have 2 job offers and honestly am having a hard time comparing the 2 and really need some advice as my wife and I are both just shrugging.

Both jobs are basically the same functions but here are the differences:

Job 1 - make 50k/year but get PHENOMENAL benefits all that are from day 1 (4 weeks vacation at start and it grows from there, 401k w/10% match, free higher ed tuition for me, flexible work hours, great health insurance) commute is about 20 mins each way. Work from home available 1/week. Sort of industry specific but most people stay here until retirement.

Job 2- make 95k/year (plus bonus that on average would be over 5k) start with no vacation but accumulate 1 week after a year and then cap out at 3 after 3 years. Health Insurance is meh, can't join it for 3 months and would just get it through my wife's work as hers I cheaper/better. 401k after 1 year with 3% match. Commute is 1 hour each way. 3 days/month travel and rigid office hours. No remote work unless traveling. Job would translate VERY well beyond Industry and would set me up very well for any future moves.


What do I do? Money isn't everything but that's a BIG difference both in pay and benefits....

Tldr: take more money with less benefits and longer commute or take less money but amazing benefits and work/life balance?",26Jun2019,1

403,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.
Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/
Edit: what I’m saying is to people like this because I’m ugly it means I’m automatically stupid and incompetent and even getting a bar job is as I did a huge surprise as I’m too ugly for that line of work to her, that’s how I took the multiple repeated ‘well done’.

405,"My \[F,23\] partner \[M,25\] and I live together, and we moved specifically to be close to his boss. He's a personal assistant to the Bossman which includes being a personal driver, so my partner wanted to be super close to his boss for those early morning start times. And there are plenty of early morning start times! His start time is different every day, just based on the schedule of Bossman

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, my partner has been significantly late to work at least 4 times this month, and I've had to drive him to work in a panic. He doesn't wake up with his alarms (neither do I but I work until 4 am so i'm passed out). I feel like he's going to lose his job. And every time I drop him off, I  have this worry that I'll have to turn around to pick him up again because he'll message me that he just got fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

And my partner has been trying to find the right time to ask for a raise (he gets paid such a low amount, that for the 6 months that he's had this job, he's been dipping into savings to pay for rent and expenses every single month). But he keeps coming late, so obviously that conversation never happens and we're stuck dipping into his savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't blame bossman for firing my partner at this point. It's completely unacceptable to be late so often. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to help him get up in the mornings when he's usually getting up mere hours after I fall asleep. But also, he's a grown ass man, why can't he do the responsible and reliable thing and get to work on time? The stress of him being fired is so high right now. We NEED two incomes to keep paying rent and expenses, and I feel like he's stopped taking that financial responsibility seriously.

408,"Hello All,

On mobile, please forgive my grammar and formatting. on tut

TLDR: My wife applied for a new job, her current manager told the potential employer that she wasn't a good employee so he could get his friend hired on instead.

Players in this game:

My Wife
Manager (her current manager and jerk)
Potential Employer (Friends with Manager)
Buddy (Manager's friend)
Sister (My Wife's sister)
Sister's Husband (My Wife's Sister's Husband)

For context, My Wife is currently looking for a new job that can offer her hours that coincide with my schedule. She had recently had an interview with Potential Employer and it went really well, but when she called about a follow up he was brief with her and just kind of shut her down. OK, no worries, maybe they found someone else. Plenty of fish in the sea and all that.

That is until yesterday, when My Wife called me and was upset because she had just gone to lunch with her sister and she had learned some troubling news. My Wife, her Sister, and her Sister's Husband all worked for the same company but her Sister and her Sister's Husband left to pursue other careers. Manager was still friendly towards Sister's Husband and revealed to him that he got a call from his friend Potential Employer about My Wife. Manager told Sister's Husband that he was shocked to receive the call because he had been trying to get his Buddy that exact same job. So he told Potential Employer that My Wife wouldnt be a good choice in hopes that his Buddy would be hired instead. Manager is also trying to get hired on at Potential Employer's company as well.

Naturally, Sister's Husband told Sister who told My Wife. Now we are just confused and hurt that Manager would stoop so low just to give his Buddy a better chance. My Wife has been nothing but a star employee. Always early, first to cover a shift, doesn't cut corners, extremely patient and personable with customers.

I need some advice on coping mechanisms for my triglomania. I've had it for a while and only been diagnosed by a doctor pretty recently (about a month ago). Haven't tried therapy yet as I think it should probably be a last resort, so Reddit it is. If you don't know what triglomania is (sorry if I'm spelling it wrong) it's absent-minded pulling at the hair, in my case eyebrow and eyelashes. It's an absent-minded thing, but it flared up a bit around periods where I feel stressed and that can cause some ingrowth and it takes a while to grow back. I rarely have good periods, and it's badly impacted my eyebrows. Please, can anyone help me with some tips to stop this pulling?

I suppose I’m personally more lenient when it comes to noise, but that’s not the point.

All of our large furniture is in place, and we’re nearly finished with placing all the smaller items and cleaning the apartment to our liking (e.g. the washer/dryer room and the baseboards were a bit gross, so it required moving larger appliances around for the moment). I guess I was a bit peeved because the encounter was so soon after we’d finished moving everything in; is it unreasonable to assume that moving in will generate a lot of noise for a few days?

It was amazing, we got along so well, the physical, mental attraction was on fire. And then after a month or two he started to take steps backwards. Which I get, he wasn’t ready to be in another relationship. We talked about it and I decided we should take a break. It was hurting me seeing him backing away I figured this was the best option. Now it’s two months later and when we are in person it’s like nothing happened. We enjoy each others presence, play video games together and just have an amazing time. But when we are apart, he hardly texts me at all and when he does, it’s hardly enough to even continue the conversation and then he stops talking to me for about 4-5 hours. It makes me feel used, unappreciated, like I was just a fling and now he’s bored and wants to move on. He claims he just wants time alone for awhile to not have to worry about someone else all the time. But it hurts me, a lot. It makes me want to just cut him out of my life so that my heart stops feeling like it’s being crushed everyday. Am I right to feel this way? Whenever I talk to him about it he just apologizes and that’s it. Sometimes I feel like I’m being crazy and irrational.. Should I just shut him out and forget about him for awhile?

422,"So on Monday I decided to sit outside for a while.
I put on sunscreen because it's hot and sunny and I'm fairly white. After some time I decided to put on some more on my shoulders because past years they were the places that got burned more easily(I try not to get burned, but I guess it happens sometimes.)

After a while I fell asleep for some time and I guess this was my mistake. Nearing the evening (I went inside after falling asleep) my stomach and chest area started getting really red, not my shoulders. My legs and feet might be a little burned but they're looking ok by now(you can the difference from where my shorts were but that would've been the same with a tan)

It's just really stressing me out that my chest and stomach are still this red and hurt. My skin is fairly sensitive so wearing a t shirt doesn't feel nice.

There is a HUGE contrast of white/red near my shoulders/chest, which looks ugly. I hate looking in the mirror even more now.

I've not gone in the pool again (chlorine dries out I think), i've been staying out of the sun, taking cool/cold showers, drinking lots of water and applying after sun multiple times a day(some kind of moisturizer).

But it's now Wednesday and it still looks really red and when you touch it, it becomes white and then back to red.

How do I fix the really big contrast between my red and white skin?(I'd rather not use make up of some sorts)
How do I get the red to go away sooner?

Im a f20 and at the start of the year, I had to face my long-awaited court trial where for a year I had to wait and consistently talk and think about the experience of me being sexually assaulted. In the end, I lost. I was crushed. I was living my best life.  I was in the last year of my degree, a great relationship, great job and great friends. But yet I fell into rippling depression,  anxiety, insomnia and PTSD. I stopped going to university completely the one I handed in i did receive an A yay. I quit my job over text message and I feel like i fucked up my frienships, and relationships.

But i have the opportunity to either move away with my partner in an isolated town with his family and chill. but this would be away from my friends and family. this would be rent free and we don't have to work. this would be for a few months. We have been dating for about 5 years but have been ustable.

or move away with my good friend who i have known for afew good months. shes great but i have to good and pay rent. friends and family are far away, as this will be a new county. But we will have fun.

So what do u think - i do plan on going back if cna be next year.",26Jun2019,1

 As a result from her situation, she gets neck contractures and attends therapy beacuse she undergoes a lot of stress. She also drinks beer frequently and seeks to lose weight but does not moderate her diet and drinking habits. My maternal grandparents push her a lot yo find a job and don't realize this worsens her situation. S
My dad recently became an entrepreneur as the company he worked for closed the business. He suffers from overweight as he suffers from my mom's situation and other kind of stresses such as earning money to feed our family and dealing with customers. He says eating is his wat out of pain and whenever I try to tell him to moderate himself and try to start a diet, he won't listen. He weighs over 100kg and he is 1.80m tall.
My family isn't really poor and we don't have serious economic problems, but I'm worried my mom and dad's situation will lead to some kind of a problem like this. Not to mention their physical and mental well being are important for me, but there seems to be no way for them to listen to me.

I don't have the strongest will power, and sometimes I use alcohol to avoid thinking about my emotions. It helps me process sometimes.

 I've decided to come up with a list of parameters I want to stay within. When I feel like I'm close to crossing one of these lines, is when I've got to stop. What are some things that you think constitute a drinking problem?

429,"This whole thing is kind of complicated or maybe I’m just making it complicated, so I feel like I have to explain the nature of our friendship before I get to the juicy part I guess. To me it’s just a really shitty situation.

I have two close friends B and H. I would say we’re best friends but we don’t use that kind of language cuz were too manly I suppose. B and I go to the same college while H goes to an equally close Uni i.e. same city. The three of us have been friends for years and last year was our first year in college. 

1st semester went relatively fine except toward the end when H started to have less and less time to hang out. We don’t hang out as much as other friends do and we’re not too great in communication but we stay in contact through Snapchat and would play together once in a while on Xbox. By the end of the semester we stopped hanging out for about a month because of finals and H also took a class during winter break, him taking that class wasn’t weird because he is sometimes an overachiever and just does better in school than B and I. We finally managed to get him to hang out with us in the beginning of January, we went camping and it was actually pretty fun getting high in the middle of the night and walking the beach like a bunch of idiots. 

We hung out once more but then stopped when classes started because H said he wanted to focus on school and that he probably wouldn’t be able to hang out at all for the semester, this pissed us off because he’s our best friend and we already only hung out like once a week MAXIMUM. We never really got over that but ultimately could do nothing about it so we sucked it up and gave him his space. B and I started to hang out more just the two of us and hung out at school between classes and during our one shared class. Even though we’ve spent a lot of time together I’ve always been closer with H than I have with B (also important later on). B and I realized that H had started to respond very slowly back to us until eventually he just stopped. At first I was pissed because who does that to their closest friends but I thought maybe he was pissed because we gave him a hard time over the whole not hangin out part, so I asked some friends in common to check up on him and it appeared that he was replying to some of them so basically my experiment was inconclusive. 

Before he cut ties with us he was already being hard to reach and we asked him about it and he said he had turned off the notifications on his phone because he was trying to use it less. So that meant that once he stopped responding to us we literally had no way of contacting him. He never replied to our texts calls or even opened our snaps. One time I sent him a text saying that if he kept on ignoring us/ not replying I would have to go to his house and check up on him that way. This was the one time he replied saying that he was just trying to use his phone less and that I shouldn’t worry. Well I obviously wasn’t worried when he didn’t respond for the next the three months so that was cool, I really have to emphasize that we tried at least 3 times a week to contact him either by phone call or anything else. Not once did he respond, he would open our snaps after a while but that’s as much confirmation we had that he wasn’t off in a hospital being a vegetable. B and I kept hanging out although it wasn’t as fun as when the three of us would hang. The semester ended and we were both too pissed to wanna message him without him messaging us first, even though we would still call him every so often. B decided that he wanted to join the marines and that left me feeling kind of upset at the though of losing my other best friend and basically friendless since the three of us had been doing our own thing for a while now and had lost most of our contact with our old group of friends. I also felt very upset at H since if he kept ghosting us he would actually lose the last few weeks we had with B. This made me realize how truly unfair it is for him to treat us like that, the whole time I was worried about his lack of communication leading to us not knowing about any possible harmful situation he could be in but at that moment I realized that he also didn’t care about us enough to check if WE were ok. So I wrote a sort of angry letter/text and saved it in hopes of being able to send it to him. As B’s departure day came closer I was ready to send my text to H and suddenly B’s departure date was moved till later nearly 4 months. The anger at H for not knowing about B’s life changing decision lingered in the back of my head for days. Three days ago I received the unfortunate news that one of my childhood best friends ( we moved a lot) had been in a bike accident and was in a coma and later died, this was very upsetting to me as expected but I kept my emotions to myself like always. I feel like this whole thing is written so crudely and I don’t mean to sound insensitive but we had lost contact a long time ago and he was mostly just a really fond childhood memory so although I still feel a crushing feeling inside it’s not as bad as it can be so I mourned in my own special way and moved on. His death made me reflect on my relationship with my friends and I really wish this next part was different but what I felt was anger again specifically at H for making us drift apart.  

Finally 7 hours ago I decided to send him a message and lo and behold he actually responded

I’m a pretty level headed guy and although I said I was mad earlier on I really only feel it, I don’t actually show it much, but this time it was different, idk if it didn’t sound like much to you but for me a whole semester without really seeing and barely talking to my friend and being ghosted for three damn months really had me pissed off. This is what I wanted to send him and still kind of do.

***Ok seriously wtf is wrong with you we’re your best friends and ur seriously gonna refuse to hang out or even see each other for a whole damn semester, no one... absolutely no one is so occupied with school that they have to ghost their closest friends for that long, even so we begrudgingly let you have ur space and time, we left you alone for spring break we left you alone for anytime we had vacations or holidays still tho after school has been out for weeks now u don’t even contact us, let us know ur ok, give us ur same crap excuse? Na. I wasn’t even gonna say anything I was just gonna let u go oblivious to the things going on in ur friends lives. So here’s a short update, Brandin was a week, literally a god damn week away from leaving and joining the army, he’s still joining but in a couple months. U would have had no idea that ur best friend was fucking leaving for good possibly never seeing him again but thank god u barricaded urself in ur house all year and avoided us cuz it would have totally ruined ur career to talk to us over the phone for a half hour.***

***If this is ur way of trying to say u don’t want friends, just say that it’s a lot easier for everyone.*** 

I got as far as putting it into the type bar but not actually pressing send, I though about it and decided to give H one last chance. I sent [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/PPzrIws/comment/1672195287) with the intention of sending my original one\^ after it, had he not responded.

[This](https://imgur.com/gallery/ROhjd6k) is the majority of the texts I sent while being ghosted, dates really tell a story. 

While B and I were trying to get in contact with him we would occasionally ask the other if there had been any updates/replies, obviously we just stopped asking after a while. So after this convo happened I let B know that he finally responded and sent him the screen caps I also sent him the unsent txt letting him know that that is what I was originally gonna send H. B was pretty pissed, as was I. He got so mad that he called H on the spot and H actually responded and B told him off (which I disprove of) and said basically what I wanted to say off the bat. B told H that he was officially cutting off ties with him and that he shouldn’t bother trying to message him at all, while B was telling me this over the phone I was shocked that he would actually do this, I was pissed but I still felt like there could of been some redemption for H, apparently B did not. They both yelled at each other and ended things pretty badly. Apparently H said that he had been failing all his classes (possibly an exaggeration by B) and that that is why he had been ghosting us. At this point I had so many mixed emotions that I didn’t know quite what to say, so I finished up the conversation and told B that we would talk in person tomorrow. 

I don’t know how to feel rn I feel like I may have contributed to the downfall of their friendship I also feel like my reactions were justified. I feel like to other people this must paint me in such a bad way. Idk what to do I feel like I can fix this by somehow talking to H and telling him why I felt the way I did. Maybe I am in the right and too emotional to think straight, or maybe I’m wrong and I’m such an asshole and can’t really see it myself. Sorry if this is too long, I’m sure it is, and if my emotions seem to change throughout the post this just happened and I’m still processing it also I started this post around 1 am and now it’s almost 6 am so I’m a lil tired and stressed so gn I guess. maybe ill stay up tonight to answer any responses I get, lmk if u need me to clarify something or forgot to mention something.",26Jun2019,2

434,"Hey thanks for taking the time to read this, as the title states im trying to out forward a case to my wife that its our families best interest that i quit my job/look for part time flexible work.


Heres the back ground.

My wife is a nurse who has recently received a promotion to a specifc role on a team, its her dream role and she works damn hard and deserves it and more if im honest.

She is under a lot of pressure with her job and in this role she is also having to pass exams as part of the training. Her shifts start at either 7 am till 7pm or 7pm till 7am.

I work full time 5 days a week 8-5 and on weekends for overtime. Ive only recently passed my driving test and we have the one car between us.

We have 2 boys one is nearing school age and will start in September, the other is at nursery, the eldest will have to go to a before school club but cannot go before 8, my youngest cannot go to nursery before 7.

I spend every weekend bar the odd shift, with the boys while she sleeps off her night shifts. We have no reliable family to give us a break or to offer a chance of looking after the boys so we can get a break. My work is much less paid than hers and is physically turing and is often mentally draining. 

My wife basicly does everything's, bills, sorting out our home, and any decisions regarding the children's schooling. My eldest has a big list of food allergies which is a lot or pressure on us all, never mind my boy, my wife being the health professional is on top of it and i am up to date on thints through her.

Once my boy starts school in September, i will need to find a job that is flexible to these times but ive spent 2 years looking and cannot find a role in which the childcare can be covered for the boys, its roughly £100 a day, sometimes a full week costing us more than my weekly wage.

3 times a week i walk my boys 2.5 miles to thier nursery at 6:30 a.m before work soni can get a lift in to work when my wife is working. This is tiring aswell getting them ready and out the door to walk that distance at that time of the morning is stressful as hell. 

We earn between us and on her wage alone too much to receive any benefits from the government. We can live on her wage, or be slightly worse off money wise now if i get part time work.

Because of this our relationship is basically non existant, we argue often though we are trying to work things out but now and again we fall out.

I am trying to take some strain of her, but it is a full time job alone looking after my boys, if anyone can offer advice or pros or cons towards my case of becoming a full time dad i woupd greatly appreciate it, thank you for your time.",26Jun2019,1

Mind isn't so great these days, so this may be a bit of a bother to read.   


Stuff to get out of the way: 	

\--- Ended up getting in an accident on the way to work a few years ago. Through that employer, I received FMLA benefits for 6 months and then long term disability benefits. Benefits were conditional, and I had to keep going to the doctors every month or so to say “Hey, I'm not fine.” Wreck ended up causing some damage to stomach internals causing a variety of issues I still deal with today, but it was estimated at 3-6 months recovery by the surgeon. 6 months after the wreck, I attempt to return to work due to FMLA benefits expiring (I'd get fired otherwise), but I can't last the entire day due to pain. Wasn't healed enough then. So I start collecting long term disability benefits. I apply for SSDI or whatever it's called, and get denied. State is Texas.  	

\--- Due to a slew of issues (not getting paid consistently, not being able to afford COBRA, COBRA denying my appeal, etc) I ended up losing insurance when the FMLA benefits disappeared. I continued seeing my family physician for the following year and three months, reporting in I still had issues and the physician reporting it to the disability company. Lack of insurance meant there was no pain clinic, specialists, etc. In March, this physician retires at the age of 91. This is significant because said physician was old school, and kept all records on paper (no digital records of any kind). Upon his retirement, my medical chart is essentially lost and I have to start over with a blank slate with a new physician. 	

\--- New physician visit comes around April. I explain everything, he listens, but it doesn't go smoothly. Lack of supporting evidence, no prior medical record, etc. I assume I'm taken as a random just seeking disability benefits, despite the fact I had them at that time and was at risk of losing them due to requiring a physician to support my claim. Second visit comes along a month later, and physician essentially says I'm perfectly health and I should go find a job instead of wasting his time seeking benefits. End of May I lose my benefits due to lack of supporting physician statement. June, I try a different doctor, but the appointment starts off badly and gets progressively worse (low income clinic, doctor wasn't listening to anything I had to say, when I take time to process a response he gets annoyed and moves on, etc), so I leave half way through appointment in anger (not the best decision, I admit).    

\--- Since the wreck, I've been dealing with more or less constant discomfort / pain. If I'm standing too long my back hurts and it gets to crippling levels where I don't want to move at all. My hip hurts moderately if I'm sitting wrong, upright, etc as well as if I've been too active and gets worse from there. Then there's my stomach, which is more or less always annoying me and increasing in pain depending on what I'm doing. New physician sent me to a general surgeon, who ordered an MRI of my stomach, which basically came back clean – suggested it was nerve damage. Doesn't do me any good for my claim. I more or less spend most of my days on the couch, and whatever tasks are needed to be done I spread them out with breaks as needed. Throw in inability to control bladder very well and digestion distress or whatever and it makes for an unpleasant existence. 

\--- Sometime after the wreck I started having neuro problems as well. Mainly issues with thinking/processing, carrying on conversations, constant headaches, etc. I'm aware of these issues, and it frustrates me to no end because I know it wasn't like this before. Describing it isn't easy. Best examples I can give is if I want to cook hamburger helper, I'll have to read the box several times to process what the first sentence says, then check it another several times while I'm trying to complete the first step. It continues the same way for just about most tasks. Where as I used to do programming with SourceMod, now I can't even get through the introductory of a Java language class. Given the ability to write things down and revise several times, like this post, I can generally get thoughts across. 

  
So what do I need advice on: 	

\--- I have enough savings to live off of for about two more months. Combined with girlfriend's income, possibly three but that's stretching it. I could likely get another three months out of whatever retirement my previous employers had set aside. Obviously I'd like to not reach that level of desperation, because if that's the case, I'd rather set aside as much funding as possible for the girlfriend instead of dragging her down with me.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing differently, as I'm not getting anywhere currently. 

\--- Obviously if you're this far into the post, mental health isn't the greatest. I've accepted the lemons life dished to me in the form of a flying 80mph pickup, and have more or less given up after all these issues arose with new physician because I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know who I'm supposed to talk to to try and get things back on track before I'm unable to correct them. My current insurance is a whatever one that only allows certain doctors in network, the term escapes me, so that's partially causing issues but I can't change it until next year. I've gotten by this long by just going with the flow, and don't remember most of it.

\--- Physically, I don't think I'd be able to handle working in my current condition. Job experience is limited to maintenance supervisory and corrections, so not a lot to pull from. Any minimum wage job that I land that requires standing for too long is out, as that level of pain I can't tolerate. Mentally, aside from the social difficulties I face now with processing conversation / thoughts, I could probably do something if the employer was willing to work with me. But then the whole why take someone damaged when there's a perfectly healthy person out there they can use instead. I don't exactly have a disabled sticker or whatever the official form of documentation is. That was all conditional through employer and ended in June. I'm not sure how I'd even convey this to a prospective employer, if such a job even came up. 

\--- At this point I'm just at a complete loss. My new physician wants me to see a neurologist, but won't do the referral. I don't really want to see said physician until a neurologist because I don't have anything new and I suspect it'll just be more of what I've already experienced. If I don't have anything new, then I don't have supporting evidence, then I can't file an appeal to get benefits back. I just need help being pointed in the right direction, I don't know how else to phrase it.",26Jun2019,1

449,"So as the title says I'm turning 20 in September and I'm really bummed out about it. As stupid as it sounds I feel ""old"", It feels like my youth is over and I just feel like I've wasted so much of it, so much of life that I'm not going to get back. I had to delay going to University for a whole year to this September because of anxiety and depression and I feel horrible about that too, at one point I was supposed to be finishing school a year early and now I'm finishing a year late which just honestly, really, sucks.   


I'm trying to stay positive about everything but with such a milestone looming over me I find it really difficult. It's a constant reminder of, and a testament to, my lack of progress and achievement in life these past few years and it just crushes me a little.  


Does that feeling ever go away? the feeling of having wasted time and of being inadequate? Do you just get to a point where you don't care anymore? I'd love to just not give a shit about anything but sometimes It feels like feeling bad about the past and past mistakes is an automatic response for me

451,"I'm 22M. I spent my past 2 years in conscripted army service thinking what I really wanted to pursue when I finish my service. Feeling super determined I should and I really want to do something related to what I love, piano, I decided to not go to university and not further my IT studies (IT was originally what I pursued as diploma) (since I knew I had no interest in IT).  


After a series of 3 interviews, today I was so close to signing the contract with a company I really wanted, but I failed a final series of a few tests. I realized myself I wasn't good enough to coach people, even when I always thought I was. I realized I lacked interpersonal relationship skills, professionalism, I am very ""green"" and new to the working world. I realized I can't really contribute to the company if I'm not at that required level yet.  


And then I also realized, this means any other similar jobs (piano coach/teacher), I really am not qualified, I see where I'm lacking after being tested and told of my flaws by the boss (employer). I started thinking maybe this is not for me. Then what is? I know I love music and piano, and I can't think of any career paths that I can strive for which I have interest and/or passion in too. There might be one out there, but right now I'm so lost.  


I'm unemployed, I can't see what I want to pursue now that I've failed in my pursuit of a piano teacher. I also have no university placings to work on. I feel like I'm left behind as a member of society. What can I do to better my situation?

452,"I don’t post on here much, so I apologize in advance if this post becomes too lengthy or jumbled. Please bear with me. To begin, a little background might help...

I’m 36, married with three kids. I live near Denver, Co. I’ve been working in the restaurant industry for 20 years. I HATE it. I recently finished my course work for my Bachelors in Communications (though I do still owe the school money so I can’t yet get my official transcripts- I am on a payment plan). I consider myself a solid writer and am exploding with creativity (it often keeps me up at night). I want nothing more than to find something I enjoy doing after so many years of hating my job. I know many people aren’t happy with how they make their money, but I just feel I have so much more to offer than flipping burgers and counting inventory. 

Aside from my Bachelors degree, I do have some different “skills”. I love to write and have written a fictional novel (not published) and am currently writing another. I am a musician. I have done my own fantasy football podcast and currently am also working on a standup comedy routine. I guess I’m a sort of jack of many trades, master of none type (though I’m pretty confident in my writing and can smash some drums). 

I mention these other “skills” because those areas are where my passions lie; writing, comedy, music, fantasy football. I want a job that I enjoy, one where I can use my creativity. I’ve tried getting into radio stations and different places, but everyone wants experience. So, I looked into internships but the paid ones are looking for students, of which I am no longer. I blame myself for not looking into internships during my last semester of schooling, but my family was in the process of moving and there was so much going on. I just didn’t think of it. I’ve tried many things but have only been able to get interviews with those schemey-type marketing companies. I feel lost, depressed and stuck. We are rapidly running out of our savings so something needs to happen quick. My last resort is a restaurant management position which I’m looking to avoid at all costs, considering where I ended up mentally after the last management position I held. I come to reddit searching advice, as I have completely run out of ideas. Thanks to all who weathered this ridiculously long rant, I cannot repay you for the time you spent reading it.",26Jun2019,1
453,"I'm so sick and tired of living at this point. I have 0 motivation for ANYTHING, absolutely nothing even excites me anymore, I have so much anxiety that I'm scared to even walk out of my house because I think the porch is ugly and I don't want people to see me walk out of there (I literally skipped the first class in school one time just because of this, I was too afraid to walk out of the door), I always think about stupid stuff that I did one time or in that particular day and I always think ""How could I have fucking done this?"" and cringe at myself for hours, even the smallest thing like making a bad joke. I went to a therapist one time to talk about this stuff but I couldn't even tell her all my problems, I just told her that I had trouble finding motivation to study and she told me all this stuff that was supposed to motivate me but it didn't, literally nothing does. I eventually opened up about problems that I have with my parents because of how badly they raised me and pretty much neglected me all my childhood without knowing it (they let me go unwashed for weeks, never made me study, always let me do whatever the fuck I wanted and here I am now, a fat, lazy piece of shit because they never controlled anything I did as a kid and they thought they were 'giving me freedom'). I hate every second that I'm alive and I hate looking at myself in the mirror every morning. All I do everyday is sit at my desk, watch Youtube and play World of Warcraft and Overwatch all fucking day because I have no friends to go out with, not even online friends to talk to. I'm alone and nobody cares about me except for my parents whom I despise for the way they treated me as a kid so they don't matter to me. I'm not good at anything, I have no talents and I know I'll never be good at anything because I never have any motivation to actually stick to something. I've been suicidal for a few years now, but I know I'll never be able to kill myself unless I get my hands on a gun, which is the only way I'd actually be able to kill myself without pussying out.

455,"Hi. I’m a 19F, I was at a concert last night with my brother (M23). On the bus to the concert we met a guy who was the same age as me. We talked a lot and seemed to get on well. Granted, no one has ever really expressed any romantic interest in me. I’d doubt he’d ever see me that way but still as I said I did really like him. 
Even if it never went that way, I do think he’d be nice to talk to as a friend y’know? 
I don’t really have any social media, my brother followed him on Instagram. Idk it was just all very awkward with my brother there I guess. 
The guy’s phone died last night so he couldn’t add me on snapchat himself. I was too shy to tell him what my user was with my brother there so I just let him leave. I’m genuinely not sure if he also felt awkward because of my brother’s presence or if he just didn’t wanna talk to me again...?

Anyways tldr: his snapchat is apparently listed on his ig page do I add him or just leave it be?  I know I’m overthinking thinking this. I’m just not sure what to do...? I know it’s not that deep. In one way I think I should just leave it. I don’t wanna come across as weird or make the guy uncomfortable either... so? I’m not sure. Hence why I’m here, would really appreciate some good advice as I don’t really know how to think about this situation. Thanks...!",26Jun2019,1
457,"So, needless to say I have had a pretty rocky relationship with my mother. At the age of 5, she got me to the hospital with my head wide open after one of her rage fits. I lied her for the subsequent 8 years and despised her in secret til it all blew out and we have both come a long way since then to try to have a friendly relationship. Friendly in the sense of actual friends, since I told my mother I do not want her to be my mother, as she did a bad job at it in the first go.


In the past three years, life has gone crazy, for sure. I went abroad to live for a while and ended up homeless for almost a month. The only reason I could eat and was not on the streets was because of charity because my mother had no money to send me and all my money was taken from me. When I came back, I discovered my mother had sent money, but she sent it to the woman that stole from me and made me homeless. Whenever I brought up the hardships I faced, she said she felt the worst during all of it.


This brings me to Monday. My mother spent over ten days traveling to different places and came back home with my father. I avoid my father at all costs because of his alcoholism. I got mad at my mother because she did not talk to me beforehand and she came up with a billion excuses for it. I eventually gave in and tried to be okay though not cheery, until at night my mother blew up on me. I was trying to check my blood exams on my laptop and she started yelling me to put the groceries away. I told her I would do it right after I checked my exam. She complained and yelled and eventually closed my laptop on my hand and tried to take it from me. I got it from her and put it carefully on the table. At this point, I was yelling, too, because I was scared.


My mother comes up on me and grabs both of my arms with all her strength. I tell her to let me go and eventually I get desperate and yell for my boyfriend to call the police while I am crying. My boyfriend was watching the whole thing, but he is a foreigner and did not know the police number, so he just stood there. My mother laughs and then dedicates herself to my left arm, leaving me two bruises, a big cut and a trail of smaller ones. She also grabbed my face, but most of the bruises went away over night with the exception of a small cut near my eye. After all of that, my mother and my father forced me to the kitchen and stopped my boyfriend from getting in. They mocked me while I cried and put the groceries away. At the end, I asked to be left alone in my room for a while. My mother had already calmed down and tried to say three times over that she was hurting more with the whole situation than I was. When she finally left I told my boyfriend we should go to his house.


Before going to my boyfriend's, my mother talked to me and cried. I had to comfort her because apparently she hurts more than I do. She told me to work on my attitude while I was away and made me promise I would go to her medical check ups with her on Friday (she is scared of her hepatitis). I accepted her apologies but I still have an uneasy feeling about her.  I do not know how to face life with her anymore and I know that talking will only lead to her victimising herself again.",26Jun2019,2

463,"Alright, so I currently have a job at a certain popular office supply store. I have been working there for about 2 weeks now, and I like it. It's pretty easy, my coworkers are cool, etc etc. The problem is, I just got a job offer from a manufacturing company I applied to about a month and a half ago. Now, this manufacturing job would be full time, which is what I really want to do, to make money, and it pays 3 dollars more per hour. However, it would mean much longer shifts and much harder work. I'm not opposed to this, in theory, but it is a consideration. 
Most of my problem is that for the office store, I am being trained in the copy print center, because a full time associate is leaving next week. However, I am still somehow considered part time, even though I was led to believe that there would be full time positions available. I feel morally wrong leaving now, when they have already spent time training me, but I'm not really getting too many hours, less than even some of the other part time associates, and I could make much, much more money for my savings by working at the manufacturing company.

469,"How do people balance hobbies versus things that they want to do to advance themselves? 

My issue is that I love gaming. I could game every night and work during the day, just barely make ends meet but be content. However, the other part of me wants to improve- go to the gym three times a week, work a side gig, advance my writing to turn it into a career, etc. 

I know a lot of it’s time management, but some of it is equally balanced fun activities that take about the same amount of time. For instance crocheting versus coloring. I enjoy coloring because it’s simple, it’s relaxing, and I can zone out doing it. I like crocheting because it’s challenging but repetitive, and I know long term I could sell some pieces on the side. I’ve sectioned off the last hour/hour and a half before bed for mom screen activities (including getting ready for bed and showering) but choosing between the two is hard. 

The same goes for my side gig (book reviews), and practicing writing. I know my side gig will get me a minimum $10 a review, which isn’t a lot when you factor in reading the book for a week and writing it out. But it’s guaranteed versus trying to write a story and maybe having it sell as an ebook online to bring in money further down the road. If I want to do anything else on the night I can only do one of these a night, but I feel like I lose progress on either when I don’t do it every day. 

On top of if I go to the gym, I can typically only do one more thing before bed- reviewing, writing, crocheting, etc. 

And then there’s gaming. I moved away from a lot of my friends so gaming is how we keep in touch. Doing all these things means a lot less time to talk to them, which makes me feel isolated. I can’t just game on the weekends because most Work hospitality and work weekends.

So, sorry if this isn't welcome here either, but if anyone can offer me any advice on how to proceed then that'd be appreciated. Copied and pasted the original post below. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where to start with this one, but I'll give you some context first. I'm using a throwaway because I've posted too much identifying information on main. I'm also going to use fake names because I'm paranoid and you'll see why in a second. This is also going to be long because these events have all happened over a decade plus.

I met my girlfriend Chloe in 2008 through her boyfriend at the time, James. I bonded with James over shared interests and similarities in our upbringing. We were both really into gaming and climbing, we both grew up Mormon and later left the church, etc.

I really liked James. We played video games or climbed together twice a week, checked in through text daily, and he introduced me to his friendship group, including Chloe. I'd just moved to town and I didn't have any other friends or family I was still in touch with so it meant a lot to me. The thing about leaving the church is that you're sometimes cut off by your family and friends who are still in the church and that was the case with me, so you tend to form pretty close connections with other ex-members as a result.

Anyway, when I initially met Chloe, I didn't think much of her. I just saw her as my best friends girlfriend and nothing more. She was really friendly, but so was everyone else in the group, a lot of them being ex-mormon. Chloe wasn't.

Around a year after meeting James, he showed up at my place in the middle of the night wasted, with no shoes or socks on, and a big scratch across his face. I know I'm talking a lot about the church but it's relevant; when you leave you suddenly have a lot of freedom to experiment and it isn't uncommon for ex members to develop drug or drink habits out of binging to make up for lost time or to rebel or whatever. James was absolutely not that kind of guy. He'd drink a beer or two when we were hanging out but he was the kind of guy who'd sit you down for a talk about moderation if you seemed like you were going down a dangerous path with substances. Not to be interfering but just to see if you were okay- he was just that kind of guy. He cared, and he was cautious. He always said alcohol made him sick anyway.

So to see him slurring his words, hardly able to stand up, looking like he'd been in a fight was really unusual and really out of character. I helped him inside and he told me he'd left Chloe's place because she'd been acting weird. I said he could sleep on my sofa, but before he could get settled, Chloe showed up. She was calm and sober, and she asked to come inside. I didn't think anything of it, so I let her in. The second she got inside she sprinted across the room and jumped over the sofa to land on James and she just started hammering her fists down against his chest. It was 0 to 100, she was calm and polite one minute, and completely feral the second she caught sight of him. I pulled her away and threatened to call the cops, and she instantly calmed down again, apologised, and left. It was surreal.

James said he was fine and after talking a little, we just went to sleep because he wasn't that coherent anyway. The next morning I really struggled to wake him up. He was extremely disorientated and didn't remember anything at all about the night before. I know we had a conversation about how much he'd had to drink and he said he'd only had one beer. I know I didn't believe him and we had a conversation about that. I'm pretty sure we talked about moderation and coming to talk to friends instead of turning to substances if we're struggling etc. But I know he insisted it was just one beer and I know how much I doubted that.

We also talked about Chloe and her assaulting him, but he told me that it wasn't what it looked like and he'd done something awful. I asked what he'd done but he didn't want to talk about it. He just insisted that he'd done something awful and she was justified in attacking him. I didn't necessarily agree, but I didn't push the issue. I wish I had.

Everything went back to normal after that, but Chloe became pretty cold towards me which made things uncomfortable. I still saw James, but I noticed he was more subdued in those last few months. At the end of 2010, I moved across the country. I'd been in an LDR for a while and wanted to be closer to my partner. I stayed in touch with James for a while mostly through social media but it wasn't as big as it was now. We text occasionally too, on birthdays and holidays, but eventually his texts stopped coming. I do remember feeling bad about it but it was just one of those things. Not every friendship from your teens-early twenties survives. I stayed in touch with two people from that town but no one mentioned James to me and I just assumed he'd gone on to do his own thing when his social media profile went inactive.

In late 2015/early 2016 I moved back to town when my relationship ended. Literally within my first week I ran into Chloe. She was a completely different person and she didn't seem cold towards me at all, she was really happy to see me, and honestly by then I'd forgotten most of the weird stuff. I asked if she was still with James and she told me he'd moved back to his parents year ago. We swapped numbers and arranged to meet up for a drink.

Shortly after, I caught up with my friends from the old group Chloe, James, and I had belonged to. I mentioned that I was going out for drinks with Chloe soon, and they were all shocked she was still in town. They'd not seen her for years, and assumed she'd left with James. They told me that one day James just upped and left. His apartment was empty and he'd just ghosted them all. No one had heard from him since, but someone had heard he'd gone back to his parents, and someone else had heard he'd moved to Europe to teach English as a foreign language or some shit. I thought it was weird, but not unbelievable.

When I went out for drinks with Chloe, I asked why she'd ghosted everyone, and she said they'd never been her friends, they were James, and when he went home, people just stopped inviting her places. She said if they didn't make the effort, she wasn't going to either. It sounded fair enough to me. Shortly after that, we ended up getting into a relationship. One on one it turns out we've got a lot in common and have the same sort of edgy sense of humour, music taste, etc. It's actually insane that I didn't notice how much we had in common before and I've been really happy with her since.

We moved to a new state this year and we're building a life together. We've got a dog and we've been talking about marriage, kids, the whole package. Until recently, I've honestly been seeing myself with this girl for the rest of my life.

But here's my problem. Chloe has always made sort of uncomfortable jokes. She's the type of girl to jokingly say stuff like *I've killed before, you shouldn't test me!* and other obvious jokes, usually about taking no shit from men, etc. If she sees a story about a girl being cheated on for example it's always *I'd cut his dick off haha!*

I don't like that kind of tumblr girl humour, but it's her life, she's always seemed like she's kidding. Sometimes the jokes are directed at me, like recently I've started getting into following cooking recipes on YouTube. She's usually the cook in our house but I'm making more of an effort. She came home to find me cooking recently and joked that she was going to have to find a new way to poison me now.

The only time she's ever seemed serious was when I mentioned that an online friend had invited me to a pride month event. She lost her shit and accused me of sleeping with my male friend. I'm bisexual but we're online friend and we've only met in person twice- she was there both times- and regardless I wouldn't cheat. During this argument she said she was going to kill him if he ever came near our home again.

Other than that, nothing major. But two nights ago, her sister spent the night. I gave them some space to have a bit of a girls night, and ended up playing some games, talked to online friends, etc. At one point, I headed to the kitchen to get a drink and passed the living room. I stuck my head in to say hello and see if they needed anything or whatever.

Chloe's sister joked that they'd just been about to send out a search party for me. Chloe then said ""God, not even James got a search party when I was through with him. All he got was an unmarked grave.""

Her sister looked a bit uncomfortable but laughed anyway. I left them to it, but the comment kind of made me think twice. She laughed afterwards, she'd been drinking, and she makes edgy jokes all the time, so I tried to convince myself that was it, but I couldn't help but wonder. So, I looked him up again. There are no new profiles, just the old profile I'm still friends with. He last updated in 2011, and it was to change his profile picture from one of him and Chloe to one of just him, so I'm assuming it was around their break up.

I also reached out to our mutual friends again, and all confirmed that they hadn't heard anything, that James just ghosted them one day around 2011 and hasn't been in touch since. One guy said he'd had plans with James the week he seemed to disappear, and he just never showed up. No cancellation or anything. Completely out of character; James was reliable as sin. Another friend directed me to his Mother's Facebook. She has a few public posts. One post at Christmas 2015 was a throwback photo of James with his sisters captioned *we're incomplete until he comes home!* Followed by her friends commenting to reassure her that James is probably fine, he'll come around etc. It could just be a typical ex-mormon becomes estranged from family situation, but most of us stay in touch or at least check in. There haven't been any posts about James since. I scrolled way down, and prior to 2011 there was a status saying she'd had a call with ""her boy"" in 2009 that made her happy, and I think James was the only boy, so it looks like he did make some contact. I found his sisters profiles too, and there's nothing about James, but one has a cover photo of some quote about the bond between siblings and the other commented ""*J :( x""* which maybe I'm reading into too much. I searched on every platform and couldn't find a mention of him aside from profiles and posts pre-2011; his surname is really unique so you'd think there'd be something.

So yesterday once her sister left, I told Chloe I was thinking of contacting James family to see if they'd heard from him. She got instantly defensive and asked why. I told her he was my best friend at one point and something didn't feel right about him disappearing without anyone hearing from him. She said she'd heard from him and he went back to his parents. I told her I'd seen his Moms Facebook and it didn't look like he'd gone home. She started to get upset, so I tried to calmly explain why I thought the situation was worth looking into but the more I talked the more distressed she seemed. She was torn between being tearful and being angry and when I said I was going to contact his Mom again she snapped and grabbed my shirt to back me into the wall. She's usually really calm but I honestly didn't recognise her. She looked like a different person. She told me that I didn't know what I was digging up and I'd regret it if I kept looking. I asked her to let go of me and step back, which she did.

I asked her to explain what had gone on between her and James. She said that shortly after I moved away, the relationship broke down after she realised James wasn't the person she thought he was. She said he'd done some bad things and she gave him an ultimatum that was essentially disappear, or she'd tell everyone what he'd done. I asked what he'd done but she refused to tell me.

Every time I push the issue, she gets upset. I slept on the sofa last night at her request and she's barely spoken to me today. I don't know what to do. James has never seemed like a bad guy to me. He was always supportive and genuine, the kind of guy you instantly warmed to. Chloe's the same, she's a warm person you just can't help but love, and she's only ever lost her temper once when she attacked James. Part of me thinks he must have done something to provoke that kind of behaviour in her. I know you shouldn't blame a victim for being attacked but knowing her I know it's out of character. And he told me that night he'd done something awful.

Obviously, my mind has gone to the most extreme place and I'm worried James has come to some harm. Her joke the other night and her reaction to my research as a result of her joke just don't seem rational in the slightest. I'd like to contact his family and try to locate him to be sure he's safe, but Chloe has told me she doesn't want me to do so because the way things ended greatly upset her and she now hates James.

What do you think? Am I overreacting? Should I look into his disappearance or respect my girlfriend's wishes? And how can I smooth things over if I am pushing at something painful for her? She seems genuinely upset with me.

TL;DR - I met Chloe and James when they were a couple. I moved away and lost touch with both of them. When I moved back, I started dating Chloe. We've been together nearly three years. My girlfriend jokes about murder a lot. She recently joked about murdering James specifically. I looked into his disappearance and realised he hasn't been heard from by anyone at all in eight years. My girlfriend says she made him leave because he did something bad and doesn't want me to look for him. I'm worried she hurt him. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",26Jun2019,5

473,"First of all, I'm sorry if I make any mistake, I'm French and I'm writing this in a bit of a hurry so it will be poorly written, so bare with me, please.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 17 years old student in France, who is currently in the wait for getting my national graduation or whatever it's called out there, but the French name is ""baccalauréat"".

My parents divorced a while ago, like it's been 4 years at least, I don't really remember it properly, I wiped this out actually.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the problem: It looks like my father wants to get a new life or whatever, because he actually cheated on my mom and they diverced right after. When they did, my mom was crying in the living room, and my dad was calm as hell. I don't know how someone normal would have reacted to this kind of situation, but at that time I didn't know I had depression yet, and I'm also an high fonctioning Asperger, so then I didn't say anything and I let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad went on dating someone else, and then broke up with her, and then got another ""friend"" who is still with him to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

He had previously divorced his precedent wife, with which he got a son. With my current mom, they tried to get custody of him, but over some ***BS*** reason, he couldn't keep him. Back then, we were born my sister and I, and it was indeed an idyllic childhood (no /s), for I had a loving father and mother.

&amp;#x200B;

But then it happened, you know the drill, he cheated and divorced.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently getting out of 12^(th) grade, and I want to get into a high rated school of informatic engineering, and with my level I could afford to get in there, but it is highly exepensive, but it will be all worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is: the subscription fee to get in there is 1400€, and the yearly cost of the school is way higher. It wouldn't have been a problem if my dad agreed to pay at least a little bit of it.

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the catch: he seemingly doesn't want to have any financial relation with us anymore, as he moved out to another appartment, and left his son with us. My Mom, his step-mom, is actually keeping custody of him. How crazy is that. But don't get me wrong, they love each other. Until one day, my brother (who have a job in the police and is 21) didn't like having to pay to stay in the house (he actually paid much less than he had to) and decided he wanted to move out to join my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

But that would be all too easy, my brother got in trouble with my mother, because he isn't really good with words, and his ego is really, *really* high. And my father didn't really wanted him to move in with him. His own father, *didn't want his son to move in with him while in search for a place where he can live.* I know this actually happen a lot, but please, my dad have now something like 7000€ of income with his ""girlfriend"" and he doesn't want to share it with his **own** children.

&amp;#x200B;

And the last thing he did, like 20 minutes ago, is not to show up at the bank for a meetup with my mother, in order to discuss a student loan in order to get me in that school. He will, like always, find a bullshit excuse to justify why he doesn't have to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

This is driving me and my mother mad, who is currently crying in the living room, searching for different options and pondering why our father doesn't want to help us anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't know I'm writing this right now, and I have no plan to tell her.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is why I'm telling this on the internet right now, and I'm asking anyone who read this: what should I do? What could possibly happen if all this doesn't come to an end where I get my scholarship?",26Jun2019,2
474,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.
Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/
Edit: what I’m saying is to people like this because I’m ugly it means I’m automatically stupid and incompetent and even getting a bar job is as I did a huge surprise as I’m too ugly for that line of work to her, that’s how I took the multiple repeated ‘well done’. I love this bar job so far I’m enjoying it a lot but she’s cast a dark cloud over it by the way she was with me.",26Jun2019,0

My little cousin is going to college in September. I live far away so I never really see them and we have distanced a ton of the years. I was close with her when she was little (up until the age of 10 or so). However, I am proud of her for going to college and I'd like to give her a gift. I think I would prefer to make a gift basket of a bunch of small things, opposed to one large gift (I'm also broke, so the cheaper the better). I am thinking of just a bunch of little helpful/handy things that she may not think about while packing.

476,"Let’s start off by saying me a F(23), have been in a relationship for about 2 years, he’s the same age. We have had a lot of ups and downs. He is an amazing man, he helps me out on a lot of things, but some thing just disgust me about him that we’ve had horrible fights. He can act very sweet and genuine at times. Then he switches to this evil character, by putting me down. I try to tell him he messes with my anxiety and he doesn’t understand. He makes me feel crazy. But when the relationship is good, it’s amazing. When it’s bad I hate him. I feel like our relationship is going downhill, and so I went on a date, which yes, we weren’t together. I had broke up with my boyfriend a week before because of this terrible fight we went through. 

Okay, this guy that I had went on a date with, I’ve know him in high school. He was basically in love with me and I never gave him the time of day because I was stupid and chasing the “asshole.” Well we came in contact by me messaging him. We texted for about a week and decided to hang. He did all these cute things on the day, he brought me flowers, he would text me everyday calling me gorgeous. The day of the date we just smiled all night. He was basically treating me like a girlfriend. But, the upsetting part is that he barely got out of his divorce. I think this is the first time he’s been out with a women other than his wife. I could tell he was still damaged. And I just wanted to have my arms open to him. I would take care of him as how a wife should but, idk if he hates women because of that.

Well what I fell in love with or think I did was how he’s a single dad who absolutely loves his daughter and would do anything for her. He has her full time, he’s hard working, and he’s handsome. He had total respect for me on the date. He was a total gentlemen. 

The part where I feel insane is because I cannot stop thinking about him, he completely changed. He leaves me on read, so I basically stopped bothering him. But I can’t to seem to figure out why I feel so shitty about this one guy. I would love to mend his heart and I would do anything to make him happy again and to not feel anymore pain. I’m constantly thinking about it and it hurts that I felt like he would have at least kept communicating with me.

I’m not sure what to do, he’s being a complete asshole and I just want him to know that I am here for him. But since he’s leaving me on read than I don’t want to be annoying and really have him think I’m insane. He made me not even want to be with my ex boyfriend.

I'm going to try to make a long scary story short. I have been dog sitting for this guy for a couple months now, he has four dogs. One of the dogs had attacked the oldest dog in the group about a year ago and hurt him pretty bad and almost killed him. The owner had let me know before taking on the job that had happened before and he said as long I kept those two separate nothing should happen. Today while dog sitting I noticed the old dog not acting like himself. He was very tired and didn't want to move much. He layed down the entire day. The other 3 dogs were outside in their outdoor kennel and it was time to bring them in. Old dog didn't feel like going outside one last time for the night. I tried to get him up stairs into his room for the night while the other three dogs stay in their own room separate from him. It was getting dark out and I was frustrated and thought as long as old dog isn't in the way and I bring the other dogs in while I'm standing right there everything will be fine. None of them have acted aggressive towards him in passing and they don't even notice he's there. Well tonight I let them in and they immediately attacked the old dog, mostly the one who attacked him before. I couldn't get them to stop. It was 3 dogs on one and me trying to get it to stop. I threw water on them, shoes at them, screamed on top of my lungs. I was panicking. I threw a blanket on top of the hurt dog and layed on top of him and the other dogs we're still nipping at him and trying to get to him through the blanket. I grabbed the one dog by the collar and dragged her into the bathroom. I grabbed the other two and took them to the room where the kennel is. There was blood every where and I couldn't find my phone. I was trying to help the bleeding dog and he had a big gash on his upper thigh. I finally found my phone and called his owner and he talked me through it. I was trying so hard to keep his dog alive. I held pressure on his wound and kept talking to him. He wouldn't move or lift his head anymore. I had to tell his owner over the phone that his dog had stopped responding and breathing. I had to get my roommate to come over to help me try to clean up the mess and carry the dog to the garage. I usually stay the night for a few days a week, but last night I went home to my own house. There was so much blood it was like a horror movie. When I went back over this morning to let the other dogs out his friend was there and had to tear the carpet completely up.
I tried everything I could and I couldn't save his poor dog. He felt so terrible for me and I feel even worse for him. I'm feeling very guilty and upset about it, even though he insists I shouldnt because he says he knew his dog wasn't feeling well and there had been attacks before.

483,"This is a repost from r/relationship_advice. I'm just trying to get as much insight as I can from as many people as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel like my parents are too overbearing when it comes to my romantic relationships. They try and influence who I date, what I do with them, and what I'm allowed to do with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation:

I am going into my 4th year of university. It's summer break and I am currently working as an intern. I've been living with my parents while I work. During the school year, I live alone because of how far school is from home.

I am currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (20F). We've been dating for about a year now. However the issue arises with my parents. They disapprove of her because of her socioeconomic status and difference of upbringing. My family would be classified as upper-middle while her's would be classified as lower. She also comes from a family with an abusive father. They feel like this difference will affect my relationship with her in the long term. I agree it could happen. So far no big issues. Regardless, I think it's up to my discretion to continue dating or break up.

Also I should mention, My girlfriend is moving back to her home country in about a week. She will be there temporarily but the duration is unknown yet. The earliest I would see here is after my graduation. We've talked and decided we would like to continue dating and make long distance work.

&amp;#x200B;

Main Issue:

Often times I feel like my parents cross the line between being good/caring parents and overbearing/no boundaries parents, especially when it comes to my romantic relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Example Scenarios:

\- My parents get upset I come home late from dates with my girlfriend. Dates happen about 3-4 times a week. I usuallysee her right after work (so about 6) and I get home any time between 11:00pm - 1:00 am. Is this something myparents should be upset about?

\- My girlfriend and I would like to spend a weekend before she goes away. My parents are saying no. Do I even needtheir permission?

\- My parents have tried to talk me into breaking up with her by saying things like: ""Oh she's too different, life will behard with her"", ""There are so many more fish in the sea"", ""You could do better"". Things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice/Question:

I get my parents are concerned. I mean what parent isn't worried about their child? But my question is: are they going too far? Am I really not responsible enough to be deciding things on my own? Am I just being an angsty teen or are my parents being to intrusive?

Any advice would be helpful. I'm really just trying to gain more perspective on my situation. Thanks reddit.

484,"I’m so sorry for the long post here.. 
..my boyfriend (39) and I (24) have been together for 3 years. Nearly the whole time we haven’t gone more than a couple of days without fighting over something. It’s either about a legitimate stressful thing in our lives (apartments, jobs, etc) or just literally what color we think a shirt is. No matter what, it’s a fucking fight.  Despite that though, we both love each other.. a lot. Individually I have no family at all.. no siblings, parents, cousins.. no one and my friend circle is limited as well. He doesn’t have many people either which is one of the reasons I feel we both love each other so much and could never imagine not being in one another’s lives. So, two months ago we were at a party and having some drinks. It was actually a ton of fun. I was having a blast! Making new friends, having drinks, it was outdoors so we had water guns etc. But, BF wasn’t by my side. I honestly didn’t know what he was doing but I assumed he was having fun doing his own thing in the same bar which I was happy for him to be socializing too! Out of no where he came up to me that we are leaving which I had 0 interest in doing because like I said, I was having a blast. We literally never go out and socialize so this was a rarity. He left me there alone which upset me. I wandered away alone, crying and upset because I felt he never takes into consideration what I want and instead of sticking around with me or discussing he just totally bounced and left me high and dry. Aimlessly walking around I stumbled down an empty alley when out of no where I hear “is this your phone?” I turn around and it’s his friend for the last 4 years handing me over my phone that my boyfriend had been holding. He starts shitting all over my boyfriend for leaving me and starts talking all this shit about him as person as he’s walking closer to me. I take a step back and he grabs my hair and is pushing my face towards his dick. He rips his shorts off and is forcing my face near him. I managed to escape after a minute or so of wrestling away and was sprinting away when I bumped into none other than my boyfriend. I immediately tell him what happened and I couldn’t even breath I was hysterical. My boyfriend did not believe me. Even after telling him nine thousand times what had happened literally pointing down the alley showing where he is, he refused to believe me. I couldn’t believe something like this could happen and his initiation reaction is believing someone over me, so I walked away from him and he let me. I drank my brains out the rest of the night roaming around the city getting drunker and drunker devastated about not only what happened to me but also that he didn’t believe me. My boyfriend was trying to reach me but I had my phone on airplane mode so I didn’t even get any notifications and at this point I was absolutely destroyed so operating my phone properly was not in the realm of possible. I walk down a street and come across these people on a picnic table who welcome me. I ended up going into one of the guys apartments, and I let him go down on me for a couple of minutes. Honestly, I. D.o.n.t know why I did this. I’ve never cheated on my boyfriend and never would think of it but after what had happened during the night I had to get black out and I made some dumb ass decisions. I think I did it to like get power back or some shit. All I know is if that hadn’t happened to me in the alley with his friend, this would have NEVER happened. I came home and told my boyfriend the following morning when I was sober and he was too exactly what happened. He was devastated and apologized saying he believed me but originally couldn’t. As far as I know he hasn’t “got me back” for what I did. I dont know which one of us think of what happened more than the other. I think and cry about it at least once every since day. I’m so depressed. I feel like I destroyed my relationship in 5 minutes. I’m so disgusted in myself.

I know this isn't healthy and I mostly avoid the situation. If a girl and I hit it off and she is in a relationship... I tend to back off and not pursue a friendship. I don't like feeling negative and envious so I pull back. But I'm realizing that this is really not helping me in any real way, girls often have single friends and I could hit it off with them...but the first girl is always in the background of my thoughts.

487,"I’m an adult with high functioning autism. Basically Asperger’s, but they don’t diagnose that in the US anymore. Anyway, my roommate brings this boy over that he’s considering dating and has a conversation with him in the kitchen within earshot. They left to go somewhere and I ran some errands. When I got back and just my roommate was home he said, “I think he has autism. What do you think?” 

I told him I didn’t have any opinion because all I had was the overhearing of part of a conversation. The other guy is a bit slower pace, country-ish compared to my former-NYC city roommate. Roommate said that he had never met anyone as deadpan as I am other than this guy. So he asked me to diagnose the guy. Obviously I told him I don’t have the credentials to diagnose and I had very limited interaction with the guy. 

Part of me wants to educate my roommate, the other part is annoyed by the ignorance. It’s not the first time he’s just assumed someone who might otherwise just be shy, anxious, nervous, timid, etc. has autism because he knows I do.

I came here for advice (I know, duh) on what I should focus on and resources that might help me make the best of this. 

There are some limitations on what I can do. I have a young puppy and also care for my brother's puppy when he's at work, so I can't spend much time away from the home.

* Work on my lack of education. I wasn't in school from 11-16 and I wasn't educated in that time. I'd really love to fix this, especially science, maths and geography. I'm not sure how to plan this out though or what resources I should be going for. I know about Khan Academy but that's all, really.
* Learn a language. Is Duolingo my best bet? Are there any resources online for learning BSL?
* Learning how to code, maybe?
* Read through some classic novels. Not sure where to start/what's worth reading.

 But I'm pretty much open to anything that's useful and might make me feel productive. I can't stand how lazy I feel at the moment. If you had a bit over a year to improve yourself, what would you do?",26Jun2019,1
489,"Hi there, I'm going to try to make this as concise as possible - with a medical context Id be able to write a fair sized essay about this.

I think my mom may be dying. I've thought that for near two decades, but this time it is at the level of friends, family and peers being scared just by witnessing her. There are currently as many knows as unknowns regarding what is plaguing her; she discharged from the hospital as it seemed they did more harm than good and weren't going to approach the bigger issues at play. She's in endless pain, with no hope in sight of relief, and just waiting for when the next high demand doctor will have an appointment for her. Even from her voice over the past two to three weeks you can tell that her current existence is torture.

So, here's my situation: I live on the other side of Canada currently with my wife, I have a sister still in her last years of highschool, not enough money or time to just freely live between the two sides of Canada, and no insight or discourse on how to better facility her medical team or the scope of her care, or does anyone have a clue what's totally wrong or if she can be made better. My sister's well-being is a big component of my concern - making sure I can be a few steps ahead so I can look out for her and prepare come... an unfortunate future scenario.

I don't know where to go from here. I have my only parent [probably] dying of a rare and unclear complexity of diseases, unknown of whether its pace is fast or slow. I can't talk to her doctors about what's going on or what we can do for her - right? I call her once a day, and I know she appreciates the mental break of dwelling on pain, but, there has to be more ... Out there? ... Options? ... Something? 

I just don't know. Please, does anyone have some good advice?",26Jun2019,1
490,"So, I’m in high school now. My mother has always wanted me to be involved with things in school, and I really have tried. At first, I wanted to be involved with choir. I practiced my song, and did all of that, but when it came to trying out, I broke down. I wasn’t able to come up with any words, and I couldn’t muster up anything. I was horrible. Recently, I’ve moved and now I have a neighbor who is very involved with color guard. I go over to her house and twirl the flag a bit, and she always tells me I should try out. I want to, but I’m also very scared to. I don’t know if I’ll be able to go in front of an entire field of people or walk through a parade or a competition. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to try out. Would it be worth it to try?",26Jun2019,2
491,"This guy I’m seeing only tells me his feelings when he is drunk. I was taken aback because at times he ignores me when I go to his house to hangout and he will be on his phone and is super secretive about his electronics. Last week he literally couldn’t get off his phone and hanging was weird with him and he didn’t get off his phone even though I was like hey this is the last time you’ll see me for a few weeks. I feel this message is fake so I don’t want to accept the appreciation. Plus when I have been positive in responding to these texts before I simply get a smile emoji and I feel like an idiot. He isn’t always on his phone but like thirty percent of the time he is. 

He texted me this last night randomly. He sounds drunk and is never this nice unless drunk. 

“I fuckin like the shit outta you. You are hot af and satisfy me in every way. Also we get along so well i love your sense of humor and we mesh so well. Hanging out with you is so much fun even with no sexy involved. You are awesome on tooo many levels”
Also 
“I have been with other peeps in past but I have never been with someone that makes me feel like you do. Emotionally and physically I turn into mindless zombie for your pussy. 
I feel comfortable being open with you.” 


It’s nice but feels fake and forced. I literally just told him I enjoy spending time with him cause I was so taken aback.

I went out of town with him a few weeks ago to visit his family and the night after we got back in town he said “you are absolutely amazing” when drunk.",26Jun2019,1
492,"First of all, I'm a guy, and I'm in desperate need of oxytocin. So I paid to be in a closed session of people who were all screened to be safe, including me. It's happening this weekend. It's not a sex party, and it's not a cuddle party either, it's somewhere inbetween. No nudity below the waist. I know, it's weird. And it's definitely out of character for me to go to something like this. But I did go to a cuddle party recently, and I thought I would have a hard time touching strangers, but I really didn't.

Consent is key in events like this, I pretty much know how to ask, and I definitely know how to take a ""no"". (Even a ""maybe"" is a no at the time.) Also, they make sure that there are at least at a 50/50 split of women to men. If anything, they try to get a higher percentage of women, because they've found it always goes better that way. Also, women are generally more okay with touching each other than men are. And if it's not already clear, I want to be cuddling with women.

I have friends who I talk to and spend time with, but I need something else. And I'm confident that this party will give me what I need for the *moment*. I'm attractive, and I've become a lot more outgoing recently, so I can do whatever I need to do. The problem is, I don't want to have to pay a fee and have to wait so long between sessions. I want to try to find someone to have some unsanctioned cuddling.

People who have done something like this, is it normal to ask for someone's number afterward if you had a good time? Is there any other advice I need to know?

Also, they requested we bring some sort of snack, and I'll be cooking a confection.

495,"This is nowhere near close to other topics that are on here, however this situation does make me very unhappy in life. (16M) I have a best friend (16F) who may not be always telling the truth. This started about 3 years ago when we started talking, we knew each other for years but didnt talk much, but one day we started a casual convo, that lead to us being best friends a couple weeks after. We talked a lot, basically for hours every day. At one point we told each other everything, but I always had a doubt in my mind that maybe she isn't always telling the truth. One day I started noticing stuff. She just took her phone out of her pocket and excused herself that someone is calling her, but I and no one around seemed to hear the ring/vibration and she was giving very generic answers, I suspected that she is faking it but didnt think much of it at the time. But this kept going on and on, and it always seemed just a little bit fake. She would ask me to go out and just chat, then when it cme to the time we discussed she always made up something not to come out. This happened at least 50 times when I had enough and had to ask my family for advice because I felt miserable that I couldn't see her for so long. And my mom and sister helped me realise that she was just blatantly lying. They pointed out things I didnt see. 
And yes we had a few fights just as any friends (and even tho they say a guy and a girl can't be friends because one is going to have feelings this never happened to us...she had a boyfriend and I know that I didnt like her like that)but one fight really hurt me. She was with friends and I asked her if she drank anything just out of curiosity and she just flat out lied to me on multiple occasions.
She would act weird all of a sudden, but again I didnt think much of it.
 And then she told me she has cancer, I obviously believed her and was with her every single day(most of the time not physically but through texts...but still helping her all the time). She hasn't told anyone else. At this point things kept getting weirder, she was obv acting and lying about stories, there was one guy we both hated(at least I thought) because he lied to her and backstabbed her but she for some reason always kept on believing him and giving him chances when obviously he just wanted to backstab her again. And again, I had doubts, who would lie about cancer? I said. But she never told me anything about going to treatment or taking medicine.
Then we started to talk less and less because we went to different schools. She would ignore my messages when I asked about her but kept on texting with me even late at night when we didnt talk about her.
But the reason I'm making this post is because today I got the news from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend for months that she wouldn't tell me about.
I'm really sorry if this post is just all over the place, English is not my first language and I never knew how to put my feelings into text that would make sense, but I tried. 
Do any if you guys have experience/advice you could tell me. And if this is just a very insignificant topic that doesn't belong here just tell me in the comments and I'll remove the post.",26Jun2019,1

498,"Alrighty, let’s start with I’m 19, I live at home with my mom, &amp; about 6 months ago she decided to let her friend from work move in. My mom is really smart, she’s never made dumb decisions but she’s also got a big heart and finds it hard to say no especially to friends. So, when this “friend” moved in, I already wasn’t on board. I told my mom this was a mistake and would/could possibly ruin her and this friend’s relationship if things went south. She was so excited about her moving in I dropped it. I even cleaned out both the rooms so she would have a room! (my bedroom I had the entire time we lived her, and the “storage” room as we all called it until it recently became mine and my boyfriend’s room) Until she started moving in 6 months ago and her stuff took up pretty much over half of the house. We live in a double wide trailer that’s been added on to. Her stuff was in the sunroom, living room, dining room, mom’s bedroom, her bathroom, the whole nine yards. Still to this day her shit is taking over half of our dining room up while her room is so full with stuff you can’t hardly walk or see the floor of her room. She’s incredibly lazy, she doesn’t hardly ever wash clothes, NEVER washes dishes or cooks, never buys actual food or drinks for anyone but herself, has made 0 progress on moving all of her stuff into her room andddd did I mention she’s like 30 and has lived by herself a whopping 1 time? For less than 2 weeks and then moved in with her other friend. Anddd to make matters better would y’all like to know what this 30 something year old spends all of her money on because she has no kids, no husband, absolutely nothing that depends on her, POP FIGURES &amp; tattoos. Literally. Works at Walmart makes $11 an hour, $500-$700 paycheck and literally doesn’t pay bills, does nothing. Pretty much is a grown ass child that’s been babied her whole life. Also did I mention that there is currently 5 people in our household, and this “friend” only buys stuff for herself and by that I mean she legit buys diet drinks and then drinks all of our drinks that aren’t diet, doesn’t buy anything mom asks her to, doesn’t ever do anything for anyone but herself but yet she drinks and eats all the food mom buys for us. Ohh and to make matters even worse, y’all wanna know what time this friend thinks it’s appropriate to wake up? Fucking 4 in the afternoon. Yep. Everyday. She sleeps in until 2-4 EVERY DAY. Then when she gets home from work, regardless of who is asleep or awake or what time it is or if it’s a school day, she stays up until 3-4 am watching Harry Potter movies on full blast. Oh and it gets better, recently we had to run my internet cable from my desktop computer into her room because that is my old room where it was originally installed and so we have two doors that go into the base part of the house and since the cord was too thick to go through the whole in the wall we’ve ran it through the underneath of one other doors going into the house so now you have to slam it to get it to stay shut and since her room is right beside that, she’s constantly complains about us coming through there when we’ve been cleaning all day and she’s been asleep in the bed until 4 in the afternoon. And you wanna know what else she’s done lately? My mom told me we were having some family stay with us for a day or two and asked if we could help her straighten up the house, I told her absolutely and we ALL started on it that night, while the “friend” slept and the next morning mom went to tell her that family was gonna stay a day or two with us and you wanna know what her response was? Oh okay well could y’all keep it down cause I’m having a hard time going back to sleep. Are you kidding me? EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE HOUSE INCLUDING MY FRIEND WHO DOESNT LIVE HER AND MY 13 YEAR OLD BROTHER WORKED OUR ASSES OFF CLEANING THE ENTIRE HOUSE to be asked to “keep it down” by some old lazy ass bitch. Who might I add never offered to help or even lifted a FINGER this entire time. So, what the hell do I do? I cannot stand her, I cannot deal her childish bs, and the fact she contributes absolutely nothing. I’m at my breaking point with this. I really need some advice.",26Jun2019,1

In my divorce decree it says I have to perform 10 hours of community service (which I did) and take counseling to learn the importance of following a court order.

503,"Hey-o! It's your casually confused about sexuality (really not sure if bi or not) guy here with some questions for people older than thyself. So, I have a classic story right? Guy (me, the handsome strapping under 18 protagonist) becomes enamoured with a girl, first fantasy, soon becoming close friends, y'know seeing the faults and deciding more or less I objectively like her. Over the course of the year, the two schoolmates become so close one might mistake them for a couple (everyone does, they just treat it as a joke). Protagonist says he likes her. She... Doesn't reciprocate, atleast fully. The gentle letdown she imposes makes him cling to a small hope that she could. He takes it on the chin, no crying, and his outward personality doesn't change much at all. The irrational part thinks it could happen but he doesn't get up hopes.

504,"I and my GF  (both 20-21) have been together for about 15 months. before asking her out, all I could dream was being with her, I just knew her from a social media and was excited about her way of thinking and I thought she's my type because we had quite the same concerns and values. We got closer until I asked her out and she accepted. 

I have to say I'm super shy and with a very low self-confidence, honestly it's still fascinating for myself that I asked her out. before knowing her I would spend almost all my time at home (except college and school), I didn't have best friends with whom I would spend time outside college and overall I'm not a flamboyant and outgoing guy but I'm more an introvert guy and keen on spending time alone reading books, coding and this kinds of stuff. 

One more thing, I live in a Middle-Eastern country in which some guys have BF or GF but most parents (including ours) aren't open to this phenomenon and it's still a big surprise when you come across someone you know with her/his SO (not married) on the street. 

now we see each other every 4-5 days on the streets and cafes etc. the days we go to college we see each other more often but it certainly isn't everyday. She is sometimes upset about my reluctance to seeing her, arguing that maybe I don't love her enough or our love isn't ""burning"". I have to confess I was never burning with the need to see her, not because I didn't like her company, fortunately I was happy around her and we usually had great time together but I felt my problem rooted back to me being introverted and and that weird feeling of what if we bump into some acquaintances.

We both aren't particularly cheerful or happy-go-lucky people, with all these things going on in ME and the economic problems, life is a bit harsh at the moment. I have to add my gf has a lot of challenges in college and these makes her quite sad and depressed at least once a week, I myself have financial issues too, long story short it's not a rare thing once a week that we are not really in the right mood to talk to each other. Recently after one of these days that my gf was very sad, I tried to calm her down and tell her not to worry and give her some solutions to make things easier, I got a little angry and she got mad at me because she expected me to calm her down but I was arguing with her, she told me she was tired of our relationship and our constant arguments when one of us is feeling depressed.

The last thing I have to confess makes me ashamed of myself as hell but I should tell you. it often occurs to me that what if people judge me because of my gf appearances, she's totally fine but her nose is objectively wide and big for her face and I can't ask her to do a nose job because it's so selfish and sickening (and what if her nose didn't get better). she herself knows her nose is big and she sometimes talks about how much she hates it but she's not sure about nose job because she don't like a ""artificial"" face (she's probably worried about surgery risks too). as I said my self-confidence is very low, maybe it's not a big deal but currently these feelings are annoying me. 

Honestly she loves so much, I don't think anybody can love me as much she does. And I truly care for her, she is super important to me and I do love her but sometimes I think what if I don't love her enough, I would truly do anything she wants but when I see Instagram and pop culture intense relationships and their burning desire to spend every second together, I often question my love toward her, I fear I'm betraying her by not having a passionate love she deserves. And if I break up with her, I certainly won't start a new relationship for the next several years because I'm truly disappointed with myself.

509,"Hi everyone! 

I’m going to try to make this short and sweet, I could really use some feedback/advice on how to beat handle this situation. 

Last semester (Fall 2018) I applied for tuition reimbursement through my job, and my manager approved it. I simply submitted my grades at the end of the semester, per policy, and got $1500 reimbursed. 

At the beginning of this semester (Spring 2019), I asked my manager if he’d approve my tuition reimbursement and asked if he’d like me to email him in regards to his approval (which he did give). Now I know to make sure everything is in writing. However, this is not required per the company handbook. 

The handbook explicitly states approval is to be obtained prior to enrollment (as I did), and there is a form to fill out at the end of the semester (which my boss prompted me to do, and I filled out). 

I carry on with my semester working full time and going to school full time. I’m working 80hr/week and staying dedicated to the company. I even followed up once with my boss after school started to ask him if everything’s squared aware for my tuition reimbursement. He assured me it’s all good. 

Flash forward to the end of the semester, I worked hard to get all As (% reimbursement based off grades), and my boss pulls me in to his office to tell me he is no longer extending the tuition reimbursement due to budget restrictions. I told him he approved the reimbursement already, and it’s not right to retract the offer based on policy. He responded that while he did approve the tuition reimbursement, he couldn’t guarantee the money would be available in the budget. I left his office, did some thinking/research, and found that he actually could not retract the funds just because the money wasn’t in the budget. He should’ve set aside the money or told me it wasn’t available prior to his approval. 

I called HR, they were annoyed but essentially said my boss told them he did not approve the reimbursement. I called my boss and confronted him with this, stating he did approve it and that he had mentioned it in our meeting. I asked him to do right by me and inform HR that he did approve the reimbursement, and that he’s stating the money just isn’t there now (which would mean he’d have to find the money, essentially, and that I’m still entitled to it). Well, he called me back and started asserting that we never had a conversation in which he approved my tuition reimbursement. A blatant lie which, due to my lack of written correspondence, is impossible to prove.  He wouldn’t budge. 

I now have a meeting with the COO next week (his direct superior) and I’m going to try to make a case for myself. I am looking for any advice on how best to approach this topic to maximize my chance of success. I really, really can not afford this $2400 loss. I’m 22 and a student, and while I understand I shouldn’t have relied on that money, I had every good reason to anticipate it. 

I have quite a bit of data in favor of my boss’s “forgetfulness” and incompetence. 

Such as:

-not paying me for a sick day with my sick time (lost the money) 

-not telling me when my superior would be absent (which means i couldn’t work and would’ve had to go to another site) 

-changing my schedule for school, then changing my schedule back in the middle of my school to where I had to either quit or ask my teacher to change my school schedule (I did the latter)

-not communicating with any of our staff, it’s a common complaint

-managing 3 sites at the time of my request for approval at the beginning of the semester, which kind of lends to him forgetting (when he has such a habit of doing)



Any advice on how to structure my argument or if I even have a good case is really greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!",26Jun2019,1
510,"This post is partially a rant but I also want some advice on how to get through this.

So a few weeks ago I decided to break up with my boyfriend as I thought that it was too emotionally draining for me. The break up didn't go so well, and he started callling me names and shouting at me. I knew that it was time to cut ties fully.

My problem now is that he's being very salty about it. We go to the same high school, and we're in the same grade. He's deliberately talking to girls right in my face, or saying things loud enough for me to hear. He's been doing things that he never did before. For example, he would talk about how he's going to live by himself when he goes to uni and that he'd have lots of girls come over (this happened whilst I was studying in the school library and he came in with his friends and he suddenly blurts this out loud enough for me to hear.) I don't know how to explain it well but it's REALLY obvious he's trying to make me feel bad.

I know the best thing to do is to not care at all, but sometimes I can't help but get really pissed at him and also I see him quite a lot at school which makes it really hard. 

Does anybody have any advice for getting over someone that you know is bad for you?",26Jun2019,1

512,"So some background knowledge, I’m 20, I live in Oregon, USA. My girlfriend is 16(17 in August) we both work (I full time and her part time) lived together in my apartment, and we both have our own cars.

So I went for an interview at the local DHS to try and get food stamps. I claimed her on the application because, well her pregnancy was the reason I went to DHS for food stamps in the first place.

So after the interview I guess they reported me for the age gap (I understand they have to).  The detective gets ahold of my girlfriends mom and tells her that if she doesn’t charge me or report kidnapping they will charge her for Neglect on the 5 children in her house and the 1 she’s trying to adopt. Finally they get ahold of me (they never once just called me). They tell me that my girlfriend needs to go to her parents and that I need to come in on Tuesday for questioning. Well this was on a Friday. (I guess the detective doesn’t work mondays?) So I go in for questioning with my GF and her mom and my mom (to make sure I don’t slip up). We all go in answer some questions, mainly about me impregnating my girlfriend, to which I invoked my right to not have to answer. 

But here’s where it gets weird. My girlfriend goes in with her mom (the worst person I’ve ever met) I go get a coffee to cool down and when I get back, my girlfriend is bawling her eyes out. They’ve told her we are never going to see each other again. They told her that once the baby is out they will DNA test her and charge me. They verbally informed her about a No Contact Order between me and her. But I have still yet to see the paper that the No Contact actually exists. Also the charge they are threatening me with is Sexual Misconduct with a Minor, a misdemeanor. But I also still haven’t been charged or anything just questioned.

This was a TL;DR for my last two weeks for sure.

So my questions.

513,"To make this as short as possible, my friend(15,male) is an artist and has a small fan base. A few months ago he started to talk with a girl though instagram, she said that she was his biggest fan and that she's obsessed with him. My friend thought of this as a joke and kept on talking with her because he didn't want to seem rude, but turns out this girl is really fucked up. 

She has tons of back up accounts and every time my friend blocks her, she always appears again. Even if he changes his username, she finds him. She said things like ""I'm never going to leave you alone"" and it creeps him. She even found where he lives, even if my friend doesn't have his location in any of his social media. He's fucking scared of her but doesn't want to involve police because that girl is about 12 years old, so they could do anything. I really want to help him and basically tell that girl to go fuck herself, but I'm scared she might find things about me too. What should I do?",26Jun2019,1

520,"When I was growing up neither of my parents had any real friends and I pretty much never seen them socialise outside of family events. They both learned to be very independent people only really relying on each other both had difficult practically abusive upbringings which didn't help.

 My dad even used to say to me when I was a child ""Money is the only friend you can truly rely on"". On one hand I think it's a sad statement but on the other hand I think there is some truth to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is related at all. I just have this thing now that I don't really feel I need people. I'm not sure if this is easy to relate to. I just have a very easy come easy go behaviour towards people. I am terrible at keeping in touch with people. I'll sometimes talk with my mum usually when she messages me and I might chat with my one friend once a month. I rarely if ever feel the need to catch up with anyone. If they don't message me then so what. On top of that I'm introverted so I don't really get out much. Although I chat with acquaintances regularly so I'm not totally void of social interaction. 

So is it normal not to need anybody? I feel like I should want to make more effort to develop friends and maintain better relationships but it almost feels like I just don't really care. I just don't feel compelled to make the effort. Plus other than my mum and one friend people rarely if ever make the effort to keep in touch with me so it feels normal.",26Jun2019,3
521,"DETAILS ABOUT THIS CASE:

Uniqlo cashier (by the name of Phot) takes my UOB credit card (Singapore-based bank) and inserts it into the POS system and seemingly starts to process payment. He waits for a while and looks to me to say that the card does not work.

I’m a little surprised as I have been using the card in Thailand for a few months. I ask for him to show me a declined receipt so that I know I have not been charged 4880THB mistakenly. He looks lost and says there is no receipt. He explains that if the card does not work, there are usually no receipts.

He asks me if he should try again..so I say ok but I am a little worried. Again, he proceeds to process the payment but nothing shows up. He says the card is not working so I decide to hand him over another credit card (i.e. my HSBC card). The HSBC card works and I am issued a receipt of payment of 4880 THB and I head off.

I make a mental note to check if the transaction went through on UOB. I needed to get back to the hotel where my Singapore SIM card is in order to receive SMS One-time Password (OTP) and check the balance + transactions.

When I get back to the hotel, I log in to my UOB mobile app and it shows that my credit balance has been deducted and I have been charged 4880 THB (160 USD) twice on this card. Which means, in total I have been charged 14640THB (480 USD) &gt;&gt; 9760THB (320USD) on my UOB card + 4880THB (160USD) on my HSBC card.

I call Uniqlo and they hand the phone over to a girl named Pearl who speaks good English and I explained what happened to her. She asks for details on the transaction (like who was the cashier, POS number, Trans number, etc.) which are all on the receipt.

She asks if I am coming back to the store where she can reverse the transaction. I explain that I am on my way (on a Grab back to the store) but it will take time due to traffic. (Seriously, Bangkok traffic is insane...)

When I return to the store, I show them confirmation on my phone that I have been charged multiple times mistakenly. Both Pearl and Phot acknowledge that I have been mischarged three times (This has seemingly happened before). They start going through receipt after receipt from previous transactions...and this takes awhile...so Phot apologises to me explaining that there is something wrong with their system. I half-suspect that cashiers are told to charge the customer again (i.e. multiple times) when unsure if a transaction has occured.

They say they need to call their EDC (?) - whatever that meant I did not know at the time.

After calling their EDC (?), Uniqlo explains that the transaction has been cancelled / reversed. I check my balance and transactions but it has not yet been updated.

They speak to the EDC (?) officer over the phone and starts to explain to me that my bank (UOB in Singapore) will need 3 hours to update my account and that I can call UOB to verify this.

I decide to give UOB a call and the UOB officer (by the name of Weelee) confirms that there are 2 transactions from Uniqlo TH (Emquartier), but they have not been reversed. He also explains that if a transaction is reversed by the merchant, it will reflect on the UOB system immediately. So, he explains that he is confident that no transaction has been reversed yet.

I explain this to Pearl and Phot, who then speak on the phone with the EDC (?) officer for another 15-20 minutes (they do this in front of me). They now explain to me that these matters will usually take up to 24 hours as my bank has received the amount but have not disbursed it into my account (?)

I'm annoyed and explain that when a transaction is reversed it usually updates immediately - I'm pretty sure I've experienced this before. I ask them why do they have to call the EDC (?) and shouldn't the store be able to reverse the transactions on their system (?)...I ask for a receipt for the reversal.

THIS IS WHERE LIES START TO UNCOVER ...and then more lies are being told by Uniqlo in order to cover up -

Phot / Pearl decide to explain to me that the EDC system actually has an issue and that there was no transaction recorded on the system and in other words, they can't find the transaction (and neither can their bank find the transaction). So no transactions have been reversed!!!!

I am a little confused and explain that the transactions definitely occured because: (1) it shows that my credit balance was deducted , (2) it also shows up on my UOB transaction history page, and (3) even the UOB bank officer confirmed the 2 transactions posted by Uniqlo TH Emquartier.

Phot / Pearl re-assures me. They say that they know I have been charged multiple times and they are not denying this. However, they are unable to reverse the transaction as it does not reflect on their system - which is why they need to call the EDC (?) and ask them to reverse it on their end...

Phot / Pearl start to speak to the EDC (?) officer again...and this is where I find out that Uniqlo uses Kasikorn Bank (or K Bank). They pass the phone to me explaining that the officer from K Bank would like to speak to me.

The K Bank officer starts by telling me that there is no transaction so I will not be charged. I re-iterated to the K Bank officer that I have already been charged. He then tells me not to worry as they have cancelled the transaction. I tell him that this is not reflected on my end and reiterate what Weelee has explained to me. Again, I ask him for a receipt or proof that the transactions have been cancelled or reversed...and I decide to keep reiterating this point...regarding receipt or proof that the transactions were reversed

The K Bank officer tells me to hand the phone back to Uniqlo - and I pass it over to Pearl / Phot

Pearl / Phot asks when I will be leaving Thailand. I tell them 1 week and they seemingly communicate this over the phone to the K Bank officer

After more back and forth, they explain that K Bank will need 1 week to reverse the transaction (and it should reflect on my UOB account by then). I'm not sure how they'd imagine I would take this....

I explained I can’t wait a week, I will be leaving Thailand and it becomes even more difficult for me to follow up on the case. They re-assure me that K Bank will be e-mailing me the “receipt” today and asks for my e-mail address.

I tell them am also no interested in dealing with K Bank, Uniqlo should be dealing with K Bank.

I ask Uniqlo for a refund and they can manage their own back-end processes without me being involved. I gave them 2 options: (1) Refund my HSBC card (since they have a record of that final transaction) + 4880 THB in cash; or (2) Refund me 9760 THB in cash fully.

I also told them that I am willing to sign on a note that I have received a refund of this amount and they can make a photocopy of my ID if necessary.

Pearl considers this...and tells me to hold on. She brings over the Uniqlo store manager by the name of Mint.

Mint starts by explaining that she can refund 4880THB to me...thinking that I was charged twice (i.e. with only one extra charge) rather than being charged three times (i.e. two extra charges). So I quickly explain that I was charged 3 times...not twice...which she confirms with Phot / Pearl

She now explains that she cannot process a refund as there is a daily 5000 THB limit for cash refund, and also...she starts to explain that Uniqlo will ""lose money"" if K Bank reverses the transaction to me eventually (this is a point she decides to stick to explaining to me multiple times throughout this ordeal, that Uniqlo will ""lose"" money)

I tell her that she can go with option (1) where she refunds my HSBC card + cash so that the cash refund is within the 5000THB limit. I also reiterate that I am the one who have made additional payment and I am willing to sign a note that I have received a refund. With regards to Uniqlo ""losing"" money, I tell her that she can let K Bank know that they don't have to reverse the transaction and refund me at the store instead.

She explains that if she refunds the amount to my HSBC card...her store will suffer a ""loss in inventory"".

I explain to her that is honestly none of my concern. I ask why is Uniqlo not taking responsibility for this? Why is Uniqlo not taking any ownership of this case? Do I really have to be burdened for their misuse or the failures of their systems or their bank of choice? I told her that if K Bank's systems fails...Uniqlo should not be passing the burden back to me (the customer). I don't even use K Bank...They need to be responsible for that or take ownership of that, not the customer.

The Uniqlo store manager decides to take me to the backroom office (as I have been standing at the cashier for a long time now and other customers are getting annoyed of the slow line-up).

In the backroom office, she re-assures me that K Bank will make the transaction reversal and she prints a document that has been emailed over from K Bank. She explains that from her previous experiences (clearly this has happened before), especially with Chinese tourists, they are able to use the K Bank document to dispute the charges with their banks. She also explains that these international bank transfers can sometimes take up to 1-2 months but I will definitely receive my money in the end.

I look at the receipt (which had language and spelling errors) and tell that her I cannot accept this. I start demanding for a refund at the store. Again, I explain that I do not want to have to dispute with my bank because of a failure at Uniqlo / K Bank. I tell her that I can't trust the document as the total amount is not reflected on the receipt.

Uniqlo store manager reiterates that these cases have happened before multiple times and other customers were willing to accept the document to dispute with their bank. This is where I get the sense / suspect that Uniqlo cashiers are instructed to charge multiple times (when there is no ""declined"" receipt). They rather overcharge customers and pass the burden over to them.

At this point - I've been at the store for 4 hours. I tell the store manager to detail the case of what happened (on the K Bank receipt) and to indicate the total amount that is owed to me. She agrees and signs on it (see attached). The store manager tells me that she will follow up with K Bank for a solution, and she will also explore with Uniqlo HQ if there are any alternative solutions (i.e. giving me a refund) and that she will get back to me by Monday 1230pm. I ask for a number that I can contact her at (Uniqlo has a separate mobile phone for store matters).

On monday, I received no call and decided to so I called at 130pm. A staff member by the name of Fish explains that Mint (store manager) is on her break. She tells me that Mint may not be available later in the day....so I try to explain the case to her, while she tries to keep brushing me off ....saying she knows about the case and ""HQ is following up on the matter"". I tell her to let Mint know to call me back or I will have to come down to the store. She says that Mint will return at 3pm and call me back then.

At 3pm...I don't receive a call. I waited till around 350pm to call the store again, but no pick-up.

10 minutes later (4pm)...I receive a call from Mint who explains that HQ had instructed her not to call me while they sort out the matter. She gives me an update that HQ is following up with K Bank and there will be an update on Tuesday. She tells me that I do not have to follow up any longer and that no dispute with my bank is necessary as K Bank will follow up on the matter and ensure that UOB will cancel the transaction on my credit card. She also explains that they have a deadline with K Bank for an update latest by Tuesday and she will contact me then.

I tell her that I'm not interested with how they follow-up with K Bank, but that she promised to explore the refund solution. She says she will check with HQ again and that they will contact me back. Before we hang up, I tell her that I still want an update by Tuesday.

(I can't remember now if what happens next is on Monday or Tuesday) but I receive a call from a lady explaining that she is from Uniqlo's call center support to give me an update regarding the case. She says that HQ is still following up with K Bank on the matter....

I ask for her name (I make it a point now to ask for the name of every person I'm speaking to) and she tries to avoid answering this. I keep asking and she finally tells that she is Phannita. I explain that I have requested for alternative solutions and there has been no update on that. Anyway, at this point I'm ready to accept a proper letter from Uniqlo + K Bank that I am being over-charged.

She says she will follow up on the request for a letter. On Tuesday, I do not remember receiving a call (the above may have happened on Tuesday morning)...but I remember considering to call them around 750pm on Tuesday but decide that it's already too late and nothing will move forward anyway.

On Wednesday morning, I receive a call from another call center agent telling me that he managed to get a letter and he will be sending it to me. He tells me his name (I had to ask for it for at least 3 - 4 times). I don't remember his name now...

I check my email and the exact same document that was issued by the store manager is issued to me. I see the funny side of this...but am more annoyed than anything.

Please advise on what I should do next.

522,"me and my mom have always been close. i tell her everything. it doesn’t feel weird. 

a few months ago i had an issue with two of my ex-friends (they were just being cruel etc.) and so i told my mom, as usual. it wasn’t like snitching, i just talk to my mom a lot, she helps me cope , because i have anxiety and depression and she is always there for me. 

i didn’t think she’d do anything... 

a week or so after i tell my mom one of my teachers calls me up and talks to me... IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS. one of my ex friends was in there too. it was so humiliating. she basically asked if i was “OK” and if “anyone was bothering me” and if “anyone was i could talk to the teachers”, and “somebody told the teachers that you were having a tough time”... like wtf i’m 14 i don’t have to be a snitch. everyone in class heard... i was so embarrassed. 

and i was like “who would tell the teachers that... only a few people knew that the ex friends were bothering me. “

i went home and told my mom, and she acted surprised... like “who would do that”.  i asked her if she said anything and she said no. (note: at this time i wasn’t suspicious of her at all)

today (like 2-3 months later) i borrowed her email because i had previously signed up to something through it, and had to check. and then i saw my name in her inbox . i know i shouldn’t have snooped but i did. 

it was a message thread of my teacher and my mom. first she asks to talk to the teacher in private, and that “my daughter doesn’t even know i’m contacting you.” basically now i know she is the one who told the teachers... i have ALWAYS told her ever since i was a little girl that i NEVER want her to go to the teachers/school about anything. 

3/4 of my teachers confronted me at school about it and arranged for my classes to be changed away from the ex friends. i was happy to be away from them, but not anymore. i’m just humiliated. 

in the email, my mom was always asking my teacher what i was doing in class, who i was sitting with, MONITORING ME. WHO DOES THAT. DONT I TELL HER ENOUGH ABOUT MY LIFE WITHOUT HER STALKING ME?! i’m infuriated. i’m embarrassed. i cant believe it. i don’t want my teachers to look at me like i’m a baby who needs mommy’s help. 

i don’t know if i can ever trust my mom with anything again. 

i subtly brought it up today... saying i saw a picture of the friends and it brought up “bad memories”... like being humiliated in school. i said “i’m still confused who would tell the teachers that. who do you think it was?”... and she just acted like she knew NOTHING about it. 

i don’t know what to do... sometimes it feels like my mom is my only friend because all my friends are kinda fake. i thought i could trust her. i’m doubting everything in my life now... what else has she done behind my back... what else will she do behind my back?

honestly sometimes if i don’t tell her things it bottles up inside me, she’s likes my human diary, i don’t know what i would do without talking to her about personal stuff all the time. i thought she was the only person i could talk to in the world with confidence... because that’s what mothers are for right? i don’t want this to happen again. i feel betrayed. lost. 

please help. do i continue to trust her? do i confront her? or do i just stop telling her about everything. that would really make me depressed.

thank you :(",26Jun2019,1
523,Sorry for the long post but I (20M) just need some opinions. I meet this girl in my one uni classes in February. Turned out she was in 2 of my classes and we became friends. Like a month in I was going to ask her out but at the time I had school and other stuff going on so I didn’t have time. We were friends for the next couple months and I asked her to lunch around finals time and she said she had a lot of studying to do. Which I completely got. After the finals we were talking and she mentioned how we should hang out sometime during the summer. Couple weeks into the summer I texted her cause I had like 3 weeks without work or class to see if she wanted to hang out. She said she was busy with work that week but she will let me know. Some family stuff happened and I forgot about it but then realized it was 3 weeks later so I thought I was just ghosted and she was just kind of done which I was like aight shit happens. But then yesterday I was leaving this place that she was at and she like yelled my name across the place to wave so now I’m real fuckin confused. I didn’t know she was there so if she was ghosting she probably wouldn’t have said anything so I’m confused. Like I haven’t texted her in like 4 weeks so what do I even text her now that I kind of know I’m not ghosted. Like “hey how’s your summer going” or something. I still want to ask her out but we are taking the same class in the August semester so should I just wait till uni starts back up? Sorry for long post but any help would be great.,26Jun2019,2

526,"Our home has been taking over by all of these little flies. They’re all up in the garbage, the bread and produce, the TOILET, and the bag where we keep our empty soda cans. They are absolutely everywhere and it’s pissing me off. I don’t even like going in our bathroom since who wants to have to open the lid and wave out a swarm of flies just to sit and have them flying all around the bathroom while you shit. 

I’m assuming they’re coming in from the back door since we leave it open sometimes so the dogs can go out. There’s a screen but it’s just a flappy mesh thing, and doesn’t have a magnetic closure so the bugs can easily come in.

First question is: are these likely to be gnats or fruit flies? 

Second question: how do we get rid of these bastards????

527,"So bit of backstory, me \[24M\] and my brother\[18M\] have moved back to the united states with our father\[54M\] from India after my parents got divorced in 2012. Mother lives there and havent seen her in 6 years. My dad has become an alcoholic through all the stress and negativity he went through. My brother who has now started college just this year has started dating this girl who goes to a different university. Hes obsessed with her and just recently got his first job to try and prove to my dad hes worthy of being in a relationship. Problem is, he doesnt do much anything at home but clean his own room. His ego has inflated to the size of a blimp. I support my dad in help with his business, kitchen, errands, and I work and go to school. Im not saying he should quit his relationship. My girlfriend sees that hes not mature enough to do what he is doing rn too. Shes 26 and admits its wrong that he spends nearly 12 hours outside the house because he goes to work for 4-5 hours, then hangs at his baes house till 1 am. This is becomming a daily habit. Ontop of that he thinks the new 2017 camry my dad bought as a family car is his possession. He uses it to go to work, his girl's and do all kinds of nonsesne shit when he doesnt even pay the monthly payments or insurance for it. He doesnt even pay his own phone bill even though he makes 800 a month. Seriously, my dad had gotten tired of this and told him to sign an eviction notice yesterday. He actually did it when i told him straight up to apologize and not cause any unwanted issues. What can I do? Hes stubborn and ignorant but he is my baby brother and dont want to see him go.

530,"I’m a 21 year old guy. I’ve been planning to attend college for about 6 months. 2 months ago, I decided I do not want to attend. There has been a death in the family, my parents got divorced, etc and I just want to move and transfer jobs. I don’t have much money. Well, my step-great grandfather gave me $5,000 for college tuition about 3 months ago. I told my immediate family I don’t want to attend and that I want to give the money back and move away to start a new life. They said fine, but don’t give him the money back. Reason being, he’s in his 80’s, he’s a millionaire and he has done nothing but cheat and steal from this family since my great grandmother passed nearly a decade ago. Normally and obviously my first intention was to give it back, thank him again for doing it in the first place, etc. But, my family is saying “don’t you dare”.

532,"I don't want to make this long so I won't get into too much detail.
My family is comprised of 6 including me, my single mum, brother 12y/o and a 8, 6 and 4 year old sisters; my mum is struggling with huge debt whilst paying off the house, car, bills, putting food in our mouth all whilst working full time. I work part time at fast food but I don't get paid very much. 
Often,  my mum would ask to borrow money to pay for petrol or food and promises to pay me back the next week. It's  a poor system because that very next week she would borrow again and again. I don't make much money myself, about $90 a week. I asked for more hours but it my availability made it impossible to balance study, work and family. 

At night when we're all asleep I would hear her sobbing whilst she secretly drinks her pain away. (Not getting drunk, I think) 

I would often buy food and help pay stuff including excursions for the kids but the only problem is that I want to save for a car but every week I'd end up broke and waiting for the next pay day.

This situation is very hard on me and especially my mum. I don't want my siblings to know of the situation. My dad is overseas. My mum hates him.

My mum loves us very much and would give her flesh for us to eat but I feel as though there is things I can do but those things would mean I'd have to sacrifice my goals.

TLDR: I (17) make it my goal to support my depressed mum financially even though I earn little but it stops me from buying a car.

Any advice would be appreciated. (I definitely don't want to drop from school, mum would never forgive me for risking her life trying to get me to Australia and dropping out of school)",26Jun2019,2

it doesn’t matter how much food i eat. i have a high metabolism, food doesn’t do much.

i also have trouble gaining muscle. and i’m trying to be more consistent with workouts and trying to incorporate weight. but it’s not going so well.

does anyone have any tips on how to gain weight? i’m currently 52kg, and i’m 5’4 (17 F) i know i am at an appropriate weight for my age and height, but i want to gain at least 5-10lbs. preferably muscle but i’m okay with gaining fat too.

i’m tired of looking so small and lanky. i’ve always loved the way thicker women look. and i want to look like that for me. not because the internet says it’s beautiful.

any tips? even if they’re small!

The reason I am telling you about this is because I love animals. The only reason I like his house is because of 2 of those dogs that I grew up with. 

Another problem is that he makes me do a bunch of things I am not interested in such as going out on the water. I don’t have anything there I want to do, and while I am there I constantly think about when I get to go back to Mom’s house. I have told him I don’t want to leave my bird for that long, and he says I am being ridiculous. I have told him I have nothing to do there and he tells me that I should do the stuff he takes me out to do because I don’t know my interests yet. But he doesn’t listen when I tell him my interests. I like writing, poetry, and doing charity work for animals. The main problem is that all his interests collide with mine. He always does the stuff he wants to do and yells at me for not enjoying them. I like playing sports, but hate going to games. He hates playing sports, but loves going to games. He loves music, i hate it, he hates being alone, i love being alone.

552,"I bought a used 2009 Subaru legacy with 52k miles on it with a warranty and gap insurance 5 months ago. I financed the car through my credit union, for even though it was at a 8.8% interest rate, the over all balance of the 60 month loan could be paid off within a year, or 2. I purchased the car from a ford dealership. I live in the northern mountains, and have only ever driven subarus exceeding 150k miles previous to this car. 

I admittedly should have not put so much faith in this engine, even if it only had 52k miles on it. I was just under a thousand miles for it's next required oil change by the warranty/dealership. However, going to work yesterday my check engine light came on. My first instinct was to check the oil level, as I am no stranger to the 2.5 Subaru engine. Sure enough, after 4 months, the engine dumped about 4 quarts of oil, and did significant damage to the engine. I somehow was able to drive the car (after refilling the oil) an hour south to the dealership where it died in the parking lot. They told me that they believe it will be covered by the warranty, however, wont know a hundred percent until they dismantle the engine. Unfortunately, being a ford dealership, they only have one mechanic that's Subaru certified, and couldn't dismantle and replace the engine until the 10th. The dealership was incredibly kind, and took pity on my poor soul. I did not know this was a thing, however, they somehow pimped my repair/warranty out to the closest Subaru dealership, where the warranty pays for towing. The Subaru dealership is dismantling it today, and I have to go in around 3 to pick up my loaner until it is done, and see if there is any news on the car.

I typically have a distrust for these types of situations. For obviously their profits mean more than my life. So I am kind of pessimistic. Even though I am confident that a 56k mile engine should not dump 4 quarts of oil and blow up within 4 months, they have no real incentive but to f- me, as that is an expensive job. I am incredibly nervous and don't know what to do exactly if they try and claim it's not covered by my warranty. I can not afford to put in a new engine at all. 

Is it possible to total the car, since an engine would be just under the KBB for the car at what I paid for, through my insurance? Is that a thing? Would the gap insurance cover the remaining balance on my loan, as well?

554,"Okay first of all that shouldn’t be a question that is asked, I don’t know what I should be paid or what exactly they do.

I’ve currently been in my field for a year now, low voltage technician work, and I landed an interview with a bigger company. My main goal, at first, with that interview was to see what other options existed and use it as leverage to get a raise where I’m currently working. I really enjoyed the place but it’s definitely a lot more work to be done. A lot of my job now is mainly residential work, running wires (~50) and installing and the other one is strictly commercial work. They have 300 cat6 runs for a Wells Fargo job coming up. 

Sadly, I didn’t know that until later on in the interview. One of the first few questions he asked me was “what would you like to be paid” and I answered it so wrong. I’m currently making $13/hr straight out of hs with a good background in IT and I answered “15-18.” Keep in mind I had no clue they did hospitals, offices etc. so I didn’t know how tough the work would be. He replied with a funky smirk and “that’ll be no problem.” 

Where I am currently working I have way better health care with a $3,000 deductible, and where I’m looking at now I would have to pay ~200 a month for worse insurance with a $5,700 deductible. I didn’t know about that until after the interview. If he did start me at the low end, $15, I would be making less and driving a good bit farther. 

I really liked the place and there’s so much more room for growth there, our entire office right now is a side room of the owners house. I just don’t see a point in going there if I’d only be making $15. Especially with the fact I’m planning on renting a house soon with some friends, currently sleeping on a couch so no bills for me yet. I’m only 19 so I know I don’t have much room for negotiation but I feel like I shouldn’t be paid less than $18/hr for this job.

And I crushed that interview, he absolutely loved me and my vision.

TL;DR had an interview for a bigger company and I lowballed myself on pay. Work would be substantially more difficult than I was expecting.

Need advice on how to approach this guy and explain that $15 wouldn’t cut it even tho I initially said $15-18.
— should I make the switch regardless, bigger company, plenty of room for growth with the company but just a lot harder work, I’m not opposed to more difficult work just not at that price.",26Jun2019,2

We happily dated for the rest of that school year, but it's summer again, and I'm starting to get more bad feelings. I love her, but the routine we seem to find gets dull fast, and looking forward, I can see a likely repeat of last year. My communication skills with her have improved, but I don't know if that's enough. Advice for why I might keep defaulting to leaving her would be really appreciated. 
If it helps, I am suspicious that what I like about dating is developing a crush on a girl, and falling for her, that first stage where she starts to notice me and we grow together. I love being nervous on a first date, and all the new things that start happening in the first few months.

559,"I realise that this is probably quite a common occurrence for a lot of people in similar positions but I'm usually a very chilled person who doesn't get worked up over a lot, however as of late I've been feeling a lot more anxious and lost than I ever have before. 

Firstly, for the past few years somebody close to me has had some serious issues dealing with addiction and a number of other mental health issues, all of which they adamantly ignore and keep telling themselves that they're fine. They've cut off all of their friends (and I mean ALL) and are slowly pushing their family and I further away. This was all unfolding over the 3 years I was away at University so I wasn't around a lot of the time to see what was really going on. I finished the end of last June and have seen just how drastically this persons life and behaviour have changed and it just seems to be getting worse (we've had 4 quite heated incidents since I've been home where we've had to involve police, the latest just last week). The real problem however is the fact that he is heavily interested and passionate about these drugs that he likes to take and has even been studying parts under the subject at university (he went for a year and was kicked out). He won't listen to anyone, won't take any advice or information he doesn't want to hear and is becoming progressively incoherent and offensive toward his family.

I've worked mainly in a bar since I left University and have done odd work placements and tried to carry on my professional practice along the way (I'm an arts graduate, interested mainly in illustration and photography). However I've not really pursued any of it really that intently, producing hardly any work since leaving, and I've quite honestly lost a lot of interest in my chosen subjects all together for whatever reason. I recently quit my job at the bar because of a fall out with a change of management (I had worked there for 4 years previously on and off) and have just finished a 2 month long agricultural job leaving me currently unemployed and at a bit of a stand still. I just have no idea what I want to do now, and what I should be doing about this person close to me as well, I've just gone blank. I've had such little motivation because of them playing on my mind all the time and I don't know how to balance my concern for them and concern for my life. The upside is that I have saved a reasonable amount of money over this period, leading me to feel as if I should just get up and go somewhere with what I have and figure the rest out along the way. But that obviously that would mean leaving the ones I love as well as lots of good friends.

I know this all seems like a bit of a incoherent ramble and I've not really even scratched the surface but I felt I needed some different perspectives, however short, long, useful or useless you think it may be.

TL;DR: how do i stop feeling guilty about working and focusing on priorities over my social life when people make me feel so? 

i tend to ramble and get off track a lot so i’m going to keep this as straight to the point as i can. currently i’m 19(F) and my entire life i’ve dealt with my sad being sick and most recently for the past three or so years it’s been both of my parents now battling with cancer at the same time. i’ve always had to take care of my parents, they don’t know much english so at a younger age it was going to almost every hospital visit and translating and most recently it’s been paying bills and working a lot to not only help them get by but also pay for my college expenses. On top of that i’m in a sorority and have a well established relationship so my time is often cut into family, school/work,  relationship, and sorority with little wiggle room for much else. 
For awhile i didn’t feel guilty about being so busy and wrapped up in my own life.  i figured i had an active enough social life with my sorority and saw my friends often enough during around campus when classes were in session and i could bare staying up late after my shifts to get assignments and studying done. However recently it’s felt as though friends i’ve made throughout the years are angry at me, angry that i’ve somehow chosen myself over them by working more hours and being busy. they take it as though i’ve neglected them and our friendship when i’ve always been just a text or phone call away. 
eventually i’ve now started to become guilty and anxious. anxious that my life is passing me by and that i’ve been too grown up this entire time when i should’ve been dumb and had fun like almost every other person my age. i’m scared of moving out of my home and starting my own life when my parents have depended on me so much but i deserve my own life too don’t i? Deep down i know that’s the “typical” way young adults should be living but my life isn’t the typical young adult life. i just want to learn how to get past the guilt of being busy and focusing on the right things rather than prioritizing and going out with friends constantly.",26Jun2019,2

562,"So this is my first post. I'm on here as a way to gain insight as to how to navigate this insane flood of chaos of my life has turned into in a few short weeks. 

Recently, I've proposed the idea to my husband of 2 years (together for 7) that we should open our relationship. As I'm sure anyone can anticipate, he did not welcome the idea with open arms and last night, in an attempt to reconcile these feelings, we stayed up all night on the phone (he's currently working a billion miles away in a different state for another week) scream-crying and arguing about this with each other. And now, I think he feels defeated and willing to give me what I wants, but at the expense of his own happiness.

Why do I want an open marriage?
Well, I recently discovered that monogamy does not suit my personality. I've always felt sincere and strong attractions to other people, but have always felt confined to the boundaries of a committed relationship. What we have is safe and secure and comfortable and I love it, but it's mundane and boring and there's no spark between us anymore...not to mention the sex is practically non-existent. At least emotionally.

In addition, I'm only 22 years old. We married young and I plan to stay with my husband forever, but I need time in my life to experience romantic and sexual relationships with other people. Does that make me a horrible person?? I feel like I'm ruining everything.

And believe me when I say that I want more than anything for my husband to go out on dates and sleep with other women. I cannot, and should not be expected to, be everything and do everything for one person. I feel owned. I don't feel like a person. And I know that I need to allow him the same freedom without judgement that I'm seeking.

So I need some objective advice. Do I take a stand for what I believe in and need and open this relationship with the possibility that I could be hurting the person I love most in the world? Or do I accept this committed  monogamous relationship, keeping my significant other happy, but sacrificing my own happiness?",26Jun2019,4
563,"Hey everyone, I am wondering is it ok to ask a girl's phone number after only meeting them once??

Like for example, I am going out tonight with a 20 somethings Meetup group for drinks at a really nice and awesome pub/bar and there is going to be quite a few girls there as well. 😁

And if I get on reasonably well and having a laugh with one of the girls or some of the girls there tonight.

This is my question is it ok to ask a girl's phone number after only meeting them once?? Or should I wait a couple times after to ask them for their phone number?? And girls, what would you think if a guy you just met once but got on reasonably well with each other ask for your phone number?? 🤔🤔

So if it is ok to ask a girl's phone number after meeting them once, What is the absolute best way to ask for a girl's phone number?? 

I am sure countless times in the past that lots of guys and girls who got in to a relationship together or became girlfriend and boyfriend, the guy asked the girl's phone number the 1st time they met each other. 🙂

I mean the thing is that most of the girls are new(and a couple girls are regulars) and they may never come back again to this 20s somethings Meetup group after tonight, so if I don't ask them their phone number then I definitely missed my big big opportunity to get to know them better and meeting up with them in the near future and who knows maybe ultimately get a girlfriend out of it as well. 🙁

I am asking this just in case when it does happen in the future because I am completely clueless and not too sure about this type of things with girls. 🙂",26Jun2019,1

Yesterday they told me they were finally getting a divorce. Here is the thing I'm pissed I'm beyond pissed I'm soo hot-headed I could probably bake a turkey in my damn brain right now. However, I'm not mad because they are getting divorced I'm mad because a year ago almost to the day I was suspicious of them getting divorced it was soooo obvious. It was a major fuck up in my life like my dad was found on bumble my mom was stealing money or some shit, and my dad was NEVER home, basically it was a cluster fuck for a couple of months but they made sure to tell me everything was fine, adults fight, not all couples are the same, and that they are not going to get divorced. They yesterday I was told by my dad they are getting a divorce and they have been planning on it for a GOD DAMED YEAR !!!! This is a lot for me mostly because I'm adopted and my birth family fell apart and now this family is too. I know I should be mature about it I just can't I feel deceived and they won't even give me the whole truth for as to why my mom claims she isn't ready but I'm 18 I deserve to know why the only thing I have is falling apart. I have no idea how to handle this I was crying so much that I had a severe panic attack and it has made me physically sore today. I just want to know what to do and how to deal with this.",26Jun2019,1
566,"Whenever I tried talking to people they either show disinterest or start talking to someone else and push me out of the conversation. I even noticed that my friends  didn't care to interact with me unless they needed a favour or I was their last resort friend. I'm positive that this has to do with not being a good conversationalist and inability to open up easily. I haven't exactly had a proper conversation with my peers for the last 4 or 5 years, other than when it was necessary for them to, but now that I'm heading to college I want to turn the socialising part of my life at least around and at least have a solid social group I'm a part of.",26Jun2019,1
569,"Vague title, I know.

Basically my friend got a boyfriend who's couple of years older than her and its just not sitting right with me. We're close, and I'm worried about her. He's a good 2 years older, and she's 14, he's just left school.

I was groomed a few years ago and while it wasn't as bad as some I'm still suspicious. He's very attractive and it seems a bit too good to be true. It also doesn't help that she's getting closer to being more than a friend. I don't want to be that one jealous friend but I also don't want to sit on the sidelines if she gets pressured into anything. 

Am I right to be suspicious or should I bite my tounge and be happy for her?",26Jun2019,1

572,"Apologies for formatting, I’m on mobile.

All four of us are girls in our early twenties. We attended college together for four years, and I was roommates with two of them for two years. 

We would regularly hang out, watch movies, do trivia nights, sing in the same choir, etc together. I thought I had a good friendship with each of them, as I would hang out with each one separately as well as in the group.

My last contact with Friend A was right after our graduation from undergraduate studies, when she moved out. We hugged and I told her I’d see her at Friend B’s wedding with Friend C - she did not show up to Friend B’s wedding. 

My last voluntary contact with Friend B was at her wedding over a year ago, where we laughed and cried and she wrote me a thank you note for my admittedly lack luster gift.

I saw Friend C the most recently, when we went to a convention together last summer. 

Friend A stopped texting me immediately after moving out.

Friend B stopped texting me after last November when I invited her to hang out and she declined. Admittedly, I may have tried guilting her into coming because it was my birthday, but she has not replied to a single text since then.

Friend B recently walked into my place of work, and she looked like a deer in the headlights when she saw me, made very stilted small talk, and has yet to come back. 

The night after that happened I texted all three of them, offering them photos of them that I had on my phone from when we would hang out. Friends A and B did not respond.

Friend C hasn’t responded to any of my texts since last summer save for when I texted her happy birthday - where she replied with a ‘thanks man’ and when she asked me to send the pictures to her email. It’s been radio silence since then.

I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what I could’ve done, or if I even did anything. I parted with all three on good terms. I admit that I can be prideful and argumentative but we didn’t have any arguments or anything. I never said anything but kind words to them. 

I don’t know what to do. I still have their numbers. I’m still friends with them on Facebook, I still know friends A and C’s tumblrs and my account isn’t blocked from them. Hell, I know Friend A’s reddit profile.

But it’s been a year since I last spoke to any of them and they haven’t returned even one text. 

What should I do? I thought they were the friends I’d have for the rest of my life, that I’d eventually be asking them to come to MY wedding/be bridesmaids. 

I’d appreciate any advice. Thank you.",26Jun2019,2

My mom agreed to look for the keys SHE LOST several months ago, but she refuses to give me a spare so I could use it when she's not around/available or if she loses them again. She claims that she wouldn't be able to afford it. She makes about 11.80-something$. While my father has bought 3 Air conditioners, can afford to have them used all night long, on his minimum wage job, in a poorer, run down house, WITH 3 DOGS TO TAKE CARE OF. ""Can't afford it"" my ass! She never uses the damn thing and wants me to suffer because she never has to deal with what I do. My dad offered to let me live with him, and with that, comes the air conditioning and heat I'd need for the months I'd need it. BUT... With my mom, is my cat, Tigger, we got him a while ago and I fear that if I left, she would no longer have reason to keep him around, I'm not sure, but what I do know, is that my dad couldn't take on 4 animals with the minor assistance of my brother, who pays rent as well (cheap, and recently he didn't have to because of an exchange over his old car to my dad). If I choose to stay with my mom, and she loses the keys, or won't let me use the AC in this temperature, I'm just going to have to break the damn casing, like it's gotten to that point, she's stubborn and won't listen, and my dad says I don't need to deal with that.

I wrote my teacher a letter asking for help and advice:

 Hello Ms. (keeping her name blurred),

My family and I received a call stating that i didn't receive a credit in your class. 

Listen, i'm going to stray away from being formal here but right now my family has turned against me, and I don't know what to do. There is a reason why i didn't do well in your class and it's linked to personal reasons involving relationships and depression. I know that i need to ask you for help but I could never find the will-power to ask. I would skip your class and i know that you know that I skipped, but I skip your class because I'm scared to look you in the eye, I don't know why and I never thought I would tell anyone that. We never have conversations and that's my fault, but I'm begging you, please, I know that you don't like me as a person because of these reasons and I don't want to dishonor my family anymore. I just want to go to University and put this behind me. I need this credit to graduate. I know you just finished with correcting and inputting information into the system, and you have probably received a few emails like this, but I don't want to be the first in my family to not go to a university. My family makes it hard on me but I wouldn't listen to them because I was going through issues myself. I would also really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell anyone or refer me to anyone because I want this to be 1:1 with you. I don't normally under-perform in classes up to this magnitude, and right now as I'm writing this email, I know that you're in a happy mood, you probably won't want to empathize, or couldn't care less as to what I'm going through because you know that you worked hard and I didn't. That's fair, but I've never written an email like this and I'm not even sure if you'll read it. I wanted to write an email because I know that if i tried talking to you in person I wouldn't have the will-power to even look at you in the eye. I'm sorry I let you down, and I just need advice and help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need help. Don't refer me to call lines or anything, if there are solutions please fire them at me, This is the first time I've ever used reddit, and I know the internet likes to crack jokes a lot. but please be mindful.",26Jun2019,2
580,"My best friend started dating one of my good friends brothers. They've been together for about 2 months now and I honestly cannot stand them together. 
I already was not the biggest fan of her boyfriend. I find him selfish, a hypocrite (more than most people), difficult to deal with, and completely the opposite of understanding. 

My best friend is an amazing person who messes up sometimes but it usually always there for me.


 Every since she started dating this guy she is rarely around and if she is, she brings him. 

I've confronted her about how I feel about her not making time for me, which she's denied. 

I, however, have not told her *directly* how I feel about hey new man. 

Whenever I've hinted at it she defends him. Which I understand. 

No one in our friend group likes them together, we believe they bring it the worst in each other. No one wants them around. 

I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. I obviously want her to be happy, but I can't be happy with him around all the time. 

What should I do?",26Jun2019,2
581,"As the title says I am planning on dropping this bomb and I honestly have never been more scared of anything in my life. Back story is that my wife was married previously and had my daughter with her ex-husband. After his abuse eventual drug habit, she left. Long story short, after the divorce, we met and got hitched. 

I met my daughter when she was 1 and married her mother 2 months before her 3rd birthday. I have been dad for as long as she can remember. When she was 5 I legally adopted her and her bio dad no longer has any parental rights. My daughter has been 12 for a few months now and just before summer break started her school did a health class that explained everything about how children come to be and although I'm sure she already had a general idea, that was what I was waiting for before I told her all of this just so I could be sure she understood exactly what I was talking about. 

I want to tell her before it eventually comes out by other means and because it is important information to have as far as medical history. The bio dad had not been in contact with her since she was 2 and don't know if he even would want contact, honestly doesn't matter either way.

So if there is anybody that has been through this, from either side, I could use any advise you can give me. I just don't want this to crush her. To be clear, I have never lied to her or told her I was there for events that I wasn't. I don't have a time machine so unless you have one I can borrow, don't tell me how I should have done it sooner.

At first I was happy and felt like I had a sense of purpose but then everything started to fall apart for no apparent reason. I started thinking I was boring and ugly which then turned into deep hatred for my own self just because I don't think I'm good enough and I'm not the best at social interactions. I have a decent amount of friends but they would laugh at me If I ever spoke to them personally about this. 

We talk at least once a day and I manage to make her smile and she always says that I'm one of the only people that listens to her but that's never enough for my happiness.

I've even started crying at random times such as in the middle of class but I try my best at hiding it.

I've been in a relationship before but after how it ended it up it really took a toll on my confidence, self esteem and I've started getting a lot quieter lately.

583,"I was recently hired at a little market It’s cool it’s my first job it’s chill but there’s some BLARING ISSUES all of my own creation because I’m a dumbass. 

I interviewed for a part time position sometime in march. They told me (my boss) that if I were hired They’d call me the coming Tuesday after reviewing the other candidates. They didn’t call a week after that Tuesday so I made arrangements to go see my new born nephew out of province and I bought tickets for a convention out of province. Cause I thought work wasn’t happening.

A month later, last week, I get a rushed call a day before my last exam if I’d be able to come in that evening however I am studying so I’m scheduled for the afternoon of the next day. 

So I have been to four days of work and I had to call in sick today cause I got strep haha lol cute love it teehee I feel like I’m making an ass of myself it’s my first kick at the can and it’s all going to shit. 
I realized I needed to tell her asap that I have tickets bought and this is all a cluster I’ve spent under twenty minutes with my boss, 15 were from the interview and 5 was collectively in PASSING as she was leaving the store. I can’t call and give her a brief heads up because it’s the store phone and it interrupts work (it gets incredibly busy) and I cannot for the fucking life of me FIND AN EMAIL FOR MY BOSS. I feel defeated I feel like faking my own death. I feel like my boss doesn’t like me very much and I feel terrible.

So for a few months my boss was saying he didn’t want to be the “boss” anymore complaining about the task load etc. He then told the owner of our company this, she said okay and then came to me to fill this role. I gladly accepted as it’s more money and I feel I could provide a little extra in the role. My boss(before this switch in roles) told me he was looking for a new job, then told me he had a new job, worked the new job after using 3 sick days to work at the new job...then the new job said he wasn’t a good fit...so when he came back my owner told him I was taking the lead on all supervisor roles within the company...he then told her, he was still interested in being a supervisor blah blah blah. I don’t actually know what the conversation was like...but now we are co-managing(think Micheal and Jim) I’ve got less responsibilities but the same pay as a manager...but that wasn’t the point in why I took this position. I love our company and the work we do for veterans. Should I tell my boss he tried working another job? Should I tell my boss I feel like I’ve been short changed?

587,"We live a block or two away from my uncle. He’s mentally ill and has a serious hoarding problem. He moved in with my grandma after he filled his own house up with junk and was evicted. Now he’s filled her house up and is using her retirement money to pay off his storage lockers (which are filled with junk). He also recently found out he has cancer as well.

A few days ago he sent my parents a message about how he just lost two of his storage lockers and is probably going to lose the rest of them. He said he doesn’t have enough money to pay off my grandma’s property taxes anymore and to start thinking about where she’s going to live.

The reason I think he might hurt us is that he’s tried getting us to let him put some of his junk in our house and to let him sleep in our house since we live so close to him. We’ve been keeping our doors locked at all times and rarely ever answer when he comes to our door.

So we were really good friends with this one family back in the day and they had a daughter who I was also able to become good friends with since we were both the same age and went to the same school. It was in third grade when they moved across the country for various reasons and excluding one or two short events during past summers where there was no time at all to hang out or talk, we have not seen each other in 5+ years and are now in high school. It was decided that in the beginning of this summer (2019)  we would go visit them. We flew in and arrived at their house in the evening, spent two full days there, and left the following morning.

Now throughout the trip the daughter who I was friends with  was very quiet (which I can identify as part of her personality since I am a similar way) and whenever we were hanging out I tried to start a conversation a few times with all attempts not going anywhere. Overall she didn’t seem very interested in talking, but did not seem to be mad at me, was not giving off any bad vibes, and seemed glad that we were visiting them (even giving me a hug before we left for the airport). As of now they hope to visit us and the family they have here around Christmas, and we hope to visit again either next summer, or the summer after that.

592,"So I recently joined a friend group and one of the members and I were talking.  I'm about a few months into the group and this other guy is about a year?

&amp;#x200B;

I joined through meetup and so did he.  I'm not really sure if the older members joined through meetup or just knew each other.  Regardless we're all in a Discord server (kind of like a fb group if you don't know).  The meetup exists mostly as a screener and it's not used for much else since there was a problem with creeps in the past.  The meetup itself also isn't very interesting; it's just a lunch talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Well there was a new rule that if you're not active in the server then you'll be semi-removed (able to do very basic things but not much else) which is fine, but the other guy brought up a point that if the rule existed when he was new then he would have never been as active as he is now since it took him a while to feel comfortable with the group.  It also got me thinking that maybe a lot of people who make it through the screening aren't exactly comfortable taking this huge jump to meet so many new people either.  I know when I first joined all the inside jokes definitely turned me off for a bit until I met more people in person, and I'm an extrovert so I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be for an introvert to pull that off.  I also think that we don't really gain interest from merely having a lunch talk as our introductory event.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we're arguing with the rest of the group, it turns into basically a shouting match where some people are saying we already have too many people and we should be more exclusive and that things are fine the way they are and they're glad that we're more of a small network of friends than a big group.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't necessarily think things are bad or anything, I just think they could be better.  It seems counter to the point of having a group and meetup to be exclusive like we are.  I understand liking having a smaller group, but at that point, why  bother making a generic meetup?  

&amp;#x200B;

Things got a little openly hostile at points (not from me, but some others got really emotional when we talked about being more ""inclusive"")  and I was a little hurt but ok for the most part.  I suppose my question is what should I do?  I really like them but I don't agree with their logic.  The topic was dropped for now and I don't want to beat a dead horse.  The other guy and I spoke about maybe making a better intro for the group but we don't know if the rest of the group will agree.

Are we in the wrong?  Does this make sense?  I feel like I'm rambling.

595,"I'm a female, 27 years old and at the beginning of this year, I moved in with my best friend since 2nd grade (who is a guy.) For the record, NO there's nothing like *that* going on, we're not each others types in any way. Just gonna get that out of the way.


As of recent, he's been going through a dry spell and is turning into the self proclaimed ""nice guy"". The type who claims he's not getting any because hes just ""suuuuuch a good guy"". He's not ugly whatsoever, he just chases after the types of women who don't know what the fuck they want, play hot and cold, get him to buy them shit, and just overall mess with his head. He says there no women that are into him which isn't true. The women who are interested are the ones he doesn't deem attractive enough.  

This nice guy phase has been getting tougher and tougher to deal with. It's getting to the point where he doesn't want to even hear about his friends relationships or weekend hookup stories. He's said it depresses him and he doesn't want to be reminded that he's not getting any. He even told one of his friends not to bring his girlfriend to the apartment anymore. 


I was pretty bummed too because she's cool as hell and it wasn't always a sausage fest. When all of the guys come over to watch a game, we would leave to go shopping or just hang out. 


So about the cock blocking,  I've had a friends with benefits situation going on for the past year. A few months ago, he moved to the next state over for a promotion at work. This weekend he's coming back to visit family and he wants to see me too. He's a great guy and even if he were to find someone else to get serious with, I'd be happy for him. I'm well overdue for some action to be honest so I was pretty excited when he told me. 


I let my roomie know he was coming over and spending the night. We would just stay in my room, order a pizza, watch Netflix and you know, hang out. We wouldn't be loud. I probably shouldn't have even told him but he was asking why I tidied up the apartment. I didn't even want to think about what would happen if I just brought him over without saying anything. My roomie lost his shit. 



I told him to stop being such a little bitch. If he's that desperate for some action, he should give other girls a chance, even if it's to give him some confidence and get him to shut the fuck up.  He said my friend was not allowed over and if I felt the need to be a ""stacy"" then I could go get a cheap hotel.

I'm fucking fuming. This would be the first guy I've ever had over at the apartment. I don't want to fuck up my credit by breaking the lease and lose my friend, but at the same time I want to be able to have the freedom to bring a guy over to my place. I understand guys and girls are different when it comes to this kind of stuff. What do I do? ",26Jun2019,1

So inside, I found he'd kept little diary sort of notes (I didn't read them, rocks, from a holiday I guess? signed school shirt, mementoes. the whole thing took maybe 5 seconds.  


But I got really emotionally upset and felt guilty. Not for finding the stuff but I felt guilty for.... well, being his father I guess? Like I should have done more. A sense that that it was too late.  
I don't have any conscious guilt about my parenting, no more than the next guy or parent rathermore not as far as I'm aware.  


So I wondered if it was an expected reaction, like the pang of fear when a child is late home. A Parenting reaction to seeing a person, with secret feelings and thoughts, not a child?

599,"So my internship will end on Friday and I have a feedback meeting with my manager. Overall it was okay but there were some things I downward hated while working with them. For example, she used me as a stress reliever and said some hurtful things to me. But since I'm a calm person, I took all her criticisms with quietude and never once I showed a nasty face / attitude no matter how badly she treated me. I also had a co-worker who had a junior position and was her intern just before me and she kept praising her and low-key showing me I wasn't at her level. 

Now I work in a field where there are some slim chances I'll meet her again and she has like 15+ years of experience than me so she'll be my senior no matter what. I'd like to say what's on my mind but I fear I'll just sabotage my own future. What should I do? Should I shut up and pretend she never did anything wrong or should I tell the truth?",26Jun2019,2
600,"I don't enjoy being alive.
I don't enjoy anything anymore.
Everything infuriates me. I always feel like I'm about to break.
I can't do it anymore.

I've been thinking of suicide since my early teens. It started as intrusive thoughts but as the years have went by I've always known I'd eventually die by my own hand. Either through sheer stupidity and clumsiness or deliberately. I'm just bored and tired. I sleep to pass the time because there's nothing for me to do in the hours between my shifts. I just exist to clean up after my coworkers and be ignored by my family and ""friends"".

I'm aware I'll never have the life I used to fantasise about as a child, I've grown into something too pathetic to be successful. I'm alone most of the time and prefer it that way but can't help but feel lonely all the time, almost like no one actually _knows_ me. No matter how much effort I put in I cannot meet new people and form a lasting connection, half of the time there's just no chemistry and even if there was, my sex drive is next to non-existent.

I'd love to leave, move away, restart, maybe somehow set myself up to be happy. But then I wonder if there's much point? Even when I've been ""happy"", I've still wanted to die, I've still wanted to just not exist in any capacity. So what will moving really achieve? Not that it's financially possible for me but even the thought feels pointless.

In my mind, if I'm not bothered in anyway about a career, cannot offer anything to the world and can't find love or people to surround myself with then what is the point? If I'm going to die in 60 plus years anyway, why not now? Why would I bother ""fighting on"" for years when I could just end it all now? I don't see the point. It frustrates me that no one else seems to think my way. 

Why am I labelled as selfish and mentally ill because I've took a step back and thought about myself realistically? I'm a literal waste of food, water and oxygen at this point. My organs could help others and I could be free.

But no, I'm selfish.

I won't lie to you r/Advice, if I had the backbone I'd be dead already and this wouldn't need to be posted but if I'm anything it's self aware. I'm a coward, I can't do that to my family. I've tried antidepressants and therapy, the pills don't work for long and the therapy is next to useless. 

What do I do? Seriously what the fuck do I do?",26Jun2019,7
601,"Hi, so I have this big problem with never really contributing to online group chats that I'm in. This can range from a small group chat with people who I consider close friends, to people I'll be working with at an upcoming summer internship. But my main 'worry' and what I would say I'm seeking advice about most here is I was added to this relatively small (~25 people) discord server and I know deep down I really want to become friends with these people, but every time I go to type a message out I stop my self. It's like I'm scared about what they might think about what I said and my mind always goes to the worst conclusions when it comes to this.

I feel like I'm really missing out on chatting with these people and others as well in other chats and it gets me down. I was just wondering if anybody had been in a similar situation and solved it or had some ideas about what I could try? Thanks!!",26Jun2019,2

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",26Jun2019,0

609,"I have a severe storm phobia.
To make matters worse, the country where I live has been under severe weather alerts for 2 months now. There were flash floods, big damaging hail, really strong wind. 

To fight this phobia, I joined a local storm chasing FB group where members post weather info, forecasts as well as enchanting photos and videos of storms, to try to better understand them. 

We left for vacation on Sunday, three families with three young kids. I had my eyes on the sky, the radar, on the forecast, silently scouting for potentially dangerous situations. 

The first one was while driving on a mountain pass, 2000 m altitude. The previous day forecast warned about a severe storm system getting in that area in the afternoon. Not a good place to be caught in by it. I insisted before we left that we need to be off the mountain by 3 pm because of it. Once we reached the top, our local alert system issued a level 2 (out of 3) warning for storms. The skies darkened and without mentioning the storm forming, I simply suggested we leave because it was cold and there was no bathroom. Later that night the storm system wreaked havoc throughout the western part of the country with wind speed reaching 100km/h

The second close call was on the highway close to our destination . I noticed high clouds and checked the radar. There were storm cells on our right and left with an small clear corridor straight along the highway. We stopped at one point, I took photos and noticed the northern cell was getting bigger and heading south towards us, so I ushered to leave because ""we have 20 more km to the hotel, I can't wait to see the sea!"" and we passed through the storms. 

A bit later in I could see the cell approaching fast with clouds resembling a shelf cloud, very dark clouds, signaling severe weather behind it. I got scared and radioed my family that ""the storm ahead looks severe, we need to hurry"". We got to the hotel as winds started. There was a lot of lightning. The storm bypassed our location but it was really intense, really strong wind, hail and caused a lot of damage in nearby cities. 

After this radio warning I was accused of creating panic for nothing, made fun of and I still didn't hear the end of it. 

What now?",26Jun2019,1
610,"So a bit about me... I’m 31 and live by myself. I’m in the U.K and live a few miles from the place I grew up (parents still live there) I work full time, 45 hours a week and I’m on minimum wage. I get paid weekly. I don’t have a car and don’t have any kids to pay for. I have a work van which needs me to have a place that either has a drive or suitable parking which lowers my renting options which in turn, ups the price. 

After I pay all my bills, I usually only have enough left to buy food for the week and that’s it. I can’t afford to get myself a car, I couldn’t even tell you the last time I bought myself some new clothes and god help me if I ever met a girl and wanted to take her on a date! Lol. 

It’s the whole finding a girl thing that brings me to my point... I know there’s a huge social stigma with someone my age still living with their parents, and I feel like if I met a girl I liked she would run a mile once she found out I was living with my parents at my age, but at the moment I’m just coming home from work everyday to an empty house where I’m deeply unhappy and can’t afford to do anything. 

So I guess what I’m asking is do you guys think I should suck it up and continue on the way I am, knowing that that’s what it means to be an adult  or should I move back in with parents where I could afford things like a car and new clothes that would make me feel happier and just wait for the right girl to come along.",26Jun2019,1
611,"I am an 18 year old girl who will be moving out of my foster house in a few days to live in my hometown, where I always wanted to move to, for college. I am so excited for college that I have had my backpack ready for it for a year now. I'm so excited to start over (even though I've lived there for 14 years of my life, not many people remember me for some reason). I have wanted to, for a very long time, give myself a new wardrobe and TRULY take care of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I take showers and don't smell or anything, but I do admit I really hate how I look. I don't really say how much I do to my boyfriend but I guess he's picked up on it. 

\- I feel overweight, I have slight curves but I have a pretty chubby stomach and it's something I am really self concious about.

\- My forehead is covered in acne scars, I have been using scar treatment gel lately.

\- My teeth aren't exactly white, so I'm using a new toothpaste for that.

\- My nose is way too big I think, I don't know I just see it that way.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend always reassures me I'm beautiful and sexy, and since I've always wanted to wear more skirts and dresses, he has encouraged me to do so. OK I should ellaborate, I am not fixing myself up to meet my boyfriend's ""standards,"" or whatever, I just really wanted a makeover for myself when I move to the new town. 

My boyfriend also says that I always ask him ""am I a good enough girlfriend?"" ""What do you think about what I'm wearing?"" Basically asking for his approval all the time, which I admit I do a lot. That's when he suggested the thing that I am self-loathing. I was kinda hurt at first but after we ended the call I looked up what I do that could bring me down.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Since I am in special education classes, me and him have this inside joke where I'm the ""retarded kid"" and I do stupid stuff, which I don't do, it's kinda like a ""what-if"", I could definitely see why that would tear my self esteem.

\- I always ALWAYS worry about making friends in college, since I have none now. My BF says that I don't understand social cues, which is true, since I had to take special classes for that in high school.

PLEASE READ

I know these are issues because these are what my therapist and I have been working on. I have had previous issues with jealousy and even though I have gotten over that mostly it still comes up. Mostly because I think ""those girls are so much cooler and prettier than me, they have normal lives, they seem awesome"" and it made me so angry. I have not have not had a friend since 8th grade, but I had to be moved to another placement and had no way to contact her. My BF makes friends so easily and I just feel awful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im asking for advice, mainly how to maybe boost my confidence? What can I do to help minimize with the jealousy? How can I lift myself up better? I truly do want to become better and make lots of friends.

TL;DR : I have a lot of issues with jealousy, self confidence and empowerment. What little things can I do to fix that? Oh and also to make friends! Thanks!",26Jun2019,2

613,"I met this woman through work; began a new job late last year, 

was very guarded and kept to myself... a few months later I decided to open up
a bit and have a conversation with her, it went well.

a few days later I asked her out and she denied me, told me that it wasn’t a good time which felt like an obvious cop out and just wanting to keep things calm at work..

a few months pass, all is fine at work between us, and I texted her just to see how she’s doing and really to learn more about her...

neither of us knew much about each other, yet came to realize that we share a lot of deep things in common.

with this mind, I figured she may be more open to getting lunch, yet her answer was the same...

she explained more about how she doesn’t want to get involved with any guys right now, how she wants to focus on personal growth in this time, she’s got other personal goals in this time.


when I asked “well how about when it’s a better time for you where you’re not busy, etc?”

... her answer to that was maybe, she just is focused on right now
and doesn’t know how she will feel in the future.

long story short, we agreed to play things by ear, see how she feels about meeting up a month etc from now.

I was pressing for a definite answer, just because I didn’t want to waste either of our time, but her honest answer is maybe because she doesn’t know how she’ll feel then, a few months from now.

She knows she doesn’t have to worry about hurting my feelings, sounds like she’s potentially curious about meeting up later on.

I can tell she’s attracted to me, at least earlier in the year she seemed flirty and showed signs of attraction... seems like she’s wanting to guard her heart in this time and focus on herself.

we’re both very genuine people, does it sound like she’s possibly interested?",26Jun2019,1

About 2 days ago someone contacted me here on reddit asking if he could use the my paypal acct to receive some money and I get to keep a portion of it. He never told me where he saw my account or whatsoever and it was a simple straightforward gig. I then receive a $450 and it’s placed on hold which I reckon would clear in about a week or so. So what’s gonna happen is that the money would be in my account. I wanted to stay in contact with the one who asked me to do this job but I can’t seem to find his messages on reddit anymore as I’d like to know where to send the funds after in order to complete my side of the deal. Odd enough is that I can’t find his message anymore, i didn’t delete it at all. And we have no means of getting in touch with one another except reddit. 

He asked me to open teamviewer and i allowed him to connect to my pc to check the money and all. I was smart enough to run the whole shenanigan on a virtual box with nothing on it except a browser and teamviewer. So basically he can’t do anything there. 

Now the money is still on hold on my acct waiting to be received - i don’t have any idea where did this come from or what’s the story behind that $450 and i don’t know where to send it to. 

Should I withdraw the money and keep it as mine? Although it’s not really my style because the money is not mine. I reckon i’ll leave it for now and wait for someone to contact me about it.

note: she has her parents here so she has a place to stay if need be. i also brought up that they could get an apartment here since it’s pretty inexpensive and they both have friends/family local so it works out in both of their favors, but her boyfriend doesn’t want to do that. which makes no sense.",26Jun2019,1

627,"So I was on my way home from work one day and I see a stray dog crossing the street. I couldn’t turn around at that moment because the traffic was heavy. By the time I did turn around the stray dog was gone. 

I told myself the next day I would keep my eyes peeled out for her on my way back home from work.

I saw her again in the same area the next day except this time she’s tied with some rope to a shopping cart. I pull up into the parking lot take some pictures of her and call a friend who could possibly help find a foster for the dog or just find her somewhere temporary. As I’m on the phone with my friend, a homeless person goes and sits next to the shopping cart because I’m sure he expects a girl taking pictures of the dog is possibly thinking about taking it. 

So I pull up next to him and ask him if he and the dog would like anything to eat. He says yes please, so I ask him if he wants the captain Ds right behind him and he says no because he has had it everyday this week and it’s upsetting his stomach. So I suggest McDonald’s and he says no but that there is a Sonic up the road that I could get him a burger from. I then ask if the dog needs anything and he said yes, some wet food because she doesn’t like normal food. 

I go to Sonic get him a burger and some water because where we are is really really hot right now. I go back to him and give him his food and tell him to stay here so I can go get the dog some food. I go to a dollar store close by get two packs of 6 cans of dog food, food bowl, water bowl, red collar, red leash and a water bottle for him to refill. So I go back to him and give him all this stuff and then he says, “if I would of known you were going to spend this money, I would of just asked for it and used it for rent money at the homeless shelter”. That answer kind of disappointed me. So I offer to go give him money so him and the dog can be in a homeless shelter for a few nights, hoping he spends it wisely. I return and give him the money and a card with just my phone number on it and say if he or the dog needs anything to please contact me.

Fast forward to the weekend and I keep getting my phone blown up by random phone numbers, because the guy himself doesn’t have a phone, and is asking for favors saying he needs rent money over my voicemail. I ignore them because I am waiting for something to be wrong with the dog in order to go back and help him. I know terrible but I was genuinely worried about the dog.

So this Monday I get a text from a random number saying verbatim, “this is william da older man dat u bought da food for he and his dog near captain d's on perkins last thursday u gave me your card and said if needed anything to be sure and call u i left several messages ill be in da same location today if its possible can u come see honey and i it very important”

I text him back asking what’s wrong and he says, “I need to know asap because im use somebody else phone. Its my room rent and hony need some warm medicine”.

So I tell him I will be there later with some friends and I will be taking Honey, the dog, to the vet to get her checked if she has heart worms. I ask him if he wants me to give her back to him and he says yes and that I can keep her for a week and he will be in contact with me.

My friends and I get there to get the dog and ask again are you sure you want me to take her? And he says yes. When I was there I noticed he no longer had the money I gave him earlier (it was $20) because he asks for food again (so I give him some more Sonic). On top of noticing that he doesn’t have the 12 cans of dog food that I gave him either. So I take her to the vet to get checked for heart worms and they say she’s too young to be checked for heart worms and all I can do is give her some medicine to prevent it. So I pay for that. When I get home I give her normal hard dog food to eat because that’s all I have and she inhales it like she hasn’t eaten in a while. That upset me too. So I’m thinking now that the homeless guy ate it (he had no teeth) and barely gave any to the dog.

My moral dilemma now is if I should give the dog back to him or if I should find her a new home that can actually provide and tend to her. I understand I could possibly be taking someone’s companion from them but also I don’t know if this is his actual companion or if he is just using her to milk money and food out of people like me because he could of picked her up the day I saw her loose and she could just be a runaway from someone’s home. I have posted on my local communities lost and found animals page to see if anyone claims her. I’m just trying to decide if I should give the dog back to him or if I should try and find her a stable home. Really needing some help here.

I asked if she was okay and she said it hurt where she was hit with a belt, and sure enough when I turned her around I found faint red marks. I couldn't tell if it was from her panties, the toilet seat, or a belt (looked at belt markings on skin and they looked similar), but I'll be sure to check again later on if she still has the marks or if they faded.

I asked if she had been hit with a belt and she told me her dad spanked her with one. I asked if she told her mom that and she said she did, but I dont know about that for sure.

I dont really know what to do at this point. Obviously if the marks are still on her after her nap I'll know it was a belt, but I dont really know where to go from there if they are belt marks.

637,"My family is complicated and messy. My mom is my best friend and a very long time ago I was told my cousin  was adopted by my aunt and her husband at the time. He left shortly after the adoption leaving my Aunt to raise her on her own. From what I can gather the intention was to tell my cousin she was adopted but my Aunt never did this. Most of the family know and as a result my cousin has been treated differently, as an outcast in my opinion. There has been blackmail and all kinds of nonsense involved. I can put an end to all this by just telling my cousin the truth but It would cause an explosion in my family. 

A few years back I sent her an email from telling her she was adopted and even put little details in only family would know but nothing came from it.

638,"I'm 22 years old and I'm about to receive a sizable inheritance of 3M-4M from a deceased aunt (another 3M-4M will be given to charity). The problem is my extended family members (not my parents) are protesting that I shouldn't be the only one inheriting the money. I already have a bachelor degree and will be attending graduate school to a career that will pay extremely well if I manage to land a job.My aunts, uncles, cousins and the whole shebang think that I'm more than capable to earn my own money and my parents also are doing quite well financially. Under normal circumstance, I definitely wouldn't mind sharing the money but there is an underlying issue.

The thing is, my aunt was cast-out from the family decades ago. I never heard the whole story but it was something petty (according to my dad) and the whole family cut her out completely. Then my aunt and my dad reconciled shorty after my birth and she moved in with us briefly during my infancy. That's how I got close to her and she considered me as her daughter since she never married and never had a child of her own.

So six months before she passed, she spent most of her time in a hospice and I visited her every chance I got and not once did anyone else from the family (except from my parents) showed their faces. I grew up hearing my other aunts and uncles belittled her and told my dad to stop associating with her. He never had a heart to tell them off so he just listened most of the time and told them to stop when he had enough.

I honestly am pissed at my extended family. On a normal day, I tolerance their prejudice against her because I knew the feud was something I wasn't going to be able to understand as it was before my time. Like, most of them doesn't even know the exact location of her house because they never even thought to visit before/after she was sicked. At when my dad broke the new about her dying, most of them didn't even batched an eyelash. Yet, when they heard that she had a lot of money, they all came running and demanding that they deserved a piece as if my aunt owned them anything. My parents advised me to do whatever the heck I want and they will support me regardless. My dad even told me that he doesn't care if this cause our nuclear family to be cast-off.  I'm pissed at my extended family but I don't want them to cast-out my parents either because of something I did or didn't do.   

I don't know what to do. I think my options are:

1. I start drawing up an excel spread sheet on who should get the money and how much. 

2. Use the money to travel for a year and limit my social media and contact to just my parents and close friends then proceed to ignore the rest of the family afterward. (My aunt told me to use this money to buy myself a good house, a reliable car, pay for my graduate school and travel the world in her stead)

3. Give in all to charity.

However the first paycheck (containing my earnings for 2 months) was sent to my mum’s account before I had a bank account set up for myself. I assumed my mum would put the money in the account some day, asking her multiple times and she assured me she would yet she never acted on it.

The other day my bike broke - my main transportation to and from school, and I had to pay around £150 for it to be fully repaired (parents made me pay as it’s ‘my bike’) as many things on it had been pretty much worn to pieces.

Especially as it's mostly women drawing and depicting these gay characters of theirs in very sexual ways. 

I can't explain why it bothers me or makes me uncomfortable, but it does. I don't like the idea of people just viewing gay people in a sexual manner. We're actual people with actual personalities. 

Maybe I'm just bitching about nothing, I don't know, but it really does bother me.

644,"TL:DR at the bottom


Just some background information. I'm a university student and I'm currently taking my 4 month annual break from school (We call it 'long holiday' ) In the country where I am from, most undergrad programmes recommend that one undertakes an internship during this period in their field of study in order to gain extensive work experience before graduation.

It's also important to note that the norm here is that student interns are barely ever paid for the work they do during this time.. Actually most companies take advantage of this cheap/ free labour to maximize their profits and sadly there are no laws to govern this. They aren't reimbursed in any way yet they use their own resources to get to work and have meals while away from home. This can be such a financial strain. 
In the event where a student intern is paid, they must have been really lucky or they probably just had 'connections' with the organization they work with..but the reasons aren't limited to this. 


Now to my story, I have been placed in a firm for the past 2 months and I have only one more to go before my internship is over. My immediate supervisor expects me to be at work at 7am and leave at 5pm daily. My daily commute is a total of 4 hours both ways so it's safe to say I'm out for 14+ hours. 


Naturally, since my commute is 4hours long, it gets  very expensive. My work description involves site visits, making project reports, model making, producin renders and software drafting. On most days, I am asked go perform several tasks at once since I am the only intern under my supervisor. It's also important to note that he always asks me to communicate whenever I feel overwhelmed  but when I do it doesn't make a difference at all. On some weekends I'm sent home with work assignments. 


Now, following this routine all weekdays for 7 weeks now has drained me so much. I'm always tired and less productive. I understand that that's roughly 50hours of work per week (excluding commute hours)  and I assume this is reasonable for most people. 
But it makes me feel like a robot. And yes, I am not compensated in any way so it makes me lose motivation a lot.

So, my main issues are:  are the work hours reasonable or am I just complaining ? Do you think I should approach my supervisor regarding my work hours? (done if before, it didn't work) and if so how you recommend I do it?",26Jun2019,1

646,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this. I’m mostly looking for the advice of non-biased strangers.

I work at a job in my company that I’m not keen on. It’s very file based, and legal, two things I did not see myself fitting into ever. My degree and my passion are from the creative field of photography, and I used to work specifically in photography for 2 years before starting at my current job 4 years ago. So when a friend of mine reached out to me about a position that I could apply to on the creative side of photography, I jumped at the chance.

I knew when I applied, it would be in my ex boyfriend’s department. We both met at school studying in the same field and had similar goals of working in photo full time. We both got jobs at the same company while we were together (I know, bad idea). The company is huge; we are not in the same building at the moment, but he’s a photography creative, the position I would like to be in, and moving my career back into the creative section would mean moving to his building. 

I’m a professional. I want this job. I am also terrified of having to work side my side with him. Our relationship was 5 years long, and it ended after a year and a half of emotional abuse from him — “I love you! I wish I was single. I want to marry you! Just kidding, I want to see other people.” We have spoken since our break up 2 years ago, we can both be cordial, but speaking to him does make me uneasy. He has apologized for his behavior in the past, has gotten mental help, and has stopped drinking, but I still feel the tingle of fear when I speak to him. I know we can both be professional, but I do not know if this would be good for my mental health. 

I have another job available to me that’s more in the career I’m in now, but I don’t really want to do this forever. I could get a job somewhere else as a photo creative, but I don’t have the professional photo creative experience on my resume yet, so I’d have to start all over at the bottom of the career path again somewhere new, where at my company now, they know me enough that I could easily slide into the position I want now.

Advice needed.

652,"Backstory: I walked out on  my previous employer after being the top performer and getting the runaround. Was promoted without a raise, boss was abusing his power, etc. I know I shouldn’t have done that but I already did, can’t change that.

I have made great connections in the industry and someone of the right circle made an amazing connection and called the president of the competing company to my former employer about me. They immediately gave me an interview without applying. Practically offered me a job on the spot and asked how much I wanted for pay. My ask didn’t even phase them. Told me to submit a general application online and would stay in touch for next steps as they had to figure out where to place me.

I submitted an application, they sent me background check release, called my references and then stalled for weeks. I sent an email asking for an update and head of HR called me 2 weeks ago. Gave me a phone interview and told me things were heading in the right direction and that she would ask if an additional interview was necessary. However that to bear with them as they were actually creating a position and needed to get job description and all of that done. She said she’d call me the following week with an update and then she didn’t.

Like I said it’s been 2 weeks without a word, so I sent HR an email kindly asking for an update or if there’s anything I should be doing on my side. Her response was short and a bit rude IMO. She said they had more pressing hires and that the good and bad news was that she didn’t have an update for me and that she would ask again if another interview was to be had for me. And that was all.

I don’t know how that would be good news in any way. Am I to think that this job prospect is dead in the water? Or should I continue to wait? I have bills to pay and a family and really cannot wait much longer. I’ve been going on interviews but none are for the same level position I had since no company really hires from outside for such position so I’d be taking a pay cut and career set back which I don’t mind but I also don’t want to miss out on what seems to be the opportunity of a lifetime with this potential employer that I feel is stringing me along.

658,"This is me explaining (read: bragging) about who I am because it might provide insight into my problem. Skip to the asterisk if you just want to know my problems. 

I'm a 21 year old man who's happy with who I am. I have a lot of hobbies and am a jack-of-all-trades type. I'm into woodworking, outdoor sports, electronics and circuitry. I'm also a really good cook and an adventurous eater. I'm super into coffee and make flavor syrups from scratch. I'm a singer and multi-instrumentalist. I dabble in photoshop and graphic design. I just got a degree in computer science and am happily working in that field. I dress nicely and take pride and consideration in how I look. I get along easily with almost everyone (I'm a terrible conversationalist with small talk but I listen well and am pretty chill so most people get along with me). I've gone through a lot of growth in my time at college, went to counseling for anxiety, and felt like I developed myself into a well rounded and interesting person with a lot of personality.

But within the past year or so I've been getting a lot of comments of people asking if I'm gay or questioning my masculinity. I'm not gay and don't really care but the comments keep building up and feel disparaging. I've gotten a lot of criticism from friends because I'm a virgin and am waiting until marriage for religious reasons (I know that might not be popular on reddit but I'm happy with my church and have never felt any shame from my faith for any reason). I'm pretty physically reserved with most people and any time I start a relationship with a woman I'm always very slow with physical affection because to me physical affection and emotions are very closely tied and I want to become very close emotionally with someone first. I live in a conservative area of the US so being PC isn't ever considered and guys are often very ""alpha"" but none of my friends are really that way. I've always either brushed it off or acted like it was a complement because stereotypically gay men dress nicely and all that.

\*\*\*

I tried just not caring what other people think. I've done that for years now. But the comments from close friends and acquaintances, and the comments that they say people have made to them just make me annoyed. I want to be seen by women as strong and masculine. I don't want women to question my sexuality. I don't think that I do anything specifically ""gay"" (I hate lumping the whole community into one and making it sound like the LGBTQ community is bad but that's what everyone around me does so I have no choice) but apparently having a wide range of interests and the ability to listen makes me seem  that way.

662,"Hey everyone. I’ve never posted on this subreddit or really on reddit in general. I’m now coming out of my first year of college, during which I moved into my girlfriend’s apartment. Not only that, we decided to accept the responsibility of a dog together.

I’ve made the stupid mistake of spending most of what money I had saved for college on helping provide for the household. Initially we made the agreement that I would only be helping to pay for our dogs medical and food expenses, but that rapidly degraded into food, phones, internet, and other fronted cash or bills that never get paid back. I don’t blame her, she’s struggling as much as I am, but I see two choices.

One is that I can move about 15 minutes down the road back into my parents house to finish my two year at the very least. As it stands now, living away from home has proved to me that, for the time being, the greatest way to ensure security in our lives is to push through my education and into a career. I’m concerned to do this though, because as much as I’d love to ignore it - I do like life at the apartment with her. It’s hard though, and lately fights have become more frequent as the deadline for my tuition continues to push that anxiety to the limit. I also feel like a jerk for getting her a dog and then moving out on her. When we’ve talked about this issue my girlfriend said she wouldn’t mind it, so long as I still frequently came over. 

My second option is to continue to live beneath the financial strain, but increased freedom of being moved out. This brings with it the joy of being with a girl I’ve dated for three years as well. However, I worry for my mental state and my ability to be the best version of myself if I continue to put myself beneath the stress that comes with trying to maintain all of this.

Now I’m not sure whether I should say anything, I’m a quiet guy so maybe it’s assumed that I wouldn’t enjoy it? Should I somehow let them know that I would have liked to go and how do I do it without sounding like an asshole and a crybaby.

&amp;#x200B;

When me and my husband first started dating we had the talk and from what he said he seemed to want kids like I did one day. I am very motherly by nature and have always wanted kids, my dream one day was to be a stay at home mom. Around 3 years later, after we've been married for over a year the talk of kids came up. It came to light then that he doesn't actually want kids.

 When we had this second talk and it came to light I started crying, this surprised him. It seemed like we had a miscommunication. When we had our first talk I kept mentioning that I wanted to wait til we could handle it emotional and financial and I didn't know when that would be, and that I wouldn't mind having kids later in life. He took that to mean that I wasn't even sure if I wanted kids. I know he didn't just change his mind suddenly and decide not to tell me.  He felt horrible, started crying as well, and kept trying to figure out a way to fix it the situation and to help me. After a while talking he was heart broken for me and said I could divorce him and he wouldn't fight it and would understand. 

Let me say that I love my husband to death. He is amazing, sweet, funny, and supportive. He does also deal with a lot of depression, anxiety, and general health problems, and I do as well. I understand why he does not want kids and I will never hold a grudge against him for it. I will never leave him for this. I possibly believe he might change his mind one day but I wont get my hopes up. I always wanted kids but after marrying the love of my life I know I only want them with him. If I cant have kids with him then I don't want them. I also don't want to have kids unless we both honestly want them and can support them. I have accepted this and I have started looking forward to some aspects of being a child free couple.

The main problem I have now is telling my family, my mother mostly, that I might not have kids one day. My mother and I are extremely close. She's known of my dreams of motherhood all my life and has always been excited about being a grandmother. She loves my husband as well, shes loves him like her own son and has a great relationship with him. I know that when I talk about this with her though she might be more heart broken than I was, she will tell me that I should divorce him and be extremely angry with him. She is kind and sweet but also very emotional and sensitive and has dealt with a lot and I know this will be extremely hard on her.

I know this is our decision and what she wants shouldn't matter. I know she will despise him just for the fact that he had a kid with another woman that he didn't even know about (ex girlfriend didn't tell him until he saw pics of her with a kid and asked her if it was his, it was) I just want to hurt her lease as possible and try to keep her anger I know she will feel to my husband under control. I know someday she would get over it but I am worried that this could damage my mothers and my husbands relationship irreversibly. I am at a lose on how to bring this up and talk about it in a healthy manner. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",26Jun2019,0

667,"Hi all

  
I didn't think I would need to make this post, but then I realized something that complicates things.  


Some background: about a week ago, I was playing a game of Garry's mod with my little brother and his friend(let's call him Steve). We were having a good time until Steves little sister came into his room and started talking. Now, the thing is, I'm known to be quite an asshole when I'm in a playful mood, so when I heard her voice, I jokingly(not that it's an excuse) said ""get that little shit away from the mic."" I didn't think much of it, after all, he must've had headphones on so she couldn't hear it, right? Well, I guess Steve did not have headphones on, or he told his sister, or some other reason, as a bit later he told me that she was crying. He asked me to apologize, which I should've, but since I was in a playful, and therefor asshole, mood, I just said no over and over and just said ""because"" when he asked why.

&amp;#x200B;

(just a brief intermission: don't sympathize with me here, I know I'm a cunt, I know I probably deserve this situation, this isn't what this is about, though, let's continue.)

&amp;#x200B;

A while later, Steve started asking what school I go to. Now, I don't' like giving information like that out willy-nilly, and considering what just happened, I knew I would be a bad idea. However, remember that my brother was there also, and while I want to keep my life as private as possible, he has no problem telling everyone everything about himself, his family, and me. so he told his friend which school I go to. then when after learning this, he said his older brother wanted to talk to me and I said ok. then his brother told me to meet him in the foyer on exam review day. Me, with my brain being a combination of confused, tired, and scared, said ok, he then replied ""sounds good.""

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to today. Exam review day is tomorrow, I have an exit plan, my last class is right next to an alternative exit, which leads to the main path I take home, so that's not an issue. The entry plan, however, is a bit different: my parents tend to drive me to school in the mornings and typically right in front of the school, which lead to the foyer. two things need to be considered here: 

1. if we were going to meet, I would likely be after classes.
2. he could very well have been bluffing and was just trying to scare me, but something about his voice and how he worded his threat made me think otherwise

let's say he isn't bluffing and he's going to stay all day in the foyer: what should I do? I could tell my parents about it, but I don't want to worry them any more than are about me right now. I could voluntarily walk to school, but I tend to be forgetful in the morning, and doing so might make them think something is up. I think about entering an then exiting until they left, but the doors inside are being repaired, meaning they're wide open, meaning he can see me clearly.

to repeat myself, what should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

when typing this I realized another issue: my brother's big mouth. If the confrontation is real and I avoid it, Steve would likely ask about it leading to my brother pestering me about it. When he wants an answer, he's very persistent about it. so he will likely ask about for days and even weeks about it if I don't tell. I could lie to him, say he didn't show up, but then he would ask Steve and Steve's brother would say I'm lying. if I did cave and tell him, he would then tell Steve, and Steve would tell his brother. You may think this isn't a big deal, but here's the thing: Steve knows where I live, and if he doesn't or forgets, he could easily ask my brother and he would tell him everything he needs to know.

it's clear that my brother is a huge problem, not just in this situation, but as a whole. What should I do about him?

can’t remember everything that happened. I remember pieces of being encourage to finish the beer, I think I remember sitting at the fire and you were there too, I remember opening my eyes and you were standing over me, looking all ways to make sure no one was watching, I remember knowing this was wrong, why were you touching me, did I somehow encourage it. But that’s all. Why was I alone in the dark? How did I get there? No answers, no explanation. And it’s not like I can ask. I can’t bring this up to anyone or everyone will be hurt in the process

When I confronted her with this information after some prodding she revealed to me it was my uncle, WHO WAS ACCUSED BY MY COUSIN OF SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR 10+ YEARS AGO. That cousin unfortunately had a bit of a history, enough of which my entire family basically excommunicated her and called her a liar. I was fairly young at the the time, but I kept in contact with her albeit infrequently. 

But anyway my wife has decided the best course of action is to do nothing and that has not sat well with me. I’ve been privy to this information for about 3 weeks and I can’t take it anymore. I had to see him at a different graduation party Sunday and I just wanted to hit him. He was like a second father to me since I was like 10 when she married him.

673,"   Lately, I've found myself not wanting anything anymore. I don't wan't to do anything, I don't want to get anything, I don't want to make anything... 

... I don't want to live... 

   Life has completely lost meaning to me. Everything's boring. I wake up, go to school, get back, watch youtube/play games, go to sleep, repeat. When it's the weekend I do the same, but without the school part. 

   And sure, there's nothing stoping me from doing something I love, because there's lot's of things I love and would like to do. 

I love drawing, and would love to learn to draw better and maybe even learn animation

I love music, and would love to make my own. Maybe even learn how to sing. 

I love filmmaking/editing/acting, and would love to make little films of my own, maybe even post them on Youtube.

I love video games, and would love to learn to make them too. 

I love nature, and would love to go out more. Maybe even work out and get some muscles 

   But what's the point if I don't have the will to do any of that. I *want* it, but I can't. I just don't feel like doing any of that. Whenever I get some inspiration to do anything in my life, I lose it instantly. Here's some examples:

I suddenly feel the urge to draw something, so I get out a sheet of paper and a pen. I draw a few lines and that's it. I don't wanna do it anymore, so I go back to watching youtube or other useless activities. 

I suddenly really really want to play/learn piano, so I go and sit down. I play one note, and that's it. My inspiration just flies away. 

   Why is this happening to me?? I don't want this. I **want** to do something with my life, but at the same time, I don't. Every goddamn day, all I do is stay inside and do completely useless stuff.

He isn’t very fit and most people would say he’s not really attractive but I fell hard for him based on just the person he was! Then we got married.....

He literally stopped showering! And brushing his teeth! At first I had to make sure I wasn’t crazy so I took his tooth brush and the tooth paste and hid it hoping he would ask where they went! But for two weeks straight he never asked once and definitely never found it! So for two weeks and more u didn’t brush ur teeth!!!!?!?!? I cringe at the thought of kissing him and when he tries to kiss me I kinda just make something up! I’ve had a sore lip for weeks trying to avoid kissing him! 

Then he just doesn’t shower!!! Then gets angry when I refuse to please him (BJ) ummmm u smell dude!!! At one point I even spoke to him with love and patience explaining why I don’t do the things I use to do and he recognized his lack of hygiene and would bathe and brush his teeth for maybe a week and went back to his old lazy ways! 
  
Not to mention there was no toilet paper in our bathroom for two days! And he was taking massive poops and just not wiping??? That’s another thing he just poops with the door open for me to hear and smell it’s like wtf did I get myself into?!?!?! 

Then last night he’s peeling dead skin from his smelly feet and then proceeds to feed the skin to the dog!!!!! I literally threw up in my mouth! 

I catch him through the corner of my eye picking his nose and flicking it or blowing his nose into his hand and then calls the dog to lick it off!!! I just can’t deal!!!! 

I am so utterly disgusted! I can’t see past all his recent gross habits and his lack of personal hygiene! How the hell do I tell him again without hurting his feelings that he needs to make changes or else he will be in a sexless marriage!!!

some backstory 


i was in a pretty emotional/mental/physically abusive relationship for 4 years. i finally got out and with all the trauma i decided to go to therapy. in these therapy sessions i brought up how i was coerced into having sex, told how to dress, and when i could speak and what to say etc. my therapist told me these were not normal (i had no idea at the time, it was my first relationship and i was 14-18 at the time and my ex TOLD me this was how relationships worked)

my ex fed me drugs all of the time, if i stepped out of ‘line’ or even had a conversation with my mother or friends he’d beat me. we broke up because he found someone else and he made it seem like i was the bad guy.

now to the present:

i’m at a place mentally where i finally feel ready to see if i can press charges against my ex for all of the shit he did (we broke up 8 months ago) because i KNOW he is now doing it to another girl and i want to protect them because i know how violent he can be and don’t want him to kill someone

neither of us knew much about each other, yet came to realize that we share a lot of deep things in common.

with this mind, I figured she may be more open to getting lunch, yet her answer was the same...

she explained more about how she doesn’t want to get involved with any guys right now, how she wants to focus on personal growth in this time, she’s got other personal goals in this time.


when I asked “well how about when it’s a better time for you where you’re not busy, etc?”

... her answer to that was maybe, she just is focused on right now
and doesn’t know how she will feel in the future.

her honest answer is maybe because she doesn’t know how she’ll feel then, a few months from now.

She knows she doesn’t have to worry about hurting my feelings, sounds like she’s potentially curious about meeting up later on.

I can tell she’s attracted to me, at least earlier in the year she was flirty and showed obvious signs of attraction... seems like she’s wanting to guard her heart in this time and focus on herself.

We had a big confrontation and I basically told him that he was being an a**hole and needed to get his sh*t straight before he worried about my grades, which were slipping partially due to the stress at home.

My mom isn't siding with either of us and still seems to have this mentality that we should just do want he wants to avoid confrontation.

After a few hours of being alone I feel drained and it makes me want to be alone even more and it discourages me when people say no to hanging out. For example, I’ve been at my friend house for the past 3 days, she had a college class to go to so I went home this morning. I texted some of my other friends as soon as I walked in the door one of my friends was busy and one other person flaked on me. Now I feel like I can’t text anyone else bc I’m so drained and sad. I know it’s sounds stupid and I’m not depressed and this isn’t a prolonged feeling but it is constant. Is there a solution? Is there a name for this?

699,"Okay, so the title of this post is a *little* misleading, so I’ll go ahead and give y’all some background. This guy and I have been friends for a couple years now. We’ve been best friends for a long time and we used to talk constantly, play video games together, fall asleep on the phone together, you name it. In around December, I realized that I was in love with him, but I never confessed until the end of January. He revealed that he felt the same way and had since six months prior. We started dating and no one was really surprised, since we joked about it a lot and were pretty much inseparable. My relationship with him was pretty serious from the start and we planned having a future together. We wanted two kids, a couple pets, a garden, and a nice house that was a little secluded. We were a pretty compatible pair and I could tell that I genuinely wanted to be with only him for as long as I could. Recently, I’ve been struggling with a lot of mental health issues which I’ve had since childhood and have only gotten worse as I’ve grown up. I’ve been going through an identity crisis and I’m still not completely sure of who I am at this point. Anyway, I asked to take a break off our relationship to alleviate some stress and I figured it’d be better to refrain from interacting with people and just have time to myself in a healthy way. He took this as that we’re breaking up even after I told him I would always love him and I only want him, but I just needed time. He ended up being fine with it, as fine as he could be, and I let him be for a bit because I knew he was upset. This was a month ago, and I’ve finally been ready to come around again and I think I’m ready to confront my feelings. I’ve still loved him this whole time, but I honestly don’t know if I should approach him about it first, or he should ask me. Any thoughts would be appreciated (:",26Jun2019,1

703,"Short Version: My girlfriend has been working at the local hotel as the front desk girl for about 2 years. My mother and I got her that job there, when she got fired from Walmart and was in tears. Now she wants to quit since her manager is quitting. My mother is furious and taking it out on me.

The long version: She got fired from Walmart for bullshit reasons 2 years ago. My mother has worked at that hotel for about 8 years and helped her get the new job there. She was depressed and crying and In the past 2 years that place has been shitty. The owners are awful, the employees try and my mother is simply a controlling bitch who never leaves anyone alone or stays out of things. Last night her manager K quit, shes quitting because the owners are mistreating her for doing her job (Leaky roof. She called the roofers for them which shes supposed to do. They got mad). My girlfriend is her friend and the other manager quit just last week now the 3rd shift girl quit. So my girlfriend is following suit. Shes 30, shes an adult who can make her own choices. I'm 24, I live with my mother because I put my life on hold to take care of grandma so I'm still in her house as much as I'd love to move out. But I can't. I work I have a job I hate it but I put up with it. My girlfriend is convinced she should quit and that she'll get unemployment still (Shes been getting it for 2 years) she has her own place (I refuse to move in where she lives. Not important) she's supposed to be there shes hanging out with the girl who quit and not going in. My mother will not leave me alone! Shes a controlling pain in the ass who takes her anger out on everyone else and I'm just like her sadly. I'm upset and angry because shes not answering, she won't listen to reason! Shes an employee not a manager its not her place. Shes going to lose her apartment, her unemployment, and if my mother makes good on her threats and doesn't let her around shes going to lose me. I don't know what to do!

I don't have all the answers I don't know everything I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do! She won't listen to reason she won't answer me. She won't even answer her phone. I thought I should let her make her own choice and I told her I think she should keep the job while she looks for a new one and that she should stick it out but she refuses. I told her she's going to lose everything she doesn't seem to care. I told her whats happening and shes just not listening or even answering and I don't know what I can do.

I'm tired of them fighting each other, I'm tired of my controlling mother, I'm tired of being stressed and angry I am fucking tired of all of it!",26Jun2019,4
704,"I work at a restaurant as a prep cook, so one of my many tasks is trimming and cutting chicken. We recently changed our supplier for chicken breasts, and I’ve been noticing bruises on a lot of the breasts, which is something I never really saw with any of our previous suppliers’ products. I’m worried that the facilities that raise the chickens we use are abusive towards the animals (kicking, hitting, etc.), and if that’s the case I would want to contact the humane society or similar organization to stop that. 

However, I’m also aware that I have little to no knowledge of the raising, processing, and handling of the animals and the packaging/distribution process of the meat, and so if the bruises are likely the result of that and not abuse, I wouldn’t want to go after a nonexistent problem.

708,"About a week ago, I went to dinner with some friends. The dinner was at a place where we could cook our own food. Unfortunately, there was an accident and I ended up being splattered with hot oil over my face. Initially, the burn marks weren’t obvious but I could feel the burning and see red spots on my skin. I ran to the bathroom to cool my skin with water. The night ended early for me; I went to the local drug store to get dressings and topical ointment/medications to try to protect and treat the burn areas. I also asked my dermatologist friend what she would recommend, and I tried to follow the advice I got from various sources.

It has been over a week now, and the burn marks are very apparent. They look worse. The largest marks are about the size of the end of a #2 pencil in diameter. Based on my internet research, they are 2nd degree burns and I am dreading the eventual scarring.

I haven’t wanted to leave the house; when I do leave the house, I put dressings over the burns, but I feel ridiculous. Today, I had a skin reaction to the dressings and so I didn’t leave the house at all. I’m about to start a new job in 4 days, and I’m so upset and depressed. I used to have horrible acne and would socially isolate myself because of how bad my skin looked; I had horrible skin for years until it got better with medications. I feel that these burn marks are worse than my acne problems. I know there are options later for treatment, like laser therapy and all of that, for scars and hyperpigmentation. But right now.....I just want to never go out again. I’m just crying all the time now. I don’t want to eat or do anything except wish I was dead.

I know there are worse situations in life, and I try to imagine myself in these scenarios as a way to remind myself things could be worse and to try to be grateful for what I do have. I’m trying to change my perspective, but it’s still hard to deal with my reality.

I don’t know if it’s advice that I want, or just to share, because I’m just so upset and I don’t know what to do. My friends are trying to be reassuring, but to me, it sounds like they are minimizing my concerns, so I don’t really talk to them anymore about it.",26Jun2019,1
709,"Long post, TL;DR in the conclusion paragraph.

Before y'all ask, I'm taking meds and therapy.  I fell into a major depressive episode in January, and in February I started seeing a therapist who diagnosed me with MDD with anxious distress specifier, and I saw a doctor who put me on SSRIs.  Unfortunately, my doc is rarely available for appointments, so I'm still on my first SSRI trial, which isn't working very well.  I'm hopeful I'll eventually find some meds or somatic therapies that work for me, but I don't know how long it will take, or if I can hold out mentally and financially in the meantime.  

I've had depressive episodes in the past, but only one as bad as this, and I didn't recognize the symptoms until now (hence the late diagnosis).  I've only been in my current negative mindset since January, but I've been feeling perpetually drained and exhausted since the summer of 2016.  I've had a blood panel test which ruled out a thyroid disorder and other physical illnesses, so I figure it must be due to the depression.

Things aren't going well with my therapist either.  She keeps saying that she doesn't think she is helping me very much, and expresses a plaintive hope that my meds kick in soon.  Maybe she thinks I'm too far gone.  I'd like to switch to another therapist, but she is the only one who takes my insurance within a 45-minute drive.  My roommate recommended her therapist, who is only 8 blocks from my house and is supposedly excellent, but she charges much more than I can afford.

I recently quit my last part-time, minimum-wage job because I was getting near-daily panic attacks.  Though I have anxiety, I never used to get panic attacks until I started SSRIs.  Hmmm... 

I'm 30 years old, and I've now worked 10 jobs in my life.  Every single one of them made me actively suicidal until I quit (or was let go), at which point I felt much better.  My job history in brief:

* I've worked as a laboratory technician on 3 occasions (I quit because of chronic joint pain, abusive supervisors, or both)
* I've worked data entry at an insurance company (quit over joint pain and low pay)
* I've been a data science intern at a software company (contract wasn't renewed because of poor performance)
* I was the customer success manager at a different software company (supervisors asked me to resign because of poor performance)
* I worked as an asbestos abatement contractor (quit after 1 week due to joint pain and acrophobia from climbing on rooftops)
* I've had 3 different customer-facing retail jobs (quit over anxiety, depression, and low pay)

The funny thing is, when I'm not forced to work for a living, I'm the happiest person I know.  I've had 2 different 8-month spells of ""funemployment,"" and emotionally I could literally keep doing that forever.  Just hike in the mountains, play with the cat, and surf the internet.  For a long time I considered myself an extremely content person, except for the whole ""forced to earn a living"" fly in the ointment.  But I don't have a trust fund, I can't live with my parents because they retired to another country, and I'm not eligible for disability.

You might ask: ""But what about your chronic joint pain?  Shouldn't that qualify you for disability?""  Funny thing about that.  My last lab job carried insurance that allowed me to get MRIs on my left elbow, right wrist, and right shoulder - the joints where the pain is the worst.  The MRIs came up with absolutely nothing.  When my supervisor asked with concern in her voice what the test picked up, I truthfully told her that they found nothing.  She responded by writing me up for faking an injury to get out of work.  I quit not long after.

So here I am.  Short on savings, completely directionless, and seemingly having a choice between suicide, homelessness, or pain/exhaustion/daily panic attacks at whatever new job I manage to get.  In my history, any job that my brain could handle, my body couldn't, and vice versa.  It appears that neither manual labor or repetition-heavy desk jobs are an option, and until the meds start working, I'd rather be perpetually unconscious than forced to think on my toes all day.  So, do you nice folks have any job recommendations for someone with depression AND anxiety AND undiagnosed chronic joint pain AND who's nearly broke?",26Jun2019,0

We have made out, he has given me hickeys, fingered me, and gave me head as well as I have him head  but we never had sex because I was a Virgin and wasn’t ready for that. Before we did any of those things I just listed he has always asked me if I’m ready multiple times because he wanted me to be as comfortable as I could be. Today I went over to his house after school and we started off watching a movie and then we started making out which led to me getting head and fingered. After that I was on top of him making out and his penis was basically out. He asked if I wanted to make out while it’s out but to be safe he’ll put a condom on because of the Pre cum. I agreed not because I was forced but because I wanted too. Than it was almost at my entrance so in the moment I said I liked it and he asked “ you do?” I obviously said yes and he asked me more times than I could count am I sure and if I’m 100% sure I said yes. So we had sex and I told him to go slow and be patient which he did. Afterwards I just didn’t know how to feel and I still don’t.

714,"Earlier today i was in my kitchen and started to hear my neighbor's 3 month old baby crying (the walls are really thin). Then about a minute after hearing a normal newborn cry, I hear what sounds like a hand hitting something. Following this, the baby starts screaming high pitch. This happens about 5 times, every 20ish seconds; the hitting noise, baby crying like its in pain. At one point it also sounded like the baby's mouth was being covered for about 15 seconds. After the final hitting noise, the baby abruptly stops crying, and i didn't hear it again until later in the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I myself am a mother of a toddler, so i know the difference between normal and 'in pain' crying of a newborn, and what I heard each time after the hitting noise sounded like serious distress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note, it did not at all sound like a baby being burped and it did not sound like the baby had a bottle in its mouth when the noise was muffled.

&amp;#x200B;

About a minute after this happened, I see the baby's mother and grandmother walk into their apartment. Point being, the only one home with the baby when this happened was its dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am REALLY certain that what I heard was the baby being hit over and over until it passed out or something, but of course if I'm wrong, that could damage the reputation of the baby's family.

715,"Quick background:
Crippling anxiety, so I never had a gf before even though all girls seem to like me. That still isn't enough to reassure me to go out with them so I isolate myself so they don't figure out how weird I am. 

I blocked arguably the most beautiful girl in social media that makes almost anyone famous look like trash. I originally met her on the Bumble dating app where she  was a verified user. But after talking to her for a long time I mainly didn't like her personality(for possibly weak reasons) so I decided to just stop.  My life is a bit of a mess right now too so I was afraid of how she would react if I told her about my situation.

Was this the right thing to do so I am not just wasting her time? Because if we did meet I already know I wouldn't be able to make eye contact or even come up with good conversation. Or should I still try and possibly embarrass myself when she ghosts me? Because I don't see how anyone who could get anyone would want to stick around with someone who has a lot of flaws right now.",26Jun2019,1
716,"I just graduated (I'm 30 though). Both jobs are good. 1 has a financial benefit, 1 has a social benefit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Job #1: City near my hometown, so I have friends and a sibling in the area. It's nice that I know people, but I'm worried about moving there expecting to hang out and join their group when they have established social circles. Sister is planning on having a baby in the next year or 2, so it'd be nice to see the niece/nephew frequently, but it's also a loss of part of my social interaction if I'm kind of depending on her. The rent and COL is at the top of my budget. The first year might be a little bit of a struggle because the position is less than full time to start with. Financially, I should be fine once I can secure full time hours, 1-2 years max, if not sooner. Will definitely have to be frugal. I'll probably live in the nearby suburbs, which isn't as fun as actually living in the city. 

&amp;#x200B;

Job #2: City 2 hours away. Job is full time, COL is lower so I will have a lot more disposable income. I'll be able to live in a more hip area of the city. I don't really know anyone in the city. I'm 30 and looking to put down roots somewhere, so I'm a little conflicted about a brand new city. Driving 2 hours to see friends in the first city is no big deal to me, but you're not really part of the group if you can only come occasionally like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having a social circle is very important to me at this point in my life, as I've been sacrificing that for school/a better job for the last several years. I'm worried about moving somewhere because I know people, because we've gotten more distant since I've been away and you can't depend on other people. City #2 affords me a higher standard of living right off the bat, but might be a little lonely if I don't know anyone. City #1 is a gamble- it'll either be amazing or terrible (if friends don't come through, I'll be lonely and poor). I don't know how to make a decision when both are good jobs.",26Jun2019,1

The older kid in particular is hard to work with because of the way they talk to me. By the older child my intelligence has been questioned, rules are constantly broken and when I follow through on punishing the bad behavior the child attempts to go over my head to the parents or manipulate me into backing off, both of which I've made clear are not acceptable. Because the younger sibling sees these situations play out frequently, they've developed an attitude towards me as well that they didn't used to have and don't have unless another member of their family is present. The parents are aware of the talking back, rude comments, and overall inappropriate behavior and have backed me in punishing the kids by taking away technology or sending to bedroom, but it hasn't stopped. At this point I'm not sure what to do. I like this job because well, it's easy, it pays well, and it feels personal. I just show up and don't have to worry about putting on a ""customer service face"" that many of my other part time jobs have required. However, I'm really sick of working with kids whose attitudes in general can be summed up by something they once pointed out to me- ""Our parents are paying you so really you work for us."" (This comment did not fly and they were punished) 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overreacting and just bad with kids? Is this normal behavior? I like the kids when they're not acting superior to me and I want to keep this job, but I feel like I'm stuck. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",26Jun2019,1
727,"I am 22 F, and last year for my birthday I got a tattoo from this guy. No issues transpired during my session, he was pretty nice and helpful. I decided this year to collaborate with him on a new tattoo sleeve.

At the initial consultation, thins went down hill. He took “reference” pictures (creep shots) of my ass for a tattoo meant for the front of my leg. Fine, no biggie I think. 

Next appointment, he tells me his coworkers dont trust him alone with female clients. Great. 

He hasn’t had time to work on my tattoo design, but he has had plenty of time to send me a stream of sexual emails, referencing handjobs he’s gotten from his former female apprentice, and trying to show me dick pics. 

He then found out my insta and started DMing me, trying to get me to come to his shop alone to see “sketches” that he hasn’t even made yet...

I’m already booking time with a new (female) tattoo artist in another city, but I feel like a total moron for letting this happen to me - thinking that I could even get professional work out of him after he started acting like this. 

How do I break it off with him and get the hell out of dodge? What should I do with these gross emails he’s sent me? I just wanted a tattoo, not dick pics!",26Jun2019,15
728,"So, I've been friends with this guy for about 5 or so years. He's been with this girl for 3 years; they got engaged and moved in together after 4 months of knowing each other. She has bpd and threatens to kill herself all the time, which is why I think they moved so fast. 

Now, this isn't the first time she's shown that she is probably cheating on him, but in the past I've ignored it because I didn't want to get involved. However this time his fiancé has been posting on multiple sites and apps that she's single, gay, and looking to hook up with any girl that wants to. Other people are starting to notice and it's getting a little embarrassing for him. 

She's been commenting on a lot of girls' posts and photos saying that she'd like to hook up and some other nsfw thing. And she's also been inviting girls to come back to the house to hook up. Which is even more concerning considering we all live together. I don't know what to do, I'm at such a loss. Should I tell him and risk hurting him, or should I just let it go like I've done in the past?",26Jun2019,1
729,"Hey, Desperate Son here...

My mom is constantly mean to me. she wakes up in the morning and she's mean. she goes to sleep at night and she's mean. She's not just shitty to me.  She's mean to EVERYONE.

per example: before she went to the grocery store this morning i asked if she could get some orange juice (as i'm sure anyone would agree, not an unreasonable request/question to ask at all.) she literally snapped going ""what did i tell you i was going to do?!"" I said:""what?"", and she said:""I told you I'm going to the store!!"" 

I'm seventeen years old and I've been dealing with this exact type of behavior my whole life from her. It's simply standard procedure on her part to either say mean things or say them in a mean way. She makes me see red at times. I get seriously desperate knowing that no matter how many times I have tried to talk to her about this behavior and how it's affecting me, I'd be better off talking to a brick wall. There is no accountability on her part whatsoever. I simply don't know what to do anymore and I'm writing this out of true desperation.

my dad is acutely aware of my mom's negative behavior and it affects him too as she treats him just as badly. my mom can't get along with both me and my sister simultaneously. If she's getting along with either one of us, she's fighting the other person. 

I don't know what to do anymore, any advice simply on how to deal with this without going nuts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.",26Jun2019,1

732,"So, needless to say I have had a pretty rocky relationship with my mother. At the age of 5, she got me to the hospital with my head wide open after one of her rage fits. I lied her for the subsequent 8 years and despised her in secret til it all blew out and we have both come a long way since then to try to have a friendly relationship. Friendly in the sense of actual friends, since I told my mother I do not want her to be my mother, as she did a bad job at it in the first go.


In the past three years, life has gone crazy, for sure. I went abroad to live for a while and ended up homeless for almost a month. The only reason I could eat and was not on the streets was because of charity because my mother had no money to send me and all my money was taken from me. When I came back, I discovered my mother had sent money, but she sent it to the woman that stole from me and made me homeless. Whenever I brought up the hardships I faced, she said she felt the worst during all of it.


This brings me to Monday. My mother spent over ten days traveling to different places and came back home with my father. I avoid my father at all costs because of his alcoholism. I got mad at my mother because she did not talk to me beforehand and she came up with a billion excuses for it. I eventually gave in and tried to be okay though not cheery, until at night my mother blew up on me. I was trying to check my blood exams on my laptop and she started yelling at me to put the groceries away. I told her I would do it right after I checked my exam. She complained and yelled and eventually closed my laptop on my hand and tried to take it from me. I got it from her and put it carefully on the table. At this point, I was yelling, too, because I was scared.


My mother comes up on me and grabs both of my arms with all her strength. I tell her to let me go and eventually I get desperate and yell for my boyfriend to call the police while I am crying. My boyfriend was watching the whole thing, but he is a foreigner and did not know the police number, so he just stood there. My mother laughs and then dedicates herself to my left arm, leaving me two bruises, a big cut and a trail of smaller ones. She also grabbed my face, but most of the bruises went away over night with the exception of a small cut near my eye. After all of that, my mother and my father forced me to the kitchen and stopped my boyfriend from getting in. They mocked me while I cried and put the groceries away. At the end, I asked to be left alone in my room for a while. My mother had already calmed down and tried to say three times over that she was hurting more with the whole situation than I was. When she finally left I told my boyfriend we should go to his house.


Before going to my boyfriend's, my mother talked to me and cried. I had to comfort her because apparently she hurts more than I do. She told me to work on my attitude while I was away and made me promise I would go to her medical check ups with her on Friday (she is scared of her hepatitis). I accepted her apologies but I still have an uneasy feeling about her.  I do not know how to face life with her anymore and I know that talking will only lead to her victimising herself again.

tl;dr: My mother physically abused me on Monday   and though she apologised, I have not seen her since and I do not know how to behave when I do see her again.",26Jun2019,1
733,"My ex that I still have feelings for and I have remained good friends after breaking up, and we normally talk daily. Even after breaking up, our dynamic became kind of flirty again, but I never addressed my lingering feelings with her, and for a while now it seems like we’re growing apart. 

Over the last week and a half, we’ve barely talked. At the beginning, she randomly stopped responding, which was odd for us, so I asked if everything was okay. She told me she would be busy with school and work and probably wouldn’t respond for a while, so I told her I hoped everything worked out, and that was that. A few days after that, I sent her a short text just making sure she was doing alright, and she responded a couple days afterwards saying everything was good, she had been busy that weekend and forgotten to respond. I said that’s good because I couldn’t think of anything else, and she didn’t respond. 

I wouldn’t be concerned, but I feel like I somehow did something wrong. She tends to stay busy, but as I said, we usually talk every single day. On top of that, I still see her posting on social media pretty frequently every day, and she’s interacted with my stuff, but won’t talk to me? I just really miss her and want to make sure I didn’t mess something up. Should I just wait for her to say something, or should I once again text her like “hey let me know when you’re not busy” or something?",26Jun2019,4

I need some advice primarily based on experience, but anyone can help really.

I have just finished my 168h course to become an ESL teacher (TEFL certificate) and my wish is to go live in Japan for 6 months or even a year!
I'm really excited for the idea and the experience that I would gain from it.
However, I've been watching some youtube videos related to teaching English in Japan and the overall reviews are pretty negative.
(Teaching not as expected, bad salary and not worth doing).

I'm not that bothered about the teaching part because I primarely want to experience living in Japan in general and I'm confident I would enjoy whatever position I'd get as a teacher.

The pay check is already assessed in the contract before I actually fly to Japan and most of the contracts I've seen offer around 245.000 Yen a month (1.800 GBP). Is that enough to live?

Nevertheless, Is it worth doing? I think so!

Any advice?

Is it worth teaching english in Japan? What's your experience?",26Jun2019,2

We ended up getting together a week after that, but it was different.

Anyways, I’m a pretty pathetic loser. I’m a 6th year liberal arts student, was on track to graduate this semester but as usual I had another deep depressive episode that left me locked in my apartment for days. I had a very strong start to the year despite going through a breakup right before the beginning of the semester, which started to fuck with my head a bit.

Due to this, my grades plummeted, and I now reside with 9 hours left to graduate and a gpa below graduation standards. I’m already deeply buried in loans after my parents stopped helping me pay for tuition, and at this point I don’t think it’s worth continuing for a useless liberal arts degree. I have absolutely no confidence in myself and I have no friends at school, as they have all moved on and graduated. I’m alone every day here and I’ll go a week without talking to someone in person. 

My family was so proud seeing me in my cap and gown, and they held a graduation party for me. I’ve never hated myself more than that day, and I contemplated killing myself that night. 

My family still doesn’t know I didn’t graduate. I probably shouldn’t have ever gone to college in the first place, I’ve always been slow and I am convinced I lie on the autism spectrum. 

So what the hell do I do now? I assume informing my parents is the first step. Is it worth continuing a pursuit for this useless degree? Do I pick up a trade? Diagnosed adhd so I’m sure the military is out of question.

Then my friend contacts me today and said his sister (same grade as my brother) saw him and some other guys and girls from the school with him and they like offered to her to vape, but she just got out of there then told my friend, then told me.  

I went out with my friend scouting out where my brother said he was, couldn't find him at the first location, called him again, and said they were going to the convenience store. Well, my friend and I took a detour around to come up behind them at the convenience store so they wouldn't see us. We came up and talked to them as they were sitting on the lawn in front of the store. He seemed slightly nervous but nothing. My friend and I went in the store, bought something, and saw them start leaving. We went to the direction of my house but I saw them going the direction to the lake by our house (he said he was at the lake yesterday with his friends 'just talking').  Then my friend and I walked to the lake, he wasn't there, and I called him, he said he went to his friends house to watch a movie. My friend's sister talks to her friend, and said that she has talked to my brother about it and that. And with not all the much evidence, I called him. 

But he kept declining my calls, and texted me, ""can we just text, we are watching a movie"" I told him to walk out of the room and answer the call (I called him a good 6 times, then on the 7th he picked up the call.  I asked where he was and said that my mom asked of where the address is (she didn't tell me that), but he said that he called my mom and said that he could stay longer at his friend's house. But then I just told him very vaguely 'i know what you did' and he was like avoiding the question, then I eventually got him to tell me: 'i used the nicotine machine' in a very scared and quiet voice. He said, ""what are you going to do, tell mom? What are you going to gain?.' I told him I wouldn't gain anything. And I told him just don't do it again and he said he won't.

I've always struggled with social anxiety, which is on the way to becoming much better, but I still don't really have much confidence in myself. I am also terrified of rejection, to the point where even asking a friend to hang out and getting a ""sorry, can't today"" makes me feel like a moron.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a party last week. I was only going to stay for a few beers because I was kinda tired, and I only knew the host of the party. However, a couple of girls that used to go to my school ended up coming, and I really hit it off with one of them (F22). I'd talked to her a few times before, but we're not super well acquainted. We were joking, playing beer pong, laughing and talking all night. We ended up going to a club and staying way longer than everyone else, dancing and making out. At one point I'm quite sure she said ""I'm saying this now, before it sucks too much: I'm gonna be going home tonight"". I told her that that was obviously fine, and for her not to worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Her place was on the same way as mine, so we walked together for a bit, and I offered to pay for a cab so she could get home (she was pretty drunk). She kept putting it off, wanting to walk for a bit longer, always pulling me to the side of the road to kiss me, until she just said we should probably be getting back to my place soon. I just sort of went with it, though I made very sure that she went straight to bed when we got there.

&amp;#x200B;

The morning after, she initiated sex. I was happy about this, because we were sober and she was still into it, and I've kind of always had like, a casual crush on her. However, I just couldn't get my... stuff to work. This is nothing new, and I know very well that it's a product of my anxiety - sex with new people is always difficult, and it's a problem I keep coming face to face with.

&amp;#x200B;

We tried a couple of times, but yielded no results, so I just got her off with my hand. We then got out of bed and got dressed, and she was saying something about meeting a friend soon. She didn't rush out, though, she sat with me on the couch waiting for her friend to call, would lay down with her head in my lap, at least giving me the signal that she didn't feel awkward about it.

The thing is, I've been going crazy about this stuff. I really wanna see her again, even if it's just casually hanging out, but I'm not sure if she'd be into that. I just feel like I'm ""that guy who couldn't get it up"" to her. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A girl that I kinda know but not super well crashed at my place after a party, we tried having sex the morning after, but I couldn't get it up. She didn't seem very awkward about it, and I'm trying to figure out if it'd be weird for me to text her, even if it's just to hang out casually.",26Jun2019,1

763,"Hello everyone.  This is my first post on this so I will try to not be too long.  Quick information about me, I am a 25 yr old male and I am an engineer.  Recently I have been feeling more and more stressed all the time.  To the point where on my drive home for work or just in my room I would love to just cry, and I have started to drink more when I am at home.  The stress has been caused a lot by my social anxiety and my constant loneliness.  I have friends, but feel like I never talk to them and they never ask to hang out, and I have texted in our group chats to hang out all the time.  When I do this though I don't usually get an answer.  But there have been multiple cases where one of them messages something to hang out and suddenly everyone answers.  It makes me feel worthless and unwanted most of the time.  I am also currently looking for my first home with my girlfriend.  This is another load of stress as I make pretty good money for a couple years out of college but she makes basically minimum wage.  We live in New England and this makes it super difficult to find a house as they are all expensive as heck, and I want to talk about her looking for a career (she has a degree in history) but I am way too scared to say anything.  As a 25 yr old I want to move out and just feel worse and worse living at home and feel like I am invading in my dads space now.  I constantly think about just moving out to another state and looking for another job, but my anxiety and fears take over make me too scared to do anything, as I am too scared to leave my good job and the friends I made there.  I am at the point where every second of the day I feel stressed, miserable, lonely, and like I am not succeeding in anything and it is effecting a lot in terms of friendships I want to make better and just overall everything.  There is a lot more but I do not want to type it all here and take too much time.  Is there anything or anybody I can talk to that could help me?

770,"I’m starting my self care/love journey this summer. Physical, mental, or emotional tips are all welcome. I’m not sure how to word what I’m looking for (which is something I’m working on) so I’ll just give a brief description of my issues, some goals I want to meet, and some things I’m already doing so y’all don’t waste your time. Also I’ll put a check by everything I’m currently doing and two for what is working, just incase someone else is looking for the same thing.

Physical 

I want to be fit and by “fit” I mean relatively athletic. I’m thin but I want to be stronger in my upper body and I want to be able to run for longer. I just find it super hard to breathe while running. My face has acne scars but they’re fading. I have seb. filaments on my chin that I don’t know what to do about. I’m working on my insecurities about my breast size. I’m kinda knock-kneed. I say kinda because I learned to walk with my knees straight and feet pointing out instead of having my knees in. 

- Taking Krav Maga classes (I’m always concerned about my safety)
- One Punch Man Routine (100 pushups, sit-ups, etc.) 
- Aloe Vera for scars ✔️✔️
- Tea tree oil face wash ✔️✔️(works for acne not sure about filaments)
- Back/leg posture Braces

Mental 

This crosses over to emotional but I’m about a year out of an abusive “parental” relationship. I’m recovering but it’s a struggle and I have relapses in myself hate (something I had pre this situation but it just made it worse). I want to love myself and cut down on my anxiety.

- Stop talking down on myself


Emotional 

Emotions are hard asf. I have severe trust issues and a conflicting need to over share. I have new need to be validated which might stem from being a empath most times. “Most times” cause I’m kinda emotionally numb. I had to hide my emotions to come out the situation above with my sanity and I’m struggling to reconnect properly. I also can’t tell if I’m using people or if I’m being used.

- Therapy  

Social

I’m an ambivalent person. Not exactly introverted or extroverted. I have different need for friends at different times. At this point of my life and the life of my peers (high school) everyone kinda just fall in to pseudo-cliques ( party friends, book worm friends, etc.) . Very few people cross over but they’re all fun in their own ways and I value them. My issue is feeling like I’m valued back and determining whether I’m being to lenient or harsh on people. I also want to brings up my interests in a non obsessive way.

- Talk less smile more
- Get a lot of small groups of friends 
-Not be a “nice girl”✔️✔️

771,"So I [19M] was talking to my girlfriend [18F] about few things and she told me that she has to attend her friend's birthday party and she told me that she wants to wear this dress which she really likes but her mother thinks that that's too revealing and so she is pissed off about that and this stuff happens to her most of the times even in her own house where her mum or brother would tell her not to wear this and that because it's too ""revealing"" or because it looks ""vulgar"". For example once she was wearing booty shorts and was chilling in her room when her brother came in and told her too change it because it looked vulgar.

So I was listening to all of this and I told her to wear what she likes and fight back to her mother for what she thinks is right. because I think the only way to overcome such problems is to face it yk.. so I told her to face the adversity and stand straight for what she thinks is right. and then, I think, she got kinda irritated with me and told me that I can never understand what she goes through. So I told her that I get all that but but there are only two options for you : 1) either you face her and fight her and throw some shit back at her. And wear that dress you like.
2) or don't. and do what she says and cry about it.
And she just replied me with, ""ok thanks. Next."" 

I mean I get it. I won't understand what she goes through. I won't ever understand. But I do know how to deal with this cuz my parents aren't easy. Im literally fighting with them so that they let me do what I like and get into a career that I like. I fight to them when I have to travel to another city to meet my girlfriend. I have to fight with them so that they'd let me go at night with my friend. Now obviously they're concerned and dont want us to get hurt but they say some pretty harsh stuff. But that's the thing! We'll have to speak up and fight back and that's the price we'll have to pay to get what we want and to fight for what we think is right. We might be wrong but that's how well learn and get better with our decision. They give me shit all the time about how I won't be able to do it or how this isn't the best option for me and you're doitit all wrong.and the only way I'mma get past that is by talking to them. Facing them. That's what I told her to do. Yeah I know it would be hard and exhausting and she has tried. But I think she should try harder. And even if it hurts her... She'd be that much more stronger the next time. Plus she even told me that she likes arguing with people because she's always arguing with people on the internet. 

I don't wanna hurt her more than she already is but I really really wanna help her because she always gets messed up about these things and I just can't see her sad like that. What should I do? And how should I help her and console her?",26Jun2019,1

774,"Last December, I(20F) moved 1,200 miles away from home to be with my boyfriend(27M) in the army. It took over a year to plan, and it has been the most love filled, happy 6 months of my life. I am working towards paying off some debt I have, already payed off 2 credit cards by getting client's and cutting hair from home. (I'm a hairdresser licensed in my home state). I have the opportunity to work on the post, but I'm making more than enough money by doing hair from home while working to go back to online schooling. We are also leaving this post to go to a different one in about 5 months time. 

All is well. The issue here is my parent's from the beginning have disagreed with my decisions. When I told them I was moving, handed them a 12k check to pay off my car(they said I wasn't able to leave anywhere until I paid off my car which my father's name was cosigned on). They didn't believe I could do it, and they said they were dissapointed in me and my choices. 

I have never had a strong relationship with my mother, but a strong one with my father. My mother is the type to manipulate others to say things or do things, so she looks like the good guy. 

Since I came down here, they have constantly said I now live in the swine of the country, saying I degraded my way of living, etc. Constantly bashing me. The one time I told them about an issue, they completely lost it saying I shouldn't have moved this proves they were right about my decision to do so.

I surprised them over Easter and flew home for a week, spent over 700 dollars for a plane ticket. I call them everyday asking about their day, helping them, letting them know i'm still there for them. 

Though, I am very vague to them about my day or anything going on in my life. I can never ask for help with questions, as it will be ammunition to them in the future. The other day, my boyfriend got the news of when we were leaving here to essentially go to the place where he is going to go to school to get promoted. I was super happy/excited for him, even us to get out of here. I called my parent's thinking that this is amazing news. 

Now, how they initally reacted was surprised I was going to go with him to 6 months to this 'school'. I told them yes of course. It's a great place, then after that we can decide where to go, even NY close to home. That's where shit got off the rocks. 

They both came right at my throat saying I was a disappointment. That my boyfriend was taking advantage of me, that he had none of my best interest in mine. Basically that he's selfish. Then they also began to say that I am an embarrassment to our family. They have always refused to tell people that I moved down with my boyfriend and instead tell them I live with him and go to school. They continued to say that my entire life is going to be following him around and have no life of my own. I'm a fuck up. I messed up my entire life. That if I get married to him and have babies, our kids are going to be miserable along side me because they are army brats. That I am extremely unsuccessful. Why can't I be like my brother who lives an hour away and works in NYC making big money.

Now, I get it. They have my best interest in mind, and they want me to make a lot of money like  my brother. They want me to be independent. They don't understand, that when I cried over them that night. My boyfriend is the one that held me in his arms. Told me he will support me in every way humanly possible. That if it doesn't work out, for some crazy reason, that I'm only 20. His mother told me that I am a smart girl that has so much potential. 

They're both proud of me for getting away from my mother who has manipulated my father into leaving his dream job and say something like this to his daughter.  My brother is on my side, agreeing none of that should of been said. They are aloud to have an opinion on my situation, but they should be supporting me. Making sure that I'm happy. Ending with, what even is success, you're happier and healthier than ever. 

I guess what I'm asking here, I know it's a jumbled mess is how to deal with this. My heart aches because I do love my father. My relationship with my mother is a bit distant, but I don't know how to cope with this. I can't go to them. I can't say anything to them. I just need help.",26Jun2019,1

776,"I graduated top of my class at high school in Australia, went on to complete a business degree. At the start of university (2015) I fell in love with a girl who I met on Tinder. She was an amazing distraction from university. Things quickly progressed, however about 6 months in, I started cheating on her occasionally by downloading the Tinder secretly and matching with girls to fill my time. I would never meet up with anyone, just talk. Meanwhile, I would still be seeing my girlfriend a lot. About 8 months in, I moved out of my parents home into my own apartment. She was almost living with me. In 2016, I decided to start my own business on top of studying at uni. I worked on the business until early 2017, at which point I decided it had failed and drained a lot of my savings. Things were still going strong with my girlfriend. However, I would still cheat on her by downloading the app occasionally. Fast forward a few months, I managed to secure a highly paid graduate job through my experience starting my own business (2017). This is when things started to go downhill.

I started to become miserable, working in a job which was not fulfilling me nor giving me any sense of purpose. I would use the free time at work to download the dating apps onto my phone again and start chatting to girls. In late 2017, I started to feel a strong sense of unhappiness in my life and relationship. I started picking out minor flaws in my girlfriend and started fantasising about other girls. One night, I went out with a male friend to a university event (my last year of uni). I met a girl there and we secretly left the venue and I took her back to my apartment. Little did I know that my girlfriend had let herself in and was studying in my apartment. That is when I knew I had fucked up. There was no confrontation at the time, I just walked the girl out quickly and came back to my apartment to find a very upset crying girlfriend. I broke up with her on the spot, as if to justify my actions in being unhappy with the relationship. I know I am a massive douche for letting it lead up to that and allowing it to happen.

After the relationship ended in early 2018, I started to fall into a sense of depression and intensified lack of direction which has not left me since. I went and saw a therapist a couple of times and I'm taking anti-depressants. I gave up my apartment in mid 2018, and moved back home with my parents, because I couldn't cope with the memories held within the place. I quit my job at the end of 2018, which made me very happy. I had saved some money and in sheer hope that travel would solve my issues, I decided to move to London in March this year. London has been tough and travel hasn't helped me find a sense of purpose. I secured a job at a top software company, which has been as unfulfilling as my last job. I want to quit. I do know it has been a great learning exercise for me being here. 

The problem is, I now really want to move back home, because the quality of life looks better there than my current situation in London. As for my dating life, I go on lots of dates with girls, but they never seem to progress further than 1-3 dates as I continually look for better options and feel guilty about what happened in my last relationship. I just have no idea to stop this 'grass is greener' mentality and to be happy with my current situation, nor do I know how to find what I truly am passionate about in terms of a career that will inspire me to go to work everyday. 

Any advice?",26Jun2019,1

So today began with me and my wife thinking I would not be playing b-ball, and would me home for dinner. I didn't bring my ball clothes to work, and she took out hamburgers to defrost for dinner. Early afternoon my buddy texted me and said everyone is trying to switch back to today. Oh well, that's mildly annoying but no big deal, I told him I would pick up some clothes at Target and that I would be there. Texted my wife to tell her, below is how the conversation went:

Me: looks like bball is switched back to today, so annoying haha
Her: ughhh I took the burgers out too
Me: just make the burgers, doesn't matter
Her: Well me and the boys can just have the burgers if you want to go. It's not a big deal if you want to

I found out that 70% of the IGs he follows are fetiche IG with asses just like mine. (Not people with big asses in the pics... just the asses! All ass and no face or anything else. Just the freaking asses)

783,"Hello, I'm a college student who is struggling financially and wanted advice about what's appropriate in a super weird situation. I don't want to be a bitch but I also don't want to be a pushover. 

In January I took over the lease of an acquaintance's apartment who was leaving a semester earlier than planned while she moved to a different city for an internship. She left a mattress, dresser and desk for the time being but soon I was pleasantly surprised when she told me that I could keep the furniture besides the mattress because she had no way of moving it and wanted different stuff for her next apartment. She said this on multiple occasions to me and my roommates. This was great news because me and my roommates ended up getting along great and I signed on for another year. 

So fast forward to now. I've had this dresser and desk for a semester and a few months, with the understanding that I would just need to replace the mattress. Aquaintence is moving back to the area so for the past few weeks I've tried to coordinate her picking up the mattress. She told me last week that she would pick it up this weekend on the 28 or 29, and then this morning, 2 days before that she texts me: 

""So I have some unfortunate news. My mom and I have had a big misunderstanding about my old furniture that you're using. I thought she was cool with you keeping it but she actually wants to make a profit off of it since she paid a pretty penny for the furniture. She said that you're more than welcome to keep the furniture, but she would like $250 for everything besides the bed because I gotta get that back...""

I can't finance the unexpected $250 and the mattress I have to buy and still make July rent so I'm like, ""I can't afford that right now, do you know when you are going to want to take the furniture?"" and she tells me her parents are going to come Friday morning (2 days from now) and asks if I can let them in to take the stuff!! But she implied that they would prefer if I just paid for the furniture (for reference the dresser is huge and very heavy. I can't imagine how they plan on transporting the dresser/desk/ and mattress at once). 

 I just feel really blindsided and I think it's innappropriate to demand payment for something you gave someone months ago. Especially on such short notice so that I either have to pay or be left without any furniture in my room, (which doesn't even have a closet). Also maybe not completely relevant but really bizarre twist is that Aquaintence has complained about how much furniture her mom buys and owns and called her a ""furniture hoarder"" before so I'm thinking their plan for this stuff is to put it straight into storage.  I know this is a complicated situation so I guess I'm just asking a general ""what would you do?"" I feel really silly but I'm really not sure.",26Jun2019,1
786,"Tldr: I have a crush on my roomate and it makes me jealous when she talks to anyone I don't know who she's talking to.


So this is my first time posting ever so im gonna try and put this the best i can.

Around 6 months ago I moved out of my parents (I'm 19 and there's a few reasons I decided to), the quickest way for me to do this was to move in with a friend which I met at work around 2 years ago. I had a crush on this girl before moving in with her but thought i could just hide my feelings to not make it complicated.

About a month ago I decided it was time to tell her how I feel in a way which I hoped wouldn't make things awkward so I sent her a message explaining everything.
Long story shortly she turned me down saying I need to sort out what I really want (This was because I used to prefer guys over girls), she wanted to stay friends which I understood.

Now though I've noticed that she's taking interest in people and talking to people more. I don't know if these are guys she's interested in or if its just her friends and tbh it's not really any of my business.

Unfortunately this is making me jealous and I have been trying to hide this but it is making me more and more easily annoyed.

791,"So our houses aren’t attached cause the neighbour is on the left. The owner of the house has rented out rooms to bunch of people in their twenties I am pretty sure. What separates a bit of our garden is a wall which is really nice and people can sit on especially his side.
The people in their twenties so far I know is two guys and two girls but I’m not entirely sure. I know of the guys name. He’s actually cute or whatever but regardless my room is near the wall. I have to open my windows to allow air in because it’s always hot even without radiators. Every single day around 9pm they go to the wall and start smoking and crap. The air comes in via my walk in closet. I closed that window as suggested by my mother then I waited 10 min while laying down and all of a sudden a gust of smoke of cigarettes enters into my room via the window behind me where my bed is. Honestly I don’t even know what to do anymore.
I don’t want to be rude because we all get along well and he’s really nice to my nephew whenever he sees him. Also always says hi and stuff to my family. I just don’t appreciate this whole smoking thing.
I don’t know what they do for living because I literally see them home all the time.

792,"My friend makes some really questionable decisions in her love life.

Outside of relationships, she is an amazing friend, but if anyone gets involved with her romantically, it never ends well.

She’s a bit of an attention seeker. Whoever gives her the most attention is usually who she ends up with, even if the dude has something off about him, she’ll usually look past it if he gives her enough attention. And if the relationship gets stale in any way he doesn’t give her enough attention, she’ll find someone else who will.

And don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying all of the guys she’s dated are bad. In fact, I’m still really good friends with some of her exes. But i do feel that she’ll greatly lower her standards if someone is willing to pay attention to her.

She also always seems to be trying to be older than she is. She got a job at 15 (one she really didn’t need). And it’s not the job itself that’s the problem, it’s that she works insane hours at a job she doesn’t need. 

She is constantly talking about wanting to have kids, always talking about how she has baby fever, and yes, some people do catch baby fever at one point or another, but it’s something she brings up multiple times a day, it’s hard to get through a conversation with her without her bringing it up. I’m totally convinced she’s fully prepared to do something that will ruin her life. While kids are something most people want at some point, I feel it’s unhealthy to be considering having one before you’ve even graduated high school.

Maybe it’s not my place, but if there’s a right way to do it, I’d like to be able to tell her what I think without putting our friendship in jeopardy.

It’s just hard to watch a friend make stupid decisions.",26Jun2019,1

I worked for a roofer and made 100 bucks in 2 days. However, he only needed me for the first half. The next job he offered is a couple days after rent is due.

794,"So I'm in my 3rd semester of technical college and I currently work as a receptionist at a motel 6. It's, as you can imagine, less than illustrious. I originally got the job since sister put in a good word for me while she worked here and said she would train me. So I started working in October but wasn't officially on payroll till January. 

Apparently the owner actually has the official book needed for training employees. He assured me he'd fun it (he never did). The only employees I know of are me (the only receptionist) and house keeping who comes in the morning. I come in everyday bare Sunday and work 5 to 10. Generally I just check people in and count the cash we made, as well as come to guests' rooms when they need something or something isn't working. If I can't do it for some my male manager does. 

As of late I've been called out for messing up somethings here and there despite before hand I'm either not told at all or not given enough information. Just yesterday I was giving someone a room on the bottom floor and on the guest sheet two rooms are  available but in the system there's only one. Naturally I ask them about this and they put him in the taken room but in the system have him be in the empty room. I got very confused at this so I put him in the room that was both empty in the system and on the sheet. Turns out the room has been having bathroom problems (they didn't tell me this and luckily dude didn't seem to mind) and the room that's taken in the system is actually empty since the guy actually checked out earlier than he was supposed to. None of this was communicated before hand.

Don't get me wrong both of my managers are generally very kind to me, with the female manager (other manager's wife) usually brings me fruit to eat while sitting here for 5 hours. Not to mention the job is such a way that I can just and do school work as I wait for someone to come. It's just so frustrating after a while you know? Especially since I just make 8 bucks an hour.   

Should I start looking for something with my structure or should I not screw this job up considering my circumstances?",26Jun2019,1

796,"I’ve seen a few similar posts, but it looks like they’re geared more toward internships/temporary positions... so sorry if this is a repost!

About a year and a half ago I graduated college with a degree in engineering and got a job about 2000 miles from home, in a very different style community than I was in before (think North US vs South US). 

In the beginning I was excited because it was a solid, easy job with good pay, in a pretty cool place with plenty of cool things to do. It took time, but I made a few friends inside work and we slowly began to hang out on the weekends as I became a part of the group. After a year I got a promotion and a raise (quick compared to others in my position at this company) and was praised by my management as being very good at my job. I got to do things I loved on the weekend I couldn’t do at home such as snowboarding and felt like I could probably stay here for a while. My point really is I have everything I could probably ask for besides maybe a few small things (but hey life can’t be perfect so that’s ok). 

Recently I took a trip back home, and while I was there I had this sudden rush of sadness/anxiety come over me. I could tell I felt the happiest I had been in a long time and felt like I was in a place I belonged again. I was sad because I obviously had to go back to my new home in a couple days. At first I thought this was normal and I was just catching a little bit of the homesickness, but it’s been weighing on me still. I feel like when I’m back in my new home I’m just kind of coasting, numb almost. I’m not extremely happy, but not depressed either.

My dilemma is, am I just still fresh to the game and I haven’t settled here yet, or am I really unhappy here and I’m just sticking it out because “it’s what’s good for my career and my life”? I’ll make a six figure salary this year and if I stick around it’ll only get better, but everyone knows the saying money can’t buy happiness. 

I don’t want to be known as the kid who freaked out and had to move back home and it’s also hard to throw away a good job... but I feel like I’m just waiting to finally become happy. I would make a huge career risk moving back home, and my internal debate is whether that’s worth it, or to stay longer and find out if things smooth out.",26Jun2019,3
797,"I'm not posting this for sympathy or pity, but for the first time in my life I feel really stuck... and this is me trying to reach out. The last time I felt functional and happy was three years ago.  

Career: Three years ago I was studying music, performing amateur musical theatre, I was in a choir and I genuinely knew what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't great at it but I was passionate and it made me happy, until I entered my final year of college and faced endless and relentless bullying about my musical ability, I left college and had a job that consisted of music/entertainment and it was one of the worst years of my life. I've since lost all passion for creating music, and I don't know what to do with my life, I'm currently in a dead-end job that's ""fine"" (but I know I don't have the job security to do it forever)  

Health: I have a progressive health problem, it's slowed down but... I'm just getting so tired of dealing with it, it's worn me down. I don't feel strong enough to put up with it anymore, and it terrifies me to think about it potentially getting worse. On top of that, I figured out late last year that I'm transgender - which is causing massive amounts of stress because being disabled and not being able to work a full workweek I'm struggling to save up the large sum of money I need to actually start transitioning (in regards to seeing doctors and buying prescriptions) on top of that I'm considering not transitioning because of fear of rejection from family and loved ones, which is very upsetting.  

Relationships: My Wife loves me, but doesn't believe she can be happy in a relationship with me on account of her being straight (which is fair enough, I know you can't change sexuality) but we also can't seem to end the relationship because every time we try we both end up in tears and backpedal, so divorce is constantly on our mind like it's something that could happen any week and we're trying to avoid it. I've been in a relationship with her for about 5 years, and she's genuinely the light of my life, I would die for her... but she's insistent that I can't avoid transitioning just to stay in the relationship. We spend too many nights crying about the situation and while she's supportive and loving, I can't help but feel like I'm actively ruining everything by being transgender.  

The state of the world: I've been ""told off"" for being so pessimistic about this before, and so it probably sounds idiotic, but combination of environmental damage, idiotic world leaders, and the rise of the alt-right, I just genuinely feel like things are just going to continue to get worse, and I'm struggling to deal with it.  

The worst thing being, I don't feel safe to go to therapy, because if they think I'm depressed they might they have a tendency to shove pills in my face, force me into an institution, or worse yet they would delay my transition until I was ""better""... but the delays and gatekeeping for transition is one of the things that's already making my life so difficult , so they would unintentionally make things much worse. I was always told that you deal with large problems by breaking it into smaller tasks, but this almost feels like a ""death of a thousand cuts"", there's just too much to deal with.

Please help.

798,"Sorry for the wall of text 

tl;dr I have pent up resentment towards my parents because of the way they've dealt with/ deal with mental health problems my siblings and I suffer from and it's causing me to become unstable.

My parents are great people they're nice, accepting and loving. But they've hurt me more than anyone ever has or could. 
My brother, my sister, and I all suffer from mental illness (depression, anxiety + autism) and my parents REALLY don't know how to deal with that, even though they always tell us they've had it too (they grew out of it). 
We haven't yet, still waiting for that miracle day. 
But throughout our younger teen years to now they've said and done things that I can't understand how you could be capable of telling your children that. 
When my brother was depressed they yelled at him, when I finally confided in my mother the first thing she asked me was if I was faking it. 
They're always angry at us but I can't help it. I didn't choose to be this way, we didn't choose to feel this way. But every time we're dealing with something they get mad at us. 
They've made us all feel like disappointments, and honestly I hate my parents. 
But I love them more, and yet I can't forgive them. All my pent up feelings are causing me to have sudden bursts of intense sadness and anger and I have like an anger attack. 
And it sucks. I can feel myself slowly going back to that dark place, I wish there was just a magical pill I could take that would either kill me or take away my emotions. I'm so tired of this bullshit. How do I deal with my resentment towards my parents? I need help.",26Jun2019,3
799,"I'm really struggling. I think it happened after my breakup about a year ago. I just haven't felt the same. I'm totally over her, even had another short term gf in between, but I've just not been able to feel good about myself. My two closest friends almost seem like they're annoyed by me, which could be my anxiety speaking, which is also the hardest part in me not feeling like I like myself at all. Example being, I'll literally ask a question in a quiet room/car and get no response, ask again, none, maybe even ask again to comprehend what is happening before me, and nothing. Even on the mic when we chat and game, I'll ask something 3 fucking times, and they'll only respond when I ask ""Is my mic even working?"" and it drives me crazy, honestly. It has been for weeks now. The reason I feel like I'm not crazy is because I hangout with another, large group of friends and every. single. person there treats me amazingly, like they really love having me around, I'll gravitate around and talk to various groups of them and everyone finds me hilarious, I become so charismatic around them, etc. etc. Sorry I'm rambling, but I really don't feel like I appreciate or like myself in the slightest. At work, been here 7 months and I work under the radar. I barely ever talk. I feel like I have zero personality. Even throughout college, I made 2 friends and we weren't friends by the end because I stopped wanting to hangout with them anymore, just no connection. I just feel like I suck socially at making new friends.

809,"I met a friend through my previous job. We have a lot in common and he’s really fun in social situations. We can talk for hours about a lot of different types of things. I like him as a person a lot and I wish we could just have a fulfilling friendship. 

But he has had a rough life. Has never had good parents and was in foster care during his middle school years. He was married for a little while and got divorced 3 years ago, and it gets to him a lot. He thinks he’s incapable of being loved. He lives alone, well with his dog, but I think living alone takes a toll on him. He’s recently dealing with discovering he is genderqueer and struggles with keeping it secret but wishing he could be open about it to people he knows that wouldn’t be okay with it or accepting. I am super supportive of all of that, and super supportive and present in general to listen whenever he wants to talk. 

He is also severely depressed a lot. There’s been quite a few times where he messages me that he is considering ending his life. In the days that follow those days he talks to me about how he knows that’s not okay and he feels better and more in line with a good mindset. One night I came over to his apartment when he was feeling suicidal, uninvited, and it was very messy and disgusting. I started cleaning and he started helping me, and we cleaned his whole apartment and then watched some movies and it helped him a lot. 

I don’t expect those things to be permanent fixes or anything. And I’m not really asking how I can fix his depression because I know I can’t. 

But he always comes to me when he’s feeling sad. If I’m not with him in person he will be very stubborn and not take any of my comforting words or pleads to call the suicide hotline or his therapist. He just says “I have been this way for over 10 years and I’ll always be this way. I’m not strong enough. I just feel like giving up. No, don’t come over. You have your own stuff to deal with. Your own house to clean”. 

I want to be able to be there for him but he’s like a needy 24 hour job. I should mention that he trains me in the gym. He’s very knowledgeable on strength training and the gym in general and I’ve improved a lot in the months I’ve been exercising under his instruction. He tells me all the time that he needs to keep training me to feel like he’s reciprocating what he feels he is getting out of our friendship. But one time, after months of him telling me that I was an awesome friend and how I give him so much support and love, he got it into his head that he was giving more than I was and told me that he “couldn’t do it anymore” and was basically trying to say goodbye to me, as in he was going to attempt suicide, because he convinced himself that I didn’t want anything to do with him and that I was using him. 

I desperately want to be supportive and make him go on until tomorrow every day he’s not feeling like he can. But I can’t personally deal with always either being placed on a pedestal, being told that I am the most awesome person in the world and he doesn’t think he would be where he is without me, etc etc. and then on the flip side being told he’s going to kill himself and me feeling like it’s my fault that I don’t give him 100% of my time, and me feeling like it’s my responsibility to make sure he doesn’t do that. 

I am trying to get him to at least do some dishes or something because I know how he is - I mean he gets himself into the gym. If he just started doing some dishes, I know he’d be able to get through them all and then I know it would actually drastically improve his mood for a minute. I almost thought  about going to his place to clean again but, he was right - I have my own cleaning and things to do at my place. I can’t take care of him. I am 24 and he is 36. I can’t take care of him like that. 

Idk what to do because I’m feeling like everything I do is me trying to show him that I’m willing to hang out with him and do nice things for him to give him reasons to live. I wish he could be the person he was when I first met him and first hanging out with him. We got too close and now I feel I have to take responsibility because he puts so much weight in my being friends with him. But I feel like I’m always walking on eggshells too. I am always dealing with illogical thoughts coming from him and stress. I don’t know what to do about it. 

Any advice is appreciated.",26Jun2019,1
810,"So my bf and I met at our current job, have been dating several months. He ended a friends-with-benefits type relationship in order to date me. This person is one of our coworkers, who refused to date my bf seriously for 2 years and told him they couldn’t tell anyone about the relationship. To clarify, my bf is looking for his ever after/marriage/kids, she did not want that with him. 

None of our coworkers knew about their relationship at all. People only found after she told them because she lost her damn mind after she found out we were dating. Mind you, this vendetta started MONTHS after their breakup; before she was 100% fine and not being an asshole. 

Due to increasing escalation and her attempts to socially isolate my bf from our coworkers/friends, I fear she’ll actually try to get him fired. She’s been lying about the relationship (saying that it was more than it actually was) and reasons it ended. When she found out my bf was interested in me around March, she told my bf (again after they broke up) that she would “destroy” him if he dated me. We were already dating at the time (not out at work yet) but my bf was dismissive about this.

For the past  month or 2, my mom has been repeatedly smoking around my sister's 2  kids.  My sister goes to work in another state for one week and comes  back and takes care of her kids at the family house for a week. In  exchange, my sister pays for their food, care, clothing, etc. I finally  broke down after about a month of this, told my sister, and gave her  recorded conversations where my mother has openly said she doesn't care.  My sister is VERY sensitive about her kids' health and she specifically  asked my mom not to smoke around them.

My  sister is pulling her kids out of summer daycare to live with their dad  (who's an amazing dad) and my mom is accusing me of putting the 2 kids  in a worse house and trying to start drama. I'm worried about their  well-being and where they end up after all this blows over. My dad is  accusing me of going behind their back and my parents are considering  kicking me out.

Should I have just kept my mouth shut? Is there anything I can do for my own well-being in case the worst case scenario happens? 

**Additional info because in case you guys ask:**

I'm 23, my sister is 20. Oldest kid is about 2 or 3, and the youngest is 10 months old.",26Jun2019,1

I’ve never had a good relationship with my dad(a lot of childhood trauma that hasn’t been resolved and looks like it won’t be for a while) but I thought it was getting better.

821,"I'm feeling stuck in a very complex web of toxicity, and I could use some extra brain power, please. Bear with me; this is a long post, but I've tried to keep things as succinct as I can!

&amp;#x200B;

**BOTTOM LINE:**

I need a new job / line of work. Please help me get there.

&amp;#x200B;

**CIRCUMSTANCES:**

* WORK

I have a fairly high-level position in a small software company. I've been here for 3 years and change. The working environment is deeply toxic, and, by all sensible measures, the business is destined for collapse due to woeful mismanagement within the next 12 months or so. I absolutely hate my company and the work I do (for myriad reasons I won't dive into here), and am unfulfilled, burnt out, and professionally lethargic beyond measure.

Relative to my position, industry, and location (urban USA), I make a laughably small salary. However, I work 100% remotely from my home office, which offers me **critical** flexibility. More on that in a moment.

I have not completed a college degree. This, as we know, would be a significant disadvantage as a potential job-seeker.

I do not particularly enjoy IT work, and never wanted to be in this industry. Alas, here I am, because ""it pays the bills."" If I could find my way out, I'd love to.

* CHILD

I am the deeply proud daddy of an almost-10-year-old. She lives with me and her stepmother (her ""bonus mama"") on weekdays, and with her profoundly vicious, textbook-narcissist mother on weekends.

This mother of hers / ex of mine is bent on lash-outs and vengeful behavior against me at any opportunity, has been this way for years, and shows no indication of ever letting up. One of the biggest flags she flies is an endless attempt to change the parameters of the custody arrangement, in order to ""have more time"" with kiddo. This is obviously a bad idea for the poor kid, and I've been able to keep the evil at bay so far.

So, what does this have to do with my work problem?

Well, the flexibility offered by my work situation allows me to physically supervise the kiddo when she's home from school and during breaks (including right now, during summer break). If I took a non-remote job, she'd either A) be a latchkey kid, or B) need some kind of child care, which she seems a little too old for (and which it would obviously suck to have to pay for).

What's worse, in either of those scenarios, narc mom would attack (i.e. almost certainly file the court case she's been threatening for years) and try to get weekday custody. She'd argue that her fiancee is home during the daytime and could supervise kiddo. I'd argue that while he's home, he's sleeping, because he works graveyard shifts, and that doesn't qualify as supervision.

**This section's TL;DR:** The remote nature of my job is providing a shield against a horrible, vile *mom*ster.

* CONCLUSIONS(?)

I don't know how to escape a work situation that feels as though it's slowly choking me to death. I need to find some means of escape as soon as possible. I'm aware of self-care being a benefit for my family, and this makes my escape all the more important.

I need a job that pays at least close to what I make now; any significant reduction in salary is liable to become another avenue for attack by the demon mom. I also live in a very expensive area, but I cannot relocate without either taking kiddo with me (which would be all-out demon war) or leaving kiddo with demon full time.

I have considered trying to bootstrap a side hustle in the hope that it could supplant the current job, but entrepreneurship takes huge amounts of resources that I'm just not sure I can spare right now. I am still open to the possibility, though.

* **TL;DR**
* My workplace is sucking the life out of me.
* I have 99 problems, and a bitch ex-wife IS one...and so is the child we share.
* I have no college degree.
* Please help me find new work.

Thank you for slogging through this, dear hive mind!",26Jun2019,4
822,"So my partner has started a new job in a call centre this week. The first day was fine but now he is falling to pieces. 

He has a history of work related anxiety, it all started a few years ago when he was hired by a different call centre. At the time his dad died very suddenly from and overdose and 6 weeks later his grandmother died of cancer. He has a terrible relationship with his his mother and gets no family support. He ended up having to quit the job because of panic attacks and anxiety. He was unemployed for 8 months after quitting. After that he worked as a kitchen hand for almost 18 months. He struggled to get to work every single day, he panics and gets nauseous, works himself up to the point of tears and ends up crying and hyperventilating. He ended up leaving the dishie job because of his poor attendance, they let him resign rather than fire him. He was then unemployed for another 18 months.

This new call centre job pays really well, he likes doing office work and the hours are less erratic than the last job. He was really excited. The first day was fine, second day was tolerable and the third day (yesterday) was bad. He called me at 9, after starting at 8, while he was having a panic attack. His training supervisor had put him aside in a room to calm down, I helped him through the attack and the supervisor set him up with their employee assistance program (EAP). I then had to pick him up and take him home. He had a half hour talk with the EAP counselor, and gets another call next Friday. Last night he was very anxious, but managed to get a few hours of sleep. This morning he woke me up at 5 with another panic attack. It took almost 2 hours to get him calm, dressed for work and to the bus stop. I then spent half an hour on the phone with him while he was on the bus, talking him through breathing and staying calm. He made it to work and I've had no update since then, but if he makes it to midday I will be surprised. A big part of his anxiety is a flight reaction, where he can't even face what he needs to do and he ends up crying in a corner. 

He is on anxiety medication and has nausea medication. He also has a prescription for valium, which helps a lot. He's had lots of counselling before but we are in a bad financial situation and have to rely on free services. These are usually over the phone or really irregular appointments. He has so much to unpack that the appointments often don't make much progress and he doesn't always get to speak to the same person so the counselling hasn't been very helpful. 

I'm doing the best that I can to support him, I'm on uni break for another month thankfully, but after that I won't be available to help him for hours every day. I'm really frustrated with the situation because of the financial strain. This has been a problem for so long and I'm beginning to struggle seeing our future as a happy one. I'm not sure how I can keep calm and support him without having a breakdown myself. How do stay strong? What do I do if he ends up losing a third job because of this? I can't bear the thought of breaking up with him because of a mental illness but I want my future to good. I guess I need hope?",26Jun2019,1
823,"I met someone from Indonesia and have been chatting with him for a while. He has a family with a wife and 2 kids . He works 6-7 days a week as just a laborer so he doesnt make a ton.

I wanted to send him a TV and Nintendo switch that I dont use but a lot of people told me not to because of the reputation of Indonesian customs.

826,"Hey all,
I’m after some advice please regarding one of my mates. 
She’s got a 1.5 year old, and a 3.5 month old - she’s always had depression and anxiety, but during her second pregnancy she was happy as Larry, had an awesome pregnancy and a calm birth. 
But now... 
She hardly leaves her home, I’ll message her and not get a reply until sometimes up to a week later, I’ll ring her and she’ll ignore my calls. 
I’ve invited her saying, my son and I are going for a walk down the river, care to join? And she will decline. 
Yes I know she likes me as I managed to get a hold of her the other day and she did not want me to leave, I said a couple of times well I better go by the time I get home It’ll be time to cook dinner (I walked there) and she was like ‘oh no you can stay! Just stay and get your man to pick you up, you can stay!’ So I stayed because her husband was at a friends house and she did not want me to leave. 
When I rocked up to her house, she smelled really bad like she hadn’t been doing any self care, she looked dirty, there were nappies piles up and she showed me a video of her and her kids the previous day still wearing the same dirty clothes. I’m not trying to shame her, and my house is also not perfect, I’m saying these things because it says to me that she’s not mentally coping. 
I have said several times to call me (she has no family here), anytime she needs a break, I can come and get her kids and go for a walk while she has a shower or goes for a walk whatever she wants to do just to get a break. I’ve even offered her to come to my house and relax in the bath and I’ll look after the kids (they don’t have a bath only a shower and nothing relaxes me like a nice hot bath!) but she won’t take my offer. 
So I can’t say that I haven’t tried. I don’t know what else to do.
Should I just let her figure it out for herself, we always say ‘contact your friends to see how they’re don’t if they’re not doing well’ - but what if they ignore all calls etc? 
There is only so much I can do. 
I don’t even know if I’m after advice really or a vent? I’m not sure. But anyway.
Thank you",26Jun2019,1
828,"So I asked this girl out a year ago (she was my classmate), and she rejected me because she said she's not ""looking for a relationship""

She was really cool about it, but we both kind of distanced ourselves from each other. We didn't really talk for 6 months until in January, she texts me out of the blue.

We quickly catch up over lunch, and we agreed to be less distant from each other.

Unfortunately, afterwards, she didn't really engage with me when I texted her (left me on read twice) but she was also busy with school.

We were still cordial when we saw each other in person. 

However, she randomly texted me out of the blue last week, and we've been making small talk since then.

831,"Hi! So i created this account for advice on what to do with my life. I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering, but had to halt my studies due to a financial crisis. I am trying to figure out my options and see what i can do to straighten up my life. I have no family or anyone to help me. I am currently looking for a job since the place i worked at closed. I have submitted tons of applications online and have still not found a job. I find this surprising. I am well versed in many subjects and have lots of experience in Sales, Costumer Service, Electricity, and troubleshooting. I am a veteran and i no longer qualify for financial aid since i used my benefits. I only had partial benefits. I'm about to get evicted, and i'm still paying for my car. At this point i'm extremely concerned about what to do next. Its clear to me that finishing my school is my priority, which is what i'm attempting to do. I have a lot of student loan debt, and i don't mind getting more loans to pay off for school, except that my credit is not good at the moment. The more that i try and find an exit, the more things seem to be shutting down on me. right now the only gig that i have is working security on Saturdays and Sundays ..... I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I need life advice or someone to give me tips on how to pay for my school. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those wondering, I am 23 years old. 

Yes, i have applied for scholarships but have had no luck with any. 

Yes, I have approached veteran services and they have helped me somewhat (security weekend gig).

Yes, I have looked into loans and grants and am using fafsa.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to get an IT job and am working on my CCNA. The only problem is that that requires time, and i dont have time since i'm about to get evicted and am looking for a full or part time job.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice Helps. I'm currently living in the DFW area if anyone knows of any jobs that are hiring, or any programs i may benefit from.

Usually I just say no with the genuine excuse that lesbian dating can be kinda tricky. Well the other day I was talking on the phone with her when she asked me again if I was dating anyone and to tell her honestly. I said no and she says ""Well... Are there any boys in your life?""  


I obviously said no and my mom continued on.  


""So here's what I'm thinking. If somebody says they're interested in you just go for it, guy or girl. It's just about the experiences. Attraction shouldn't play a part in that.""  


I was obviously weirded out b/c my mom's always brandished herself as my ally, to the point where when I told her I thought I liked girls she went ahead and made a facebook post about how proud she is of me for discovering my true self and then proceeded to call all of our family on her side. She did all of this without asking me.   


I have no idea where this is coming from but she's started getting more pushy. Today she called me and said ""You need to not be so picky. It's just dating. If a man shows interest take him up on it."" She doesn't even ask me if I have any women in my life anymore, just if I have any men I like.  


I really need advice on how to deal with this. Should I talk to my mom about how uncomfortable she's making me? Or should I just start ignoring her?

845,"So this is pretty straight forward. My wife and I were at the mall the other day and we got a cart from the parking lot. Well when my wife came back to me she said that there was a bath and body works bag in it with some products that came to a total of around $50. We try to be really honest people because we eventually want to see our kids do the right thing when people arent looking.

So we came to the conclusion that we were going to go to the shop and see if anyone came back looking for the bag. No one had, then I asked my wife if the payment was made by card, because at least then we could return it and they would at the minimum get their money back with the slight inconvenience of having to go purchase the products again. She stated that it was paid for in cash. After thinking some more my wife had made a post on Facebook in our local cities fb page (we live in quite a small city/community).

The ideas that I found and I thought about using were:

\-  Start learn programming now and use it + the knoowledge from college to  freelance and make money while in college which is one of the pathhs.

\-The  2nd path I've thought of following is learning Facebook ads and running  an agency, doing fb ads for busines to get more money (i suck at  getting clients tho)

\-And other path i've thought of following is learning how to bug hunting and do bug bounty hhunting.

848,"Hey everyone! This is my first time posting on reddit for advice (or ever... my first post ever). I’m going to not discuss the private and personal details of this story, but I’ll just lay out the basic details. It would mean the world for me to hear a fresh point of view so I could act in the best way possible.

My two best friends (22m qnd 22f) and I (22m) have been a trio for as long as I could remember. A few years ago, I started to see red flags of an unhealthy friendship. Both of them would throw me to aside, ditch me for hours when we were all together, etc. I’ve always consistently spoken up about my concerns with how our relationship played out, and they seemed to listen. However, they never stopped their actions that made me feel secluded and not valued.

In the end, both of them ended up together. I’m not upset by the fact that they’re together at all, and always told them that they’d be perfect together. I’m more so upset that they’ve always thrown me away as a second thought and never looked at how their actions could affect me, not only with this but in general. For me, this was more so a last straw type of thing.

After finding out about their relationship without them telling me, I ended up accepting it and moved on from them hiding from and lying to me. But they consistently wouldn’t reach out to me, kept me in the dark, and lied to me countless times after. They acted extremely untrustworthy and unreliable for two people who I considered family for most of my life.

This all occurred during an extremely tough mental episode, so I did my best to step away from these stressors to focus on myself and my academics. After not speaking for around a year, they both reached out to me to make amends. I usually am not the one to hold grudges, so I talked to both of them on the phone and tried to mend what was left of our friendship. After these conversations, I felt better and was hopeful that I could get over my negative feelings towards them.

Recently, a week after we spoke, I saw both of them for the first time in a year. This immediately made me uncomfortable because I was very open to seeing them individually first and easing myself in, but was thrown into a dynamic that caused all of this in the first place. This was around a month ago, and since then, I haven’t spoken to them. However, today, one of them has reached out seemingly friendly, but it feels forced to me for some reason. What used to come so naturally is now extremely difficult for me to swallow.

At this point, I’m not sure how to feel. I’m very much not the type of person to hold any emotional grudge, but i can’t seem to get over the past to a point that it’s affecting how I see my future with people who used to be like family to me. I valued the relationship I had with the both of them, but it has yet to feel like they valued their relationship with me. Mentally, i want to be able to grow past this and rekindle a friendship with both of them, but I don’t feel like I am able to look past the past.

Even with many bad details omitted, this drama still feels silly to me. Am I letting myself get in between a relationship for selfish reasons? Or is it valid for me to feel uncomfortable with them because of the repeating patterns of bad friendship? Any input is valuable to me and I’d love to hear your take. Thanks!!!",26Jun2019,1
849,"We’ve been dating for months and I really fought to help her stay out of her depression. No matter the cost, whether no sleep, or failing mental health, I have my heart to help hers keep beating. 

I’ve recently became depressed about different things in my life and some terrible thoughts came to mind. What if she doesn’t love me, but instead she loves all I’ve done for her. What if she never had feelings for me, she just didn’t want to lose her sense of happiness and her safety net to fall back on. This is the first girl I’ve connected to and actually mean it when I say “I love you.” 

Her personality is just so strong, all she needed was someone to show here that she can be happy on her own. I’m worried that since she knows she can be independent, she might leave. I’m happy and sad that if she leaves, sure she will be independent, but I’ll miss her.

851,"Now I know that r/relationship_advice is better for this kinda stuff, but long story short I met this girl back in March online and when I say met I mean we had talked before but in a group of peoplez but we've practically veen talking every day since the 15th March, I've said I like her and we have shared feelings (tbh mainly me) and I don't usualy share feelings, being a Guy is part of it ( dont wanna seem weak all that stuff) and also most of the time people don't realy notice me, so I dont bother trying to be noticed.

But recently (almost 2 weeks) we have been sending messages and stuff, but actual talking or playing games we haven't done. I mean its prolly me overreacting and stuff but for some reason its realy getting to me. So for some quick context we live pretty far away both about to start Uni all that Jazz, so I get why she dosen't think a relationship would be good. But the thing thats annoying me is when we dont talk much I start overthinking stuff like ""mabye she just wants to go"" or ""I want to tell her how I feel but idk how to word it"". And this for some reason is making me hella upset, Whenever im not working or watching something I start thinking about it I feel as if for once I let myself feel but now I dont know how to control them.

I think the worst part about it is how me upsetting myslef by overthinking makes me more annoyed at myself for not trusting her, which I do but for some stupid reason I think vut what if.

Now I don't know what kinda help/ advice you can offer about this (if any) but I dont wanna give up, it might pain me to keep feeling this way, but I just dont want this chance, bo matter how small it might be, to slip away.",26Jun2019,1

853,"I don't know what I'm doing, I've never reached out for help before but the stress is too much. I'd appreciate any advice..

Some background. I am a 19y/o whose parents separated when I was a child(my mother cheated). My dad has been mainly taking care of my since. After my grandfather died, we (my dad, me, and 2 brothers) moved in with my grandmother(dad's mom).

We lived there for a year and then my aunt also moved in after getting knocked up and her boyfriend ending up in jail(meth charges). She had a gorgeous little girl that faces the same problem I face all the time. Shes now 5.

--------------------------

So let me tell you about my dysfunctional 7 member family living in one mobile home.

My dad has always shifted his responsibilities on to us. He rarely has the time to be there for us at home, he is always stressed out and just throws his problems by the way side until they become too big to handle. I'll admit he works a lot to keep us fed, but when he is home he is either too sick or too upset/smoking weed or cigarettes to give a damn about our personal problems, or to offer support.

My middle brother is on the verge of killing himself. He skipped school twenty or so times before we realized it, and not to party or hang out with friends, just to sit in the parking lot and avoid school I guess because of his anxiety. He does nothing now except sit in his room after not even attending his own graduation, and he's 17.

My youngest brother is an arrogant 15 year old that thinks hes on top of the world, admittedly he is the only one that I think that has a decent future and outlook. He has been in trouble with teachers and stuff, but mainly he just takes advantage of the chaos at home.

My grandmother is older, shes a sweet old woman who doesnt deserve all this chaos. She takes care of my aunts 5 year old daughter at the house. One thing she attributes too however is the amount of animals we have. We have 20ish dogs and 20ish cats that just ruin everything they touch. She and the rest of the family dont have the heart to get rid of most of them.

My lazy &amp; neglectful aunt. More on her below.

My sweet cousin. More on her below.

-----------------------------------

Now the biggest 4 problems that lead to all this bullshit:

My aunt, who has been caught with meth pipes in her room and rarely ever takes care of her 5 year old daughter.

My little cousin, who Ill call Sarah, doesnt have anything to do all day and they just let her destroy the house and neglect her. Luckily my grandmother tries her best.

The number of animals in my house is absolutely crazy. We have a combined income of like 40000-50000(everyone working) and all this plus the amount we spend on these animals is nonsense. Plus were always replacing stuff since they destroy stuff and pee and poop all over the house.

And my dad who doesnt do much to solve any of this, except yell at me, his oldest, to solve it for him. 

The biggest thing is my poor middle brother, who I'm afraid is so close to taking his own life.

I dont know what to do reddit... I took a long walk today and I'm just sitting here on this park bench... any advice helps...

tl;dr: my family is a mess due to neglect.

Let me know if I need to clarify anything.",26Jun2019,4
854,"I landed in a thing has led me to have sort of cyber-sex with a woman 10 years older than me (im under 18) and i can't stop. Im wondering how do you tell the person you cant do this. They're kind of guilting me into talking with them and this whole thing is making me feel like shit.

855,So I have been in a relationship for the past two years. Before that relationship I was good friends with this guy K. We actually sorta dated before my boyfriend and I now got together. Recently I’ve been wondering how K is doing and was wondering if it would be a bad idea or weird to request to follow him on Instagram to check on him.,26Jun2019,3
856,"Hi, i am currently running a  test on someone by not messaging them. I want to see if they care enough to message me first, even when not prompted. Is this a good assessment for that person judgment of me?",26Jun2019,3
857,"The first part of the question is, how do you meet people when you're looking to date. I work with 100% men who are 10-30 years older than me, not meeting any girls there. After work I go to the gym and there are some attractive people there, however I don't think that's the right place to look.

My other question is, when you do finally get a date, what do you do on that date as an introvert? I have been on a few dates before and I found them all very awkward and uncomfortable because I'm not good at talking, and it exhausts me to pretend to be an extrovert for so long. I feel like for this reason I haven't had much success.",26Jun2019,3
858,"I recently had my first panic attack and had to take time off work.  With a lot of opening up to both loved ones and a professional, I feel I’ve lightened the load enough to fight back the most severe physical symptoms of anxiety.  However, I still dread any quiet time.  When I’m in bed, on the couch and even in the back of my mind playing video games, that’s when I’m harshest on myself.  I’m either telling myself I suck or that I can be better.  Obviously positive reinforcement is the healthier option, but either way I feel like I’m dwelling on my problems.  Today I got a massage and it was the best I’ve felt since this whole thing started.  At first I was concerned that the quietness of the massage would trap me in my own thoughts, but for the first time I was able to completely empty my brain and just focus on the pressure.  Obviously I can’t get massages 24/7, so how do I carry that focus on the moment into the dreaded quiet place?",26Jun2019,4
859,"Okay so based on the title, yes I am a hot mess right now. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I’ve dealt with anxiety for years, along with bouts of depression. The anxiety was treated once upon a time, the depression never. Yes I’m aware I need to get to a psychiatrist but the wait time to get in is quite long. 

About ten months ago I started my current job. At first I was happy and enjoyed it. But honestly, the job doesn’t challenge me much at all, the people I work with are fake as hell and still act like they’re in high school (they’re all in their mid 20s), and people just sit around and talk shit about other employees. To the point of being downright mean some days. 

To add to it, I’m stuck in my hometown with family full of drama who constantly drag me into their problems and try to get me to deal with their problems for them. 

To top it all off, I ended a nearly five year relationship earlier this year and have really struggled with the breakup. Some days I’m okay, others I’m not doing well at all.

I need a vacation, badly. But unfortunately I don’t have much vacation time accrued yet and I need a couple days off for plans I currently have later this summer. I barely have any free time outside of work and what little I have is usually dominated by said family. 


I feel like I’m stuck going through the motions and I just don’t know how to handle it anymore. I wake up most days just wanting to call out of work. I feel like I shouldn’t be burnt out already but I am. Any advice on the best way to handle this without a lengthy vacation would be much appreciated. I apologize for the book and if you made it this far, thank you.",26Jun2019,4
860,"The past few relationships I've been in have not been the best (or long-lasting), which I regret quite a bit.
That being said, I ask for advice on something I hope will help (among other things that will change based on if I can keep up):

How can I get into working out?

I've tried in the past, but I stop within the day for no reason. I think it will help me with making myself look more presentable physically and maybe help me gain some sense of pursuit of my goals, but if not any tips on improving a life would be welcome.
I apologize if it intrudes on your day, which, if it does, please go on and enjoy your day.",26Jun2019,1
862,"I need advice on how to deal with a coworker.

A bit of background: I'm working a summer student position for a provincial government and we are required to do a lot of overnight trips (up to 6 days at a time) away from phone service areas. We work in 4-6 person crews with 1 student supervisor and 2 regular supervisors. 

Problem: I have a coworker named Scott. Scott is a high functioning autistic and has major issues with communication/social cues/anger management and that's just the tip of the iceberg. For the last month, we've had lots of issues with him just straight up being a dick (for lack of a better word) but we've been patient with him and have not complained, sort of brushing him off and moving on with our lives. During our first overnight trip, he became physically violent with us over 5 times in 3 days. 

When I went to my boss about this, he said that this was not enough to warrant termination, suspension, or even separation from the team to work on different projects. I was also told to be careful of what I say to him when he is violent with me because there's a bigger chance of *me* being fired for discrimination than there is of him being even slightly reprimanded for being abusive towards the crew.

We have several overnight trips left over the summer and I have no idea what to do. Any advice is welcome. I love my job and don't want to be afraid to go to work.",26Jun2019,1

I also get really nervous and when the time comes am scared to work with clients. Is it really possible to achieve working there if I am shy and really quiet.

870,"Hello everyone, I weight around 265 with a height of 5 foot 8. My BMI indicates that I am very obese and my doctor always tells me I am as well. I am going off to college soon and I feel that my weight interferes with life.

I have tried countless diets, starving, exercising, but nothing seems to work. I exercise almost every day but yet nothing happens. I do consider myself to be internally fit as I can climb mountains, run, climb monuments, and lift heavy things. 

I have recently been depressed because I feel like I have failed my body. I keep getting told by my doctor that I am at risk for death if I do not lose weight. Is my doctor just trying to scare me? I will continue to work at my weight hard and as I enter college, I will probably be much more active. I just would appreciate some advice in life.",26Jun2019,1
871,"This guy I’m seeing only tells me his feelings when he is drunk. I was taken aback because at times he ignores me when I go to his house to hangout and he will be on his phone and is super secretive about his electronics. Last week he literally couldn’t get off his phone and hanging was weird with him and he didn’t get off his phone even though I was like hey this is the last time you’ll see me for a few weeks. I feel this message is fake so I don’t want to accept the appreciation. Plus when I have been positive in responding to these texts before I simply get a smile emoji and I feel like an idiot. He isn’t always on his phone but like thirty percent of the time he is. 
He also texts me daily and asks about my day but doesn’t seem super interested. Just says yay or that’s great. I also met his family twice already. 

He texted me this last night randomly. He sounds drunk and is never this nice unless drunk. 

“I fuckin like the shit outta you. You are hot af and satisfy me in every way. Also we get along so well i love your sense of humor and we mesh so well. Hanging out with you is so much fun even with no sexy involved. You are awesome on tooo many levels”
Also 
“I have been with other peeps in past but I have never been with someone that makes me feel like you do. Emotionally and physically I turn into mindless zombie for your pussy. 
I feel comfortable being open with you.” 


It’s nice but feels fake and forced. I literally just told him I enjoy spending time with him cause I was so taken aback.

I went out of town with him a few weeks ago to visit his family and the night after we got back in town he said “you are absolutely amazing” when drunk.",26Jun2019,0
