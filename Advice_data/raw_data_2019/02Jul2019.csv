0,"If I come off as sucidal, then don’t think that, because I’m not.

I’ve never done something like this but I’ll just go ahead and write what comes out of my head.

Since I was like 12-13 I’ve been questioning myself, who I am, what my purpose is in life, what the future stores etc.  I’m a very reflective person who literally thinks about thousands of thinks every second, every day. 

The reason I’m writing this is because I’ve never expressed myself before (on this kind of level) 

As mentioned in the title, I fucking hate my life. Yes, I wish my mom never met my dad.

Shit. I was born shortly after when my mom met my pops in the Caribbeans. They got me, but the problem was that they lived in two different countries. So yes, I grew up without a father and I had to become a man on my own. 

Ahh let’s look at some points that makes me hate life. 

I grew up as a second generation immigrant in a shithole city. Grew up with a single mother. But I always got food on the table so that was fine enough.

I’ve never had any friends. Even til this day people don’t like me. They never approach me or anything. They either look at me in disgust or fear. I don’t really care tho since it’s been a routine my whole life. I’m a calm, reserved patient and reserved person so no, I don’t start anything or nothing.  Since I’ve been so alone it just motivated me to become better. I’m not  overexaturating. My drive is literally based on a controlled kind of anger if you could say it like that. I’ve promised myself that even tho life sucks, there’s still some things I need to discover and experience.

I have to elder brothers/half brothers.  

I live in their shadows. I hate myself for not doing my mom proud. She doesn’t force me, but I know she’ll be angry if I don’t accomplish something like them. My oldest brother is one of my role models. He’s and all rounded man. He’s stands at the top of a company, he’s good looking (I am too), He has a lot of money, loyal wife, two adorable boys, everybody respects and likes him etc. My other bro lives in his shadow too, but he got the same quality as him, except the wife, kids and high rank. 

The thought of not nearing them is stressful. 

I’ll never get/don’t want a girlfriend/wife.

I have seen thousands of girl but no one appeals me. I’ll make this one short. Basically girls nowadays aren’t loyal, they look to boyish, act boyish, they are gold diggers etc.

When I reflect on life, it just bothers me. Nothing makes sense of all. 

I usually reflect best on three terms. 1: In a warm long shower while listening to music. 2: Smoking a cigarette in the rain (without wind) with music. 3: When I lay in bed or drive. 

The only things that relieves my hate is music, cigarettes and sleep. I barely sleep because if insomnia so I look forward to getting some sleep since It’ll allows me to think and reflect 100% with no distractions - it’s also a big escape for the everyday life. 

Ive problaby mentioned this before regarding some feats, but I would describe me self as a calm, reserved, reflecting, quiet guy etc. Besides that, I’m an angry person too but I’ll can control it. It’s more of a drive that keeps me going and a form of hate towards life. 

But, right now while I’m writing, I’m listening to a song called “The girl I haven’t met - Kudasai” while I’m smoking my Marlboro cigarrettes and looking at the sky (while writing this) 

There’s so much more. But my days are to repetitive too. It’s just wake up, cigarette, drive, cigarette, school, cigarette breaks, work, cigarette on they way home and then there’s nothing more but repeating the scenario.

I feel fucked up, tired, Bored, unmotivated and motivated at the same time, feel no emotions besides anger etc. all the time.

I don’t trust nobody since most people either are selfish, disloyal, annoying, don’t know them selves etc. people will leave you soon or later - that’s why I only want to live for myself.

Mane.... I don’t want to kill myself because that would kinda be useless. I still want to experience life even if it means walking through it alone (ironically)   

So... at the same time I want to live, but at the other side I don’t want to.",02Jul2019,1
1,"Let me preface this saying that I'm a 17 year old boy, which may or may not be important, I don't know. This is also gonna be long.

Since I was twelve, I've had bad depression. I've used and maxed out multiple medications and while they helped a bit, they all wear off eventually. In the past few months, it's gotten worse.

In January of this year, I gave up on school. My grades slipped and I fell behind. I had no motivation to do anything, and it got worse and worse to the point where I faked illness to stay home. I started junior year with hopes of Ivy league, and I finished with the idea that I'll resort to community college, which I obviously don't want. I've done nothing but play video games and I can hardly get up to shower. My parents aren't worried, they just think I'm getting lazy (love them a lot but they can be bad at picking up signs and I'm scared to tell them everything).

At school, I have a lot of friends. I'm the funny guy, and people like that. But nobody wants to be close to the funny guy. The only person I ever trusted I messed up my relationship with (next paragraph). I don't have anyone to talk to and I'm losing it.

Before I say the next part, let me tell you that I get attached to people. A lot. I fall in love easily, and I am made up of pure empathy. So, when my best friend told me she had a crush on me two weeks ago, I was ecstatic. I had had a crush on her for a while, and it was reciprocated. We fell hard for each other, and spent almost every day together. I know it was only a couple weeks, but I felt closer to her than I had to anyone.

Today, she broke up with me. It wasn't for any bad reason, but she was crying as she did it and that made the already bad feeling I had even worse. I know I'm gonna get over her soon, but what then?

Completely seriously, I'm not completely suicidal, but sometimes shit gets too much. It seems like an easy way out, and I like the appeal of it. I know people say ""oh, it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem,"" but that's not the point. The point is that life is full of problems, and I'm only 17, so I know I'm definitely gonna have some worse days, so why not quit before it gets there? At this point the only reason I don't kill myself is because I know my family would be sad, and my damn empathy is overpowering my will to not live.

Thanks for reading. All advice is appreciated.

One last note: please don't tell me to find something to invest myself in, like a hobby or a job. Sometimes I don't even have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning.",02Jul2019,1
2,"So i had this friend since middle school, we were best friends. Fast forward to us being 19.

I found out that he was stealing from me. For a long time. I told my friends, and of course, they show him all the screenshots.

I didn't know, so i got drunk and blacked out and he took my phone. Find out that pyscho looked through my phone (photos,messages, apps, everything including my nudes and stuff) and is using all this to blackmail me and spread around the town, literally ruining my image.

I spoke to his recent ex and she says that he raped 2 females. He also stole her debit card. He's convincing everyone that I'm doing (according to his ex) EXACTLY what he is doing. Along with 'proof' which are just personal stuff i have taken out of context. His ex also said that he used to come into my house when everyone is asleep or away depending on if there are no cars in my driveway, and steal almost all my, brothers and parents belongings and sell them.

So what do i do? He also claimed to her that he wants to slit my throat and to much more people than just me, but me mostly. He's also a really strong dude. :( Advice?",02Jul2019,1

5,"I can't shake the feeling of being on the outside looking in. Like when Scrooge looks in the window at his past but is helpless. But for me it's not a memory but the lives of others. Like I'm just a background character in other people's lives. 

I dont think I'm suicidal because I WANT to be involved but every time I try I realize that none of that can be for me and I'm alien again. I'm just here as a placeholder.

I'm 26 now and I realize that most opportunities when you're young have passed me my. I dont have happy memories to look back on and I don't think I'll ever be able to break past that window. I threw my teens in the trash and have done that with most of my 20s. I frequently surf the internet to escape but when I try to engage in life there's nothing there. I'm not interested in video games or movies anymore. I've never been in a real relationship and people around me are getting married. My life experiences are virtually nonexistent. I went to college and somehow graduated but was a pariah. Similarly held no life in high school. I focus on working and getting money in Hope's that somehow I'll get a better live through perseverance but that hope is running out.

8,"Hey everybody,

Over the years, my mom has made very poor financial decisions. They cost her the house, her cars, and her relationship with me and my siblings. Four years ago, she got fired for delinquency and truancy (possibly stemming from undiagnosed depression, more on that later). This comes after my older sister invested thousands of dollars to make our broken house presentable to buyers. When it sold, we moved to a smaller place, sold the cars, and tried to move on with our lives. Before all that and even after FOUR YEARS, my mom has done zilch to improve the situation. She stays in her room all day, reading or watching TV. She doesn't cook or clean. She doesn't shower. She never leaves the house. She refuses to spend time with me or my sister. And day by day, the money in her bank account draws closer to 0. She has no back up plan, she hasn't been applying to jobs. She's not old enough to retire yet, either. We've tried to broach the subject with understanding or tough love, and every time, she stays silent and cries. We figured she's incredibly depressed, but when we tried to make appointments for a doctor's visit, she refuses, saying she doesn't need it or that she's fine. 

We don't want to abandon her, but at the same time, this has been going on for a looooong while and it's getting to feel real exhausting. I guess what I'm asking is how do you help a person who seemingly doesn't want to be saved?",02Jul2019,1
9,"Long time reddit peeper, first time poster... Sooo not sure where this should be and or where it'll end up... Ill try to tl'dr... Bullet points for the win! (34m btw)

\- ex left a few years ago (to be with someone that hurt her cheating all the time before, got married then divorced and looked her up when I was on the road for work) with a mortgage on a house that she said yes to that I am re-doing and made all of the payments of which

\- gave me hsv2 prior (thought we were gonna marry so didn't care)

\- left IT to work with her fam on the road being a rough neck because it would better us making more money and she was on her 3rd try at a 'degree of what she wanted to do' (yeah yeah yeah red flags... hind sight smfh)

\- live back in the same small area with a lot of gossip around town about hsv2 (because she burned my name when she visited because of said fact) so I withdrew from possible relationships because of said fact

\- had already started drinking too much working on the road to self medicate being alone and going through a 5 year relationship break up and more so but got more so when I left

\- left the road because I was 'outta the fam' so to speak because work was becoming less and less

\- went back into IT and am local in the same area again and can't leave without a better resume until I get more experience in diff areas

\- Continued to drink ignoring every thing

\- Now caught in a weird limbo of drinking at least 14 a night during the week and up to way more on the days off

\- Do not want to hurt anyone that doesn't have hsv even tho most everyone has it and and def do not wanna have the convo with anyone

\- Not sure if anyone can get the gist of my ramblings and being too many deep already just asking for advise

\- What would you do next genuinely taking into consideration of each bullet point? 

\- All I do now is lift as I have for the past 12 years and try to get back into that more again instead of drinking so much? As well as get more motivation to finish my house?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* yeah ik it's prob not in the best context that I have tried to convey, yes tried dating sites(too far away from everyone), did I have slight insecurities? prob, like most everyone but felt slightly better when I was messaged back 'Im sorry I was such a shitty person' a few years later when I needed mortgage info to get rid of her name from the deed

\*\*\* honestly dont care and hope the best for them because it's whatever and I have been trying to do me, would meet more local peeps but all of my buddies are married with kids and lead a pretty simple life's or very religious so no wing man options

10,"How do you manage and deal with your emotions mentally?

I (22/m) feel like I have been suppressing mine for so long now that I don’t even know how to express them anymore, it’s almost like I’m slowly going numb to expressing them with other people. I really struggle to empathize with somebody else, yet I care and think about them. I struggle with expressing them with friends and family. I am not depressed and I’m relatively happy! I have a great life and I love what I do, but this is just a personal issue I’m trying to get past.

it really confuses me and I know that in order to move on in life, I need to be able to manage myself emotionally.

I don’t know how to process them, it feels like some how, eventually, the issues fade away and life continues on but they are holding me back personally",02Jul2019,2

12,"I fucked up a few years ago.  Got half way to a degree in computer science (ugh... probably more like 1/3 the way there), but anxiety made it so that I had to withdraw from courses.  Funds returned, acknowledged medical basis, etc; I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder that I've been treating with therapy.

Basically, I'm going back this year to get... some sort of education.  The only problem is that I am not interested almost anything.  I don't have hobbies; things excite me for a week or two, but then I lose interest entirely.  I was good at programming, but it's boring and I can't stand the idea of just sitting at a desk beating my head against a wall until I figure out how to code something for 50 years.  It was going to be my career, but I haven't so much as glanced at a programming textbook in years because I just don't care about programming.

I'm in my late 20s.  I feel like I am mentally ready to go back and I'm sure that I will be able to (eventually) achieve a bach degree, but starting fresh is 4+ years (accounting for fuckups).  Programming would be the quicker and smoothest option, but nothing about it interests me.  I'm a very logical thinker, and it suits me very well; but good GOD not a single thing about it is exciting.  I feel stuck.

15,"I hooked up with a guy from my former work place about 6 months ago after a party. We went back to his place and spent a large part of the night having sex. It was pretty incredible. 

I texted him the next day (bad move) and got short replies and basically the impression that this could never happen again. 

More context, we both had SOs at the time. 

He got engaged to his SO (a few months ago). I sent him a congratulatory message and we texted for a bit. 

Fast forward to now and he messaged me late in the night to “grab a drink” and we met up at my place and hooked up. We spent another two hours talking smack about our workplace and just having a conversation. (Strange, right?)

He established that they are getting married next year and I confirmed I am happy with my SO and then my next thought (out loud) was - what the hell is wrong with us then? He said he didn’t know...

The sex is amazing and honestly, I didn’t think I’d have a second go at it so I am happy with that. 

But I want to understand what the fuck do I do now? Like is this going to be a casual thing we do once in a while? 

Can I booty call him one night when I’m horny or not? Why did we spend equal time chatting and laughing as we did having sex if it’s only physical?

17,"Some background, we are in our teens and were long distance during our one year relationship. I'm a male, she's a female.

Our relationship ended because ultimately we were both unhappy. She realised it before I did and broke things off, which I didn't take very well. We ended on rocky terms and we've been no contact for an entire year now.

I have grown up and have worked on a lot of my issues and now I am missing her a lot. We had super strong chemistry when we were friends and during the relationship. I considered her a best friend as well as a girlfriend.

A week ago she tried to get in contact again but changed her mind. A mutual friend asked her what she wanted and my ex supposedly claimed it was personal and couldn't say.

So I'm asking if I should attempt this or not? We had a brilliant friendship and we have had a year to heal from it all, from my point of view the worst thing I can get is a simple no and even then, at least I am getting some closure.

If I am to attempt a friendship with her again, what should I tell her? How should I ask her this in the best way possible? Cheers",02Jul2019,1

Another one of my close friends ended up being my roommate during my freshman year of college, we'll call him Joe.

Joe and I decided not to room together sophomore year, we were still friends but the living arrangement wasn't ideal. Joe and Bob ended up rooming together our sophomore year, and by the end of sophomore year they despised each other. Just imagine two massive egos clashing, fighting about dishes, fighting about having people over, etc.

I still consider myself good friends with both of them individually. I hang out with both of them on a regular basis. I can't hang out with them together, but I've made it work. However, this is where the ""uncomfortable situations"" come in. Both Bob and Joe (Joe especially) will take every opportunity to bash and insult each other when I'm with them. Joe is always saying horrible things about Bob and vice versa. They are also both the type of people who will never admit they are wrong (again, Joe especially), so it's hard for me to say ""hey, that's really not cool"" and such.

20,"This is a repost. My dumb ass deleted the original 🤦🏻‍♀️

SO I live with my divorced mother in America.
I haven't seen my father for 7-8 years and last time he called was 4 years ago - not his fault, will explain why.

To give you some context : 
My mother is Korean, my father is Algerian.
My parents moved to France in like, 1997 I think?

My father got involved in some bad stuff. The police started listening to my mother's conversations on her phone. They began spying her and my father. She told me they were some kind of wannabe terrorists ( not SERIOUS stuff like I don't think they killed anyone or tried to drop a bomb or something )

The cops broke the door and went to her place, they thought she helped him with illegal stuff ( she never told me what exactly ) and she was traumatized.

My father went to prison for a few months then got banned from France. He went back to Algeria. My mother kept switching between Algeria and France. Her mother, siblings ect lived in France too btw.

According to my mother, she was working her ass off to get money only to give it to my father for his.. illegal stuff I think. She sent him money in Algeria even after he got banned.

Then my mom got pregnant. She gave birth and we kept switching between those two countries until we stayed in Algeria.

I can't remember much but I think he was nice to me. He would go to the amusement park with me and I recall having fun.

I also remember that one time in the kitchen when he grabbed my mother by her hair and dragged her with him while she was sitting on a chair. He then locked me up so I wouldn't see what he would do to her.
Sometimes he would come back home angry and do stuff to my mother in another room. I assume he beat her up.

I don't remember my father beating me up so I assume it didn't happen often.
From what I remember he was nice. I have some good memories with him.

Fast forward to when I'm like 5. My mother takes me with her and moves to France definitely. My father and her divorce. According to my mom I was really happy.

My father didn't pay anything. The thing you pay for your kid when you're a divorced parent idk the name. According to my mother at least.

He called me every 3-4 months, once again according to my mother. I do remember being nervous as hell when he called.
Once she told me to ask for his credit card so I could get money. Cant remember his answer. Dont know if mom ever got money.

She blocked him. She said he called her during work or very late and it annoyed her. She never asked for my opinion even though he only called to talk to me.

One thing I know is that he's LOADED. Like really REALLY rich. His father was super loaded and my dad got half of the money. I remember living in a huge house too.
Now I live with my mother in a rat hole. We're always tight on money too.

It's really shallow of me to say that but part of me wants to talk to him for all the money. I would inherit all his money. If he had other kids I'm fucked tho. But I'm tired of living like this and my father is literally rich.

BUT I mainly want to talk to him cause he's my father and it's been YEARS. My mother told me bad stuff about him, like he cheated and denied it, his mother called her a witch and he didn't say anything ect.
She even implied my mother cheated cause I only look like my mother despite being mixed and according to my mother he didn't deny it or defend her.

My mother has a huge bias against him tho. I dont blame her!!! But she isnt unbiased. She tried to get money from him by using me too.

Everything I know is according to her. What if she lied to me. What if she exaggerated stuff. What if she's right and I want to talk to a terrible guy.
At the same time, this is the past.
My mother beat me up A LOT too but that's another story. Yet I dont hate her at all. Why would I hold a grudge against him when she did the same thing to me.

I dont fully trust my own mother and dont remember that much of him to judge clearly.
I just want to talk to him again, a phone call or smt. But I'm afraid of this being awkward. He's also a conservative guy.. if that makes sense. Hes kinda close minded. I go out, have male friends, I dont wear hijab. He would probably be against it. Then again I havent talked to him in 4 years. Its not like he can say shit.

If we do somehow get along .. I gotta go back to Algeria a bit to see him. Cause he cant go to US. He's registered as someone who tried terrorist stuff or something. That's what my mother told me.
He's loaded so he can pay a ticket for me right. My mother told me she would never spend anything if I want to see him.

I'm also afraid of him not caring for me anymore. What if he has other children now. What if he completely forgot me. I'm scared of getting hurt too.
My mother says she doesnt care but I know damn well she would be mad and disappointed if I talked to him again. I have no idea what to do.

BASICALLY : my father did A LOT of shit but was relatively nice to me. We havent talked in 4 years and last time I saw him, I was 5. My mother hates him and would be disappointed in me. He lives in another continent and can't visit me. 
what do I do? Should I talk to him again? Despite all the stuff he did?

I mean people change right.

For the past 4 years she has hired me to take care of it while she’s gone. She has told me before that I’m one of the only people she trusts to take care of it (she has no family in the area). It’s time consuming work and she’s very neurotic about how things must be done. I’m probably one of the only people who knows exactly how she wants it and who will spend the necessary time on it. The problem is, she underpays me every year. Last summer I put in about 35 hours and she paid me $85. It wasn’t much better the other years.

I really don’t wanna do it. It’s time consuming and I have a job and don’t need the money. The only thing is, I feel really bad declining as she doesn’t trust many people with her garden. Also, I’m not sure if she has anyone else to do this for her. She’s old and doesn’t have many friends or much family left. It might break her heart if I say no. I’m just doing a lot this summer and this would be even more tiring, plus it sucks to be underpaid. Would I be a terrible person if I didn’t accept this year? She just asked me today.

24,"My husband is the manager of a large emergency room in a large city (approximately 1 million in population) where I've lived my whole life and he's lived for more than half of his life. We've been married for 13 years and have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 4. I've been a stay at home mom for 9 years and don't contribute to the income. We don't struggle for money but don't have extra for things like preschool, vacations, long term savings, etc.. 

We have a large family support here (my parents and 4 siblings, plus his mom and aunt all live here). We have attended the same church for 6 years and have support there as well. We've never used a babysitter bc we can usually find someone who can help out. 

My husband constantly has head hunters calling to offer him jobs around the country and he always says no thanks, but this one is only 1.5 states away (5 hours) and is a very lucrative offer. It is in a tiny city that is 3 square miles in size with a population of less than 4 thousand. The cost of living is much lower and he'd be making at least 20-30% more than he does now, plus they'd cover moving expenses and potentially pay off his school loans. We would be away from family but able to afford babysitters, plus we could finally put away some money for the future. 
A five hour drive would allow us to visit home frequently. 

We're both really torn. He is their top candidate and they are skipping the phone interview to fly him there to spend a whole day interviewing with everyone in the hospital.

25,"So I accepted the friend request from this girl because we had lots of things in common. It's been three years and we've spoken sometimes but we've never been too close until recently we started talking a couple of times at week. And she's started acting clingy which is annoying me. She reacts and comments literally everything I share, including inside jokes of series she hasn't watched. Even if it's just to comment ""wtf"" she'll do it, jeez, if she hasn't watched that serie of course she'll think ""wtf""! She brags about an apparently crush I don't know, she's started opening about personal stuff she shouldn't share with me, she even talks about her sexual dreams wich is cringe as fuck. I told her I was going out to do something fun yesterday and she started sending me ""omg be careful that seems dangerous"" texts. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm writting this is because she just got cringier today. I tagged a friend on a stupid meme that said ""When he explains you the end of Evangelion with his D"" and she responded like if I tagged her. She commented ""omg I'd never do that"", then ""mostly because I don't have a D and I haven't watched Evangelion lol"". I facepalmed hard but then she commented ""don't make me say something lewd or I'll regret it lol"". I cringed so hard it made my nipples retract and I deleted the comment before my friend saw it.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I deleted the comment I took a screenshot and sent it through her DM asking ""Are you drunk? Wtf lol?"" to which she made up some stupid excuse and we both dropped it. She hasn't talked to me since then and she hasn't reacted to tags or publications she doesn't understand. Maybe she took the hint and I'm okay with it but I honestly don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm seeing so many red flags I just want to block her cold turkey but I'm afraid that'd hurt her feelings. She'll want to know why someone she considers one of her best friends suddenly cut contact with her, and I personally don't want to overreact for something so stupid. I just wish things were like they used to be before we were closer. How to set boundaries with her? Thank you!**",02Jul2019,2
27," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",02Jul2019,0
28,"Just started a job. I like it so far but the person that works close to me has a very negative outlook on the profession and the office itself. I have found this outlook influencing my mood and own motivation despite myself.

29,"My husband is the manager of a large emergency room in a large city (approximately 1 million in population) where I've lived my whole life and he's lived for more than half of his life. We've been married for 13 years and have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 4. I've been a stay at home mom for 9 years and don't contribute to the income. We don't struggle for money but don't have extra for things like preschool, vacations, long term savings, etc.. 

We have a large family support here (my parents and 4 siblings, plus his mom and aunt all live here). We have attended the same church for 6 years and have support there as well. We've never used a babysitter bc we can usually find someone who can help out. 

My husband constantly has head hunters calling to offer him jobs around the country and he always says no thanks, but this one is only 1.5 states away (5 hours) and is a very lucrative offer. It is in a tiny city that is 3 square miles in size with a population of less than 4 thousand. The cost of living is much lower and he'd be making at least 20-30% more than he does now, plus they'd cover moving expenses and potentially pay off his school loans. We would be away from family but able to afford babysitters, plus we could finally put away some money for the future. 
A five hour drive would allow us to visit home frequently.

30,"M15 | I need a good way to respond to her. I’ll call her “C” to try and clear any confusion. Here’s the story:

Me and C have been talking in person and on Snapchat for 6 months now. Early on, I was told by her friends that she liked me, so I’d text her, flirting with her. They had a school dance and I was able to convince C to go, and we danced together. I told her on Snapchat it was a lot of fun and I had a good time. After I sent that, C responded asking if I liked her, and I said yes. C then went on to say that she didn’t feel the same way towards me but that doesn’t mean we couldn’t be friends. C said how she was going through some stuff and wasn’t really looking for a relationship or anything else like that. I asked a different friend of hers about if C liked me and she said that C never did. I still continued to talk to C until the start of last month. I received some bad advice from a friend  who told me to ghost C, to see how she’d react. I was desperate for a change cause I still really like C. I realized last night how stupid doing that really is. To stop being her friend just because she wouldn’t hook up with me, it’s just stupid. So this morning I wanted to apologize to C and let her know I was sorry, so I did.

What I sent her:

Hey *******.
Sorry have I’ve been recently. Seriously, how I’ve been acting towards you lately is wrong and just really, really stupid. I can see that now, and I truly am sorry about it.
With that said, I’ll understand if you don’t want to be friends with me anymore. If that’s how you feel, then I’ll be fine with that, I won’t bug you about it anymore. But still, I really hope that you can still somehow be friends with me again.


What she sent me back:

I haven’t really noticed but that doesn’t mean I don’t wanna be your friend anymore. Sorry for making you feel that way but its not your fault 

It’s funny and sad how she didn’t notice, but I just want to find a way to let her know that none of it is her fault. I can tell that she’s confused on what I’m even talking about, but I’m afraid to tell her everything. I just want to make the right decision. I love her but if she doesn’t like me back then I’m willing to stay as a friend, because she is a great one. I just don’t know how to respond to her.",02Jul2019,1
31,"Earlier this morning, I learned of the death of my friend from high school. I immediately wanted to let those who I love in my life know that I care for them and appreciate them. I (25/F) texted my friend (26/F) about the death, and proceeded by telling her that life is short and I just want her to know I love and appreciate her friendship. I didn’t hear anything back all day, (sent text at 6 am, hadn’t heard anything by 7:30 pm) but I didn’t mind because I know people have lives. But then I was scrolling Facebook and her post came up about how she’s so happy she has her big coffee mug today, or some trivial ass shit. I felt super dissed and rejected that she’d had the time to craft some ridiculous, petty social media post about her coffee meanwhile she can’t even answer to a friend whose in mourning. 

I told her how I felt, albeit in a slightly bitchy way  (I said the cherry on top to learning of my friend’s passing is that understanding even my alive friend can’t even be there for me) and she told me that she saw my message and she’s been going through a lot herself. She said that she didn’t ignore me, that she just didn’t respond. And that friendships go a lot deeper than just social media and texting. She verbatim told me I was the one whose hurtful. I caved and I told her I’ve never had a friendship as shallow as this one and she told me to not message her. It actually felt like a breath of fresh air. I don’t deserve such a POS for a friend that can’t even look at themselves. What the fuck? Am I an asshole?? I mean... I can understand being busy, but not even having the decency to send an acknowledging/genuine/warm reply is disgusting.

In case you’re wondering, this person has a track record of being selfish (cheating on boyfriend and not telling him, stealing things). I have been wanting to find new friends for a while but I don’t particularly like cutting people out and try to see the best in everyone. But this cut me deep.

TL;DR! I learned that my friend from high school died of a drug overdose, then communicated this to my current “best” friend and told them I love and appreciate them, didn’t receive any response but they posted on Facebook about how thankful they are for their coffee mug, then they twist it onto me and can’t understand why I am upset.",02Jul2019,1

I have tried for a while to become close to them or relate to them but I just can’t anymore, and just find myself not enjoying myself when I am around these certain few people in my friend group. Which sets me up for today, I am sick of hanging out with these people, but want to maintain my friendship still with the rest of my friends, I have honestly been thinking about just totally abandoning everyone in the group and finding new friends.

33," 

Hi there friends, I'd really appreciate some solid advice for this topic because it's been plaguing me for so long, and I'm slowly unraveling. This is going to be a VERY LONG post (for context), so please bear with me. I apologize in advance for how long this is. And this isn't meant to be a pity party, I just really need to get all of this off my chest and hear some outside opinions. I appreciate you. Thank you so much!

My ex (M24) and I (F22) were dating long distance for 2 years and 8 months before I broke up with him in December 2018. He lives in Winnipeg, MB, Canada and I live in MN USA. So even though we were long distance, it was only a 7 hour drive one way to see each other. That being said, we saw each other every month for a weekend at a time because we both work and I was still going to school. We were making it work, and everything was really good. Like, really good. He was my first for everything; boyfriend, kiss, sexual partner, and the first man to show me my worth and love every part of me. We were so much in love with each other, and everyone around us saw it. We were a good looking couple together, and everyone commented on that as well. We were perfect opposites and yet we seemingly worked so well. He's a Cancer and I'm a Capricorn (sorry if you don't believe in astrology), And those two signs together are perfect. People refer to them as the Mother and Father of the zodiac. He filled in where I lacked. I'm a natural pessimist and he's a happy-go-lucky optimist. I'm a realist and he's an idealist.I'm super anxious at times, and he is so not. He would even attract people to come talk to him.Random strangers would ask him questions about himself, for directions (even though he was a Canadian in America), and not once has someone ever come up to me when I wasn't with him. I digress. He would go out of his way to do things for me.He would pick me up a grinder (a hot sandwich) from the Red Pepper every time he would drive through Fargo.He would take care of my car, like get my oil changed, change my headlights, he changed my brakes himself, and he even bought me an expensive sound system for it as well. He found my apartment after my parents kicked me out of my house, he moved me in, and stayed a week with me because he didn't want me to be by myself. And to top it all off; I had an ovarian cystectomy (laparoscopically through my abdomen to remove cysts from my ovary) in March of 2018 and he went with me on surgery day to have the procedure done, and he proceeded to stay with me for a week after to take care of my healing body. He had to literally drag my ass out of bed many times a day, whenever I needed to get up and pee or stretch my legs. For a whole week. If that's not love, I don’t know what is… and I never once doubted that he loved me.

But he wasn't perfect, and nor did I expect him to be. There were some things that weren't quite sitting with me and at the time I genuinely didn’t know what was wrong. But I did know that there was a shift after I moved into my own place in Feb 2018 and after my surgery in March 2018. I had come to realize that I was maturing so much more than he was, and so much faster too. I had to learn how to be an adult very suddenly, and it aged me. So moving, surgery, still going to school, having to earn enough money to survive, and having my long distance boyfriend were becoming a lot for me. So I was feeling like we could relate less to each other because I had significantly more responsibilities than he did and there was less spontaneity in our relationship. I felt I was falling out of love with him, and that terrified me because we were supposed to be soul mates. And he gave me a promise ring only one year in, and he said he wanted to marry me; make me his wife. And I loved him so much that I was okay with that.

Over the last eight months of our relationship, I was getting more and more frustrated and impatient with him. I wanted to close the gap between us and move into our own place together, which would mean one person would have to move to the others' country and start a new life there. Well … he didn't want to be the one to move to America because apparently he (in his own words) ""wasn't mature enough“. And mind you, he wasn’t the most mature to begin with, but we were closer in maturity when we met 3ish years ago. So it was put on me to move there. And I rationalized his decision too; I thought it made more sense for me to move there anyway because I have less friends and family to miss. And it sounded fun; I could be with my SO, eat poutine, and get the bragging rights to say I've lived in another country. I came to terms with the fact that I would move, and all I needed to do was figure out how to get a visa, a job, and where we were living together. But he wasn't helping me. Which leads me to one of his major flaws; remember when I said he was a happy-go-lucky guy that was optimistic and an idealist?Yeah, all those characteristics also means he wants to have fun, because of this he never wanted to make any hard decisions. That always landed on me making all the hard, not fun, and boring decisions. Which, when moving to another country as a young 20 something and trying to do everything legally, easily, and as least stressful as possible BY MYSELF wasn't working! Yeah he did try sometimes but he always gave up because he ""couldn't understand all the big words"". AND he didn't want to move out of his parents house (he owns part of the house with his parents) because then they'd have to find another place to live because they couldn't afford it without him. I won't even get into why I think that's so fucked. Don’t even get me started!

So all of that was weighing on me and I was mentally breaking. I felt so bad for all my coworkers, friends, and family for having to listen to me complain for 8 months about my dysfunctional relationship with my boyfriend. And you might be thinking, “So did you talk to him about all of this? What did he have to say?” Well, I’ll gladly tell you! I finally got the guts to tell him that I was unhappy and that I felt like I was falling out of love with him. I was prepared for the worst, honestly. But nothing happened. He listened and I knew he understood what I was saying, but he didn't do a damn thing about it. He didn't want to fix the issues I brought up because (in his own words again) “I don't know what to do”. Oh interesting… So you think I know what to do? As someone who has only dated one person ever, do you really think I knew what to do either? He’s had two relationships before, and he learned nothing from them? So needless to say, we carried on as if I hadn't even said anything about it to him. But it obviously was still bothering me. And I brought it up again. Not once, not twice, but FOUR separate times. FOUR! And still, nothing… You could probably see why I was getting so frustrated. And I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt, I truly knew he loved me, and I knew he didn’t know what to do. But man, actions speak louder than words! He didn’t put effort in, he didn’t want to see the big picture of where our actions would take us.

And I won’t sit here and claim to be perfect and holier-than-thou, because I know I’m not and I know I did a lot of wrong in our relationship too. I was/am very impatient by nature (thanks dad), I expect way too much from literally everyone in my life (including myself) and I'm the kind of person to want to get stuff done immediately. I hate sitting on work that could be done. I have anger issues (again, thank you dad) and I always took it out on him when I would have a bad day, and he definitely didn’t deserve to be treated like that. I know I was a shitty girlfriend sometimes, but I always tried my hardest to be better for him; I did want to be with him forever, of course I wanted to be better. But really, I fucking tried for him. I fucking tried so hard to make it work. I talked to him about how I was feeling and he swept it under the rug. I waited for at least a year to try and move to Canada for him. I wanted so badly to finally start a life with him, because he was my sunshine, my life preserver, my fucking everything. But I had to break up with him, because I felt like I was settling for someone who didn’t take me seriously and someone who enabled me to be a recluse and never pushed me to be better. I felt like I could have so much better. I felt like he wasn’t taking our love seriously and I need someone to take the love I give seriously. I was a ride or die for him, but it felt like he wasn’t for me.

Now let me get to the breakup and the events that followed. I broke up with him early December (Happy birthday to me), and it wasn't a premeditated, rehearsed affair. We needed to talk about what we were doing for Christmas and my birthday, and I fucking snapped. I had had it. My brain was so over not being a primary focus to him, but my heart was breaking.I didn't want it to end between us.But I wasn't being valued as I felt like I deserved, so I chose the lesser of two evils. During the breakup, (which was over video call, by the way) he didn’t cry. He didn’t say much of anything. He just kind of.. took it. He didn’t fight, he didn’t beg, he didn’t try.I told him I felt so underappreciated, and so misunderstood and that I needed to be alone for a while and that maybe we should date other people.I can't say for sure that I actually said that, because frankly, I was breaking my own heart into pieces and I don’t remember. But he also took that as well. So… that was that I guess. That was also the last time we ever spoke to each other...

And now, ladies and gentlemen and my non-binary friends: the \~best\~ part. My ex started dating his ex (the one before me) only a month after getting broken up with. Let me repeat. My ex boyfriend (who I almost married) got together with the woman who fucking broke his heart before he and I got together only 1 FUCKING MONTH after I broke up with him. How does someone get over a 2.5 year relationship in less than a month?! I understand the concept of a rebound relationship, BUT THEY’RE STILL TOGETHER. 7 MONTHS LATER. And I’m over here, sad and alone. I tried to get some kind of closure by sending him a letter around valentines day (shortly after learning of his shockingly new girlfriend) basically apologizing for all the wrong doings I had done, thanking him ferociously for all of the wonderful things he had done for me, and telling him that I regret what I did and I would like to give us another chance,only if he wanted to. Aaannnnd….I got nothing back.So either the international mailing system failed me, or I got hardcore rejected by someone I thought still had a little respect for me.And these next words may be controversial, but I think it is so disrespectful to go into a rebound relationship that soon after a committed relationship ends. Disrespectful to him, to me, and to his now girlfriend for not processing these emotions. And I know him really well, and I know he will fall in love with her, if he hasn't already. My mother even said herself, he’s the kind of guy who goes for the easiest thing. That's kind of the only thing that's keeping me going, knowing that I'm still worth something even after being metaphorically left in the dust.

So after reading all of that word vomit (thank you, by the way), here are my questions: Why do I still feel caught up on him 8 months later? Should I feel regretful of breaking up with him? Was I truly too impatient with the relationship, should I have let it go for longer? Did I dodge a bullet by getting out of this relationship? Should I even bother worrying over a man who went into a rebound relationship with his ex less than a month after the breakup? Is this karma for my hubris? Am I crazy? Do I deserve to be alone?Is he just looking for the easiest path? Gljskdentowsiengflsd??? How do I get past this? How do I be happy again? 

TL;DR : I sometimes regret breaking up with my ex even after 8 months of being separated and my mental health has been taking a beating, so I’m venting to the internet and looking for help. I loved him so much but i was between a rock and a hard place and I thought I made the right decision. But he seems happier without me and I’m depressed as shit and alone. I feel like I lowkey should off myself (KIDDING) because I feel like I made the biggest mistake of my life . I’m working myself to the bone to survive and also to distract myself from being single. He was my everything and now I feel like I wasn’t as important to him as he said I was. Tell me your thoughts, but please for the love of Jesus himself, do not lecture me. I have done that a thousand times over to myself.

Again, thank you to anyone who read my story. Even if you don't have advice, please just let me know I’m not alone in feeling like this. And please don't be worried about my safety, I wouldn't do anything to permanently harm myself. Have a great day, friends.",02Jul2019,1

36,"I am 22, almost 23 and my mom is a severe helicopter parent. She tries to be involved in my life as much as possible, and it is really restricting. I still have to ask for permission to go out with friends, and if alcohol is involved and I need to stay over a friends house, all hell breaks loose and my mom accuses me of doing drugs or acting suspiciously to get out of the house. To make matter even more complicated, I am gay and have a boyfriend of 7 months that all of my friends know about, except for my family. So it is incredibly hard to see him a lot, when previously when I was in college we used to see each other 5-6 days a week. So not only am I adjusting to seeing my friends less, but also my boyfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my mom has gotten even worse, threatening to ""disown"" me for going out on the weekends and not spending time with the family, even though my older brother and sister have moved out, and my parents literally do nothing on the weekends anyways. My boyfriend has said multiple times if I need a place to stay, I am welcome to come live with him and help pay rent, but I don't want to run away to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know what to do anymore, do I take up my boyfriends offer and move in with him? He lives much closer to where all of my college friends live, and I am friends with his friends as well. My worries though are that moving in together at 7 months would negatively impact our relationship, and that my mom would be pissed at me for moving out and not ""staying home and saving money""... I feel like I am in a lose lose situations and feel lost, has anyone else gone through something similar with controlling parents or adjusting to life after college? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; Controlling mother won't let me go out, feeling trapped and depressed at home as result, boyfriend offered to let me move in with him but am worried it is too soon (together for 7 months so far) and could negatively impact our relationship.

37,"I love my friend so, so much. He’s one of the only people I’ve ever had an online friendship with and he’s a great person to talk to. He’s also sucidal, and i’ve had to talk him out of it 4 times in a row a few weeks ago. He’s also severely depressed and I think I might be his only friend in the world. And now he’s selling homemade drinks, and keeps getting beat up by kids in his area, and he won’t go to the hospital for it. His parents don’t like him either. He has no one to go to except me and I don’t know if i can handle it. 

He’s gone to a suicide center and I think thst just made him distrust it becuase the psychiatrist just said to think happy thoughts and call the suicide hotline. So now he won’t go anymore. i’m trying to get him to a teen shelter but i’m afraid they’ll just send him straight back home, and then it’ll just be worse. plus i don’t think he’ll go anyways. 

He won’t get any more online friends to help him out, even though I’ve asked if he could just to take pressure off me. He has no desire to change or pull himself out of the hole he’s in and I still want to talk to him but I don’t want to stay awake all night and be tense all day thinking for him. It feels like I can’t relax. 

I don’t even mind that he drinks and shit like that, I just know that it’s going to drag him deeper down and I don’t want any more trauma like that. 

I’ve had advice to just cut him off but as I said I’m his only friend. I would also feel bad doing it and i don’t even know how to do it but I’m starting to think that’s the only way I can stay afloat. What do I do? I’m so confused and stressed and scared and sad.",02Jul2019,1

41,"I haven't had success with posting on other subreddits, so I figured I'd try here.  I have tried so many different products, and I just feel unsatisfied with everything. I have tried brands including Garnier, Herbal Essence, Pantene, Loreal Paris, John Frieda, Mane &amp; Tail, and Suave. Right now I use Oribe, which is really nice, but it is very expensive. I am hoping to find a cheaper shampoo and conditioner that I can wear more frequently and save my nice shampoo for once a week or so.

I have very fine hair that tangles very easily. I don't really know how to describe my hair, but the ends get very dry while the scalp gets very greasy. It's kind of a weird combination to work with. It feels like my hair is constantly flat and gummy-feeling. My hair is color-treated (I just have some highlights that I get touched up at a salon). My hair doesn't seem like it's extremely damaged, it just feels like it has this stickiness to it that I can't ever wash out, completely. I don't wash my hair everyday (probably every other day, since I don't want to overwash it). I find that some shampoos seem very harsh on my hair, but sulfate free shampoos leave my hair feeling greasy and slimy.

44,"I know the title of this is a bit iffy in the wording but I’ll explain. 

So last night I had a dream. I had met a girl in this dream and lets just say that things got intimate between us pretty quick. I have many factors about this dream that could lead to it actually happening but I want some more advice on it. First, here are some more details. 

Firstly, the dream was completely in a first-person perspective (meaning I saw it through my eyes and not an outside source or camera of some sorts). This may not seem like an important detail, but every time I’ve dreamed about something happening and then it actually happens, it was in the first-person. 

Second, my mannerisms and personality traits in the dream were exactly perfect to how I act and am in real life. Normally in completely fictional dreams, I come off as an exaggerated version of myself. In this dream, I said things I would say in real life, I moved normally, I talked normally, etc. 

Lastly, this girl’s face wasn’t blurry, it wasn’t a combination of a celebrity or girl I already know, and it wasn’t a person I had seen before. She was someone I had never met or seen before and for a split second after I woke up, I could actually recall some facial features.

Anyway, I hope someone can give me some further advice or insight as to if this dream could actually happen to me. I really wanna know because I have a huge gut feeling that it will happen but I could be wrong.",02Jul2019,1

46,"Basically my wife and I had thought of a name we liked for our new son (wife is still pregnant) and I happened to mention it to my brother without thinking about it. He told me that he and his wife had been thinking of naming a future child that name also even though they weren’t planning on having kids any time soon. 

That conversation ended with me saying “oh wow, what a coincidence!” 

A couple of hours later I get a really long text from him asking me to please not name my son that name because he and his wife had already been thinking about that name for a long time. I didn’t know what to say and still didn’t really think he was being serious so I said “if me naming my future son that name will cause serious drama between us then I guess we can keep thinking of names.” He quickly replied and said “thanks for understanding.” But I thought it was pretty messed up that he felt like he could call dibs on a baby name like that. 

So now it has been a couple of months and we are wanting to name our son the original name we had thought of but I’m nervous about how to bring it up to him.

Just a bit of background: Hi. I'm going to middle school. I have an older brother that I barely know. He doesnt talk to me often, we never have talked much, despite us having lots in common. I have two parents. My moms a libra, dad's a virgo. They often quarrel alot. Whenever I dont clean my room, they both complain and make me clean it up.1 I also live with my grandparents and aunt. As much as I love them, I cant just avoid this forever. 

My problem: For some reason, my aunt and grandma in our family mistreat my grandpa. They make him walk around in circles outside, he can't do something without being watched. Hes kind of sexist, and according to my grandma, he was always pampered and is basically like a little kid. They hit him, yell at him constantly, freak out when he doesn't follow what they say, etc. They do this in front of me. That's right, in front of me. Because of all of this, I dont really talk to my grandpa. I'm cold towards him, and when we do talk its short and I keep it that way. I don't know if what's going on is right or wrong. I dont wanna say anything because I'm scared. Before I used to think he might have a mental disorder or something, he does unusual things such as drinking water from the sink without a glass, clean the bathroom with toilet water, and grab excessive amounts of napkins and blow his nose even though he doesnt need to sneeze. My aunt and grandma also visit the doctor often with him. The thing is that this is never discussed. We sit with them at dinner and yell at him, and no one, not even my dad, mom, or brother do anything! Now I'm fucking confused. I know this is alot to ask, but this has been on my mind since I moved to the us at 5 yrs old.

I (19F) have recently broke up with my now ex (17m) . we met in a Reddit through one of those break up community and we instantly clicked but we both were bascially worst time to even think about getting into another relationship. But it happened and shit went bad and here we are. 

We still talk everyday and honestly I feel pressured to be there. The reason I broke up with him was because I felt pressured to prove my love to him. I felt pressured to love him as much as he loved me. I felt pressured to be with him. All by him. And I realized I still was stuck on my ex and with therapy i learned i had to cut that shit off. So I ended it but he clung to me tightly and the more he didnt want me to leave the more I felt pressured. I care for him but I cant give him what he wants. 

There was about a good week or so where we didn't speak and it felt so good for me not to talk to anyone. I haven't been alone in 3 years and I feared being alone so I clung and jumped guy to guy after my long term boyfriend dumped me. But finally I felt free. 

Now talking to my ex I feel pressured again. He wants to come see me and live in my state and all that stuff and honestly if i am going to be completely honest. I don't want him to come. Because i don't want to be with him. Im happy just being like this. Alone not having to give myself to someone. Everytime i try to tell him he gets so heart broken and begins to say things like he won't live with out me. He'll for sure just end it. That I never loved him and used him. 

I feel so fucking trapped. Im finally happy being alone. I don't want to be tied to someone right now. Im not ready mentally or emotionally. What the fuck do I do.

I feel like my teacher isn't that great, he doesn't really help us as much as he should, and just has a teaching style in general that isn't a good fit for how I learn. It's important to know that I am a lesbian, and there is so much homophobia and sexism in the class, not just by the students, but sometimes even the teacher (I wasn't out before the school year ended, but I am now, which could make it worse). I was doing quite bad towards the end of my junior year, and the class is only supposed to get harder. Not to mention I'm not too sure I want to go into networking at this point.

However, I am afraid of my mom's reaction, when I told her all of this (minus me going into communications in the future), she seemed pretty disappointed. When I told her I was doing Cisco she was very excited, so I guess disappointment makes sense.

61,"I'm a 19 year old living in South Carolina, USA. I work as a college camp counselor and just recently had two reports filed against me on the accounts that I sold alcohol and marijuana to residents. This led to the police coming to my room and interrogating me one night. Ultimately, these reports came out to be false (determined by the police). However, that night was the night a friend from a different city came over and wanted to go out to party. I did not drink much that night (around 3 beers), however my breath still smelled of alcohol. When I came back to my room, I saw two police officers right outside my room and they began to interrogate me about the two reports filed against me. They said they could smell the alcohol in my breath so there was no way of me lying about where I have been. They interrogated me and found nothing in my room and I was charged with nothing however my supervisors were alerted of me going out that night and drinking. Now, I have a meeting with someone from the Office of Community and Ethical Standards and they ultimately will decide on whether or not I get fired from this camp counselor job. If I were to get fired, I would have wasted $2k on summer classes since I would have to leave campus because of a party that I attended off campus. Another issue that arises is my position as an RA for next fall. If the Office of Community and Ethical Standards meeting determines that I should get fired, I very likely will lose my job as an RA next semester. All the inexpensive housing has been taken up so the only places left to live are incredibly expensive and I likely would not be able to live there which would lead me to likely taking a gap year or transferring to a completely different school just because of an off-campus party.

So I'm a 19 year old male, and I need some advice. I (for the last six-twelve months) have been dealing with an increasingly stronger feeling of wanderlust/desire to leave everything behind and set out on my own. Its not that I don't love my hometown or family... its just that I feel unhappy with staying here forever, I want to go experience new things. I tried moving away for my first year of college with hopes that would fix it, and while college wasn't bad, I couldn't stand the city. So I'm now back home and going to go to the college/university there. I thought that moving home to go to school would help me get rid of that feeling of dissatisfaction and wanting to adventure. (I live an adventurous lifestyle; camping, four-wheeling, fishing, hunting, trapping, and hiking/lake days are a common thing for me) As back home I have a ton of options of adventurous things to do. However, I still feel as if there's something more for me out there and that I just need to go find it. I've tried to come up with a way of explaining this to my parents, but I don't know how. I know my mom would just tell me that I need to start going to church, and I don't know what my stance is on that. I have an extremely personal belief on what religion is about, and it doesn't line up with hers. My dad is more supportive on what I feel, but I don't know if he fully understands. I feel trapped, as I've been told that it would kill my mom if I left (by her). To top it off I'm treated like the lynch-pin of the family. Constantly having to sacrifice what I want to do because my mom freaks out if I don't jump when told to. My dad and I have tried bringing this up to her but she just starts claiming that we're ganging up on her. I want to just disappear one day and cut off contact with the family, (I have two older sisters), because honestly I feel as if I'm treated like a tool, and that I don't necessarily want to go to college rn. ( I really support trade schools) I'm lost at what to do and I need advice.

I had a pretty rough deal with this girl from a while back. For a simple (but not really its still kinda long) and slightly pathetic story.

TLDR; She slept with a close friend I was planning on moving in with, then started dating that friend after I broke it off. They broke up and week later we ended up with some pathetic ""Cuddle-buddy"" situation. I was an idiot who couldn't keep his mouth shut and realized I still kind of resented her. Now she's got me ghosted after I considered no longer speaking with her.

Earlier I was scrolling through my phone and found a screenshot of her saying ""Aw I'd love to"" when I first asked her out. My friend noticed that it visibly affected me and suggested I delete it. I did.

Then I realized I have a treasure trove of these things, all randomly placed throughout my gallery (I got a new phone and that moved everything around).

I guess in part it feels like some bizarre self-esteem booster. But I also realize that maybe she barely meant any of it. Which would be opposite of good vibes... Plus, maybe if I delete everything and erase her from memory then I'll be back at square one. Like I never learned anything. Like hiding your screw ups instead of looking at them.

I don't know, maybe its kind of holding on to the past, but what the hell does that even mean anyway? I can't forget that this happened. Hell, I bet the same people would probably say ""Accept the past!"". Then there's a fringe group that would say ""They're the same thing!"".

I have nothing that I’m extremely passionate about, and I’m pretty much apathetic to everything else. I’d say the main paths are Sciences, Arts, Engineering, and Business.

I don’t think I actually naturally excel at things like math, even though I have 100% in the class, I think I just have a good work ethic.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I went over to another man's house. I work with him and he was really nice. I thought it would be ok for a date. My parents drove me over to his house and took a second to meet him and his doggie. Everything seemed fine and my parents left. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went into his room and everything started getting hot. He was taking off my clothes and stuff, eventually, we had sex. I probably should mention that I told him over text that I wanted to wait and start slow, but I didn't stop us. I did have to remind him to put on a condom, which we discussed that when we are ready he will wear one. First, he got it out to put it on, I thought he had put it on, I wasn't watching to see and he put it in me. He didn't, but before he came he took it out, put on the condom, continued and finished. I wasn't too happy about that.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after that, he was a little pushy. I didn't want anymore and kept saying that I didn't want anymore. He still was kissing me and grabbing at me and stuff, stuck his penis in me a few times and each time I would tell him no and he would pull it out then a few minutes later put it back in. He did this about 4 times.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, he could tell I was scared. He kept trying to reassure me and say that he is a big teddy bear and I shouldn't be scared of him. He just kept telling me how not scary he was but he still grabbed at me and kissed me a lot. I would push him away and he would stop but then he'd do it again. When I had a second I texted my dad to pick me up, which is like a 30-minute drive.

&amp;#x200B;

It's all too much and too fast. This was our first date. I'm never doing this again. I'm really scared. Am I being reasonable or no?",02Jul2019,1
80,"About a year ago, my ex (21F) and I (21M) split up. It was her choice, and she kind of blind sided me.

I still think about her daily, and she is still a common thought in my mind. We were together for 5 years so it was alot of my growth in life with her.

Since the split, ive made new friends, gotten into new hobbies, and focused alot on my own growth. Hell, I even had another relationship (that did not last). But throughout it all, I always feel as if I want to know what she is up to. 

I know very little about what she has been up to, besides I know she hasnt seen or dated anyone else. I broke a barrier of trust, dignity, and respect once after the split when I logged into her Instagram and Facebook. It was a full insanity moment and since then I have fairly consistently seeing a therapist.

I dont know what I can do to get her off my mind I guess and actually move past. I don't have any animosity towards her or anything.

During high school I developed I guess a type of eating disorder, my body wouldn’t keep down food even if I wanted it, and he helped me through a lot of it. I went off to college and he stayed for two years we had a long distance relationship and were fine. I moved back due to my grandmothers death because I knew I couldn’t do it alone. We decided to move in together. When we moved in together I started to sense a distance between the two of us. We were just starting to be two very different people but he was still my support system. One day he decided that we needed to be apart so we could grow. I agreed but it was still hard because I had made him my reason to live. Which I know is super unhealthy but it happens. Fast forward a month I run into an old fling and we start going out. We start dating but I am not really enjoying it. He is older than me and is very immature and doesn’t seem to have plans to change the way he is doing things. I put a lot of energy in the relationship, more than I should and yet I get nothing in return. I feel more like a caregiver than an equal. I tried to break up with him but he spent 4 hours at my house trying to convince me otherwise and I took it back. I recently spent a day with my best friend. I realized I don’t just have platonic feelings for him. We are both touch starved people and can just spend a day entwined together doing nothing and be fine. I felt very guilty once he left because I had a thought what if we dated. It couldn’t happen cause 1) we did, I hurt him and 2) I don’t think that’s what I need right now. 

I need advice on how I should go about sorting my emotional feelings for everybody because I have so much love to give that I don’t really deal with the fact that I still love every single one of them. And how to go about releasing these feelings. And how to be single and still receive love from others. 

TL;DR: Have been in long relationship, got dumped. Jumped straight into another relation where I feel more like a caregiver. Tried to breakup but they spent close to 5 hours trying to convince me not to so I took it back. May still be in love with my best friend. How do I sort my feelings?

86,"I moved across the country after college, wanted to live somewhere new and explore. It was hard to meet friends outside of a classroom so when I finally met a couple people I was so happy. After a little bit I realized they weren’t as nice as I wanted to believe. I met my boyfriend through them, he wasn’t super close with them and told me at the beginning he only really hung out with them because his close friends just moved away for jobs. I really wanted to like two of the girls in the group. My boyfriend is really chill, he doesn’t like having a problem with people. I really love that about him. If someone was being petty and mean to him, it would upset me because I care about him. I should preface that these two girls have boyfriends that barely pay attention to them. It started with small comments that I was fat, or my nose is big. (I’m 5’6” and 122 pounds btw). I’m not clueless, and girls can be kinda obvious when they’re intimated by another girl. I tried to see past it, I really did. But sometimes girls are shitty and they don’t feel good unless they can control/hurt another person. Anyways, my boyfriend is kinda clueless to petty girl drama (again I love this about him). And there have been times he’s seen me far from my best and there are times I should shut up that I don’t. I’m working on myself everyday and am far from perfect. But because he doesn’t like to believe people can be mean for stupid reasons (something I am familiar with, being that I’m a girl who doesn’t live under a rock and have been around girls in school since kindergarten). Anyways, they’re calculated and manipulative and they hate that he and I have a good relationship. They have tried to pull him away from me, there’s been a lot of specific situations that I won’t bore you with. But I’ve tried staying the facts of these situations he hasn’t seen himself, letting him interpret it as he sees fit, and it’s not enough for him. They hit him up all flirty, he’s said himself they’re trying to turn him against me. I get why he didn’t what to say anything to them at the beginning, but at a certain point enough is enough and it really sucks he won’t have my back and tell them to grow up. Most recently, he went to the bars w his sister because she’s moving away, and I happily stayed at home with my dogs because bars aren’t my scene. He was supposed to Uber to my apartment after, but left me three long voicemails drunk and sleepy and crashed on his couch. I was just happy he was home safe. I went over in the morning like he asked, his phone died so I plugged it in. I went to get it off the charger for him and out of curiosity looked at his phone and saw that he hit up these two girls and went back out after being home and partied with them. He lied to my face, he played up the story that he was home all night at 11:30 when I got his voicemails. This was 3 days ago. He says he’s seen them being petty but he still can’t “decide whose side to take”. All I am asking is that he have my back and not feed into their games. I’ve tried asking them if they want to grab dinner and talk things through and that was months ago and they weren’t open to it. I’d rather talk about things straight in and move on, they hate confrontation and would rather talk about you behind your back. It hurts me so much that he has to think about it as taking sides and shit. Girls are not black and white. They’re fucking sneaky and deceitful.

2. He almost ran over my foot. He thought I’d gotten in the car when I’d only just put my purse in and he started to drive off, the car door knocking me onto the sidewalk

3. He tries to show me photos of his cats on his phone while driving. Veers off into neighboring lanes, almost goes into cars, meridians and light poles etc... 

4. Tried drinking a milkshake and driving at the same time and almost hit someone in the next lane

5. Often doesn’t see cars coming when merging into traffic and it’s almost caused us several accidents

102,"hi reddit friends - sorry for the crappy format - long time lurker, first time poster so i’m on mobile.

i am in desperate need of advice and as soon as possible (i need to make this decision by friday).  It may seem kind of silly, but let me explain. 

(sorry for the length) 

So I (20F) live with my boyfriend (21 M) and his family, which consists of his 2 younger siblings (18,15) and his parents. its a small - half house, but we make do &amp; its quite cozy. Dear boyfriend and I have been together for roughly a year and living together for 8 or so months. We all get along perfectly, they are like my actual family to me, i am an only child and don’t really have a strong relationship with my parents or any extended family. 

Dear boyfriend and i plan on getting engaged within the upcoming year, he will be graduating college with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and basically has been guaranteed a job as soon as he graduates. he currently has two internships now and makes really awesome money for just being an intern ($22 an hour/40hrs a week) I still have two years of college left but work two jobs, so i also bring in a good amount of money, we pay for everything ourselves and are both pretty financially responsible for our age. The only reason we haven’t moved out yet is due to the cost of living is SO high where we live. 

so now to my point. 

Dear boyfriends family has two doggo’s currently, they have always fostered dogs and this specific breed. they love them very much. i have always LOVED animals, especially dogs. We currently just started fostering a new doggo - he is the best dog i have ever encountered, i love him with all my heart -he is so sweet cuddly &amp; just the goodest boy. We all have been on the fence about adopting him because he gets along with the other dogs really well and loves all of us to death, but especially boyfriend and i. I am so attached to him, its honestly a little ridiculous. 

last night someone had put in an application to adopt
mikey. my heart broke. i instantly began to cry, a lot. i don’t want him to leave our big family, he has gotten so comfortable here, and truly loves it. he is also deaf, so heavilly relies on other dogs and people. I see this situation the same as foster children - its not good to bounce them around from house to house &amp; this poor little guy has already been to two other homes. its never good to do this any animal/human. 

Dear boyfriend’s mom has given dear boyfriend and i an ultimatum - they aren’t poor but they aren’t well off, unfortunately one of their vehicles as just broken down and they don’t have the money to adopt the sweet doggo. so, she has given us the option to buy him and be responsible for him but we have to make a decision by Friday. 

I dont know what to do, neither does dear boyfriend. we both desperately want to keep him, we both love him dearly, but this is a huge decision on us and i don’t know what decision to make. I know his family really wants to keep him also, his fee is only $450 - but i just don’t know if we should let him go, like a good foster family does, with fear that we are putting him in danger or we keep him and love him endlessly but then we are responsible for all his costs and when we move out. 

please, please, any advice on what you would do in my situation would be great. 

thank you for reading, i’ll update once a decision is made.",02Jul2019,1

105,"I love my dad and I’m greatful for everything he does for my mom and I, but I am very conflicted. 

For awhile I’ve had the suspicion my dad has been unfaithful to my mom ever since this woman began working for him. He owns a small business, small as in it is just him and the woman working. The first big thing that tipped it off was finding some text messages months ago. He had left me his phone to fix some sound issues with his messages and I happened upon his texts with the woman. They consisted of calling each other pet names, lovey dovey messages and gifs, saying “I love you”. This upset me, though I didn’t want my dad to know I saw so I tried to act like I was fine (didn’t work).  He finally assumed I had saw and assured me it wasn’t what I thought. 

The woman was his friend, she is one of those people that tells people she loves them, she’s emotional and invested. I believed him, sort of, because I know the woman as well and she is like that, but it was still very odd to me. Very. Should a married man be texting another woman “you are my red headed angel?”. 

Now recently I’ve become even more suspicious due to my dad spending more time with the woman outside of work. At dinner one night, I happened to glance over and see him texting. I wasn’t trying to read what he was saying but I saw “I love you my honey bun”, he was texting the woman. This fired up my suspicions, anxiety, everthing. Maybe I shouldn’t have done what I did next, but I got his phone when it was left inside and looked through his messages. I needed some sort of validation that I wasn’t paranoid. The texts were an argument (he had deleted them prior and it was on a new phone. So no old texts). The woman was mad that they never got to spend time together outside of work, upset and she didn’t want to see my dad that day. Then today I got his phone again, he deleted all his texts. I searched Facebook, found more lovey messages, I love  you, pictures like “___ loved is red head”, life posts about how you don’t have to stay in a situation where you’re unhappy, them calling each other sexy, telling each other they can’t wait to see one another. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid to tell my mom and her be hurt, afraid my dad will leave. My mom can’t support herself. If he doesn’t leave, the woman literally lives beside us..my dad set it all up and she will soon have a perminant place right beside our house. I could yell out the window to her, that close. I’m too afraid to confront my dad, I feel like he will deny it. Assure me they are friends. If any one has any advice, please share it.

I fely alive and that was the best thing i have had ever done in my life.

She's asked him to stop but continues bc he sees it as friendly and doesn't think that's it's serious. how should I bring it up to him to stop, while not being too hostile as to not make the rest of the friend group uncomfortable by it?",02Jul2019,1
110,"I just bought a phone last week, well it's been over a week, From my local phone store. 

It seems that my number was recycled. 
I keep getting calls everyday from
Prison/Jail which is located near my hometown. 
I cant help but think that this person is desperate to speak to whoever had this phone, and there's probably a reason he cant get ahold of that person. 

I just want to let him know that this is a dead end for him in whatever attempts he has been trying to make. 
For me, alot has happened this week. For him nothing has happened and Im sure he'd appreciate knowing. 

Idk, do I care too much? 
Probably. 
Should i pay the 14 cent a minute call just to tell him? 
Idk, it's not much for me but he's not giving up until he knows. 
Its not about the inconvenience, because sure, hella calls from jail are inconvenient. 
I just care too much.

111,"I have a tenant whom I'm trying to evict as of today. I was foolish to move one of my best friends into a house I had for rent. It's lasted five months, and now things are going sour. I want her out. Of course, she's been threatening me with dumb shit just because she's mad I'm evicting her. But really, my question I have is this... 

Okay, so she has a history of trashing propertys before she moves out. At least that's what she did to her ex... The one she moved out of. She did donuts in his yard, stole any appliances and furniture that wasn't here, but also put a hole on his brand new shower...

That's my question!! If she does do anything to my house, or steal anything I have in that house.. which is a washer and dryer and a few desk and dressers... We left them there for tenants to use... But if she does... Is there any way I can get her into trouble if she vandalizes??",02Jul2019,1

For example my oldest brother moved out when he was 18, my sister when she was 19, my other sister when she was 18.

But for me it seems like she's trying to keep me here as long as she can and she baby's me too much, so of course i have no life experience in regards to independance.

116,"I am the absolute worst at confrontation. It makes me sweat, it makes me insanely uneasy and anxious. I especially hate when I have to handle it at work. I am extremely professional and it throws me off guard. I need to learn how to better handle that kind of stress at work, firstly. As in, a disgruntled client.

 I am in the veterinary industry, and dealing with different personalities is an all day thing. I genuinely enjoy it for the most part. However, we get some really weird situations. For example, today we had a non-existing client come in thirty minutes prior to close. They claimed their dog got attacked last night and he's badly injured. Indeed, the dog needed surgery because the wound was fairly deep, but it was not an emergency; it happened last night. I offered to give this person a referral list of nearby hospitals, as perhaps another clinic could help them today. The client never looked me in the eyes while I spoke, just looking around me and down. They didn't take the referral list, saying something that insinuated taking their dog out back in their backyard to shoot it (haha, not funny). They then said several times how unhelpful we were, etc. The client then got in their car, made a hand gesture that I didn't see (finger gun or flipped us the bird) and then just drove around our building, making their way back up to the front office and staring through the windows for a good two minutes just staring at us. The person was drunk, high, or mentally not all there and honestly the whole situation was weird and uncomfortable. I legitimately sat there helping another client and thought to myself, 'This is when I'm going to get shot and die.'

Mangers at my facility don't act on anything, and unfortunately these types of situations have happened before and will continue to do so, so how would you go about this? It's borderline on calling the police if they didn't leave when they did. I never got any training or help for these situations. What is the best way to handle it?",02Jul2019,1
117,I was riding my bike this morning as usual for my workout. I was checking the weather using my apple watch and out of nowhere a middle aged dad and his 3-4 year old son come out of nowhere.

118,"We are both male, I am asian-american, he is asian-asian, we are both ethnically chinese, he speaks it better than i do and conforms moreso to chinese culture.  We are very good friends and talk maybe a few times a week and have been doing so since at least 2014.  

Recently he was accepted into graduate school in southern california on an international student visa, in a high cost of living area.  because of his background as an international student, he is not able to get an apartment on his own and needed either a co-signer or a US-based sponsor who can guarantee the apartment in order to get the apartment.  I don't make NEARLY enough money to be a sponsor, so my friend asked me to co-sign the apartment with him.  The problem is that I do not live in southern california and I haven't set foot there in years.  I live on the East Coast.  This is clearly a problem because I am not going to sign a lease for an apartment that I don't live in.

I work in legal and have access to free legal advice, I consulted lawyers in real life and I lurked similar posts on reddit, and the common theme on the cosigning idea is simply DONT DO IT, not even with best friends.  In my own work and school experience I have never seen this arrangement work out.  Someone always gets shafted and stuck with a bill.  So I perhaps wisely refused to help out my friend.  It's not that I don't trust him, but I am not going to my my name down on a piece of paper that ties me to a property I dont reside in and otherwise have nothing to do with.  

not to mention, I don't trust the people at the leasing office, they know that he has the money, so they were pressuring and goading him into essentially taking on a phantom tenant so they could get that rental money.  This is downright illogical to me because apartment complexes typically run the other way, they RESIST requests from tenants to put on another absentee tenant because typically legal recourse is limited as applied to absentee tenant if absentee tenant is out of state.  This is not an arrangement ideal for landlords.  I figured they were desperate to sign him on but needed a work-around to get him signed up.  

I tried to explain to him that this sounded fishy and is an all around bad idea and that he would be better off trying to find another place to live, also told him that in my experience, that arrangement always ends up screwing someone and I don't want money to come between me and my friends, so it's better that he just drop it and find another place to live.  

Complicating factor: modern chinese culture is not about doing things ""by the book"" or doing things ""the right way"", there is always a workaround or someone to pay for the workaround.  me not helping him accomplish the workaround probably seems like a bigger deal to him than to me.  For one, I would NEVER put a friend in that tough position myself.  

Since then, I was pretty much given the silent treatment.  

Sorry for this long and rambly post.  Just to clarify - there are no trust issues between me and my friend.  Does it look like this friendship is over?  Is there anything I can do to get him to speak to me again ?",02Jul2019,1

I couldn’t pin point the feeling at all, but I knew they were about her. so, I get back from Florida and that night we’re talking. she asks me if I like anyone, and I tell her that I’m not sure. she asks why not,  and I told her that I can’t pin point the feeling and also that I’m sure the feeling wouldn’t be mutual. she said “ well you never knowww” and by this point it’s painfully obvious that it’s her I’m talking about. but I keep insisting that I don’t know what the feeling is. she keeps pushing and I just go for it, she shoots it down (obviously) so I just admit it was a mistake and she instinctively says it wasn’t, even after the next day. recently, I’ve just been getting left on read and she’s found another guy, I try to help her with anything regardless of how I feel, so I wish her well on that. but a couple days ago she shared on her snapchat story that a couple people are annoying the shit out of her, and also said for those people not to push conversations because she’ll just leave them on read. so I kinda had a feeling it was me. today, I ask her if it was me. she responded with another question. why? and I told her that I was just wondering and if it was me she could say, she then said that she’s not good at being straight forward. and now she’s not opening my texts. what’d I do wrong? do all my friends feel the same???",02Jul2019,8

I’ve been going out with her for almost a year now, and there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do to help her in any way I can. I’ve known for a while now about her anxiety and depression, but have been constantly told by her that “even if you were the most supportive person in the world, you wouldn’t be able to help me.”

It’s pretty heavy hitting, and I’m not too sure what I can do. Whenever she’s stressed with assignments coming up, I’ve extended my hand to do them for her and have done a few of them just so that she can relax and not have to stress or worry about those things. But I’ve been told that’s just enabling her bad habits. I want to do everything I possibly can to help, but it just seems so hard to help someone who refuses medical, or professional help.

What can I personally do as her partner to help her out? I’m basically the only person she talks to willingly, and she’s too afraid or lacking in energy to go out and do some things or talk to her friends. I’ve only just recently convinced her to agree to start thinking about getting therapeutic help or medicine to make life a bit easier for her.

142,"Hi,,, 

After a year of my previous relationship, which was a very toxic and abusive one—and lasted 4 years, I finally found peace with a girl, Y. 

Y is a very amazing girl, makes me laugh and makes me feel loved. 

Anywho, I have a terrible mindset when it comes to relationships (I blame myself for everything and think there’s problems when there are any, this behavior is due to my previous relationship where my ex blamed me for everything, and I was scared of her so I took the blame and apologized for everything that upset her) 

Y recently has been extremely busy: school and work, so that means we rarely talk throughout the day. I message her little reminders telling her that I hope everything is going well, good luck and that I miss her very much. 

Before this, we would have 5-8 hour long conversations, she would find ways to come to me and send me cute memes, and also tell me that she misses me so much. 

Last week, she told me she wants to be in my life. 

And the last thing she texted was a day ago, after I said “I’m sorry, but I miss you” which she replied with “it’s okay :))”


To the little texts I send her, she doesn’t reply to them, completely gone. This has been happening for 3-4 days now. She is on her phone because I can see that she is active on her Instagram, so which leads me t my conclusion. 

I’ve consulted friends, some have said to relax—that she is busy, while the other have said to not text her until she does. 

I feel like if I don’t text her, she’ll think I don’t care about her, but also if I don’t wanna look dumb if I text her when she’s probably giving me a signal that she doesn’t want to talk to me. 

Which I don’t know what the answer is. I asked her best friend and she didn’t know anything about her being upset at me or anything like that, so I might just be overthinking.

I just got accepted into a high School of the Arts for 10th grade to 12th. The application process is hard, but I did it by myself. My parents didn't help me except dive me to the interview. Me getting in was a huge disappointment for my parents. It's not that I'm going for something like musical theater, I'm going for culinary, and it's not because it's a bad school, it's test scores are nationally ranked, and it's also free to go, as long as you get in. It's just that it takes too much effort from them to get me there, it's a block away from my mom's work. I normally walk to school, but this place is a 30min driving. I don't know why they hate it.

I think I'm just going to end it. No one really cares. I have friends, but they would trade me in any day. I don't really have anything to live for. I applied to the school so my parents would be proud, the school is extremely competitive. And now I'm crying to the internet about how sad my life is.

Even some friends that I've seen as some of the most important people in the bettering of my mental health this year don't really seem to be that interested in my company.

147,"So I'm a bit overwhelmed with this situation and just need some advice on what I should do. I'm a 21 year old guy living with his girlfriend in a small one bedroom in northwest Washington. My dad lives on the other side of the country int the state I grew up in, went to jail, was found innocent, but lost almost everything during that period. That was about 4 years ago. After that he moved in with an older man who needed a caretaker and lived there for most of the last 4 years. He left a few months ago to live with a girlfriend in another state, it ended up not working, and he was kicked out with nowhere to go this morning. Now he will probably be coming to Washington to stay with me, but it will definitely be a struggle financially. My question is, what resources are out there to help him get on his feet and find his own place ASAP? I have no clue where to start here. He is in his mid 50s but still capable of working, aside from finding him a job and a car is there any resources to help him get back on his feet?

Everyone was given a few days off due to hours being cut and i was told to report for work tonight at 10pm. 

I arrived at work at 9:50pm ready to clock in only to find a manager i have never had interactions with before locking up. After speaking with her i was told the night manager called everyone to let them know that the night shift was to come in at 7-am except i never received a call. I checked my email, voicemail and text messages and found no missed notice. 

After talking to friends and family both sides are split with some saying to tell my boss i quit and others saying to show up, keep my head down and let them formally fire me. 

some things others have pointed out that i have considered and my views on them 

1. It was an oversight on managements part -maybe they got busy or thought they called me. Well thats crazy they had fours days to give me a heads up. I am expected to perform my job well which i do. So should they, having an employee drive 20 minutes to work at night only to find the doors locked and the shift has been changed is not a little mistake. And this is not the first time iv heard of this manager not calling their employees.

2. Maybe my phone is acting up - iv been receiving messages and calls just fine.even had three separate freinds leave voicemails and i got them all.

I wanted to ask for some advice in regards to college -- I'm currently a sophomore coming down to the wire on a decision of whether to transfer schools or stay at my current one. My current school is an insanely expensive but still well-regarded school for architecture... however, I know for a fact that after graduation I don't want to work in an architecture firm or really have anything to do with the nitty-gritty parts of building design. My alternative is a less expensive school to study industrial design, which I think I might be more interested in, but am not 100% sure. It seems like this should be a no-brainer, but the decision is difficult for me because I have good friends in my current program, like the school and don't really want to leave... plus I'm not 100% sold on industrial design and have heard stories of people who study architecture and go on to have successful careers in related fields anyway... I'd still be interested in that. (Plus, don't lots of people go on to work jobs unrelated to their undergrad major anyway?)

165,"So I met this guy in January and I had a crush on him since I met him. At the time I thought I'd hit the jackpot, he's attractive, really nice, and I thought he was totally my type. I found out he likes me back in February, and i was the happiest I'd been in a while. I had a crush on him up until mid April then started to doubt it. Upon getting to know him better, I found out he's a lot more religious than me and has a completely different sense of humor than me (I have dark, sarcastic humor and he has super light hearted random humor that I don't find funny at all). The religion thing I didn't mind so much, as we have the same beliefs, he just takes it to a deeper level than me. I disregarded the humor thing and dealt with it by just going along with his jokes and making my own, as he finds my jokes funny. 
Ok so now it's been a while since I've seen him in person, because summer break started in May so the only communication with him has been through text. So i thought maybe my questionable feelings for him were because of lack of contact? I'm starting to doubt that though. I no longer feel excitement when I get a messege from him, and I don't think about him as often as I used to, but at the same time I care about him and enjoy his personality and family, and my friends and family approve of him as well. The problem is that I've recently gotten annoyed with his religiousness, which is something I used to be able to handle. Also he is just boring to me now.

Thanks in advance all for any input,

Long story short I'm almost 28, I took the asvab with my army recruiter for OCS and I scored high enough to branch as an intel officer. I just need to do well in my class and hope an intel spot is open.

I also said why not, and applied for the FBI as an SA. I have a background as a licensed financial advisor and I got the email today for the invite to take the SASS phase 1 test. Which is beyond awesome. I know its a huge acomplishment to even get invited to take the test, but the entire process takes around a year at the quickest I believe. 

Even though my work experience was very unique and right up a financial crimes type of deal, I did not go to grad school or have a 3.8 gpa. Im worried Ill get to the very end then just not make the cut cause I assume there are 300 more like myself who have their masters or better GPAs.

Well the plan was for me to go to MEPS in a few weeks and see the board right after. Then this possible FBI epic opportunity actually happened. I underdtand its like 3% who actually end up graduating from the academy. As far as I know the oldest you can be to actually commission as an officer is 29. See the issue?

I need to pick one..... please give me some guidence. Both would be awesome but come on, FBI is some next level stuff. Either way I already signed up to take the SASS in two days.  Higher chance of getting into OCS, smaller chance of being a freakin FBI agent.",02Jul2019,1
171,"This is really complicated so I’ll try to explain the best I can.

We just sold our house and at first we were going pretty much cross country as my mother had a potential job lined up there. I applied to all the universities there and got accepted into most.

Well the job didn’t go through with the cross country state, and she essentially got laid off weeks before closing. Now, I’m frantically applying to colleges/universities that I can’t even apply to most of them because it’s now late May, but I was able to apply to some.

I got accepted to the school I was hoping to get into. But now my grandmother was going to buy a small condo for us to stay in, but since the university will require me to live on campus for my freshman year, my grandmother will not buy the condo unless I live there as well.

I really don’t know if my grandparents will be willing to let my mother in, not out of resentment or anything; but, because they live in a very small 850sqft house with my grandfather being wheelchair bound, and is on 24/7 oxygen, Which makes it difficult for two people let alone 3 and a dog to live there.

I’m willing to go to community college, to be able to live at ‘home’, but my family(including my mother) say I should go to university.

We close in 2 weeks and we have no clue where to go, my mother can’t get an apartment lease due to not having a job, and the proceeds from the sale are not looking great either.

They say it’s not my problem, but it definitely feels like it is. After everything my mother has done for me, I really feel like I’m letting her down for this.",02Jul2019,1
172,"I want to start this off by saying that this is a commited and long term relationship, and I am not going to leave him because of this. Please give helpful, not judgemental advice...

I have had lice and bed bugs for year now. My family has spend over a thousand dollars containing it (Evacuating our house for professional treatment, going to lice clinics, the bogus shampoos, and my doctor's appointments, which I'll talk about later.) We are very well off and live in a nice big clean house (not counting the half a million we have in debt) so we had the money to do so right once we realized what was happening. My partner lives in a trailer with 6 people, 3 of which are out of control toddlers. Only his grandmother works to support everyone. Needless to say, they can't afford to do what we did. Especially not to everybody in the family, including the rest of the family's other contaminated houses.

When I saw the bed bug bites on myself, I didn't know they were bites. I broke out in humungous and miserable hives. I went to the doctor and took allergy medications and all kinds of shit for 6 months which turns out I didn't need. Apparently, I am highly allergic to bed bugs. It took me finding a bed bug on myself at school to realize. After a very expensive extermination, the hives disappeared with the bugs. But the bugs are back, and now my little brother and cousin have bites (my cousin and their big family are living with us, because they're house was destroyed by a severe flood.) We have too many people in the house to have bed bugs again.

I cannot live with head lice anymore. It does not matter how much I sleep in oil, comb, heat, whatever I do, I get it again, because it is impossible for my boyfriend to get rid of it on himself without staying completely bald until he is able to move out. He is so disgusted with and ashamed of himself. It is not his fault at all.

One of the toddlers I mentioned is absolutely covered, head to toe, in hives from the bed bugs. It is very DHS worthy. My partner's mom has been trying in vain to get rid of it, but I believe the infestionation is too bad to get rid of. They'd probably have to just tear the trailer down. But again they are quite poor. (Even though they're going on a cruise, WITH LICE AND BED BUGS) So irresponsible. but his mom works too jobs very hard so I don't blame her for wanting to enjoy something like that with the little bit extra they have. Yes this pisses me off and probably pisses all of you off, I know that's shitty. But that's not the point right now... the point is I love my boyfriend very much but I am going crazy.

He can't move out, he has no where to go. His family bought a camper but it's not for him to live in which really angers me. You're going to go on a cruise and buy yourself a camping toy, while letting your son live in a house filled with little kid's trash, bed bugs, and lice? Again.. not the point at the moment... but god. As much as I want to call DHS I'm not sure what good it would really do. I don't want them to get fined, they couldn't afford it. His grandpa is terminally ill.

To start it off I have been with my boyfriend since sophomore year of high school and we just finished our sophomore year of college. In high school I looked a lot different then I do now. I weighed about 110 pounds I wasn’t on a crazy unhealthy diet or anything I just worked a horrible summer job where I would walk like 12 miles a day work a 10 hour shift and get one 30 minute break. Anyway fast forward to now I am about 50 pounds heavier thanks to a new medication and a less active life style. Also since college has started I have been experimenting with my look a lot just because hey it’s college and I won’t be able to have fun with it when I have to get a big girl job. So I have been messing around with hair colors all but one have been normal human hair colors. The only abnormal one is teal but that’s a wash out color. This background information will make more sense when I get to the real issue just please bear with me. 

So starting about late last year early this year my boyfriend has been slowly recommending that we go to the gym together more and more. He’s a big gym guy who has to go like 4 times a week or he gets stressed. For my birthday he got me a pair of gym shoes and at the start of the summer he got a membership at a local gym chain that lets him bring a guest (me) every time I spend time with him. Now he and his family is a lot more conservative then I am. Whenever I even mention that I am thinking about a new fun hair color he freaks out and it turns into a fight about how he doesn’t have to like it and he just grew up not liking dyed hair wether it’s a natural hair color or a unnatural color. The last time he brought it up he said he doesn’t even wanna bring me around his extended family because they say all this mean stuff about it and they tease him. I asked him if I was an embarrassment to him now and he said he just doesn’t like answering the questions

182,"I'm fairly new to reddit (aside from youtube), and this is my first post! In a little over a week I will be turning 18 years old. Finally, freedom to do as a please, without breaking the law of course. My birthdays have always been different from other people's, as I have an identical twin sister to share the celebration with. Yesterday in the car, my mom asked me what I wanted, and I realized, I have no idea. I got a job almost a year ago, and have been occasionally treating myself to snacks, art supplies, make-up, books, and things for my dogs.
The past few years my birthday has seldom been celebrated, as we usually take a vacation the week of, going down south to visit family in Florida. My younger step sister's birthday is a day before ours, she'll be turning 15 this year. Our birthday is often overlooked or not as celebrated as my step sister's, which often leaves me and my twin feeling a bit down, but still appreciative of what small things we did get. However that's often hard when most of the past years we only got money and a 'Happy Birthday', not even a cake most years.
I don't know what I want for my birthday, and I suppose because it's my 18th, my entrance into adulthood, I should ask for something meaningful, and perhaps helpful to my future. My family was poor in the past, and I recall 3 instances of homelessness in my youth, thankfully though my grandparents took us in. Nowadays my family is fairly financially stable, and I suppose I could ask for a car or something like that, however I'm nervous to. I have many siblings, and being the oldest, it's rough asking for birthday gifts. Especially with 3 of my siblings birthdays within the same period, one of course being my twin sisters.

184,"Hello! I'm a 17(m), and I need some advice about a friend of mine. I've know her for as long as I can remember, and we have been good friends for most of that time. To be frank, I'm kinda concerned about some of her behaviors, and I need some advice about how to handle my personal shit around her too. Truthfully, I had a crush on her for multiple years. Unrequited obviously. That doesn't directly matter. The thing is, lately she has been getting more and more distant from me. She also has been doing more and more things she really shouldn't. Nothing too bad, mainly drinking and some drugs. She's been scaling up, which scares me too. She has also been getting worse and worse mentally, or at least it seems like she has. More therapists lately. I don't want to alienate her by being judgements about her habits, because I like hanging out with her, and also because I'm worried about her safety. She kinda blows me off to hang with her drug friends a lot, and I will admit, that makes me jealous. I worry that a lot of the people she hangs out with only encourage her to do worse and worse stuff, and from some of the stories she has told me it's obvious that they don't care too much about her safety. I would cut ties with her, but that would crush me, and I would still be worried about her. I don't know how to handle any of this. Wtf do I do? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. This is a burner account, for obvious reasons.",02Jul2019,1
185,"Hey I just wanted to start this off with I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this but I didnt know anywhere else to. Also this is probably going to be long-ish. And thank you for taking your time to read this, If never really told anyone the full story and its been eating me up recently and I just want closure.

To start things off this happened when I was fourteen, incredibly naive, and desperate to impress the few friends I had. Looking back they wherent the best people to try to impress since they where having sex with older man and occasionally doing drugs.

This guy texted me and we talked for about a day collectively (over a few times talking shortly throughout the week). He was into the same things I was in to, had the same sense of humor I had, and didnt strike me as the type of people my parents warned me about. 

When he asked me to hang out I wasn't sure so I asked my friend if he knew him and sure enough he did. He jokingly remarked that he was probably going to hook up with me and said something along the lines of ""you should let me go instead"". And to this I said jokingly back to him ""no way you get all the guys already im a virgin let me have this""

Before I met him a small part of me wanted that. That disappeared the second I met him/ he walked me to his house. He acted weird around me and gave me very off/bad vibes but I went along with it because I trusted my friend.

We where alone at his house and sat me down on his couch when he pretended to ask me what I wanted to do before interrupting me to say ""oh I have an idea"" as he pulled out a naughty truth or dare app on his phone. Do to him acting weird on the way there I was kinda scared to say no to him.
I'm not sure if it's inportant or not but he was eighteen.

It started out innocent enough at first as I would always choose truth or take the non sexual dares. He eventually didnt like this and said that I had to start doing the dares. When the first one came up it was touch the other persons crotch. I didnt want to but me made me. It was over the clothes but I hated it and when I tried to move my hand or show that I was uncomfortable he would get made at me. Right before I finally left he had the final dare. It was to touch my breasts. I said and showed that I was uncomfortable with it and he did it anyway. 

I'm not sure if this counts as assualt because it's my fault that I went with him and that he could've done a lot worse but didn't. I mean like I said before I met him I knew the possibility of something sexual could happen. 

I've definitely grown sense then and would never do somethinthing like that again but it still bothers me. I have anxiety so I do tend to over worry about things so part of me also thinks that its just my anxiety making a montain out of a mole hill so I would really like to know so I can finally have a sense of closure whatever the answer may be.",02Jul2019,1
187,So I just graduated 8th grade from a small private school. At my school everybody was really close. Now many of us are going to different highschools but thats not the problem.

We talked everyday.

(This would be the first time in 2-3 years I would see him besides little things at school where I would exchange a few word with him) I was so excited to go see him. I planned it out with him and we where all set to go. The day rolls around where I can see him, and he doesn’t show. He did this many of times in the past but obviously didn’t change his ways. I went home and I told my mom what happened. She instantly blocked him on Instagram. Few months past and my aunt dms me on insta (dads side) she wants to go to lunch with me for my birthday. It’s all great. She asks for my number (no one on that side of the family had the number due to mom) and I give it over. She at first only gives it to one other aunt until she askes If it’s ok to give my number out. I told her I didn’t care. My dad now text me everyday (I never respond) acting like nothing has happened. Idk what to do. He could care less about me but wants to seem like a good guy?

192,"I just finished my first year at university and I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m currently on summer break and the thought of going back in the fall makes me feel dread. I don’t know what I want to study. I hear people speaking about a subject they’ll love to get their Masters on and all I can do is envy them. I haven’t found that subject that I’d love to do for hours on end (and least importantly, one that would make me good money). I don’t know what I’m good at either. It seems that no matter what I do, there is someone out there that does it and does it better so why need me in university. I’m the first in my family to go straight to a four year instead of the workforce. I see my siblings and they seem fine with their life. Sure, some of them are struggling financially but they still have a smile on their face. I look at myself and I don’t have a smile on my face. This makes me wonder whether I should continue at this university or just become an entrepreneur like one of them. I really have no idea where I’d start but, it seems better than memorizing what’s on a bloody book and being anxious about my future at university. I just don’t feel like I belong, everyone is excited about what courses they’re going to be taking and then there’s me- I’m lost. To add to this, I didn’t make any friends. It’s always been difficult for me to open up and trust people with my problems. No parties either. (Isn’t that what college is about: friends, parties, and studying?) University looks bleak at the moment. My parents are proud of me for getting this far and I don’t want to let them down but I can honestly say school hasn’t made me happy in a long time. I can probably trace this back to my first year of high school. I don’t know what to do. Does it even matter what path I take? Should I just stick to whatever major brings me even the littlest of joy? I need to declare a major by the end of this upcoming year. If I don’t it’s not the end of the world but, I’ll probably need to spend more years there which requires more work and money both of which are limited.

193,"Lord I never post anything on Reddit but I’m feeling like I need some help or maybe just to reach out in a way where I can be uninterrupted... and tell the story so I can maybe figure out where to go from here. The long story short and the quick problem at hand is how badly my sister and I need a place. We are living in what was our mother’s beautiful home which is about an hour away from work for both of us. We work near what is essentially my dream town to live in but there aren’t many places available right now. I used to live there with my boyfriend- but a moment of intense clarity lead me out of his arms and back home to start a new life. All of my energy seemed to shift. My sister after spending years black-sheeping it with a lover my family did not approve of and intentially or not, cut out most other relationships with her family. She would reach out and ask for money- well her girlfriend would for her... and would talk our ears off about how both of them suffered from mental health illnesses and ended up going in and out of the mental hospital (this seemed to go on for a while) and at one point when I saw my sister at her worst she was delusional... the scariest goddamn thing I had ever seen in my life... it was manic and kind of horrifying because I thought I knew her one way.... regardless, no one knew how to help and the system didn’t take great care of her and she ended up with a felony and more time in a hospital... and by the end of that ordeal she was spit up on Moms doorstep (Mom who at this point is totally healthy). Sister and Mom butt heads so much. I have my moment of clarity with boyfriend and decide it’s time to end things.... longest story short- the most difficult thing I ever did leaving him, to be the cream between two hard-ass cookies. Sister fell from her manic state to a more depressed one and has spent a lot of the past year sleeping. Moms cough got bad, real bad, then she got the diagnosis... and then she got real bad.... then real good... then hospital bad, then hospice bad... then gone... all of our family and friends rallied around us, and sister and I have been going through this together. She’s doing so well I feel... and I am a spiritual and bright and happy person and I can see the magic in all this.... and I miss my Mom but we got to be with her all the way and we see our other family more and I’m trying to find her in the butterflies.... but sister and I need a new place. Landlord is selling the building. I don’t want to buy a home yet. I feel like an actual child, a year ago I thought I was on this whole other path and now I just want to be a waitress and make money and new friends and help my sister find her best self and her passion and her zest for life and maybe a reconnection with family... but the felony on the apartment application is the scary part... how can we get past that? And I can’t help but feel like I’ve taken on all of this responsibility- I feel like she couldn’t get far without me.... which might be presumptuous... but I do have to ask her all the time if she’s taken her meds or if she’s brushed her hair even... I get worried that she will get too depressed and just give up caring for herself.... I’m just trying to stay positive... we literally have to sleep somewhere. The world won’t stop for us and I suppose I could always sleep under a bench, but I’m just trying so hard to make all this work and keep the biggest, wisest perspective possible... I just need some help I guess or some kind advice... hope to hear from some of you, and I apologize for the ranty, stream-of-consciousness vibe but it’s just got to get out.",02Jul2019,1

I went to a bar after work without telling my husband because I wanted attention. This is very out of charater for me. He was devasted when he found out. I realized I fucked up and scheduled an appointment with a therapist.

I wrote down notes for my therapist about what happened and how I felt, but my dumbass left the note on the couch, only to be discovered by my husband. He sobbed. He looked genuinely hurt and deeply heartbroken.

He asked me multiple times who I'm attracted to and I said no one...that it meant I was seeking external validation to feel good about myself because I have low self-esteem. I need attention, i feel lonely.

He said he always took me for a wallflower. This news shocked him. 

I know that I have a good thing going with my husband, which is why I'm trying to work through this in therapy, but I feel horrible for hurting him.

I dont want to admit being attracted to another man, this would devastate him. I wish I destroyed that note.

198,"Hey Reddit! 

So normally I would just sit here and worry all by myself about what to do, but I’ve decided that I’m so negative and clueless, I really need some outside advice here to help me out. 

So, the situation:

Two nights ago (Saturday) was our big end of year party for my high school, and two other nearby high schools. 

This party is always HUGE; the cops know about it and let it happen, they just make sure nobody is drinking and driving so there’s not too much trouble. 

So we’re at this party, and everybody is COMPLETELY trashed, myself included. I’m standing around talking to some people I haven’t talked to since high school started, when The Boy came over to join us. We’re gonna call him Peter. 

Some backstory on Peter: I’ve known this kid since I was seven. We went to a VERY small elementary and middle school together, and I probably had a solid crush on him from grades 4 to 9,  which is when we really stopped talking. I never really stopped the crush though, it just got pushed to the back burner. We’ve talked casually a bunch of times, but we haven’t really been friends for quite a while. Another important piece of information, Peter has had a girlfriend for the past 4 or 5 months I think, (she’s super nice I really like her so that makes this worse) but she broke up with him earlier that day. I remember learning this earlier on during the party, and saw him looking pretty sad about it.

So Peter and I and these two other girls are standing in a little clump, talking, kind of stumbling around, and Peter is having a real rough time standing without tripping (I should say that this party was literally in a sand pit so that was the major contributor here).

Anyway so he kind of wraps his arm around me and me around him, to keep his balance. We’re talking, kind of going back to when we used to be super close friends.
These other two girls decided to leave, and it’s just me and Peter now with our arms around each other. 

I’m not going to lie, the beginning here is a little hazy so I don’t know how it actually started, but we Hardcore start to make out. Like we were both absolutely going HAM here. Everything you’re picturing about a drunk makeout, you’re right. It’s sloppy and im loving every second of it.  I drunkenly confess to him about the crush I had on him forever, and he says he had one on me too, which is absolutely NUTS to me. 

And it lasts for a very long time. Like this goes on for over an hour. I finally have to leave with my friends so they come over and interrupt, and he begs me to stay longer. 

Anyway, we talked briefly the next morning and basically apologized and that was it, except he’s continued to snapchat me for the past couple days. 

Keep in mind i haven’t really been friends with this guy for a few years, and we haven’t really talked outside of school for about the same, and now he’s snapchatting me pretty frequently. 

We haven’t said anything else to each other, and I have no idea where to even start. As I said i’ve liked this guy for SO long it feels like I’d be missing my only shot here if I don’t go for it, but also i’m a bit of a pussy and i’m so afraid of rejection it’s terrifying.

I realize that this ‘problem’ is super trivial and probably doesn’t seem that important, but I literally cannot stop thinking about it and I really want something to happen between us this summer, before we both leave in the fall.
I want to know if you guys think I have any sort of shot with this guy? Or do we think i’m just a shitty rebound? and what do I even say to him now? I feel so awkward whenever I think about it.

Please help me. I’m desperate.

210,"**TW: Suicide, Metal illness, Sexual assault. A clusterf\*\*k of other things.**

First off, I supposed I should start off with some back story. OP has been diagnosed with BPD (boderline personality disorder) and separation anxiety since a very young age. I grew up around substance abuse,physical and mental abuse, sexual abuse among other things and I'm a cocktail of issues thrown together to make whatever it is I'm supposed to be. I spent most of my life locked away in my room or isolated and only in the passed 3 years have I tried to really get my life back on track. My anxiety used to be so bad, I couldn't go to a shopping mall/center without having a rather severe panic attack. My depression all the same, I've made attempts on my life a few times (10 years old, 15 years old and 17 years old). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Those three years that I have now spent working on myself, I owe to my partner. If it wasn't for him I don't think I'd have ever come this far to begin with. As of this day today I have my own apartment, food on my plate, a loving boyfriend, friends and a ""career"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now... I have struggled immensely to hold down a job but due to my illness I  have lows and those lows are extreme. They come like roller coasters where i'll be doing fantastically then all of a sudden I'm ready to run away and end my own life and am left with the feeling of no return and I become extraordinarily self destructive.  I have barely any control over this and even now as I write this I just feel like running off and vanishing from existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new job recently in the passed several months and so far I had really enjoyed the work and my co-workers aside from a handful and some pretty nasty sexism that I had to deal with it really has been okay. My issue is that I live quite far away and my day consists of getting up at 6am, carpooling with someone who talks to much and as a quite introverted person, drains the life from me. I travel to work for 40 minutes to over an hour depending of traffic. Then it's the regular 9-5, then I get home about 6:30-7. It's a long day for me and before all of this I used to have so much time to myself to process my emotions, my mental health and could spend time on my behaviors etc. Now I have maybe 2-3 hours when I get home to unwind but usually end up just sitting on the couch blankly till I go to bed at 10pm. On top of all this I had to quit cigarettes as I was coughing so profusely that I started to cough up blood. Since quitting it's gotten much worse and I now get maybe 4 hours sleep a night if I'm lucky as once I lie down it all begins to sit on my lungs and it absolutely kills me. I don't have time to exercise anymore and because of how stressed I am I stress eat which is making me pack on weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried so hard to continuously push myself to prove to both myself and my partner and my family that I can be normal, that I can function as a normal person and that I can control my mental illness but as each day goes by I don't feel this to be the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned by now that workplaces do not give a flying fuck about mental health so I don't mention it. Plus they legally can fire me if they believe my mental health is becoming a concern. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I fix me? What am I doing wrong and how the ever loving fuck am I going to pull through this. To most this would all seem so minor but for me it always feels like a literal tsunami heading right toward me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.",02Jul2019,1
211,"Let me start of by saying that I love my little brother more than anything else, but I’ve been jealous of him since I was a child. I understood from a young age that he needed a little more attention and help than I did and that itself didn’t bother me, but my parents and every one else started to spoil him endlessly (not that I wasn’t spoiled as a child, but not the way he was). I family does EVERYTHING for him, even things he’s perfectly capable of doing himself. On top of that, they’ve told me that I’d be the one to take care of him one day since I was little. This part makes me feel even more guilty, but I don’t want to. Since my parents have always done every little thing for him, he gets agitated when he’s asked to do anything for himself (even putting shoes on). It’s not like he has trouble doing these things, he just refuses to. Sometimes he’ll get agitated enough to kick and hit people. I know I can’t have my own family and have him in the same house. I don’t hate my brother, but I hate being his sister. I hate that I was understanding enough as a child to give up things my brother wanted, I hate that my parents made that the norm, I hate that I’ve set the bar to sacrificing my own happiness for my brother, and I hate that in the 18 years I’ve been alive no one has ever attempted to ask me how I feel about all of it. My mom and I got into an argument last week about a vacation (for my brother) that I didn’t wanna go on because it wouldn’t be fun for me, and she told me it’d be fun for me because my brother would be happy. I remember birthdays when I would open presents and my brother would want to play with them so I would just let him, so they eventually become his toys. It was the same with clothes, shoes, stuffed animals, pretty much anything I owned. I just gave it up because I didn’t want to see my brother upset. There was actually more than one occasion here we switched clothes in public because he suddenly wanted my shirt instead. It was expected of me. My parents always thanked me and said I was good big sister, but they never asked if I was okay with giving away what I had or how I felt about it. I feel like my parents don’t see my individuality, they just see me as “the other child”. I wanna move out of the country once I’m out of college and never come back, never talk to them again, but I know my conscience won’t allow time to do that. I might get by without talking to my mom again, I’d feel horrible and cry about it but our relationship has always been a little strained. But I could never go without talking to my dad again. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve considering marking everything off my bucket list and then ending it all when it’s time to come back and take care of my brother, but I don’t think I could ever go through with it. I have no one to talk to about this. Every time I bring it up I get labeled as selfish for not wanting to care for my brother or give up stuff for him anymore. I get shamed for wanting to get as far away from home as possible. I feel like my life has pretty much lost all meaning and I’m never gonna have the life I want because my parents planned it all out for me already.",02Jul2019,2

214,"To give context: my friend is a middle aged woman that lives alone with her 2 kids in Boston. Her ex husband has been abusing her for years but she was too scared to seek help until recently when his abuse became worse. Last week he came in very drunk, strangled her, knocked her down, kicked her, etc, until she finally decided it was enough and called the police on him the next morning (so proud!!). She had her bruises documented and there’s a warrant out for him now, which he doesn’t know about, but the police are trying to catch him while he’s home, which may take another couple days. Tomorrow morning she is filing a restraining order.

However, we are expecting him to try to come tomorrow night, and the police may not get him before then. So I need some advice that I can pass on to her. Here’s what we’ve done so far: 

-We bought some door jams for her (door knob stick things that keep the door stuck shut). Only concern is that we tested it and her door hinges are pretty weak, so it might buy her 30 seconds, but it’s not super promising. 
-Gave her some pepper spray, which will probably buy her 3ish minutes, but will also tick him off and potentially make him more dangerous 
-told her to move her kitchen knives somewhere else so he can’t find them easily in case things go badly 
-told her to ask the neighbors to call 911 if they see him (because previously they saw him abusing her through the window but DIDN’T call 911 because they didn’t want to get involved... please if you see abuse happening don’t be a bystander!!) 

She needs enough time to call 911 before he takes her phone away, and needs 2-3 minutes of self defense time before the cops arrive. 

Any advice we haven’t thought of yet? Please, anything helps! Thanks Reddit!!",02Jul2019,2
215,"This story will be long, for whoever is willing to read: 

My mother passed away over three years ago, and I did not get a solid reason for her passing, My sister said that she had a drug overdose, and one aunt said the same thing. My mum was 69, bipolar, and addicted to cocaine and alcohol, yet she was the only family member who loved me unconditionally. I was not in contact with her because knowing this hurt too much. 

I've also gone no-contact with all of family - both sides - and even most people connected with my family, for health reasons. They shunned me for having emotional maladies which were apparently passed on by my mum's side of the family, quite possibly my father's as well (schizophrenic and schizoid cousin and aunt). 

When I became manic a few years ago and flew to Ireland to try to ""restart my life"", they completely shunned me after I said that I wanted to end my life, and I did. I was desperate and also struggling then with addiction which made me horrible depressed and suicidal, on top of already having depression, clinical OCD, anxiety, etc. I recovered now, however. I have a steady job, I'm sober, and I'm currently on holiday in Perú for a month, planning a trip to Cusco, a place where I've never been and always wanted to see.

Now, the hospital where my mother passed (the same one where I was born), is just ten minutes away by car, however I'm not sure if I have the emotional strength to go and ask for a death certificate to officially learn what happened to , fearing a relapse of my condition due to possibly learning horrible details about her death. 

When my mum died, my family (my $#$!! sister) decided to have her body quickly cremated, and no autopsy results were revealed. They did **NOT** help me get a flight ticket for her funeral.

I'm on holiday at the moment - came here to see Cusco, but I'm haunted by my mother's death and feel that it's a duty as her son to learn the official reason of her death, and the autopsy results, but don't want to sacrifice my own mental wellness in the process.

219,"TL;DR:  Summer housemates that are messy and loud posted a salty tweet about us asking them to quiet down. Is it worth it to confront them about it or just let it go?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm living in a unit with my sister and three other girls. We're all college students sharing a space over the summer, and the other three will be moving out by the end of summer (so I will really only be living with them for a little more than a month to go). When we moved in, we set guidelines on responsibilities for trash, cleaning, dishes, etc. One of the rules we had all agreed upon was having your own dishes done by the end of the night- they don't have to be done right away, but it would be nice to have them cleaned so that the next morning the sink isn't filthy and plates don't stack up.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the month we have lived with them, 2 of the girls in particular have not been the best housemates. They leave crumbs and dirty paper towels/aluminum foil/food scraps all over the counter, leave burnt crispy edges all over the stove, leave the dishes in the sink for up to 4 days,  and have even left the stove on after cooking (that goes beyond cleanliness, it's just dangerous). On top of that, they have been extremely loud and will hang around the kitchen area cackling for whatever reason. My sister and I are the main leasers (the other 3 are just subleasing for the summer) so we decided to send a text to the group chat reminding everyone of their kitchen responsibilities. Last night, the two were cackling in the kitchen again while my sister and I were studying at around midnight. My sister went out to the kitchen and simply said, ""Hey, do you mind keeping it down a bit?"" and they responded seemingly okay with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then today, one of my friends who follows her on Twitter found that one of the girls had tweeted about us saying ""so we can't laugh in this house now. interesting.."" I'm pissed that they didn't just talk to me about it, and I refuse to play the villain because of their own habits.  I have also been pretty kind and polite to them, allowing them to use all of the cooking materials I bought and often letting them have pizza or homemade banana bread. How should I approach this scenario without exposing my friend who follows one of the girls on Twitter? Should I even bring anything up if they're moving out by mid-August?",02Jul2019,1
221,"So I’m driving and I’m making a left turn out of my neighborhood and some guy runs the red light and nearly into me if I wasn't paying attention. I honked my horn at him and that pissed him off so we were stopped at a red light and he drove up next to me, knocked on my window, we exchanged words and then he threw water into my car and on my face. I still am so shaken up by the situation. I don’t know how to let it go. I know I should’ve just ignored the guy and moved to the next lane  (it was empty) but I wasn’t expecting someone to do something so disgusting.

It could’ve ended a lot worse but I’m still really upset over it. I wish I got his license plate to report it but I have nothing, so I’m better off just moving on from it but I just can’t. I’m stuck either replaying what happened or berating myself for not doing something different like drive away from that horrible, disgusting man. 

How can I just move on from this and stop replaying what happened in my head? I can still see the guy’s face, it’s like haunting me…",02Jul2019,1
222,"I'm a govt contractor and the place I work is pretty laid back. I've been there for a few years and I am continually disappointed in management overall. I started working in a department that seemed promising as a career path but my manager is extremely volatile, emotionally unstable, and doesn't seem to care how her careless actions constantly jeopardizes the rest of our team. The team is pretty small and the majority of the members have formed their own little clique and spends every day gossiping and illegally ordering lunch on the corporate credit card - this is not an exaggeration. It's gotten very very discouraging to be there. And since I have stopped engaging in meetings where we either sit around and listen to our tyrant boss talk about her personal life (i.e. how her kids went to Harvard or how much money she makes) or listening to the other women's sex life stories and other depressing personal issues, I have been frozen out.

Recently, we had a major project going on, one we had been preparing for 6 months out. I put a lot of work in with research and data collection in preparation and was excited this was going to be my first major project where I got to contribute and every team member had a role assigned. Unfortunately, somewhere in the middle of completing the project our boss shut all teammates out except for one and stopped coming to work (""worked from home"") and only communicated to the rest of the team through the one teammate. That teammate is not a great communicator and is desperate to feel important - so instead of keeping us informed she pretty much holed up in her office and only doled out pieces of information and small tasks without giving us any updates on what was happening. By the end she and the boss just kept telling the rest of us that they were ""protecting us"" because the project wasn't going well... 

After the project was completed our boss took a 3 week vacation (which she bragged about getting PTO from our CEO and not having to use her personal time because ""she worked so hard"" on the project) and she and the teammate took pretty much full credit for the project not mentioning they shut the rest of us out. And at this point, I had not saw my boss in 2 months. I forgot to mention just as the project began, she hired a new employee. So I started training her (since I had nothing else to do) and trying to pretend that everything is fine and convince her (&amp; myself) that the job is great. But she also had little to no communication with our boss for the 2 months she's been there...

And finally, there is an elderly woman on our team who really did not function well with being cut out of the project. She retired last year but I guess hates her life, so she came back to work on our team part-time. She is somehow threatened by both me and the new coworker because we're younger? And she thinks with the two of us there she'll have to go back into retirement (she told me this when the new girl started). So she has taken to trying to encourage me to look for other jobs. At first, I thought she had taken an interest in me and my life- like a mentor. This quickly turned into her sending me job postings and being condescending to both me and the new coworker every chance she gets. (Trying to redo our work or try and call me out in meetings for things she thinks I don't know etc.)

Anyway there's more but I don't have the energy to type it. It's just all become so draining I don't know what to do. I am not particularly thrilled or attached to the work I'm doing. I feel like I have no allies there and the only person I am comfortable being around is the new coworker. And I'm finding myself growing in resentment everyday. I have made efforts to bond with others but because I am the youngest person there no one often takes me seriously or actually listens to my input. I'm not respected. I need the money and I actually did start looking into and applying other places but with no luck. I don't necessarily want to start over without a clear plan but I don't know what else to do. I don't know what I want to do or what even to apply for.

I'm feeling very lost.

223,"Well this is my first Reddit post so hello. I came on here because Iv'e kinda lost faith in the rest of the internet and also hopefully can be fully myself here. I'll just start now.

&amp;#x200B;

I just turned 26, which I know is pretty young but i'm starting to feel old as I feel like my life is going nowhere. All my adolescent  I was overweight at my heaviest I was 6'2 289 pounds until I made the decision to better my life. I had always felt like my weight was the problem and as I grow older im starting to realize I am fundamentally fucked up in some areas of my life. I age 19 I started to lose the weight by age 21 I was a completely different person. While people started to treat me different and much kinder and attention from women grew very fast at my core im realizing im the same lazy, unmotivated, unattached person ive always been. Seeing the world from two different weights kinda fucked with my head. I was the same person I've always been it was just much more accepted when I looked good in societies eyes. It even drove to my first ""career"" as a personal trainer which has since fizzled out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to give you some slight background information on myself but here are the real questions.

&amp;#x200B;

After a recent break-up with my first long term girlfriend I moved from the San Francisco Bay area to San Diego CA. My life was pretty decent there but I was not very happy. I have a hard time being ""normal"" I actually run from most ""average"" things. The idea of working 9-5 and coming home to the same shit everyday drives me crazy. Life has been a little bit rough here for me, first off all I don't pay Rent, I didn't care for training as much as I thought I was just pretty good at it, so I stopped working in a gym and now I have one client who I live with in a top-floor condo in one of the most beautiful cities in the world and I still can't shake the feeling of being more depressed than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent 4 months in the city and i'm still relativity un-employed. I moved here to chase a dream that I can't even define. I have been doing odd-jobs and gigs to stay afloat but the reality is I hate the idea of working for most places and trading my time for minimum to low-wage jobs. Reality didn't hit that hard until recent, for the first time in a long time I missed all my CC payments, my car bill and insurance. My current finical situation has me with $-25 in my bank, one month behind on all my bills a rapidly declining credit score. All my CC debt totals at about $7,500, I have no college education and I don't know my next move in life is. To make it worse, if you looked at my social media you would think I was perfectly happy and thriving in my new situation and even my parents and family are not fully aware of my situation. I don't want an easy way out I just feel so lost, I have a hard time attaching myself to anything, literally anything. I have always been someone whos kinda good at everything but my attachment issues have prevented me from being great at anything. I don't doubt my ability to become a better than average human and that makes it hard to settle, but reality is I'm dead broke I have no idea what job im willing to trade my time for money.

She's mentioned that some of her friends do drugs and have gotten in trouble with the police. I'm worried about her getting into drugs, alcohol, etc. especially because my family has a history of addiction.

232,"The ""old friend"" went to school with my father and my uncle. Growing up, his daughters and I were best friends for many years and I saw him as my second father (he is a single dad). Today I am no longer friends with his daughters but I still keep in contact with him (maybe catch up twice a year, nothing consistent) to check up on everything. He is very aware that I am a suffering sex addict, my medical history, an abuse victim, ect. 

A few months ago he was driving me home and said ""if you need help with your ""issue"" I'm always here. I'll let you know when the girls aren't home"". I knew what he meant but I passef it off, didn't react and changed the subject. He is much older mid 50s, shorter, balding, I have zero interest in that.

Out of the blue at 2am yesterday he calls me. I'm still awake and pick up because I thought something could be wrong. He asks me if I'm working, if I need money...

233,"Tl;dr - dude did some bad shit to me. Part of it was spreading a rumour that I’m a pedophile and turning friends, family and neighbours on me. I’m guessing he either wants me to kill myself or he wants the people around me to kill me.

It’s a really long story of how this all started, but basically a guy who I used to be friends with is trying to ruin my life. He drugged and sexually assaulted me a year and a half ago, he also spread rumours about me to my friends (and I’m guessing also my family) to make me look like a liar, among other things. 

He told my ex, my friends and even my neighbours that I am a pedophile, I’ve received death threats from those neighbours, my ex won’t talk to me (weren’t on good terms anyway tbf) and all of my closest friends now treat me like I’m a fucking predator. Like any time we’re around kids they’re giving me weird looks and saying weird things. Then when I confront them they tell me it’s all in my head and I’m “just paranoid”. Needless to say they aren’t really my friends anymore.

I didn’t tell my family for nearly a year although they’d noticed something was up with me. I stopped working and just kinda withdrew into my bedroom for almost a year, rarely saw anyone. At first when I told my family what happened they were really supportive and understanding. My friends however acted like they believed me but I could tell they didn’t, one friend even laughed in my face when telling him how this mutual friend drugged and raped me. Laughed in my face and said “yeah ok mate I need to get going”. It was one of the most painful things accepting that my “friends” don’t trust me and it’s not their fault, it’s the guy who did it who’s obviously told them something else. All that’s dark will come to light, one day they’ll see.

My family then started to act weird around me, or at least I felt like they were. I felt watched constantly. I felt like they were assessing every conversation, every word, every micro-expression. I thought I was going crazy. I confronted them about it and their reaction did nothing to comfort me, it just made it worse. It was obvious they thought _something_ about me.

They do this thing where they speak in subtext, like there’s a message underneath what they’re saying. Sometimes they’ll say things that just don’t make any sense in the context in which they’re saying it, other times it fits the sentence but their body language and emphasis on words makes it obvious they’re saying something else.

For example the other day I was with my dad and my auntie, it was late, we were chilling and talking about stuff. I’d noticed a few times my auntie whispering something to my dad and signalling towards me, then when she looked to see me looking straight at her she just looked off into the distance as if it didn’t happen. 

This had happened so many times before and I hadn’t brought it up because every time I do they just tell me it’s all in my head. So I confront my dad about it, he gets all passive aggressive with this smug little grin on his face and starts asking me stuff like “and how does that make you feel” (with a big passive aggressive grin on his face). 

I’m like “dude cut the bs just tell me what it is”. He beats around the bush and doesn’t tell me, he then changes the subject to pigs... we own pigs... he says completely randomly “are you going to help me round up the pigs in few weeks?” 

I’m just like wtf is happening, I sort of have to humour my dad because he’s bipolar and off his meds atm so I’m like “yeah sure whatever man, can you just tell me what this shit is though?” 

I can’t remember exactly how he got to it but he says something about how the pigs “don’t like to be trapped” with a massive emphasis on “trapped”. 

I’d told him that I thought he was speaking to me in subtext and that is what he chose to say to me. And then he goes “they just want to... run away!” 

To which I go “you’re still trying to talk to me in subtext? Why? Just talk to me like a normal fucking person and stop gaslighting me”. He just said “I don’t know what you’re talking about” still with this big passive aggressive smile. 

Some other things he said that were of context (while we were talking normally) were the words “shame” “disgust” and “suicide”. 

Another example is what happened yesterday that has kept me up all night and led me to write this. I was round my mum’s house, we were chatting about shit I can’t remember what exactly but at some point she starts trying to reset one of the Alexas in the house. 

The one in her bedroom she’d set so it listened more intently and so it could hear us from the kitchen, the one in the kitchen had stopped working. At some point while she was talking I felt like she was starting to talk in subtext, I was looking off to the side while she was looking at me. 

She said “it’s started to happen now that I’ve told that one to listen on a... deeper level” 

I squinted my eyes slightly thinking “did she really just say that?” 

And then she goes “and I can tell because it just noticed that”

My facial expressions then went from sort of confused disbelief to mildly pissed off.

“Oh and it’s getting very cranky now” my mum goes.

I know that I can’t say anything because she’s just going to deny it, the last time I confronted her about it she burst into tears and made me feel really guilty for being “delusional”. 

They had me convinced I was delusional for like 4 or 5 months, they had me on anti-psychotics, I went to a fucking psyche ward because of them. And no, the pills didn’t help, the doctors didn’t know what was wrong with me because I didn’t seem to be delusional or psychotic, and my family carried on gaslighting me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried talking to them, I’ve tried to tell them what they’re doing is gaslighting me and it’s the guy who did this shit to me that’s got you guys doing it and ya don’t even realise it. They don’t trust me, if I’m to understand their subtext speak correctly they think I’m a manipulative lying sociopath. 

My dad outright asked me if I was pedophile over text during an argument... he said something along the line of “are you scared people will find out what you are” to which I’m like super sarcastically like “yeah dad, I’m soooo scared... I just love fucking kids man i just love it” or something to that effect, probably not the best moment to crack a joke but I was just sitting there laughing like “this guyyyyyy”. 

So I’m like close to calling it a day yknow. What this guy has done to me has taken everyone closest to me and turned them on me. Life isn’t really liveable anymore, I can’t work because my head is still too screwed up, I’m too anxious and scared of people, I can’t confide in my family who I’ve always been so close to. I’ve never felt so alone. So disconnected from the people I love the most in this shitty world.

The fuck am I gonna do? I don’t think I could actually go through with suicide, I’d probably pussy out, but it’s getting to the point I might snap soon.

I posted my story somewhere on reddit a while ago on a throwaway, if you really want to find the full thing just search “hyoscine sexual assault” or some shit like that I can’t remember. Be careful, it’s not a fun story and I’m not a great person, inside that post is like every moral indiscretion I’ve ever committed. Can’t be fucked with throwaways now though, I was using it because the guy who did this to me stalks my reddit and so I’m sure he’s gonna see this... Sup Adam, hows life? Are you scared of dying? Because I’m not and I’m coming for you buddy. It’s gonna be painful and drawn out. I want to see the look in your eyes when you’re helpless. I want you to know how it feels :)

Ight I’ve written enough, feels like I got some shit off my chest so I guess that’s something. If any of you guys have any ideas that don’t involve suicide or murder I’d be happy to hear them. Oh and yes I’ve been to the police, they’re useless. Yes I’ve seen doctors and counsellors and psyches and none of them have helped either.

236,"So I've got lots of problems, but I've been thinking about something someone told me. She said that alot of my problems stem from how I'm trying to live my life. Basically, she said I was fake. I was trying to be worldly and cosmopolitan when I'm really ""small town,"" and I should just accept it and be happy. I guess I'm stupid enough, or desperate enough, to ask strangers on the internet what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. She's right, sort of. My life is kind of at a dead end. I have a crappy dead end job, I'm single, and I'm stuck in the same town I was born in. I made the mistake of trying to study other languages and cultures in college and most of my work experience has been at non-profits, so I don't have a ton of marketable skills. I'm also the whitest person you'll ever meet. All the same, I don't really have any interest in my family's history or my town's history. I was never interested in NASCAR, or most sports in general. I never went through that Evangelical phase. I'm also neurodivergent, so I can't really say I've ever had a meaningful relationship or even really understand sex. I like gaming, comics, heavy metal, kaiju movies... basically ""nerd stuff,"" as well as breeding fancy rats and mice.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I am far more interested in other countries and cultures, but I'm also pretty firmly middle class. I don't own a passport or anything and have never been out of the country. And likely I never will considering my decidedly low income and student loans that I'm still paying off over a decade after graduating. The thing is, most of my coworkers ARE far wealthier and more worldly than I am. They come from rich backgrounds. They travel to Europe or India or Bali or Cancun every Summer, Hell some of them do it twice a month. They talk down to me like I can't possibly understand other cultures, and act like I should just accept my lot in life and be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the thing, given that nobody thinks I have any real knowledge of anything, should I just give up and accept that I'll always been provincal and small town? Should I just settle for McDonald's instead of phở, Hollywood blockbusters instead of Bollywood, and shitty pop music instead of Fela Kuti? I get the distinct feeling that being interested in things that are outside my grasp is making me miserable. Would I be happier just being another ignorant redneck?",02Jul2019,1
237,"I’ve lived alone in my 1 bedroom apartment for just over 4 years, and I’ve finally accepted that living alone is just too expensive for me. I found mold growing in my apartment suddenly a week ago and now have the opportunity to break my lease without any fees. My sweet boyfriend lives in a house with 4 other roommates, and he has offered that I come stay with him and save some money until a roommate situation I lined up for January comes around. 

My boyfriend has a cat as well, and she’s indoor/outdoor. I was told years ago when I got my cat that he doesn’t get along with other cats, but he’s always been fine with smaller dogs that have come into his space since him and I have been together.  

Dilemma 2 is my worry that someone would accidentally let him out with all the foot traffic. The roommates like to party a bit, and one in particular drinks until he’s oblivious.  

Do I speak with the guys before we come into their space and let them know that it’s very important that he doesn’t get out ? And just hope for the best? 

Or, do I fly home to my mom and have her watch him until the end of the year, when I’m moving into a more stable place for him. 

This damn cat is my best friend in the world. The last thing I ever want is to be far away from him, but the risk of losing him is out of the question.

Anyway. I was very angry and upset at first about this betrayal, and still am sometimes. I go back and forth with how I feel about him. But at the end of the day, I can’t help my feelings towards. I always end up sad and miserable we aren’t talking like before. Like just this feeling in my heart. I had so much emotion towards him when we first started out. It was that love at first sight feeling. I had a good feeling about him intuitively and in my gut. I still love him now even though he hurt me and I just what him to talk to me about it. But I know he’s scared and intimated especially after what he did. I’m even awake now writing this in the middle of the night because once more, I cannot sleep thinking about him. And some days it does feel like the love we share isn’t going anywhere. Which is why, in addition to the betrayal, I feel conflicted about him. 

He has shown caring toward towards me. I’d say more so than any other man I’ve known. He’s given me attention even on my “ugliest” days and I feel more myself around him than anyone else I’ve been with. 

But the environment were in. Isn’t conducive to open emotional expression. So it’s been complicated and lots of confusion, heartbreak, and repressed emotion involved. There are also other factors as play like his being from a different country and culture.

I hate my body. I hate the way I look when I see myself in a mirror. I have pasty white skin and am an absolute beanpole. I am so skinny my ribs jut out of my body at all times. My neck is so long many people know me as Giraffe. My hands seem too large for my wrists and my feet are enormous compared to my tiny ankles. I have no muscle mass anywhere and look tiny compared to most other boys my age despite being 6’3”. I hate how my chin is non existent and how large my forehead is. I am not comfortable with my body

Now I realize self doubt and body image issues happen to many teens I just didn’t expect for me to feel this way. I’m a loud athletic boy who plays trombone not the stereotypical shy girl. I feel embarrassed to be so upset over my body image but not matter how much I try to ignore it, I always wish that I looked like somebody else. 

A large reason for making this post is that I just feel like I don’t have anyone to talk about it too. I haven’t even told my closest friends who I tell everything, as it feels too intimate and idk wrong I guess, for someone who acts as confidently as I do. I feel comfortable in my personality but not in my body.

278,"Hello guys i am a 23 year old student who will finish his bachelors degree in software engineering next year. I have faced some setbacks in live that have caused me to be a bit older then most of my peers when it comes to studying and life in general. I really want to pursue a master because my bachelors degree does not challenge me at all and i feel like it would look great on my resume and i would enjoy studying more.

Here is my problem however. I am kinda getting worried about my age. I am 23 now and will finish my degree at 24. I want to study in a different country which i will do for 5 months next year and then i also want to pursue my masters in a different country like sweden or Finland. I want to pursue it there since both countries really attract me and the living costs are the same as my own country.
I am planning to work for a year to save money for the studies. However i would be 27 when i graduate which kinda feels old... I am not sure if people would look down upon this and if this would be weird. On the other hand i suffered from a developmental disorder which made my youth very hard and now i feel like i am already behind everyone. I think it would be very cool to pursue my dreams but i am just clouded by doubts and i really dont know what would be the good decision.",02Jul2019,1

And she wont GIVE UP. And just saying mean things that i need to leave him and that im not happy, still bringing up my supposed pregnancy and the children i didn't even know i gave birth too......

281,"Hi everyone, I’d like to start off by saying that I care a lot about my girlfriend. I’m sorry if I’m kind of all over the place. I really don’t know what to do.

We’ve been dating for a while and she never told me that she cut herself in the past. We recently graduated from high school, and we are both going to go to different colleges in the coming months. This is obviously pretty difficult because we don’t know what we are going to do as we leave each other. Staying together would be very difficult, and leaving each other... difficult as well. I recently told her that I was going on a trip to visit my college and my grandparents for two and a half weeks. She was happy for me but also sad because I’m leaving (which she didn’t really tell me about). Anyways, I left and while I’m on my trip there was a day where I didn’t text her as much as I usually do (which I will confess I am a bad text-er and it is not unusual for me to take 30+ minutes to respond to a message. This is something I’ve tried to get better at but I prefer to live without a phone in my lap all of the time). Regardless, I took a long time to respond to her and she was very upset. When I messaged her and called her she was crying and thought I was angry with her. I told her I was not, I was busy, that I was sorry. Fast-forward, I got back home and I noticed a couple of cuts on her thigh. I asked her about them and she denied it at first but eventually after prying at her she told me that she cut herself and that it was because she was feeling sad and didn’t know what to do when I wasn’t responding to her. Also, she has scars on her thighs which I noticed before but I had no idea what they were. I told her parents even though she told me not to, and they were worried. They told her she needed to talk to someone, it’s been a couple weeks since then but seems like nothing is coming from that. 

I spend lots of time with my girlfriend. The past three days I was at her house for 5 hours or more hanging out. Today I decided to spend time with a friend of mine and because I’m spending time with someone face to face, I rarely take out my phone to check it (it’s rude). Well I didn’t answer her for a long time and she got upset. She asks to talk to me and of course I tell my friend that I need to talk with my girlfriend and leave. Get to the house and she tells me that she is sad because of the limited time we have left before we leave. That she’s kind of jealous over me spending time with even my friends. And that she doesn’t want to sound clingy, but that I am what makes her happy and that when I’m not with her she is sad. 

I care a lot about my girlfriend, I want her to be happy, and I’m worried about her going to college and leaving me. I don’t want her to end up hurting herself or something even worse I really don’t know. But I feel trapped in this relationship for the same reasons. She makes me happy and I enjoy spending time with her but if I can’t even hang out with my friends that’s a lot to ask. I’m dealing with issues of my own and I can’t devote all of my time to her and even if I do that’s a short term solution to a problem looming over us in the next couple months. I don’t know what to do. I want to be in a relationship with her and spend time until we leave for college. I want to be able to spend time with my friends. I want her to be happy. But right now this isn’t healthy for me or her. I think she needs to talk to a therapist but she doesn’t want to. I guess in conclusion, how do I make my girlfriend happy and mentally healthy, make myself happy, and what am I supposed to do when we leave for college? 

Sorry for all of the rambling. Thank you for the help if you read through all of this",02Jul2019,2

285,"Won’t explain the whole story in detail but basically ex best friend and I argued and “broke up” because she tried flirting with a guy I knew would hurt her and I tried to talk her out of it. She told me I was being controlling while I was just trying to care about her yada yada. She pulled her worst on me, attacked every personal thing she knew about me including my trauma from bad experiences. Overall, really just was a shit person to me then told me to fuck off and that she didn’t want to be friends. 

We didn’t talk for months besides an argument or two until now. She texted me at midnight saying how she hoped I was okay and that she missed hanging out with my boyfriend and I (something we did a lot but at the end of our friendship I became aware that her intentions with my boyfriend weren’t good or friendly)   She apologized and said she wouldn’t stop apologizing and then said she hoped we could eventually be on good terms with each other. And I honestly don’t know how to react. I dreamed of the day she would turn around and realize how and she fucked up but now that it’s here, I’m just confused and anxious. 

Now that she’s hanging out with new friends that drink so chances are she was drunk/high when sending that so idk even know if it’s honest. I heard up until literally two days ago that she was still making up lies about me and trying to ruin my friendships with other people. She also tried some sketchy things in order to get alone with my boyfriend, something that I was not comfortable with at all. She ended up twisting this as if I was controlling him when in reality I asked him to avoid her because she made me extremely anxious when around him. He completely understood and agreed. 

I don’t know what to say back to her. I’m sad the relationship ended and I’ve been thinking about old memories with her. But also she constantly gaslighted me, took things from under me, went behind my back, etc the entire friendship. I’m in class with her so I have to see her everyday so I have to be civil. I just don’t know if I should be acquaintances with her, be friendly with her, or give the whole friendship a try.

306,"I think I've done it. Adulting has officially hit me.

So every Tuesday, my mother who's now on her way to elderly, and I were going to the cinemas because all senior citizens and people with disabilities don't have to pay at all to watch a movie. And first time I did this was around the last few weeks of summer. Now when I was a child, I never went to the cinemas at all. So this is a really positive thing for me, as I can go to the cinemas and watch as many as I want because I don't have to pay for the tickets every Tuesday. That's how I watched Detective Pikachu, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and Aladdin. 

Until school hit and things went downhill from there. 

For the first week until now, I managed my time crucially so that I can finally watch another movie. I am dying to watch Toy Story 4 and Far From Home, and am super excited to watch them, because I can finally watch a movie that I wanted to watch after Detective Pikachu. And it's usually at home where my excitement comes to it's peak, where it all comes crashing down. 

If anyone wonders why I can't just go myself, my aging mom is too paranoid for her own good, and it'll be one of the few times we spent time together not arguing or anything. So when she told me I can't come, everything feels like it's wasted for nothing. I am currently lightly drunk as I'm on the breaking point, and I am currently reworking all of my life choices for the future.

I always tell myself that when adulting strikes, I will embrace it, but after this I am in full on denial on it. But I know I'll have to. So eventually I convinced myself to just kill happiness altogether along with the other emotions I don't need because I'm an alexythymic fuck due to Asperger's, and ask how to kill the child inside me who's utterly disappointed.

If anyone has advice on how to kill it properly, and accept the fact that I am now legally and everything-ly an adult now, that'll be great. I wouldn't accept answers like ""just accept it"" or ""suck it up"" because that's what my toxic aunt will tell me when I told them about this. Talk about supportive.",02Jul2019,1

I usually have a weird fear of windows and unlocked doors that I can't explain at night, so I closed the blinds to the back door while her phone was ringing, then got this really bad gut feeling when the voicemail sent and double checked to make sure the front door was locked.

When I turned around, looking a little shaken, my sister asked me if I got that feeling too. She rarely ever shows fear or paranoia, but she got that feeling too, which freaked me out. 

Neither of us are willing to approach the front door anymore, and I'm currently hiding from view of all windows and peepholes while still able to keep an eye on my less-anxious-but-still-paranoid sister.

308,"So two weeks ago one of my friends had a party. While I was there, I recall that the guy that I spoke to a few years back is very close to my friend so I had asked her which guy is the one I spoke to over Snapchat. After introducing us, later that night we sent random snaps to each other and it had continued days after and that’s when I shared my phone number with him and we began talking talking. It’s clear that he’s interested in me but I don’t know if my confidence level is high enough to even be in any sort of relationship. Not to mention the fact that he just got out of a relationship maybe over two months ago. Oh, and also he lives about over an hour away from me. 

Even though I’ve enjoyed our conversations, there’s not really much to talk about and he’s been annoying me recently and I’m not sure if it’s me or him because whenever he tries to text me I sort of just leave him on delivered for a while like I’m just not in the mood to talk to him whatsoever. It could be the fact that he tries talking to me like every single second of the day but I don’t know to be honest. In addition, he had also played the guitar and sang me a song last week which made me feel a certain way but I don’t know how to describe it (not a bad way). I don’t know what has changed after a week of talking and even if anything were to happen, I know it’s possible to meet up once in a while but I don’t know how to long distance if I’m already tired of talking to him? 

A few days ago my friend told me that all of their church friends know (they’ve known each other since they were very young) and so I’d asked him why he’s mentioning me to other people and he said he doesn’t know and that he isn’t sure about telling his parents yet because they like to talk a lot. I was just confused as to why he’d need to tell his parents about me. This might seem a bit confusing but my friend told me he likes me and she asked me what I feel about it and I never gave her a proper answer so he wouldn’t know I might or might not like him back. 

Am I crazy? I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m asking for because I’m really confused in this situation and I don’t know if I should cut him off or continue to talk to him and see where things might go.

ALSO, he gave me an exact date as to when him and his ex broke up, am I in the wrong to think that’s weird?",02Jul2019,1

312,"Hello everyone,

I am an EU student, took a gap year, and I have an offer for Economics from UCL (university college london) and an offer for Econometrics and Operational Research from University of Amsterdam. 

I like the idea of attending UCL because of its reputation and the fact that it's  a top-tier university and I imagine it will give me a better head start in terms of employability. I'm also excited to attend a university that seems to have a more active student life and societies and etc. However, at the same time, I don't really like the idea of living and working in London because it seems like the corporate world and life in general is rather stressful there. 

Now, when it comes to the Netherlands, I feel like I might enjoy my day to day life there more especially if i were to consider it long term( 5-10+years).  I find life there to be more laid back and offer a better standard of living. Also, I think( but I'm not sure) that having a stronger quantitative background in econometrics should give me some pretty solid career opportunities as well. I plan on being dedicated to my studies and building up my career regardless of my university choice, I just think I'd enjoy my life better in the NL. 

However, I am having some doubts and feeling some remorse at the idea of giving up studying at  UCL because of how prestigious it is. I'm scared I might be throwing a valuable opportunity down the drain. When I look at rankings and see that UCL is 8th in the world and UvA is 62nd, I can't help but fear that I am taking the wrong choice.

315,"Hello r/advice,

I'm using a throwaway account, but I don't think it'll matter too much in this case..

This happened just a few hours ago.

Former friend = R

To get to the point, no fluff or anything. I've been a really shitty person towards a former friend of mine, who cut contact off with over a month ago. I've had time to reflect on what I've done to R, and I wanted to see if it was possible to try and reconnect as friends. He's blocked on every game platform we both used, so stupidly, I make a new account and pretend to be someone else, this was really stupid of me, even though I did it twice.. I'm caught, twice.. And I try my best to explain to R that I'm working on getting better, but there were two other in this conversation via Discord and these two people are just I'm full of bullshit, and the likes. I was being as genuine as I could, but it didn't help that I was just being barked at by two other people. One of the other people threatened to get police involved and say I'm stalking, which I wasn't doing, so I backed down and I kept on getting barked at by the two other people.. I was kicked from the conversation, and I came out of that ordeal feeling like the worst piece of garbage ever.. I was ashamed at myself.. I was disgusted by myself.. I don't know if what I did was right, but it sure didn't feel like it afterwards.. 

I'm a toxic person, aswell as I was called abusive by the two people barking at me. 
I want to not be toxic or abusive, even I have no clue how I was abusive in the first place. How do I go about cleansing myself from this type of behaviour, so I don't end doing something like this again without realizing it? I want be R's friend again, but I know that the chances of that happening are slim to none. I thought I was doing better, but I'm not sure now..

I don't know what to do and I'm crying silently as I write this on mobile..",02Jul2019,3

323,"My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years (we are long distance)  and for two of those he’s worked in a retail warehouse. I don’t remember a time when he enjoyed his job - it’s very rare he comes home and says “Work was alright today.”  I’m currently a student, about to go into my final year and afterwards go out and get the job of my dreams, I’ve worked super hard to get here because that’s how I feel you achieve things in life. The issue I have is not what his job is but the fact he dislikes it and continuously complains about it - if he loved his job and wanted to work himself up and had a drive to do so, I’d have no complaints but he has no motivation to search for another job or enter into a career he adores, he’s mentioned the police and the army but is always focusing on the negatives of these other jobs. Although he always talks about wanting to achieve something career wise. It’s very draining and I’ve tried to listen, be sympathetic and even take the approach of “why don’t you search for something else?” But it’s to no avail. He wishes to start a family but in no way are either of us in that position and he knows this. I don’t work as I’m a full time student and we live 7 hours apart. We’re both only 21 and I want to reach my career goals and be financially stable before I think of having any children.

325,"CW: sexual abuse (duh).

Just to clarify, I've already talked about this with my psychologist. I just want to know whether other people feel like it was or wasn't, because I'm not sure if my feelings are justified. 

So a couple of weeks ago, I (21, F, 5 ft 5 &amp; a bit chubby) got pretty drunk at a gig with some friends of mine. It was a lot of fun and in a safe environment, because it wasn't at the bar my ex frequents. After a few drinks my friends decided they wanted to go to said bar anyway, even though I had clearly expressed I wasn't very comfortable going there knowing my ex (21, M, 6 ft 5 &amp; buff af) was going to be there )he is there almost every single day).

But alas, I went anyway. It was a lot better than I had expected, I got to catch up with some friends I hadn't seen in a while due to the break up and I continued to drink throughout the night. Fast forward a couple of hours and I'm outside of a club. I just got harassed by a guy, was too intoxicated to get home safely and was looking for a safe place to go. One of my friends says he is going to have an after party, so I figured that would be my best option. It was not.

My ex was there. In my drunk state I had jokingly slapped his ass, which looking back was a stupid idea but I would have done that to any of my other guy friends as well (they are okay with it, I've asked). As soon as everyone sat down, we started talking. I wanted to apologize for the things I had done in the weeks prior (had a mental breakdown in front of him, kissed someone else, etc) and talk about a festival we were both going to, because I was uncomfortable with the idea of camping right next to him. As soon as we started talking, I started crying. I just couldn't help myself. So he decided to take me aside and talk to me. In a bedroom.

That should have been red flag number one, but at the time I was too intoxicated to notice. We started talking about everything that happened in the past few weeks and he comforted me, something I really needed at the time. But comforting soon turned into kissing. At first, I was okay with this. I was very drunk, still somewhat attracted to him and just wanted to feel loved instead of miserable. But then he pulled my panties down.

What happened next is all a bit of a blur. It all happened so fast, I can barely remember. He was still kissing me, which I was okay with at the time, but after he took off my panties he immediately started to have sex with me. I didn't do anything to stop it. I knew in the moment that I didn't want him to, but I didn't say it. I just let it happen. He was done within a few minutes. We got up, said goodbye to our friends and walked outside.

As soon as I wanted outside, I sobered up a bit.  I realized what had just happened and started freaking out. I had just started dating someone else and felt like my life was about to fall apart. My ex just kept telling me it happened for a reason &amp; that obviously, I still loved him (texted that a couple of times afterwards as well). I wanted to go home asap. I said goodbye, he kissed me and I walked home.

I don't know how to feel. I feel incredibly stupid for even putting myself in that situation, for being so oblivious to his intentions and for kissing him back. However, I also feel really angry and sad. I was incredibly drunk, possibly even drugged by the dude that kept harassing me. I was extremely vulnerable as I had just cried for the past 10/15 minutes. I simply wasn't able to give consent, even if I wanted to have sex with him. 

I know he will never admit what he did was wrong. He takes too much pride in his 'loyal' and 'faithful' identity that he claims to have and will definitely manipulate himself and others into thinking that it was all mutual. It was not. I just feel like I'm going crazy and that it's all my fault. I don't know whether I'm even allowed to be angry.  I don't want to press charges or anything. I just want some peace of mind. 

TL;DR: Ex had sex with me while I was incredibly drunk, possibly drugged, emotionally unstable and vulnerable. I didn't say no and allowed it to happen. Am I just stupid for letting it happen or is he an asshole for taking advantage of me?",02Jul2019,1

I have also tried making a new email account with the same username but says an account with this username already exists

327,"So I was at a party and we were all very drunk. 
We decided to play strip never have I ever (never have I ever but when you have you take off an item of clothing and take a drink).
Obviously we all ended up nude, it wasn’t sexual or anything like that, we used it as a trust exercise kind of.

Here’s the part where advice is needed:
One of the people, let’s call them Dave, thought it would be a good idea to take a photo. They took a selfie with us all, and one of our friends, let’s call her Sarah, had her whole boob exposed. 
We all agreed we would never talk about this again and that no one was ever gonna find out.
Dave posted the photo on Instagram (a private account). None of us knew until at least a few days later.
At school on Monday it turned out that the whole year knew and loads of people had screenshots of this photo. 
We are all humiliated, and I don’t know whether to feel disappointed or upset with this.
Two of the staff at school talked to us about this and advised us to talk to Dave and say we won’t be friends anymore if anything like this happens again.

339,Hi everyone im a sufferer of dyshidrotic eczema and it's just spread to my feet I was wondering if people had any tips or help to relieve the pain and how to get rid of it,02Jul2019,1
341,"Ok, so this a kinda silly and unjustified concern, but I want it off my chest.
 A few months ago, a dude I occasionally chatted with in the bus said he was interested in me and asked if he could get to know me more. I said sure and there we go.
 He is autistic. He never explicitly said that but he is always suddenly interested in any movie or TV show with autistic characters. Plus, he randomly mentions it in conversations. Not only that but I was stalking his Facebook and ended up finding his mom's profile where she posts a lot about autism and having an autistic son. We're both 22. He said is a virgin and had never kissed. I'm ok with all this. He's a really cool, mature and interesting guy. We think alike on many topics and have a lot of hobbies in common. I'd never guess he was autistic and virgin to be honest. He doesn't look like that (ok, I know I'm stereotyping)
 Anyway, something that had always bothered me is how much of a ""family guy"" he is. Not really in a weird way, but he says he will always defend his family. Family is above everything, he loves them to death, etc. Since my family is just plain toxic, and I hate and have cut off pretty much everyone, I assumed that's just how the world is and I'm just problematic.
 But there are a few notes:
- He call his mom ""mommy"". As in ""mommy, can HablaConmigoBebe come over?""
- He said he will occasionally massage his mom's feet when she comes back from work
- He said he really likes to show affection and that he is used to it, so it's normal for him to just randomly hugs/kiss his mom during the day.
Now, this is not wrong. It's just really weird for me because I'm not used to physical contact or affection of any kind. But:
- He lives alone with his mom (dad and brother moved to another city where brother is working)
- Once I asked him what was his favorite type of porn and his first answer was ""hmm, well, I definitely don't like MILF"", then started listing what he liked. It was so random. Why the fuck that was the first thing on his mind?
- This Saturday I saw his mom for the first time and she is, how can I say, a gorgeous lady who aged too well. And that is terribly weird because it gave me such a strong incestuous porn vibe. I don't know. I know my assumptions aren't his fault, but, man, seeing a grown up guy like that living alone with that woman just doesn't look like something that would work, you know?

The last straw for my concerns happened yesterday. I told him my family is really fucked up, just a bunch of scammers, thieves, cartel members, teen moms and stuff and we were chatting about it. In our language ""fucking"" can mean both sex and stab people's back. So, he was telling me how he thinks being a c*nt to relatives is wrong. Then he says something like ""fucking your relatives like that is absurd, etc"" in a voice tone that indicates a double meaning. I said ""I think fucking your relatives the other way is worse"". He disagreed, mentioned moral freedom, ""who are we to judge"", things like that. I kinda agree that what people do with their own lives is none of my business if they're not harming anyone. But then he mentioned parent/offspring incest. I personally think this is really wrong, because the child will always be harmed. Like, the kid would have to be conditioned to want a relationship with their parent. That goes into pedophilia too. There's the problem of an authority figure imposing that ""lifestyle"", someone you depend on. I told him this. That's when he turns to me and says ""what if it's the kid who loves the parent and wants a relationship with them?"". I internally dropped my chin and was like ""hold up, what the actual fuck???????"". But I kept quiet. Now I don't know what to think.

Like, I'm not sure if he is just a momma's boy or if there's something else going. His mom seems very overprotective. He told me that she indeed was when he was younger. I once asked him if I could go to his place. He said he had to ask her first and she said no. He obeys pretty much everything she says. When I saw her I didn't introduce myself or anything, just looked from far away. Later I asked him if he told her who I was. He said he did but she said nothing and barely noticed me. I almost feel she was just ignoring me. I wonder if this is just a fear of losing their ""precious son"" some mom's have which may cause some serious jealous in her or if it's some Oedipus complex.

Am I overreacting?",02Jul2019,12
343,"I am a male in my forties and I cannot stop thinking about having sex with strange men. I have been single for some 15 years now.

I have also been to parties where they strip you naked and tie your hands together and then put a hood over your head. Then they lead you out into a room where anyone can do what ever they like to you. I have had sex with upto 5 men at any one time before. These parties happen every two weeks and the closer it gets to the time, the more I cannot stop thinking about it. Does this make me a sex addict or just a pervert.

344,"Alright so I've asked for help here once before and was prompted to pull my pants up... 

Now it's been a few years and I've been working on gaining passive income for myself. Right now things are as rocky as they've ever been for my living situation. I'm not entirely sure what to do and frankly there isn't anyone to talk to about it with. I've gone to get public assistance and that didnt work. Idr why... 

There's also legal issues I have that tie me up and make it so its difficult to leave immediately so if I've got to go there's gonna be a bit of a hold up. A year ago I lost everything on account of my Fathers lack of communication which could have made it so everything lost could be retained. I know I don't need to be anyone's burden any longer and frankly my fam doesn't understand what to do about my personal underlying issues. I was evicted after my father neglected to pay rent for a few years meanwhile he's just been collecting checks and taking vacations while I remained home working and trying to figure out what exactly to do and how to come up with the funds to bring these actions to fruition. He had a girlfriend that I stayed with last summer who was fed up with him after he basically had another child without anyone's knowledge in the family. There i stayed for two months burning through savings and looking for work. I finally found a job only to get sent to jail for a gross exaggeration of charges which I'm still doing community service for. 

Fast forward to now I've eliminated most of my bad habits. Pushed away from being socially anxious though not entirely and learned a fair bit of personal finance. 

But I notice I have more to get done as I knock each thing down as I believe I've been neglected since I moved in with the man around 15 years ago.

I have dental work that needs to get done, therapy to be attended to and medical issues that I still ignore because of the perceived negligence in the past. I don't know what to do... both sides of my family are busy with their own lives and the few I can speak to aren't truthfully to be trusted in the least. 

Tl;dr
Help me help you was a lie and everything has actually fallen through the cracks. 
I've tried to push for things on my own but unforeseen events got in the way... the ship is sinking but I can swim

345,"27F. I drank excessively and went out without a care in my heart or head and cheated throughout my freshman year in college. I was reckless.

We marry [19] at the time and I confess 3.5 years later. When I confessed, he ended up confessing things from high school and other encounters within the recent years. It’s like we both loss ourselves and our sanity. He said he cheated because he knew I did anyways. I had been denying it since it happened and was too coward to tell him before exchanging vows. Evil, I know. 

We tried to work it out on and off. He started to express his disappointment with me at any moment he so chose. Name calling and silent treatments came in heavy. I started to feel crazy, started questioning who I was and if I was some physcopath! Whatever he told me about myself is what I believed. I thought I could just take, because I deserved after doing what I did. When we separated, we talked some times which was damaging. I’d wake up crying, go to sleep crying and even got down to 98lbs. 

The woman I am now despises the person I used to be. I cheated, so I know I don’t deserve sympathy, but how can I love myself again? I’ve realized a lot of this was from a weak relationship with my father, and how I grew up with very unhealthy attachment styles. Now it’s like I obsess over psychology and narcissistic behaviors still trying to figure out if I was one, or if I created one. So I’m very familiar with psychology terms.

This has truly affected the way I communicate. I feel like I don’t understand or know how to connect with others. I’ve become too literal. I feel like it messed up my comprehension. I feel phony. I feel like it’s a cloud over my head. I worry about a new circle of people knowing I was married, and that the “new me” may contradict who I am now. It’s like I think the world already knows how much I messed up and I’m just trying to hide it. I struggle with being open, so instead I don’t show who I am (I’m tired of hiding behind this).

359,"I had been with my ex for nearly 4 years. I raised her son as if her were my own since he was 3. his real father was an abusive piece of shit, so I gladly took over the role as his father. Eventually he started calling me ""Dad"". I never asked him to, but he wanted to and it made me proud. 

My ex split up with me a month ago now. She said it was because I said no to another baby, I didn't say no I said ""not yet"" because of her mental health. She had recently been diagnosed with Psychosis and our flat was way to small for a baby. At first I wasn't allowed to see the little boy again, because she said it would be easier. But she changed her mind after a week of no contact, I suspect because she needs someone to look after him at weekends while she works as she cannot afford childcare. 

Last Monday she was threatening suicide, so I left work and ran all the way to her flat. she admitted to have been cheating on me while we were together and said that was the real reason she left me. I told her I just wanted her to be happy so I left on good terms after talking her down from suicide.

She is seen by a therapist on a daily basis now.

I don't know what to do.
The little boy wants me to be his dad but I have no legal attachment to him. I've raised him for 4 years, I taught him to swim and how to ride a bike. We spent all our free time together, he was my son.

He's always felt like mine. But on sunday he said ""mum says I'm getting a new dad soon"".
Pretty sure I'll never see him again once she settles down with her new partner.

360,"(I'm going to keep this as neutral as possible. Sorry if this should be posted in r/Relationships.)

To start off, I'm currently in a relationship. This is going to sound REALLY stupid and dumb, but I have a crush on one of my co-workers. We've ended up telling each other how we feel, apparently which you're not supposed to do especially if you're in a relationship, and I realize that. My co-worker is amazing, I like them a ton, even though they're still my best friend and I don't think I'd change that for the world. My co-worker likes me back, but I've talked with my significant other about this...

My significant other is understanding. They aren't mad or upset with me that I told my crush how I felt, and they realize that it's easy to develop these feelings, even though you are or are not in a relationship with someone else at the time, so they get why I'm emotionally conflicted. I told my significant other that I love them, and they've told me that they love me too, whatever decision I make will please them as long as I'm happy, and they'll still be my best friend. My crush also said that they'll be happy with whatever decision I make, as long as I'm happy. They're both so awesome, I just...

I'm so conflicted on what to do, but I've decided to stay with my significant other for the time being, considering that we're basically testing the waters before I even met my co-worker and got to know them like I have. I've told my co-worker that no matter what happens, they'll always be my closest friend, as they've said the same to me. But it feels off... they don't respond like they used to. Is that normal, or did I just break their heart?? I feel like utter shit right now, and I feel like a terrible person for hurting them... what the Hell do I do?",02Jul2019,1

363,"Just being clear I did post about this situation yesterday, but I
didn't ask a specific question and I think this reflects the
situation better.

Over my senior year of high school I became good friends with a
girl from some of my classes(I'm a guy just to be clear). She is
honestly the friend I have that I value the most, but
unfortunately for me school is now out and I have graduated and
might not ever see her again. On one of the last days I saw her
she asked to be invited to my grad party, so I sent her an invite
as an Instagram dm. Well my party was a few days and she came
and that was the highlight of my day. We talked for about half an
hour (and accidentally made my family think she's my girlfriend
or something), and she seamed glad to see me. After the party I
opened the card she gave me and she wrote a nice message
about how she was glad to know me and will miss me. I really
miss her and I don't want this to be the end of our friendship. We
never hung out outside of school and she has a boyfriend I can
barely claim to have met, so I can't exactly ask her to meet up,
but I was thinking of sending her a message every once in a
while just to stay in contact, or something else along those lines.
The only problem is I don't know quite how to go about this. I
don't want to be weird, and we haven't messaged each other
casually before, only when we had some legitimate semi
important thing to say. I might be getting a job soon and if I do
I'd like to tell her. I want to seem casual and not like I'm
hitting on her, and I don't want to be annoying; I'm also known
for being really quiet and reserved both online and in person, so
I'm worried it might also be weird for me to do something so ""out
of character"" for me.

Any and all advice is appreciated, even if it isn't fun to hear.
Thanks in advance.",02Jul2019,1

Why I feel like shit: About a week ago I discovered a painful lump on my lady parts. I wasn’t concerned at first but when it became so painful that walking and sitting became difficult I did research and found that I had a bartholin cyst. Apparently only 2% of woman will have them (lucky me) and they never really “go away” without surgery. Anyways, after about 3 days i thought it took care of itself and I was in much less pain if any. Then, it came back. I was at work last Thursday and had to leave to go to urgent care. My gynecologist is located 2 hours from me because I moved recently. I have an upcoming appt so I just wanted to see if everything was going to be ok until then.

I went to urgent care and the doctor said she wasn’t going to try to physically take care of it (thank god) and prescribed me antibiotics. So I’ve been on those, and between them and my birth control I am SO nauseous. I also have a really bad head ache. On top of it all I had my upcoming gynecologist appt for my ovarian cysts which I believe have made a comeback. I had surgery to drain one about 2 years ago and currently I am in a lot of pain on my right side from one. 

Sorry that’s all pretty nasty and maybe tmi, but I can’t exactly tell my male boss exactly what’s going on so I feel awful not being at work for it.

376,"I know what the simple answer is “find a new place to live”. Not that easy though. 

I had to take on my great grandmothers cat 2 years ago after she went to nursing home from assisted living. She had been with her for almost 13 years. No one else in my family would take her and so I took her in so my grandmother would know she was taken care of. Older cats rarely get adopted and i could not see her go to a shelter to die. Grandmother died a few months later.

Fast forward a year later and I meet my boyfriend who lived out of state. After a long distance relationship I decided it was time for me to move to his area as it was where we want to settle down. Back in March we were approached by the owners (and friends/next door neighbors) of this home to see if we would be interested in renting a cottage they purchased in our waterfront community that they would be doing extensive renovations to. We immediately accepted as my boyfriends home now was only temporary as it is too small for the both of us. We were ecstatic that we would be getting a beautiful new place on the water to live in until our own piece of property here came up, as with me just settling in here we are not ready to buy yet. Move in was slated for May 1.

Last few weeks of April we are told the house will not be ready and it would be end of May. Thats fine, it’s worth the wait and we will still be close by (4 doors down). We move all of my stuff into a storage unit and I move in temporarily at his cottage. Still on the water, beautiful place, no biggie. We can do the tiny house thing for some of the summer. 

End of May rolls around “it’s going to be mid June”. June rolls around “we’re thinking end of June”.
That doesn’t happen. Finally we get the notice that July 15 is our day. I’m not mad about that what we are getting is going to be worth it and required extensive work. And the almost finished project is truly gorgeous. This entire time they knew about the cat.

I had been asking for a lease to review for many weeks now and we finally get it yesterday. After review I ask what the pet deposit would be for the cat as she had mistakenly checked no pets on the lease. We get an email back “no cats allowed, you will have to find a solution for it before move in, no exceptions”. 

We are blown away. This entire time they knew the situation and after months of waiting and passing up multiple other rental opportunities they throw us this curveball. I should not have to “find a solution” in two weeks for my pet! We have also been putting off moving my boyfriends father closer to us until after we were done moving, as he had a stroke a few years ago and now needs to live closer to us so we can care for him. My thought also eventually was to let the cat live with him as a companion and let her bring him happiness as she did my grandmother. 

I will finish this by saying in our area it’s extremely hard to come by rentals and especially those in our price range. Nothing would compare to the quality of home and neighborhood that we would get with this house. My boyfriend grew up here and does not want to leave and I have fallen in love with it as well. It would break my heart to have to live somewhere else. However I feel as though I’m being asking to choose between finally having a home or continuing my commitment to care for the cat, and that’s just not fair. Advice?",02Jul2019,1

I'm attracted to girls since 4th grade and I've never been in a romantic relationship. Some of you may laugh, but I do have feelings for the opposite sex even if I'm young. I wish I could maintain a healthy relationship with a girl and feel loved and appreciated, and love and appreciate my couple too.

382,"Issues like this or at least similar to this is probably posted here daily, but I just have a need to express my thoughts and hopefully get some good advice on the way.

The main issue: I've been in love with this girl for about 6 months (I've known her for more than a year though). However, I know she is not romantically interested in me, since I actually told her about my feelings way back in February and thus learned they were not reciprocal. I really like this girl though, as person -- we share a lot of interests and ideas, which is something that up until recently has been a rare thing in my life. After about 3-4 months of no contact, we started talking and hanging out again. In the beginning, I thought my feelings of romance had come to an end, which would enable us to just be friends (something I actually really, really want to be the case). However, as time went by and after a week of really intense get-togethers -- I think we met on 4 different occasions in a week -- I understood that I still have feelings for this girl. I'm even lovesick, one could say, since I think about her a lot of the time when I'm alone, anxious that I might have done something to ""fuck our friendship up"". Since I know that there is no possible chance of us engaging romantically, I'm a bit in the doldrums at the moment. To make matters worse (or possible better, I don't even know anymore), we will both move to different cities in August to pursue our studies, which means that we will not be able to see each other remotely as often as before -- pretty much only during the holidays or the summers, if we both are home. I really wish to keep being friends with her, since we have so much in common and have good time together; however, I understand that I can't keep feeling this way if I want to be friends with her. It wouldn't be good to either me or her. Do you have any advice on how I could proceed from here?",02Jul2019,1
383,"I would like to start off by apologizing for the length and for any spelling errors. I have never made a reddit post like this before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (17F) have been with my boyfriend (17M) for a year now. We loved each other with everything we had and were very devoted to each other. However things have recently turned sour. 

He has a traumatic past and his family dynamic is not so great. In order to cope with this he consistently smoked weed in the first few months of our relationship. All he ever thought about was the next time he could be high. Together we worked hard to fix it. Eventually he learned that the best way to cope is by addressing problems head on and talking about whats going on with someone who cares about him. This was difficult for him because he said he had never really opened up to anyone before.

Everything after that was pretty good. He still smoked recreationally. This was completely fine in my eyes as he smoked nowhere near the amount he used to, and he only smoked socially with friends. We talked about our personal problems with each other. I had complete faith and trust in him. He was sweet, kind, and always treated me with respect. We had an argument here or there. He had anger issues as a kid so sometimes these arguments would lead him to hurt himself or break things. As a kid he was prescribed medicine for it but he chose not to take it as it made him feel like a zombie. Luckily this was another thing we worked on and fixed. Whenever something was going wrong he started taking breathers and only continued to act or talk when he was calmed down. 

We both got jealous when one of us interacted with people of the other gender. I just thought that was a part of regular teenage love and it never raised any problems. I really want to emphasize that through this time period and all the years I've known him before he was a sweet kid. He was extremely attached to me as I was to him. He told me often that he wouldn't be the same person without me as we both actively tried to better each other. He started reconnecting with his step dad and brother again because he really missed them. He was very nervous to do this but he eventually did.

Everything changed for the worst in the past three weeks. I did not expect things to get worse at all as he has been getting extremely close with his step-dad and brother again which he always deeply wished for. He has been controlling and acting strange. Every time I brought up things that upset me he started to yell at me, which is something he's never done before (I would be upset about things such as him not actively searching for a job, not following the same rules that he had set for me in the relationship, and repeatedly asking me to hang out when I told him I wanted some alone time).  He's lying to me about a lot of things. He has been thinking about suicide. He's made very strict rules for me. He has been giving me a hard time about hanging out with my friends because I could be hanging out with him instead. He is extremely jealous over anyone that interacts with me or takes up my time  (boy or girl).  He had an episode where he started cursing at his Mom, telling her he hates her, and ripped up every bible in the house. None of this is how he normally acts except for the jealousy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago I gave him an ultimatum.

My boss is firing employees and I really wanted to keep this job . I asked my boyfriend the day this occurred not to come into the store while I was working because that isn't something my boss would like to see. We were having a mild argument over text when I came into my shift and I had to put my phone down as the store got busy with customers. All the sudden he storms into the back and yells at me for not answering him. I told him to leave immediately and that he was being extremely disrespectful by coming in when I specifically told him not to. Once he realized how much him  ignoring my request had hurt me he began to cry and started climbing a ladder with a rope telling me he was going to kill himself because all he ever does is hurt me. I did everything to physically restrain him but I couldn't stop him. I immediately screamed for my coworkers to come help me and he ran out of the store immediately. 

I could not leave him alone in this mental state, as he has been close to committing suicide before. So I followed him outside and refused to leave his side, as he was still crying and screaming. I offered to let him sit in the back the entirety of my shift so I could keep an eye on him, but he refused to go back inside because he didn't want to see my coworkers. I had to text my boss I was leaving unexpectedly and he was very angry with me. My job may or may not be at risk now. When I got into the car I started crying and told him that we were either going to my house to talk to my parents, his house to talk to his parents, or the hospital. I was crying to him and I explained that I'm still a kid too and I don't know how to handle any of this alone. He made me pull over and got out of the car. After crying, begging, and walking around a field for 20 minutes I finally got him back in my car, but only if we could talk one on one with no one else. At this point I was extremely frustrated. I felt as if he was trying to punish and scare me because he was embarrassed to see my coworkers after they heard me frantically yelling about him committing suicide, and he didn't want to speak with anyone else who could help him. I felt in over my head. I told him that if he didn't stop acting the way he has been acting I would have to stop seeing him. But if he was willing to work on his attitude or try to see a therapist I would gladly be there to support him. I really did not want to end things with him but these past three weeks have drained me of all my happiness and energy and at some point I need to make sure I am taking care of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is what happened yesterday:

I was still hurt by all the events that had unfolded but I still went to go see him. He made me some theraflu because I haven't been feeing well. I asked him if it would make me too sleepy to drive, because I had never taken Nightime Theraflu before. He assured me it would be okay. When I  asked him why it was blue he told me that it was the usual color of Theraflu Nighttime. I didn't second guess it. 30 minutes later I have more energy than I have had in days. I felt like I was on adderall. I asked him if he had put some in there since he is prescribed to it. He told me ""no"". We get to our destination and he lets me use his phone to search something. I open safari and see the google search ""How to dissolve adderall in water"" What???? After making a lame excuse he finally admits to it. He claims he did it because I was concerned about becoming drowsy from the theraflu. That still didn't explain to me why he had to lie about it. I would have been fine with it if he had asked me first. Although I was very unsettled we continued on with our day and I tried to ignore it. I decided we would talk about it later. I face-timed him at night and told him how hurt I was that he drugged my tea, caused me to maybe lose my job, and all of his actions for the past 3 weeks. He tried starting an argument, but I just broke into tears because no argument could justify his actions. He started saying ""sorry"" over and over again. When I asked what he was sorry for to clarify that he knew what he did was wrong, he said ""I don't know. Whatever you were just talking about"" I broke up with him seconds after that and he hung up crying and screaming. I texted and called him a few times out of fear that he was going to hurt himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted one of his best friends, his brother, and his mom. They all completely agreed with me that something has been very wrong and he needs to go somewhere to get help immediately. I was supposed to go on vacation with them in two days and my boyfriend has said if I don't go he refuses to as well. We are all very scared to leave him alone, so I am considering going if he even wants to see me anymore. 

At the end of the day I care about this boy more than anything else in the world. I want to get to the bottom of what is happening, but is it worth risking my mental health? Am I being emotionally abused? Should I try and reach out to him or should I just block his number and forget he ever existed? What should I do if he reaches out to me first? No matter what happens between us I will continue to remain in close contact with his family to make sure that he is safe and getting whatever he needs from them. Whenever I tell them things like this they are very confidential and thank me for the information. I'm not trying to snitch on him at all. I seriously just want him to be safe and I need these people to know what's going on so they can watch over him. Even though I am hurt by him I still love him, care for him, and want him to do the best he can in life. I have no ill will towards him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I think this might be happening: 

\-I talked to his friends and apparently he's been doing more drugs such as adderall, codeine, and mushrooms. He is prescribed adderall so I'm not too worried about that, even though he does not take it daily as he is supposed to. I was upset about the codeine. It was prescribed to him as well but it was for a surgery he had recovered from a long time ago. I have been looking into mushrooms and apparently if you take them too often it is possible for your depression to worsen and has the ability to turn you into a different person (I'm sorry and please correct me if this is false I do not have much experience with this drug). His friends informed me that he had been taking them weekly with them. His brother also thinks that his actions could be resulted from drug use. 

\-I am leaving for college in September. While I am only an hour away this is something he has been dreading. He is in the grade below me and will be a senior

\-The fight with his mom (They seemed to have worked through it as they were talking normally yesterday. But I don't want to make any assumptions) She is calling me later to talk about things and it is clear that she loves him endlessly so I don't know why he has so much rage built up towards her. She even told me she is willing to break up with her boyfriend who she loves dearly if that'll make him happy again. 

\-I have been complaining and pushing the rules he has set for me because I feel they are too restricting.  I've been arguing with him about him not following the same rules he insists I follow. I have also been nagging him to get a job frequently so I don't have to pay for everything, 

\-A plethora of many unknown reasons

So after that relationship I quickly move on to someone to keep me stabilized instead of having multiple mental break downs 24/7 and all at once. Making that ""relationship"" actually a ""Dependership"". That person figures out Im only there with them because they are emotional and mental support, have a big argument then leaves me alone. I decide to have a new thing at life and focus on my studies and what not. I find new things I like, and Im enjoying my single life to the fullest. When out of nowhere I meet this guy and he ends up being my fated pair and I fall in love, we have our differences like every other couple does. But we make up in the end fairly quickly and easily. So here we are having a great time with a our lovey-dovey relationship for a short time when also out of nowhere, my half soul comes along and claims his love for me. I end up falling for both of them and have no clue what to do. Other people I have asked has just told me to cut them both off as fast as I can, but I love them both from the depths of my heart and soul. Both of them are unique and perfect in their own way and I love them, flaws and all. But when my fated pairs' parents find out he says he ""Needs a break"" so then I reluctantly agree and keep my distance for a little bit. Still waiting and hoping for him to come back and pick me up over his shoulder to carry me away. But then he does comes back but with a ""Welcome back Hunney Bunney, I miss you"". And my half soul knew about the break thing and ends up calling me his ""Girlfriend"". Now I dont know who Im 'Dating' or who Im with or who I love more. Im so confused and cant focus well. Im back and forth all the time, I do nothing so Im not classifying as cheating, but I dont know if my fated pair and I are still together or if he has broken everything. And I dont know if Im dating my half soul or not. Please help me make sense of my situation, Im so lost and confused😵😖😭",02Jul2019,1
386,"Let's start from the beginning. I've played soccer all my life, and for all my life it has been my main goal to try and become as good as I can, and hopefully one day, play as a professional. Because of this, my life has always been split between soccer and school, as my parents think that school is very important (so do I) and should be a priority. I think you should know more about me:

* I am 16 years old and in year 11.
* I recently returned from Spain after 6 months of training there.
* I also play for one of the best youth academies in my home country.
* Up until my visit to Spain, I also went to one of the best schools (academically) in my home country.

So as you can see, both these parts of my life are very full on, and it's required me to work extremely hard in both aspects. This resulted in me not having a social life for most of my high school years up until a couple months before I left for Spain when I started hanging out with my best friends and seeing this girl. Because of this, I think I developed quite a lot of issues and I never really felt truly happy, and it really showed because I was very content in those last couple of months before Spain.

Now this is the problem: obviously, since I was juggling between soccer and school, my grades at school were pretty average, especially as I started to train more and more as the years progressed. I was training every day and studying everyday and basically had no time to kick back and be a normal teen. This affected me a lot with my soccer because my body was exhausted and I was always mentally down. I wasn't energetic in training, I didn't have much motivation to train etc. but I still went out and did it. 

So last year when the season and year 10 ended, my family and I decided I should try soccer in Spain. Here I got to mostly concentrate on football. 6 months pass and I come back to my home country. I had had a good months break, chilling and having more fun than ever before. But the thing is, with the amount of money and effort my parents were putting into this overseas experience, the results were not showing because when I started training with my old team for the off season (seasons are different times in Spain and my home country), I performed poorly compared to what me and my family expected. Now we're thinking it may be best for me to stay here and go back to how it was previously, juggling between the two things as we are not financially rich. To be honest, I agreed with staying here at home and just continuing with what I was doing before Spain, but the past few weeks of training have lead me to absolutely detest playing soccer. And it isn't one of those ""overtraining loss of motivation"" episodes, because as I said, I had a great month to myself. I started getting truly depressed and questioned the purpose of life. Now it has gotten to the point where I just want to quit, and this is where I need your help.

While in Spain, one of my coaches told me that I have the potential to become a pro soccer player (of course with the gargantuan amount of sacrifice and work) and this may sound great, but let me tell you that there will be nothing that will help me gain any motivation to do that work. I have no more interest in playing this sport and becoming a professional athlete. I am a person who values the quote ""here for a good time, not a long time"" because I want to have the best possible experience. Basically, I want to do things in life that will not be possible as an athlete. Here is what I want to do:

* Quit soccer
* Focus and work my ass off at school
* Get a part time job to earn money
* Possible entrepreneurship after high school

I have already thought this through and there is basically nothing I can think of that will restore my motivation for soccer. I've thought of the sacrifices and the risk of pursuing this career and i've realised that the bad outweigh the good because at the end of the day, I don't even enjoy playing anymore. I used to go for runs, train by myself and do everything I could to become a better player, and now I literally cry because of the pressure of having to be consistent and show up every training session. I hate myself for it, and I don't want to continue down this path. I want to experience new things in my life, focus on my studies 100% for the first time, put time into my social life, and most importantly, actually feel happy with life. I know school is going to be very hard, but I'm ready for that challenge because I know it is something I will enjoy and I'm very motivated to go for it.

Now there are three things that I need advice on:

* What do you think about my decisions?

Obviously this is no Snickers vs Mars bar, this is a very big deal. I want the opinions of people who may have experienced this or something similar, or even any sort of identity crisis.

* How do I tell my parents that I want to stop playing soccer and pursue an academic career?

I know that if I go back to school and grind I can make up for half the year that I missed. However, my parents have spent countless amounts of money and time for my soccer, and I don't want to upset or disappoint them. My parents are very old-fashioned and extremely strict, and we rarely talk about big things like this. Secondly,

* Is there enough time to get my grades back up?

I have my end of school exams next year, and I want to get a very good mark so I can pursue a good career, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to achieve that, and I know that I have the ability to do so, however my opinion is not enough. The 6 months when I was in Spain were academically terrible. Input on this is not necessary but it would be very reassuring.

I'm very, very sorry that this read was so long but I just had to get this off my mind. If you read up to this point, may God bless you, and I would really like to hear your advice for my problems.

Tl;dr: pursue a career of soccer that is hard and would require huge sacrifice of life experiences and happiness with very slight chance of success or pursue a career of school that may not necessarily be as successful as soccer, but will allow me to enjoy life and do something that I love.

390,"Hey guys, I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for the formatting. Also, this is clearly a throwaway.

So, I'm a woman, and I'm pretty sure that I may have a UTI. Ever since last Wednesday (6 days ago/almost a week ago) I've been frequently urinating, usually a smaller amount than normal at a time, it BURNS when I'm urinating, and I've noticed an awful rotten fish or ammonia type of scent about 4 or 5 times now (not every single time that I've urinated in the past 6 days).

My discharge has seemed fairly normal, so that isn't a huge cause for concern.

My biggest issue right now is that the burning sensation has been lasting longer than just after urinating. Since this morning it's been a constant burning pain and it brought me close to tears when I was actually urinating.

I'm sure it's just an easily treatable UTI, my biggest issue is that I have to leave for work in ~3 hours, but that's the average wait time at clinics near me. I was considering going to the emergency room when the burning was at it's worst, but I have a high pain tolerance and the extreme pain isn't a constant, but always at least a very uncomfortable burning sensation in my uterus.

Is it worth it to go to a clinic or the nearest hospital and let my employer know that I may be late for work? I'm also worried of being in extreme pain at work and stuck in the bathroom for too long. I also feel bad frequently asking to go to the bathroom.

396,"We're both female. I'm 30, she's 24. I'm introverted. She claims to be introverted but has a lot of social energy. Despite that, we get along very well. We have a similar sense of humour, same down to earth attitudes (for the most part haha), and despite only knowing each other for about 2-3 years, we've had a lot of similar experiences in our lives prior to meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Obligatory warning that this is a long post, but there is a TL;DR at the bottom!

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to push this friend away once about a year ago. She got hung up on a guy she met on Tinder, and despite him telling her outright that he wasn't looking for a relationship, she still insisted that he ""wasn't being clear"" and kept digging deeper for him to basically confirm what he wanted. From my perspective, she's not the best at picking up on social cues (queues?). She didn't know how to understand that this guy wasn't as into her as she was into him, and for some reason this was completely lost on her when it was so blatantly obvious to me. I also tried to ease her off of talking about her longing for him...""you have to let him go"" types of kind words. Or just outright changing the subject at times. She was beating a dead horse and I enabled it. The ""digging deeper for answers"" thing has some significance with the main reason I'm finding her annoying now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think for simplicity's sake I'm going to call this friend ""C"".

&amp;#x200B;

The two of us (plus a third friend she went to high school with) recently decided to get a table at a small convention to sell some artwork. C and I have worked together before (at a retail job - none of us have ever sold art before). I was basically her superior (she wasn't in my department at our workplace, but she spent so much time there that she reported to me). She knows I have a ""get it done yesterday"" attitude, don't communicate more than I need to, don't really socialize casually on the job until all my tasks are done. We're all excited to be selling our art for the first time ever. I'm just burnt out that C might be over-preparing for the event.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I'm in touch with C once every couple weeks, and usually it's by text message. Maybe once every month or two we will go for lunch and spend a day together. She has a large social circle and I like to keep to myself so that level of frequency with contact is perfect for me. But since this convention has come into our scope of plans, C has been messaging me significantly more. It was almost daily up until about a week ago. On top of that, she has set up these ""meetings"" to discuss the convention and our plans roughly once every two weeks. I'm drained just thinking about the upcoming ""meetings"". This is going on until the end of September (convention is the last weekend of September).

&amp;#x200B;

Our first official scheduled meeting felt lackluster. We had a few questions, found solutions almost immediately, and then the rest of the day was spent just being casual. I have nothing against a casual outing, but I just don't want to do this every two weeks. I'm very much concerned that I'm going to get sick of C or resent her by the time the convention happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned earlier that C doesn't really pick up on social queues (cues?). Usually when she spends time with me, it's until the last bus out of the area runs for the night. Doesn't matter if I say I'm tired or want to be home alone, or even audibly yawn (not on purpose - if I hold in my yawns my eyes start to water so I figure the yawning itself is less awkward than actual tears). We get along well so conversations can last long, but she tries to make them last longer. When there's nothing left to say, she'll start this weird habit of saying, ""But, um...yeah."" And I know whenever a sentence starts with that, she just doesn't want the moment to end when it probably should. And she can ""but, um...yeah"" for literal hours.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the convention is concerned, I have my merch ready. I have my budget for stuff to help display my merch (we're doing shopping for this as a group sometime in August, which is the only ""meeting"" I can justify out of the eight or so C has scheduled). I have researched the demographic and turnout of this convention. I've done all my number crunching. I did most of this within two weeks of registering the table. It only took one ""meeting"". C recently met with another friend who sells at conventions regularly and tried to get some advice, and texted me, ""I need to do more research"". That was followed by some very elaborate texts about everything from popular art styles at this convention to display advice to how many people actually attend, and how many of those attendees actually buy things. So I asked her, ""do you have any questions left unanswered regarding the convention"" and she said she's confident all her questions are answered. But in the same breath she said she needs to do more research. I saw it as another example of her digging deeper for information that was explicitly given to her, or beating a dead horse. This exchange was part one of me coming to realize that I'm getting annoyed. Also, this conversation was at about 1am. I generally go to bed early. Also, I keep my phone by my side on full volume in case my dad has an emergency overnight and needs to reach me ASAP (it's happened before). C knows that I'm an early bird for bed and why I have my phone with me at all hours. My closest friends know not to text me late at night unless it's an emergency because I will likely get woken up by casual texts and be a little grumpy that I was woken up by something that wasn't an emergency. Problem is, if texts do happen, I'm awake after hearing them, and have nothing better to do than respond at that point, so I guess I bring it on myself if people continue to text me overnight. It's not uncommon for C to spend most of a day texting me, and she even does the ""but, um...yeah"" thing by text (she actually types that phrase). I've told her that I have to go to appointments or call my dad or run errands and she keeps texting. Usually this doesn't bother me as I'll get back to her when I can, but since the convention talk it just seems excessive. I feel more compelled to check/respond in case she actually wants/needs to talk about the convention, but majority of the time it's just casual stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""meetings"" are the second part of what's caused me to be annoyed. We have a meeting this upcoming Friday, which is fine. We also have a meeting three days later, on a Monday. It's the only meeting that's not on a Friday. And it's the only specific Monday I'm not available. I'm going to a concert, and have a VIP pass to meet the artist, get a photo with them, and get their autograph. It's the first concert I've gone to in eleven years. Because there's a photo op, I'm getting my hair, nails, and makeup done before the show. I'm literally unavailable that entire Monday. C has known about this concert from the day I bought the ticket, which was quite a few months ago, and it comes up in conversation regularly. When I reminded C that this upcoming Monday is the day of the concert, and I can't meet up to talk about social media promotion for us being at the convention (the only purpose of this meeting is to talk about when to start using hashtags related to the convention), she said I could be part of a conference call on the phone instead, or we could text each other. I personally don't see why we can't just discuss the social media stuff this upcoming Friday and I can have an actual day away from C and the convention stuff the Monday of the concert. From my perspective, I'm giving C and this convention so much attention and the one time I can't, it's still demanded. It's making me resent C a little. Still excited for the convention, though. I'm working on a comic book and most of the merch I'm selling is related to that comic book.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my dilemma:

C is one of my only friends that's currently in touch with me. I was in a car accident a little over a year ago and 99% of my friends coincidentally vanished at the same time when they all heard the news. Occasionally a friend will pop in, apologize for being a ""bad friend"" for losing touch with me, and then vanish again for months at a time, or ghost me when I ask to hang out. That's fine. The car accident has taught me which friends are strong enough to ""deal with"" me while I'm recovering. C is definitely one of those friends, and I thanked her for being one of the only people to stay in touch with me while I'm off work and recovering. I'm concerned if I tell her to tone down the social stuff regarding the convention that I might distance myself too much from one of the only people that still wants to be in touch with me. I understand to an extent we need to be in touch about the convention, but I just feel that it's way too much right now. I'm glad I got most of my art finished early because I wouldn't have time to draw regularly with the amount of contact we've been having. I don't see a need for meetings every two weeks. It's expensive for transit/food and I'm on a limited budget being on sick leave, and it's socially draining. I still have appointments with doctor's/specialists regularly and legal correspondence and whatnot, so despite being off from work, I have a pretty saturated schedule. Also, I have some post-concussive issues so I have these weird instances of sleeping for 19 hours straight if my brain decides it's over-stimulated. My last ""meeting"" with C triggered one of these hibernations, as what I thought would be a meeting over brunch for a few hours ended up being a ten-hour social day until after midnight with C.

&amp;#x200B;

I got SOME peace and quiet starting about a week ago. C's hours got cut at work (same place where I used to work with her). She went into some shock as if this is new to her, but this workplace cuts hours every summer due to business being slow. She said she will be busy for the next little while because of job hunting/interviews. So over the last week I've heard from her only twice because she has other things to distract her. I respect that she's busy and am not texting her, unlike when I tell her I'm busy and she just continues texting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also...I don't know if this adds much to this entire situation, but we have a mutual friend who is incarcerated at the moment and can only communicate by snail mail. This friend had C's mailing address and got in touch with her first. I had been asking for the return address to stay in touch with this friend. It took almost two months to get said mailing address (literally asked for it while I was at C's house for one of our ""meetings"" - told her to pull out the letter from the friend and I'll copy the address). I wrote my friend in jail and she responded saying that C never replied to her initial letter. Somehow that upset me more because C is giving me all this attention when she knows I have a breaking point and will get fed up from being so social, but our friend who is open to written letters gets ignored.

Oh, and the third girl doing the convention with us? She has a two hour commute (four hour round trip) into the city for each of these meetings. I don't know much about this third girl as I just met her, but she too seems pretty quiet and has a lot of stuff going on in her hometown that keeps her busy. I'm not entirely sure how many of these meetings she'll end up attending in-person. She has asked C for information in out group chat and C said she's not saying anything until actual meetings because most of what she wants to talk about is ""in-person only"" stuff (I get that for art critique but not for the convention planning itself).

&amp;#x200B;

Am I unreasonable for being annoyed? Is my friend an attention vampire? I don't want to bring up the over-socializing until I know for certain I'm not just being a grumpy introvert.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Friend has quadrupled the time we spend together on arbitrary ""meetings"" for a convention we're planning to sell art at. I'm not the type of person who likes to be social so frequently, so this is overwhelming for me. Friend has admitted she has no unanswered questions regarding the convention, but still wants to dig deeper for information regardless. Friend also wants me to be available by phone/text three days after our upcoming meeting, which falls on a date she knows I'm not available. I'm becoming annoyed/resentful but don't know if I'm overreacting.

I asked around to see if anyone was doing anything for him but no one seemed to know about anything. So I got him a little personalised present from me and, because as far as I was aware he couldn't drink alcohol because of his medication, I said I'd bring some pizzas in at the end of his last ever shift tonight so whoever is in can wish him good luck. I was trying to do a nice thing but now I'm feeling really stupid. That's not what adults do, is it? I feel like he's only agreed to it to be polite.

406,"
 I'm currently 16 years old.  I'm not close to her(my classmaye) and I rarely talk to her unless it is related to school. She doesn't have much friends. Most of the time, I see her either being alone or with 2-3 friends. Her humour is often self-depracating and she tends to jokes about wanting to die to her friends. Other than that, I overheard certain sensitive and personal conversation between her and her friend. I have a slightly hint on what she is going through as her friend is often loud despite her hushing.

   I heard and saw some of her unhealthy habits; scratching/fiddling with her hands until they bleed, staying up super late or not sleeping at all, saw some deep scratches (?) on her upper arm, and avoiding people. I talked to her before but it's often small talks and silly jokes. Aside from her self-depracating jokes, she's quite friendly and funny. However, I still do not know her much. She tends to stutter or not involve herself in most social activities. I'm not sure what to do.

  I don't know how to approach her friends and her. The only thing I have in common with her is that we're in the same class and same school club. If I report to a counselor, I'm afraid I mistook her behaviour and intrude her personal space. What should I do?",02Jul2019,1
408,"  So my husband has been with me since I was 3 months pregnant (my son is 2 now) so as far as my son knows and as far as anyone is concerned my husband is his real father. I dont want my son to know anything about his bio dad because the man was a complete piece of shit. He was very manipulative and extremely abusive (actually caused me to have a miscarriage before I got pregnant with my son) my ex didn't want anything to do with my son and hasn't talked to me since my son was first born. 
  I've seen a lot of posts about kids finding out things like this when they are older and being upset with their parents and I dont want that with my son. The problem though is if my son does decide he wants to meet his real dad and he actually does track him down I dont see it going well. Last I heard he was in Florida (we are in ohio) I know for a fact he has 2 other kids to two other women and abandoned them both and he had another on the way to a girl in Florida. 
  My ex made it very clear he wants nothing to do with my son and if he does try to connect with my son it will be just to turn him against me. He did the same thing with his other two kids and hes very good and screwing with people to get his way. So my question is should I ever let my son know about him or would it just be better to never let him know?",02Jul2019,1

412,"Before anyone tells me something about ""he's your ex, move on"", I have to clarify a few things.
The relationship lasted 2 years, I was his first loving relationship. He broke it off because of his own depression and fears, due to the fact I was leaving the country and he didn't know what to do (LDRs, future, etc). He made a lot of mistakes and completely became self-destructive, but with time started working on himself again.

We've been talking a lot, even though the first few months after the break up it was very on/off with him. He told me he loved me the day I left, was there for a week then went cold, I went NC 3 times and he always broke it to tell me he was sorry, that I deserved better and that he loves me - that's the short of it.

A couple months ago we started fully working on restoring everything between us. We were doing great, in a way. He was taking care of himself and eventually started therapy, because at some point during May I believe, his mother fell ill and was hospitalized - he was distraught. Things were still working between us, although he was struggling still and having doubts, more than he did back in April where he seemed so sure. I assumed it was because of his mother, so when he left to see her for a week back to his home state, I figured this would help him. Boy was I fucking wrong.

He's been extremely depressed, and struggling close to what he was when he broke up with me, maybe a bit worse. He got bad news recently about the condition his mother is in, who is no longer hospitalized but has an extremely rare disease that could kill her any moment. 
He made the decision that he wants to quit everything and move closer to his mother, and that means that as it stands, with him and his depression/struggles and this whole deal with his mother, there's no way he has the energy or time to be or work in a relationship. So everything went to shit, and I'm a massive wreck.

Part of me is selfish, just like part of him is selfish too. I hate this situation and I hate that all our work has gone to shit. He also doesn't want to lose me, he wants me to stay by his side, he's told me this is a fucking shit situation and that he hates it too, a lot. I think deep down he doesn't want to lose me in hopes we find what we once have. But I'm a dick and I don't know if I can do this. I'm miles and miles away from him, so it's not like I can visit him whenever and support him, we live in completely different countries ffs. I want to be there, but I alsi wanted this relationship to work. Thinking that's not going to happen when everything else in my life is awful, makes it harder. But I also needed him to get out of my shithole of a country, so it's selfish because holy fuck, his mother is sick and he's doing the right thing, but I can't help and think what an awful situation this is for us.

I've come to the realization that I need to live my life without a particular goal in mind. I hope we work out in the future, but I'm a mess and he's a mess. He needs me now more than ever, so how do I do that?

I will be focusing on my goals. Since I no longer need to save to visit him, I'll still save with another objective in mind. I also have an account back in his country which I'll mostly leave untouched, until I know for sure there's no use for it anymore.

So, if you can, please let me know what I can do to get my head out of my ass and help him through what could possibly be one of the worst times of his life.",02Jul2019,1

414,"A little background. I'm an introvert. You wouldn't know it if you met me. I'm a good actor when it comes to one on one interaction or a small group of people. I'm a Meyers Briggs ISFJ. 

Speaking in front of large groups of people has always been a HUGE phobia of mine. I failed speech class TWICE in high school because I refused to get up in front of the group. I'm in my early 40's now. When I look back at my wedding pictures from 10 years ago, my entire head looks shiny because I was sweating so hard from being so nervous standing up in front of a group of people.

Anyhow, my boss at work knows of my phobia and is trying to force me to do a training session in front of our group that lasts more than an hour. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I can go through with it. The anxiety from the thought of it is driving me crazy. I can't focus on anything else. It's eating me alive.

416,"Me and my boyfriend are in a situation where he earns ten times more than me. In fact - I would define him as rich.

I work as a fulltime writer and I earn next to nothing. This was my choice. I knew that if I chose this career it would be tough.

Now him and I are talking about going on a holiday and I am fine with something cheap so I can afford it too. He on the other hand wants something more expensive. We're talking hostel vs hotels here.

I tell him I can't afford it, and if he wants that he should pay. He then respond with saying we should both pull our weight.

It makes me a little mad and rubs me the wrong way. Coz I already feel guilty not earning more and he has a way of hinting every now and then that I should chip in more.

I just wanna say, that he is really good at paying every time we are out, whereas I buy yhe groceres for dinner and always cook. But besides this I am in no way spoiled. He doesn't really spend money on much and still has his old student/save money mentality. I think this is fine, but I just don't get, when he has that much money, where the problem is in paying for the regular stuff.

I know I would do it in a heartbeat if I had the money. He says to me that I can't know that for sure, but I think all my friend will attest to the fact, that whenever I did have money, I'm always happy to give a little extra.

He just really makes me feel like my values and equality to him is based on chipping in as much as he does.
I think I contribute with a lot of things that isn't necessarily measured in money.

I think in general is a little stingy with his money for some reason.

Sorry for long post. But would be nice to know if I'm in the wrong here or if there's any advice to bridge this money gab between us. I don't wanna sound ungrateful for when he does pay.

419,"For the past five years, my wife \[33f\] has been doing exceptionally well in her bjj/no gi classes. Although I have little knowledge of the sport, I have ensured that she gets all the emotional support she needs from me, especially when she gets injured and has to temporarily distance herself from any physical activity. She had won the gold medal in five consecutive tournaments until she struck up a friendship with this strange woman\[24F\] who had recently relocated to our city and joined the same academy.

This woman claimed to be a child prodigy in the sport and regularly defeated my wife in their bouts. The gold medals started turning into silver and bronze.

Recently. I overheard this lady telling my wife that beautiful women rarely beat the ""tomboyish"" ones. My wife is an extremely good looking lady and has won quite a few beauty pageants in the past while this friend of hers identifies herself with the ""tomboy"" variety .

I am worried that such ideas might ruin my wife's self-belief. She performs quite well when she faces the other women but **she always loses to this friend of hers.** Despite this, she calls that lady her best friend! They frequently go to movies and dine together. A few weeks back, when I returned home from work in the evening, I saw them watching television together. My wife's friend gave me a triumphant smile and proudly declared her victory over my wife in the final match of the tournament. I was so upset that I did not reply. My wife laughed as if nothing had happened.

In a one to one conversation with my wife, I bluntly asked her why she loses to the same woman every time and she simply replied that her friend was ""much stronger"". In fact, I happened to notice one of their practice bouts this Sunday.

My wife's friend held her in such a position where she could hardly breathe and released her only when my wife tapped her on the shoulder. At the end of the bout, when my wife was getting up from the mat, her friend held her firmly and **slapped her bottom** several times. I found that extremely disagreeable but my wife did not seem to mind it so much and in fact, moved away only after her friend was done with this awful slapping ritual. I am scared that a quarrel over this friend might strain our relationship. Is this friendship proving unhealthy for my wife?

TLDR: My wife always loses to a particular opponent, who happens to be her best friend. How do I prevent this lady from influencing my wife?",02Jul2019,2

421,"We have been together almost 6 months. Our relationship wasn’t the easiest even from the beginning. But within the last month or so it’s been different. I’ve felt like I was slowly losing her and I didn’t know why. We found out a few weeks ago that she’s pregnant. I thought that it’s great. It’s terrible timing right now but I wasn’t even supposed to be able to have kids and so anytime is a good time to me. But naturally so, she’s gotten herself stressed out and worried about being pregnant because we are both still in college. But a few days ago she came to me and started making what I felt were demands and quite unreasonable ones at that. She wanted me to quit drugs all together, which were just pot and LSD, she said after I finish my last few beers, no more. She said when she gets further along, no more nicotine. So to clarify, I don’t do drugs around her as it is. I don’t vape around her. I don’t drink in excess. Then she told me that since her house is a Salvation Army house (her parents work with them) that I can’t live with them unless she and I are engaged. I’d already planned on getting that sorted out but after her saying I need to start saving up for a place of my own for after school it made me realize she’s saying her family doesn’t want me to stay there even though her mom emptied a dresser and put some of my clothes in it so I’m not living out of a bag when I’m there. They’re turning her room into a nursery. So I can’t live there, but her room is gonna be a nursery. See where my mind went? So we got into an argument about all this at school. And me being mad and being an ass, I said something with the intent to hurt her and I immediately regretted it. We were talking about drugs and I said “You’re worried I’m going to get caught but I do drugs and you have no clue. Hell, I did coke all last week and you or your family didn’t know.” Now this is true. I did that. But I wanted to try it. It was one time. I’m not touching it again. So here’s where shit gets really bad. After apologizing and thinking everything was alright again, we get to her house after class and her guinea pig died. Then after all that she came downstairs to me and asked me if she could stay by herself tonight. In the 5 months and 11 days we were together, we never once spent a night apart. We couldn’t. So now she wants to. That pissed me off again. I didn’t understand it. Im not going to pretend like I do now. But once again I could make the right decision and give her what she’s telling me she needs or I could act like an asshole. Take a guess. I texted her when she dropped me off that I can’t do this. I can’t be in a relationship with somebody I love that doesn’t love me anymore. I told her either we talk this over and fix it or we break up and worry about the baby later. It really leveled me and humbled me when she said that we need to break up then. The whole time I was playing victim and I didn’t realize it. So I called her. Told her I was sorry and that I didn’t want to split up. Swore I wouldn’t touch the drugs or anything again. But it went from she needs the night alone, to a few days. She said she just needs to be alone to figure out all her thoughts about this baby situation. What there is to figure out, idk. But I know I want her. I want my kid. I want to be happy. How do I fix this with her? How do I make everything go back to being what it used to? I don’t want to lose her.",02Jul2019,1

423," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

424,I work for a private business with under 20 office employees.  I’m sure it is not illegal their policy but my coworkers and I want policy change.,02Jul2019,1
426,"I couldn't seem to add a location. I'm in utah.

I picked up a stop-gap job last week and was hoping to stay for a couple of months while my husband looks for better paying work. It's a purebred puppy store, and I figured that whatever was going on in life, this would be easy. Poopy kennels, handing kids their new best friend, that kinda thing.

I was out of work due to a massive injury, and now am returning to work. I had mentioned this to my employer, saying, ""I had to sit for 6 months, and all my stabilizer muscles get really tired and I'll have to sit occasionally."" The employer was fine with this, and over the last week I've been able to do my job within reasonable accommodation aside from one thing: a shift lead that is very aggressive and tries to intimidate me. 

I started noticing his behaviour immediately--he would direct an employee from a task they were currently doing to a task that he was assigned. He would leave shit covered towels in our sanitary sink. He used an exclusively condescending tone when he spoke with other employees, especially me. 

Then, I was left alone with him on a shift. I can't remember all the things he did over that shift, because they were many passive aggressive little things that started adding up, but:

If i wanted to watch what he was doing, he would immediately send me off to do busy work--it quickly became apparent that he is not the one who completes his job duties. I watched him flip through a notebook and do nothing for 30 minutes after I wanted to see what he was doing on the computer. 

For instance, when he pulled out a chart that we apparently initial every hour to ensure that the Windows are washed. 

""Ok, and where is this normally?""

He points to a filing cabinet. 

""Wait, we do this hourly but we keep it in a cabinet? Where is it normally?""

He pins it to the wall and doesn't answer me. 

But then, I got in trouble for doing too small of a load of laundry. ""I apologize,"" I told him, after he said that it was a waste, ""yesterday you told me we should always have laundry running. So I ran it."" He then says, ""Well, you wouldn't run just one washcloth, would you?""

""I didn't,"" I responded, ""it was a few items. But for the future, you want me to wait until we have a bigger load, and not 'always keep the laundry running.' Right?""

And he legit sneered a yes at me, as if I was being specifically obtuse.

Then, as I go to sit down, he asks me to come work with him on a task list. I ask him if it's a daily or a weekly task list. He says weekly. Then, I ask what the color coded days on the top are for.

He stares. He shrugs.

""Just put your initials on the tasks you did yesterday."" He said. He was visibly frustrated with me at this point. I chuckled and said, ""yes, I'm familiar with the concept of checking off items as you do them,"" thinking that a light joke might bring some levity. I was wrong. He says something like ""there you go, then."" Under his breath in an angry tone.

""Why am I checking off stuff for yesterday?"" I ask him. 

""What?!""

""These dates. They're yesterday. Shouldn't we put today's date, so we can mark tasks off as we go?""

He doesn't respond. After some time, I see some employees exit out the back to smoke, and everything is done, so I follow them to ask if this is normal for this guy, or if he's just having a bad day or what. They each day, ""that's just how he is.""

It's important to note that NOT A SINGLE EMPLOYEE talked to me about him, warned me of this behaviour, or anything. They wanted nothing to do with how he'd handle this. (At least that's my impression)

So, after a few minutes of blowing off steam, I come back in to an empty back room (with one of the puppies out and unattended). Then, I notice the chart. He's removed yesterday's dates and left my initials on the board. So, since I don't want to mark off something that didn't get done, on no particular date, I start erasing it. While I am, he walks into the room, and comes so close behind me that I can feel his breath on my back. I turn to address him and he's got a smirk on his face, like he just caught me doing something wrong. I said, ""hey, how come you left my initials and erased the date?""

""Because we have people coming in tomorrow,"" he said, walking away to look at the schedule. 

""Well, I'm off tomorrow. And I wouldn't sign off on something that didn't get done anyway, so why did you do this?""

""I already explained that to you, pesh. I'm trying to look at the schedule, and you won't stop asking me questions.""

""Because I don't understand this."" I said. He doesn't respond. 

I pull out a marker that correlates with the color for tomorrow, and say, ""so, do we put the dates out for tomorrow, or today's so the night shift can use it?""

""Neither, they'll do it.""

""Okay, but does the shift tonight need it, or do they start fresh tomorrow?""

He starts walking towards me with aggressive body language and yells, ""What, are you afraid of being in trouble?"" He's less than a foot away when he says, ""What exactly are you asking me, Pesh?!"" In my face.

I turn from him as I start to write tomorrow's date in the date section.

""Why won't you just listen to me?!"" He yells again. 

""I'm just looking for something to do for the last 30 minutes of my shift."" (Also trying to understand the crazy he just spat at me but whatever I guess)

He starts raising his voice at me again, and erases the date that I've just written, saying ""OH I'll GIVE you something to do. You can clean and replace all the dogs water bottles!""

""And is that a daily or a weekly task?"" I ask.

""It's weekly! Every Friday!"" He yells as he leaves the room. 

I go do the task while another employee is taking care of the dog that's out.

""Hey, where's his water?"" She asks. (We had a bowl out rather than a bottle)

The lead (who returned at some point) says, ""oh, it's being cleaned. She's got it."" I assumed he meant me, because I was in the sink at that moment, but I also had no idea that I was washing his bowl. I see his bowl in the sanitation bucket so I say to her, ""oh, oops, sorry, I didn't know I was doing that."" And start to wash it. (We have plenty, I don't know why I thought I was washing and returning it to him, but hey)

Then, the lead comes up behind me and says, ""did you just say that you didn't know dogs needed water?"" There's condescension in his voice, and I can hear that aggressive tone rising.

""No, I didn't know his bowl was in the sanitation bucket, so I didn't know I was washing it. I thought he had no water.""

Then, he clocks out.

During my day off, I conclude that this is Way Too Much™ for a place that's paying me 11$ an hour, and begin putting in applications for other places. Again, I had originally intended to stay for a couple months at least--more when I found out how much I liked every other employee there.

And then, come to find out, that this isn't a new problem. He was the first person the owner hired, and their entire back staff was fired for ""inability to cooperate"". The current employees have complained to the owner. She talked to him, the behavior decreased for a little while, and then he was right back to normal. 

The next time I'm back, I'm talking with the manager (Also the lead's boss) about this. We're in the sick room (and we have more sick dogs than healthy ones right now).

""I had a really rough time training with The Lead the other day."" I tell her. 

""I know,"" she says, ""the other employees noticed and texted me about his behaviour. I sent them to the owner, and she already talked with him. She wants to talk with you too.""

""Great!"" I'm legitimately relieved.

I tell her the story above, since no one witnessed it. She responded with, ""I'm not supposed to be talking with you guys about this.""

I look her in the eye and say, ""I am telling you now, my manager, that if I'm left alone with him on a shift, I will walk. I am not going to be treated this way.""

I also got to meet a weekend worker who had already heard about me from the lead. He shit talked me to another employee who I hadn't even meet yet, saying that I have the worst attitude and can't listen.

The owner did not show. However, she did send out an email noting everything that was wrong with the store when she visited last. The manager gets us all together to read it. She states a bunch of problems, mostly relating to the sick room.

When we return, I'm being trained on how to do medication for sick dogs. I find out it's the lead's job mostly, and that he'd been breaking rules. A lot of rules. 

He was stopping medication and switching the dog to a new one--the dogs would appear healthier for about a day after, just long enough for the dog to be seen as healthy and reintroduced to the group--only to get the other dogs sick.

He was so desperate to skip out on caring for the dogs that he's faking their health. I would file this under animal cruelty--ultimately harming animals because of laziness. 

98% of the issues in the email can be easily traced back to his negligence. We sign off on everything, they have cameras everywhere. I've been working there 5 days and can see it. The owner either sees it and doesn't care, or doesn't see it regardless of multiple employees telling her multiple times. 

Y'all? This place has been open for 4 months.

I'm leaving. There's no doubt about that. But I also ultimately understand that leaving without telling the owner WHY will only give The Lead the ability to continue doing this quietly. I'm not a quiet person. There is NO HR, so I'm at a loss as far as what to do next. I want to at least help the people who are trapped with him. I've considered sending an email to the boss directly after I leave, but I worry even with neutral toned writing she'll ignore it and view me as a disgruntled employee. Is there anything workforce services can do, or am I best off bailing asap? Would it be inappropriate to send a bcc of the email to workforce services if they CAN help, so there's at least something on file?

My manager also mentioned that she was considering leaving because of how tightly controlled she feels in regard to this behaviour. Apparently, the lead told the boss ""I only act like that because they're disrespectful to me."" I suggested that she email workforce services with her experience as well. 

I have managed in so many places--including inside a prison--and have never in my life had to speak to an employee like that. Even if I did think they're the dumbest person alive, this behaviour doesn't help.

Thanks if you read until the end! I appreciate it. I have a job interview today before my shift, and I work with The Lead today. Since my manager was a no show yesterday, she may have already quit, which would make the lead the one I answer to today. I'll update if there's enough interest.",02Jul2019,0

430," I am going through a difficult situation in my life. I have two kids, and I love them. I am separated, still not divorced, so I am still married to the father of my kids. We have about 7 years together, about 5 married. About 6 months ago I met a man that I enjoy spending time with, he is also a parent of two older kids. He is 14 years older than me. He seems to also enjoy my company but I don't think he wants anything serious with me. I met his kids, and mother, but he doesn't invite me to any of his family events. We can only spend time together once or twice a month because he is always planning something with his daughters or family event or a trip. He said he can't invite me to spend the night with him when he is with his daughters because he only does that when he is engaged or married. Does that even make sense? I told him how I am supposed to get to know him and his daughters if we only spend little time together. He says he is a busy man but yet he always has time for this daughter's sports and events. Their daughters live with their moms, he gets them every other week.

I had tried to ask him about his intentions, he knows I am married but he also knows I am separated and in a divorce process, when I want to talk about our relationship he says I am full of drama or immature, I have tried to stop talking to him, but it seems to be so hard for me to do that.

I don't know what to do, if to cut all communication with this man since he seems he is more interested in being with his family and daughters than me. I don't want another failed relationship.",02Jul2019,1
431,"Dear all, 

Like everyone, I occasionally don't get enough sleep. I'd say it's about once or twice a week that I simply can't fall asleep or wake up after 4 hours and can't doze back off. I try to work through the tiredness, I know many people have to deal with much worse sleeping issues while still able to work/study, but I don't just feel tired. I feel absolutely empty apart from something that feels like a broken heart, like I just got out of a relationship or a close relative died. 

I know that it's all temporary and I don't become suicidal so there's no real danger, but it just affects my day so much. I feel horrible, can't focus, can't feel joy, but I also can't nap or fall asleep to make it stop, seemingly because I feel too sad. I don't really hear this from others as much except lack of sleep making their depression/anxiety worse, or getting a sad mood like this after a while of insomnia, but not after one night of 4 or even 5 hours of sleep. That I do feel like this makes me feel weak, but it also makes me think (hope?) that there might be another physiological reason. Maybe I just need more vitamine B/D(although I also have this while spending the day in the sun)/Anything)?

So does anyone have similar experiences and/or tips of how to be less sad when tired?",02Jul2019,1

433,"My girlfriend and I have been together for just over a year, we have had our share of arguments but we have always worked them out....until last night.

We got into an argument about how I'm not as attentive as I used to be; not spending time with her son, not helping as much with our baby etc. Now for context; I work overnights so my schedule is already turned upside down but when I get home I don't immediately go to sleep. I give her, our son and her son a small kiss on the forehead (kind of like my way of telling them that I'm home). I know that she can have a rough night with two kids, a one month old doesn't like to sleep, so when I lay down I have one eye open for when he starts to get fussy and I change and feed him.

Because of this, when I get home I usually don't fall asleep until 9-10 in the morning. Things around the house have gotten slightly messy, mainly from both of us being exhausted so we have been a little lax in dishes and laundry.

Things came to a head last night when her son was throwing a fit and just not listening, I asked her if she wanted any help and I got a very sharp ""I got it."" Fast forward to when I get to work, I get a text from her saying that she didn't care if I came home in the morning and if I did, the couch was mine. I told her that I understood and that I was working on changing my general attitude so I could be the man she deserves, from there I was told that my words (and myself) were worthless.

We have had short conversations this morning and I'm afraid that she's falling out of love with me. I've had depression on and off for years and thinking back on her message is only compounding the old feelings.

I love her, I want to be with her, but most importantly I want to fix our relationship. I have no idea what to do, everything I try is just met with silence or a grunt of acknowledgement.

435,"We have been married for almost four years. There is a lot of history, and we have had our share of problems. I won't get into them, however none of them make the marriage unfixable.

We have a three year old. I love my wife more than life itself. I went through some real dark times and she did everything she could to keep me strong. I've become an amazing husband, an amazing father, and have done everything in the world to ensure that happens, and I still continue to grow every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Here recently we have had a lot of problems. She's been angry and me, in addition to anger in general. I have been keeping away and giving her space, keeping my head down and letting her get through this. Everyone told me to give her space. Professionals told me to give her space. I apparently gave her too much. She has decided to be done. I cannot handle this. Our marriage is fixable, and now that I know I was giving her too much space, I know I can rekindle our old love. The flame we used to have while we laughed like children together. I had already planned to do this, but I was still giving her time and space.

Apparently it's too late now, and I can't. I haven't eaten for three days. Every hour I'm awake, I'm crying. I can't even go to sleep to escape from it, because every minute spent asleep is having nightmares where she's leaving me and with other people.

&amp;#x200B;

She's everything to me. I can't handle living life without her, and I can't handle her finding someone else to call hers. I know we can get past her anger and frustrations, go to therapy, and I can be a 200% proactive husband to make sure this promise happens, like becoming the great husband and father I have today happened, I kept that promise too. She just will not do it, and I can't take it. I cannot live life without her. I love her too much. I need her back. I need to fix us.

437," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

I bought the tickets solely because i thoroughly love the band that we’re planning to see. If i we’re single at the time i would have been perfectly fine just buying one, but since he likes them also and i was hoping we’d be together around then i bought him one as well.

439,"I’ve (M48) been married for 20 years and our sexlife has been virtually non existent. My wife was apparently sexually assaulted before we married by a friend of hers. So in the beginning I accepted that sex was going to be rare. We moved country as she did not want to live in the vicinity to her attacker. 
My wife got pregnant and we were blessed with a child. After a few years we bought a house together and that’s when strange things started happening.
She resisted everything I tried to make our lives better, from buying a house, to fixing it up. Even decisions to improve the quality of our sons life, such as which school to go to, teaching him to stand up for himself. One day a guy decided it was a good idea to urinate against his window, my wife’s response was to ignore it. It doesn’t send a positive message to my son. 
There is black mold which forms on the inside of his room, on the walls and windows, but she refuses to allow anything to be done about it. 

Recently things started disappearing from the house, always my possessions, rock memorabilia that I have collected over 30 years, tickets(signed), t-shirts of all of the concerts I’ve been to, pearl necklace heirlooms. My safe has been raided and emptied. She tells me I’m going mad, that this cannot have happened and denies any part or knowledge. 

She recently told me that our sex life is down to me as I apparently don’t make her want to. When we do she prevents me from making her climax, by stopping me, getting up or just rolling over saying she’s had enough. She refuses to dress up to make herself look beautiful, yet wears perfume when she goes to “ work”. 
She uses her phone in the middle of the night promptly deleting messages. She has always been very secretive about her own life. 

 It doesn’t matter what I try, nights out, lingerie, the more I try the worse it gets. It feels as though she is using sex as a form of control, as though I am some kind of subservient pet. If I try to stand up for myself she constantly puts me down. In twenty years we have had sex less than once a season, going years without any form of physical contact. She tells me oral sex is cannablism and is abusive and neglectful of my needs and desires. 

I took her on a luxurious holiday and all she could do was complain and push me away. She doesn’t like me having photos of her of any sort

It is not possible to make her happy

She is now divorcing me saying I am crazy and that I have stolen my own possessions and is using this as a reason for divorce in order to get custody of my son and the house we co-own.

440,"I will preface this with a lot of stupid decisions were made and I’m aware of this and I can’t undo them now so I don’t need them pointed out. Also this is my first time posting here and I’m sorry if I’ve done something wrong. 

My husband and I signed a lease with his mother, an idiotically long lease (5 years). But it was extremely affordable for what we got and in a wonderful neighborhood (still dumb I know). His mother has claimed since we got married almost a decade ago that she always wanted to live with us and eventually, we gave in. 

Well, my husband is bisexual and I’m a trans man (though I’ve been closeted). She lied that she was over her bigotry so we would let her move in. We believed her but she recently revealed to us that the only reason she moved in with us was to protect our daughter from our evil filthy ways. Somehow she figured out I’m trans, seeing a gender therapist etc, I imagine by snooping and outed me to my mother who is also religious in hopes that she would reject us. She didn’t. My mother in law has stated her goal is to make us homeless like we “deserve”. She’s also on a rampage to out me to as many people as she can. 

She’s being very verbally abusive and I am afraid to go home, especially with my daughter. 

We can’t live with her but we’re all on the lease and I can’t force her to leave. Because of the emotional abuse, are there any grounds to get out of the lease ourselves or to get her off the lease/a new lease written? We don’t have a lot of money for extra legal costs or to pay a crazy amount money. 

I believe our rental agreement says that we are responsible for the rent until we find a new renter but wouldn’t my mother in law also have to agree to moving out?

Because I now had Colorado insurance NY suspended my license due to lack of NY insurance and not mailing back the tags. This has been going on for months. I only realized last week how serious driving under restraint is. Previously I was driving only when necessary but now I'm not driving at all.

If anybody has any thoughts at all I'm at the end of my rope on this. NY will keep the license suspended until the end of the registration. So I won't be able to drive for a year. My only hard limit is moving back. I'll entertain any other solution.

Things I've tried but haven't worked or are not viable-

- Sent back the tags

- Sent proof of current insurance and proof I had insurance continuously

- Attempted to hire a lawyer. I was told they don't do this

- Get insurance in both NY and CO. My insurance company wouldn't register it to an address I don't live at

- Take the driver's test here in CO. They will not issue a license to someone who is under restraint in another state

446,"Around this time last year, the guy I liked at the time (who is in the same circles as I am) was being really frustrating and doing things that got on my nerves so I decided not to talk to him for a while in order to just focus on myself. One day (about 2-3 days into this period) he asked me why I hadn’t been replying to him and I just felt particularly annoyed with his behaviour irl that day so I straight out told him that I was getting over him. He asked me if I was being honest, to which I replied yes and then he told me that he did have feelings for me but he wasn’t sure if they were serious. He asked if I wanted to meet up and talk about it and try things for a while. He is genuinely a nice and considerate guy most of the time so I told him that it wasn’t necessary to be that considerate of my feelings. In response, he listed out several instances that served as evidence for him liking me. 

After thinking about it for a couple days (before we were scheduled to meet up though) I realised that although we got along well most of the time, I still wasn’t in a good place for a relationship and we did have differences that annoyed me (as previously). I told him this and apologised for bringing up the subject in the first place. He asked me if I wanted him to ignore me (I was quite confused at this however he told me that some people prefer to get over people this way) but I said no. I also asked him the same question back and he said no. But eventually he started ghosting me on Messenger (the main way we communicated online) and when I asked him about it irl, he told me that if I did have anything to ask him, I could iust do so on Snapchat (where our conversations are usually extremely short). I told a couple of my very close friends at the time as well.

Fast forward to this year, I was feeling pretty confident that both of us had moved past the situation and left it behind. Recently I heard from my friend that in actual fact, the story that had been spreading around was that I had liked him, and he hadn’t liked me at all. Also, that I had asked him when he was going to ask me out. I definitely know, to the best of my knowledge, that neither of these things are true, in particular the latter.

In the back of my mind, I’ve always wanted to confront him about the ghosting because it wasn’t something that I expected from him at all. But now that I’ve found out what is going around, I feel like there is even more reason to talk it out. At the same time, I am very non-confrontational and feel like this situation is too far gone/in the past for anything to be fixed.

As a kid I was bullied pretty badly by my classmates, as well as a few teachers. Things started getting better, when I was around 14. I started gaining confidence and friends.

At 16, my mother had some kind of psychotic breakdown. She was verbally and emotionally abusive, and occasionally had violent outbursts. I lived with that 'walking on eggshells' feeling/environment for about 2 years, before my dad finally kicked her out.

I have been in and out of therapy since I was 19 (about 8 years) I know these events have majorly influenced the unhealthy thought patterns I have now. I have made a lot of progress with changing/healing my issues. However, there is one that I have been having an especially difficult time with.

In my mind, it's just a simple fact that none of my family/friends are interested in my thoughts/feelings/opinions. Not in a mean way. More like, if you were to compare the life of a rock, to that of a bird. One is just more interesting than the other.
A lot of the time, it doesn't even occur to me that someone I'm having a conversation with, actually wants to know my opinion on the subject. In my mind, it's a simple fact that the relationship is one-sided. It's a simple fact that I like them/find them interesting, but they don't think the same of me.

457,"Some background: My parents divorced when I was nine years old. I’m now 18.  I have little to no memories of that time. My father has ADHD and anger issues. He struggled with bulimia and was emotionally, physically and sexually abused as a young child by his own dad, not that he’s ever talked about it with me, I learnt from other family members. 

On the day before my dad got remarried in 2017, my mother sat me down and told me the circumstances of their divorce. The timing was far from ideal, but she was worried that he was going to tell me his version of events before she could. She told me a lot of information, most of which I’ve forgotten because I was so upset at the time, but to cut a long story short, he was incredibly abusive not only to her but to my older half-siblings who had viewed him as their dad since they were very young. None of this had ever been talked about before because I had no memory of anything happening and still saw him at least once a week at that point. 

I didn’t want to confront him about any of it so I pretended everything was fine for the next year or so until he decided to try and get out of paying for me in October last year, just after my 18th birthday. He’d been messing around with payments for years but took it to the next level by contacting child benefit services and telling them that I was no longer in full time education (I had just dropped out of school to study at home due to chronic illness) and therefore wouldn’t qualify for child benefit payment anymore. If my mother wasn’t eligible for child benefit anymore, he wouldn’t have to pay child maintenance. We’re not a well off family and at that point in time were struggling to make ends meet. 

We received a letter from the child benefit office a few days later telling us to prove that I was in education or the payments would stop. I had arranged to see him the next day but messaged him to tell him that I didn’t want to anymore because of what he’d done. 

Fast forward about eight months to now, we hardly talk. I’ve sent several messages explaining my feelings but I never get a reply. He hasn’t apologised for anything and instead tries to shift the blame onto me and my mother. I didn’t get to celebrate my 18th birthday or Christmas with him. I sent him a message in May telling him that I still loved him and that I just need more time because it’s brought up a lot of old emotions, but he didn’t reply. His wife tried to use her father’s terminal cancer diagnosis as emotional blackmail to get me to message my dad. 

He still paying for me because we proved I was still eligible, but I don’t know what to do from here. I’m seeing a therapist because of depression and anxiety that has been worsened by this whole ordeal. I’m having to confront the abuse my family suffered at his hands a decade ago and it’s brought up other things that have happened between him and I over the years. I’ve gained a new understanding of why people kill themselves because I just want to sleep all day so I don’t have to think about any of it. 

I don’t care about the money in and of itself, but it was a sign that he cared about me to some degree and it was the very least he could do as a father figure. 

I’m really sorry if this is confusing and doesn’t make sense. I’m more than happy to explain some more if anyone doesn’t understand. I’d just like some unbiased opinions on what the fuck I should do now. I haven’t told him that I know what he did to my mother and siblings but I think he’s guessed. I don’t want to see him face to face - I haven’t in over a year - but the idea of cutting him off forever is terrifying.",02Jul2019,1

460,"So, I [19F] work as a home health aid for an auto accident rehabilitation company.  My 45 day review is coming up... 

I’m new to this kind of work. I have no experience. So far I’ve made a lot of mistakes. 

- I missed a staff meeting... yikes 
- I have made several documentation mistakes
(one included inappropriate wording that I didn’t realize was inappropriate until my manager told me)
- I accidentally let it slip to one of the clients that my brother has epilepsy (we aren’t supposed to disclose personal info)
- I burnt garlic bread while making their dinners 
- I have passed meds late
- I was told yesterday I need to “keep up” on 24 hour checks because I was an hour and a half behind 
- I was assigned to a different house and while I was in the bathroom and someone else was with my client, they fell.  It technically wasn’t my fault since I don’t normally work at that house and I told the regular staff to watch him, but my name is still on the incident report (he was fine btw)

As I’m writing this all out, it sounds like I’m a terrible fit for this job.  I want to get into social work, but I’m completely bombing this job in every way possible. 

My manager is becoming more and more sarcastic with me.  I can guarantee she’s going to tear me a new one when she gives me my review.  Does anyone have advice on how to 1. Not cry, and 2. Handle this situation gracefully and probably how to look for a new job since I suck lol",02Jul2019,1
461,"Hello r/advice!

This turned into a bit of a novel.  Not sure if anyone will bother to read it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling a bit lost and miserable and I guess I am hoping someone will have some advice, recommended reading, or SOMETHING that can help me sort things out a little.  I have started talking to someone a week ago and I hope this will help me in the long run.  I am trying to do things like ""live in the moment"" more, but, I always end up falling into a trap of rumination and over-analyzing things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 35 year old male, no kids.  I live in Ontario, Canada near Toronto.  I am recently divorced (separated a year ago and divorce just finalized).  I have been struggling the past few years and lately (the past few months) I have been feeling desperate to give myself a direction that I can feel confident and happy with.  Lately my life feels very purposeless and it feels like I don't have ANYTHING figured out.  I'm worried that in my desperation to find a path to happiness ASAP, I might end up making some huge changes that I could regret later, and as a result I can't seem to make any decisions.   The truth is, my life is, objectively, pretty good, so I feel guilty feeling like I have screwed my life up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Work**

I am a mechanical engineer and I make pretty good money - I'm not rich but I get by very comfortably and am better off than a lot of people, which makes me feel silly for feeling unsatisfied.  My job, however, is not challenging at all.  There is no path for progression or growth.  I could do courses on my own time but none of it would be applied to my current position which makes it seem like a waste.  I have this really odd drive to try and do something ""challenging"" that I can feel proud about, which seems to be lacking at work.  

Ironically, because of this feeling towards my current job, lately I have been struggling to get my work done - I'm too busy contemplating what I should do to fix the fact that I am miserable 8 hrs a day.  I am totally disengaged at work.  Part of me wonders if this is purely a ""state of mind problem"" - if it is, I don't know how to fix it.  I'd love to be happy with my easy, decent paying, job.  My boss and coworkers are great and so there is no reason, besides the lack of challenge and growth, for me to be unhappy.

I have been considering going to school to switch from Mechanical Engineering to something in Software Development.  I honestly don't know if it would solve anything, and I worry it could create some financial problems for me (years of being unemployed while in school has a significant opportunity cost associated with it, and it is possible I would never achieve my current income if I made the switch).  This decision takes up the majority of my mental bandwidth every day.

Unfortunately because of my ambivalence, my unfinished work is starting to pile up.  I have a great, understanding, boss who is being patient, but I am starting to feel very guilty that I am not bouncing back and getting my stuff done.  I just feel like garbage at work.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships**

I was with my ex-wife for 10 years (married for 5 of them).  We split up because I found out she was pursuing a relationship with her personal trainer.  I tried to work on things for a year, but she had checked out of the relationship.  We separated a year ago.

I live on the other side of the country from my family, and we aren't very close - so after the divorce I have more or less been on my own, though I do have some friends.

For a year I did the dating thing and went on a ton of first dates, and had a few relationships that lasted a month or so.  I seem to be a bit needier and less trusting than I used to be, and that is a bit of a problem.  I also, initially, didn't seem to have much patience for any signs of incompatibility, and could be quick to end relationships over the year.  

I am currently seeing someone and things have been moving fast.  It's been 5 months and I basically live with her.  Lately there have been times where I am wondering if being in a relationship is a good idea for me (maybe I'm not ready, maybe I need the other parts of my life sorted out first), which I think my girlfriend picks up on and this makes her feel insecure.  If I am being honest, her insecurity is probably justified, because I am constantly evaluating the relationship rather than just enjoying it.  

Sometimes I wonder if I am a good person to be in a relationship with (more accurately, I often think I am shitty to be in a relationship with).  Sometimes I think a solution to my work issue would be to move somewhere else where there are more opportunities for me, which would pretty much mean leaving my girlfriend.

Lately I seem to have a very short fuse, and small things my girlfriend will do that I perceive as passive aggressive will get me really bent out of shape.  I try to be up front in my communication about things (calling her out if i think she is being passive aggressive) but she says I am reading too much into things.  I feel a bit broken, mentally, in this regard - as though I can't tell anymore when someone is acting in a way that I have a right to be upset about or not. 

To be honest, things with my ex-wife were totally conflict free, until the end.  Even our divorce was very amicable - no lawyers or anything.  I'm not very used to being in a relationship with any conflict, and small conflicts stress me out a lot.  I often wonder if I should just live by myself and get a pet. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Housing**

Financially I am in a good spot.  I have a year's salary set aside and a healthy retirement fund.  Again, I am probably better off than most.   Housing where I live is very overpriced.  I could afford a place (barely), but, there is this part of me that won't allow myself to overpay for a house.  Sometimes I think having a place of my own would provide some meaning to the day to day grind.  I'd love to have a dog (I used to have two, but my ex wife got them).  I used to own a nice house with my ex, but we sold it after separating.

Part of me is worried about making a housing purchase, getting my life all together again, getting in a relationship, and then losing it all over again.  I also worry about buying a house and then ""really being stuck"" in my current job, because I wont be able to afford to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Health**

I used to be very active (perhaps obsessively and not maintainably so).  I used to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo a lot, but, since I started seeing my current girlfriend, I haven't trained at all.  I've become pretty inactive, started eating junk food more and more (For the past 5 years or so I had been very careful with dieting and eating healthy).  I'm worried if I start to train again, that I will overdo it and she will get upset with how late I get back home.  Sometimes exercise was a distraction from work (I could train over lunch hours, but it probably wasn't the best from a productivity stand point).

&amp;#x200B;

The short version is, I feel like I have all these decisions to make and I seem unable to make them.  This didn't used to be an issue for me.  I don't know where to start, and would welcome any advice.  I also know this is all ridiculous because many people have it worse off than me.",02Jul2019,3
462,"So, because of the fact that summer is here and I have 3 months of free time, I decided to get a job, so I can earn a bit of experience and some money (I am 16 yo, so this would have been my first one ever). I started looking for jobs around my city with the help of some apps for two weeks. I wrote my CV in the app and I applied for some jobs (at basic fastfood/supermarket places).

Finally someone asked me to meet up for an interview at a local restaurant. I went there, everything went very well, in the end my employer started talking about signing a contract and taking some medical exam that the law asks for. He said that in 3 to 4 days everything would be over and I can start to work there.

So, in the next 4 days I took my medical exam (to test if I have any intestinal parasites or salmonella). I kept in contact with my employer throughout the hole process and everything seemed fine. In our last phone call, he told me that as soon as my results are ready, we can sign the contract and start to work.

Fast forward the next monday (yesterday, as I'm writing this) and my results are ready(everything is fine with my digestive system). I contacted him and he told me to send him the results . I did, but he didn't say anything for the rest of the day (I tried to contact him a few times ). I called him once, but he didn't pick up so I messaged him a few hours later. He ended up messaging me around eight in the evening that he will call me the next day at around 10AM(today, as I'm writing this) to clarify things.

He didn't contact me at all. I tried to call him at around 13:00 PM, but he didn't answer. At this point I am very annoyed with this behaviour and I don't know if I should message him or just leave it as it is. I also gave up on the idea that I would be working there for the summer.

But I already wasted a week with this bullshit and I am also getting quite demotivated with this stuff. It took me 3 weeks to get to this point, and there are less than 2 months of summer left(I can't work in the last week, I have some plans I cannot change). Even if I wanted to find another place to work at, I don't think anyone would want to hire someone for only a month.

Whatever, I had my boyfriend, I was in love, I would get through it ( LOL).

470,"I hate to use the term hoe lightly. I apologize if I fail to use another more appropriate term.

She's been in a relationship that didn't work out because the guy she was with wasn't ready for sex while she was. They mutually agreed that it wasn't going to work out, and broke up.

She then went to a guy that was all for her. He helped her through that breakup. After a few months, they had sex. That relationship didn't work out too well either a few months after that. 

Now that she's lost her virginity, she likes to go and meet up with guys. She evidently is not ready for a real relationship, but this is what she does. Just for a few days they talk, meet up and go out. She would let them fuck only if they showed interest and if she's known them from the past. These are the only two circumstances, and in her book, her motto is ""whatever happens, happens"".

She used to never want to talk about anything close to sex with me (sex jokes etc), but she now can talk so openly about it. I've lost my virginity way before she did, and when I asked her for favors to bring me to my girlfriends house to have sex, she would get upset and disgusted (at the time I didn't have a car and she did, my ex lived farther from me). 

Now she's with another guy that she's been talking to for a few weeks. They've known each other when they were younger. This guy is clearly a douchebag looking to ""open his heart"" just so that he can have sex with her. I shouldn't judge a book by its cover, since I don't know the guy, but the way she talks about him shows all the red flag signs.

My concern: she is a wonderful person with great morals and I've always looked up highly to her. I don't want her to fall in this pit of not respecting herself. I don't want guys hurting her, making her think that they are ""the one"", when in reality she's gonna get her feelings crushed. I know in the long run this is gonna destroy her mentality on how she sees relationships and I feel it would make a huge impact on finding the right guy when time comes to that. I claim that she is slowly becoming a hoe because she likes to use the term ""Hoeing around"" lightly.

What do I do? What do I tell her? Should I just let her be and she will learn on her own, or do I step in and draw the line for her?

We cooked together, caught up about our weeks, just normal friend stuff. Later in the night she confessed to me how she could see herself in a relationship with me. Now, to give some important context, this is a girl I have had hidden feelings for pretty much since I've known her, but I was in a relationship when we first met and I've been very content being single since being out of said relationship to focus on school and starting a career. This girl and I are both graduated and in the midst of job searching, so it's still a bit of a hectic time in our lives and therefore we both decided to just be cautious and see where things go after admitting feelings for each other. Problem is, I can't keep my mind off of her since. I can't focus on work or my usual routines. Everything is just off. I have work responsibilities I need to get done every day as well as wanting to stick in a normal routine of exercising and eating well but it's all gone to hell the past few days. We are going to try and only see each other once a week or so to try and grow our relationship instead of rushing into it, but as you can probably tell it's definitely messing with me.

I stopped doing this when I was 15 after being told I was too skinny and looked ill (looking back on photos, I did look malnourished and sick) my mental health has also been down the drain this whole time, due to the death of my mum and my dad fucking off.

493,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

I self-harmed last saturday by taking a shit ton of cough meds and then had panic attacks so bad that I finally decided to go to the ER. I'm better now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to pay for this ER visit out of pocket, and not with my parent's insurance plan- I'm on their plan until I'm 26, but I'm an independent adult who lives alone and I would prefer my privacy be respected on this point. So I don't want them getting a statement from an insurance company or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got tons of cash and can easily pay whatever the bill is- but who do I call? Or what the hell am I supposed to do here? If my parents do end up getting a statement from the insurance thing, will it include details as to why I was in the ER? Isn't that a hippa violation? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just annoyed because I was assured upon being checked into the ER that no one would know about this. For this reason I specifically did not give them my insurance info and did not sign the sheet that allowed them to release my info to the insurance company- yet upon discharge, I asked some woman at a desk ""how is this getting paid for?"" and she was like ""they'll bill your insurance, the registrat must have looked it up with your SSN/parents names"". I asked if that could be undone and she said she had no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, ???

494,"First of all, sorry for the bad English. It's not my first language. Also, I'm on mobile

I'll explain the situation first.
So my mom had a seizure last Sunday. She was cleaning something and hit her head hard while she was at it. She lost some blood and blacked out in the bathroom. When she fell, she did hit the toilet with her head causing the seizure. Because of this, she was hospitalized until today when I picked her up. Luckily she didn't suffer any permanet damage and she is getting better day by day.

The problem now is:

Local law forbids her from driving a car because of the seizure for three months. Because of this, she can't get to her work normally. She could go by public transportation but won't always work since she sometimes needs to transport things for her work.
The second problem is, that she is a freelancer. She works at an museum and gets payed per hour. Because of this, she already missed out on 600€ this month and it is going get worse every day she isn't at work. She is the sole provider(?) of the household, which doesn't really contributes for the better. I don't make much money since I'm still an apprentice. Most of the money I make goes into my car which I need to get to work. I also can not drive her to work since mine starts way earlier than hers.


What we did think of would be selling my car (I would then drive hers in the meantime) and buying her an E-Bike but since selling a car probably won't work in the next two days we need a faster solution. Also, my car is not really worth that much(max 1000€)

Does anyone know what we can do to get out of this?",02Jul2019,1

So around December of last year I decided to end a 15 year friendship with the boy/man who was, at one point, my best friend. He had been ghosting me for *months* and during those months I came to the painful conclusion that I just didn't like him anymore. It caused me to reflect on those 15 years and realise way too late that I was always the friend who put in the effort; it was never him. Around a fortnight ago he emailed me out of the blue. 

My reply was simply:   
'Here is my PayPal: \[INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS\]  
£100 still owed for the \[EVENT\] ticket

Cheers'

That £100 is something he'd been promising to pay me back since 2017 when the event I bought his ticket for took place.

There are four other people living there other than him, myself, my husband, two other friends. The only person who he will accept as a cosigner other than me (and I can't because of student loans) is our friend with no credit history. We are therefore trying to help her build her credit so that she can cosign. She previously did not even show up in Credit Karma. Now, since she has been an authorized signer on another friend's credit card, she at least shows up. But they have had the card for over about 6 months and she still has no credit score.   


According to the bank that card is with, her being an authorized signer on the account should build her score. I added her to my credit card account (she won't have a card, just be authorized on it) and my bank told me that she would get credit bureau reporting for the account starting on the next billing cycle.

500,"I am 35M struggling to find good friends. With the hype of social media, it is too easy to get caught up in adding and approving friends requests. People don't seem to value phone calls or physical interaction like we used to. Growing up in a family of narcissists I became a black sheep because I called everything out as opposed to rug-sweeping everything. Now, I am fully independent and in a ten year relationship with my amazing wife. We are both introverts and unless someone makes us feel otherwise are for the most part unapologetic about it.

This didn't come up as an ""ïssue"", until i started going to university. I am pursuing my degree in child &amp; youth care which the equivalent of a social work degree only more hands on and on the frontlines. This field is female dominated with only four guys out of 46 women most aged 18-25, only two of us in our thirties. Before this, I was a cook for eight years. Anyone who has cooked for a long time knows that its like a big family, loyal, fun loving and very crude and real conversations, holding nothing back. Now, fast forward to school. Those ""friends"" have deleted me and slowly one by one took themselves out of my life. I tried to maintain contact but to no avail. Now I am in a new group of people.

If anyone knows me, knows don't double cross this guy. I will call you out and hold you accountable if you show a pattern of behavior such as canceling dates, saying ""if you need anything, I'm here for you"" while never stepping up, (lip service). if you say anything behind my back and I find out, you're out! I have little to no tolerance depending on how deep and meaningful our relationship is.

I had a conversation with my sister about this yesterday. I have two very good friends. We chat on the regular and are honest, loyal and when we cant make an planned event we let each other know with legitimate reason.

At university, I have came close to making good friends but fast got 'das boot!' for making false promises of showing up for planned events-three paint nights (hosted by me, I'm an artist), one board game in the school bar, multiple coffee dates. One ""friend"" I had deleted because she was a ghost both on social media and in person. I deleted her. She came with a sob story that had fast become and phrase that has been overtly used and abused ""I'm going through some s\*\*t"". Its been used to get extensions on papers (our professors are weak sauce) and a means to excuse showing up. I gave her the benefit of the doubt as she was the only one out of maybe 10 i deleted for the same reason to come forward. She continued to ghost me and to make matters worse, we were joined together for a group assignment. My role was to research and provide a rationale for group therapeutic activity for a specific age group with specific traumatic issue (fun stuff really), her role was editor. It came about that we needed to improve a few things myself included yet I didn't know until last minute the day before. she learned this a week before. Apparently she went to our professor complaining about my work saying that I did not communicate with the group as to where is was with my research. This was a lie! I could show messages of me asking  ""Is it good?, Hows my work? what can I do better? When can we meet?"". All I got was thumbs up and vague replies as to when we could meet, essentially avoiding meeting altogether. Last meeting we were suppose to bring this up. Three women and myself- the group. Use three met up and promised to address the issue but it never came up, all of them completely avoided it. I didn't bring it up as I shook my head. It was last assignment of the year and the work itself was rock solid so our mark was in the bag. We got a 94% mark. I deleted AND blocked her. 

This is just a small example of everyday life in this program. 

My sister says that I will die alone for my strict policy. She claimed that she and her besties have had multiple falling outs. My reply was what kind of friends do you have where you can wrong each other repeatedly and be ok with that. Her reply was that ""people mess up and make mistakes"", my reply was that there was clear distinction between mistakes and bad decisions. Mistakes are where you did everything you could to avoid any errors and consequences and still something went bad, while a bad decision is where you knew all those consequences and did nothing to mediate or minimize them. I find that people tend to downplay their roles and actions by calling them mistakes when in fact (in my opinion) they were bad decisions which are malicious and selfish.

My sister claims that I must cut people slack for their ""mistakes"" or I will die alone. I strongly oppose this and wonder what you guys might have to say on the matter-mistakes vs bad decisions-my personal policy of holding people completely accountable. too harsh or rightly so?",02Jul2019,1

510,"Hello everyone. This has been something I cannot stop thinking about. My anxiety is at an all time high and my cousin’s wedding is still over a year away.

My cousin and I are very close. She moved out of state to get a better job and we haven’t seen each other in some time. She met someone and they’re getting married and I am so happy for them.

She send me a box in the mail with a bracelet asking me to be there for them to tie the knot. She asked me to be a bridesmaid. I know to some people it’s an honor but for me it’s sheer torture. I hate weddings, I hate trying on dresses, i hate the whole idea of being bossed around by the bride (I have been in weddings before) and I hate the idea of spending all this money when I’d rather just send it to her as a gift.

I know my cousin very well, I know she would say she doesn’t want the money she wants me. I am trying very hard to care about her wedding because I do care about her. I am actually getting married but do not plan on having a wedding because I really don’t see the point. I think it’s a waste of money and would just cause everyone such a burden and myself anxiety.

I also don’t make a lot of money, and my car won’t make it for much longer. The place she’s getting married has no direct flights, you have to drive 3 hours in if you fly. It’s an 8 hour drive which I could maybe afford, but I don’t know if my car can. The dress alone is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars, then staying at the hotel is a few hundred a night. I am freaking out.

I love her so much. I would torture myself just to make her happy and be in her wedding. Now I am so scared I won’t be able to afford it, and I have no idea how I will get there. What do I do?

Should I start saving now and just get over it? If I have a heart to heart with her, and explain my circumstance will that help me? I am worried she will then just offer to pay because she will want me there. If anyone has any advice, please anything will help me right now. 

TL;DR I love my cousin with all my heart and she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding out of state. I don’t think I will be able to afford everything and I don’t know what to do.

Hey everyone

Just figured out that I have “text neck”, or “forward neck posture”.

I’ve always noticed that I look terrible in photos because my neck also looks super long and awkward. At first I thought it had something to do with how I styled my hair, but now I know it literally is my neck.

While I don’t consider myself SUPER concerned with my physical appearance (don’t wear makeup, I have an easy hairstyle), I do care (I take care of acne, have good hygiene, have had braces), and my neck is very unsightly in my opinion. Also, it’s unlikely that this posture is very good for my health.

I’ve seen a few preemptive ways to AVOID forward neck posture, but not many to get rid of it once you have it. 

I assume I have this posture from being on my phone, constantly using a laptop for my required studies, and reading books. 

Does anyone have any advice on getting rid of this posture? Or, do any of you have (or have had) forward neck posture?",02Jul2019,1

526,"My family moved into the neighborhood in 2015 and have hated it ever since. It is me, my spouse and our two younger children. We live in an area where primary parking comes from parallel parking on the street. Some homes have garages and driveways behind their houses with ally access. For the most part everyone has parking etiquette, such as not taking up two spots with one car or parking in front of your neighbors houses etc. 

The issue we are experiencing is that our neighbor purposely takes up 5 spots with 3 cars and the only people it affects is our home. Bare with me because I know this sounds like I’m complaining but with a little backstory I’m hoping that someone can help me with advice on how to handle the situation. 

Our first interaction with this neighbor was shortly after we moved in and built a shed in our backyard that required us to remove part of our privacy fence. The shed sat on a small concrete easement in the back ally. It sat 3ft into our yard and then 3ft on the easement. The neighbor came out and checked on what we where doing and said that our shed was placed on his easement and that it prevents him from getting into his garage. We apologized because it was our first meeting with him and quite awkward. My husband said okay we will move it in as much as we can. We moved it in a foot and he came out again and still threw a fit. We asked how it was his easement when it was on our property line and he claimed that he had an agreement made with the pervious owner of our home that it would be his easement? WTH right? Also claimed he would get a lawyer to prove that we placed our property on his easement, and that he would sue us. We did our own research to try to find if anything legally had been made for this and found nothing. The neighbor never actually did anything about the situation and the shed was kept on our property. 

Now normally I would feel guilty if we had blocked our neighbors way of entering his garage, but 1 his garage was full of junk so he couldn’t park into it anyway and 2 you could fit a full size truck in the spot he claimed was inaccessible for his sedan. So I do not feel guilty what so ever. We could push the shed 5ft back and really make it inaccessible but why be pitty? We tried to approach him again to say we understand you don’t like the placement of our shed but we don’t believe it inhibits you from parking back there. What can we do to correct the situation? and he went off on us again, so we’ve just stayed away.

Here we are 4 years later and he still parks his 3 cars in 5 spots in-front of our house and his house.I really don’t mind parking away from the house normally, walking is good for the soul right? But I work second shift and get home to no spots and have had to park blocks away before. I am then responsible for carpooling in the morning and have to walk 4 kids to my car blocks away, sometimes in the snow as well.

Sometimes two of his cars won’t move for weeks or even months at a time. We’ve tried the route of having the police tag the cars if they haven’t moved but he just rips the sticker off and nothing comes of it. We normally do this in the winter because our street never gets plowed because the cars are always there. We are not the only neighbors who call about his car because it hinders the entire block from getting plowed. Also during winter, if we manage to get a spot in front of our house, we would shovel it out and come home to find his car moved into the shoveled spots. We got smart and stoped shoveling and just used our 4x4. It’s a lot of fun watching that guy try to get his sedans out of snow spots cuz he’s too lazy to shovel. 

He’s approached my husband twice now while carrying our kids inside and has argued/yelled at him in front of our kids. My husband has stayed calm because he was in front of our kids and just went inside. But later called me and blew up in private about the guy. 

I’m at my breaking point with this neighbor and I’m not sure how to handle the situation. He’s a reckless guy who has multiple battery charges on his record for hitting his wife (but somehow gets the charges dropped?) and we constantly get to witness the screaming matches he has at his family from inside their home. I’m not sure approaching him again is in the best interest for me or my husbands sake at this time. 

When talking to other neighbors they’ve claimed that nobody ever stays in our house because of him and that he drives people to the point that they want to leave. I love our house and the area we live in. I don’t want to go through the process of selling and buying a new home again. So I am just not sure what else to do. I know that it is public parking and there isn’t much I can do in those regards but I was just hoping someone had advice on how they’ve handled this type of situation before. Do we try to be civil and have a conversation with this guy again or do I just wipe dog shit on all his cars? Jk.",02Jul2019,1
527,"But how the fuck do I get over my cousin? (-insert Alabama joke- whatever) This is seriously taking a huge toll on my mental health. It’s to the point where I can see any other women and I won’t be attracted to them even if they’re hot. I’ve liked numerous other girls before but this is intense love I have never felt before for anyone else. I can only think about her. I only get to see her like once every 3 years and it fucking hurts. It hurts so much. I miss her already. I just find her really fun and attractive. Shes a cool person to be with and we both like similar things.

How can I stop being attracted to her? I don’t know if she shares the same feelings but shit man I just want this to stop. I can’t get over her and this has been bugging me for YEARS. It’s like I could date her forever without caring about any other women or cheating on her. 

I know it’s fucking weird but please give me some advice to help me get over her....it’s really fucking me up mentally and makes me feel like a sick bastard for liking my own cousin (Second cousin to be specific as well).

I am in Highschool and I live in Colorado, I told the girl I liked I had a crush on her in October of 2018, nothing came from it for a while but we starting talking a lot in February of 2019. We had texted steadily for months, our mutual friends told me she liked me sometime during when we were texting back and forth. We started to hangout more and more but usually it was her and I, we’d watch movies or go on walks and stuff like that but they were never dates. I had known that her family was going to move to Washington, but she had told me she was going to move after she finished Highschool. A few weeks ago she told me that her mom changed her mind and now they’re going to move to Washington in September of 2019. I never made a move or asked her if she’d be my girlfriend and now I won’t get to. She wants to keep talking when she’s in Washington but I’m so heartbroken and it hurts so much to talk to her even while she is still living in Colorado. I want to tell her that I can’t keep talking to her because of all the pain it puts me through knowing I can’t be with her but I don’t want to hurt her.

540," 

AITA-I am 35M struggling to find good friends. With the hype of social media, it is too easy to get caught up in adding and approving friends requests. People don't seem to value phone calls or physical interaction like we used to. Growing up in a family of narcissists I became a black sheep because I called everything out as opposed to rug-sweeping everything. Now, I am fully independent and in a ten year relationship with my amazing wife. We are both introverts and unless someone makes us feel otherwise are for the most part unapologetic about it.

This didn't come up as an ""ïssue"", until i started going to university. I am pursuing my degree in child &amp; youth care which the equivalent of a social work degree only more hands on and on the frontlines. This field is female dominated with only four guys out of 46 women most aged 18-25, only two of us in our thirties. Before this, I was a cook for eight years. Anyone who has cooked for a long time knows that its like a big family, loyal, fun loving and very crude and real conversations, holding nothing back. Now, fast forward to school. Those ""friends"" have deleted me and slowly one by one took themselves out of my life. I tried to maintain contact but to no avail. Now I am in a new group of people.

If anyone knows me, knows don't double cross this guy. I will call you out and hold you accountable if you show a pattern of behavior such as canceling dates, saying ""if you need anything, I'm here for you"" while never stepping up, (lip service). if you say anything behind my back and I find out, you're out! I have little to no tolerance depending on how deep and meaningful our relationship is.

I had a conversation with my sister about this yesterday. I have two very good friends. We chat on the regular and are honest, loyal and when we cant make an planned event we let each other know with legitimate reason.

At university, I have came close to making good friends but fast got 'das boot!' for making false promises of showing up for planned events-three paint nights (hosted by me, I'm an artist), one board game in the school bar, multiple coffee dates. One ""friend"" I had deleted because she was a ghost both on social media and in person. I deleted her. She came with a sob story that had fast become and phrase that has been overtly used and abused ""I'm going through some s\*\*t"". Its been used to get extensions on papers (our professors are weak sauce) and a means to excuse showing up. I gave her the benefit of the doubt as she was the only one out of maybe 10 i deleted for the same reason to come forward. She continued to ghost me and to make matters worse, we were joined together for a group assignment. My role was to research and provide a rationale for group therapeutic activity for a specific age group with specific traumatic issue (fun stuff really), her role was editor. It came about that we needed to improve a few things myself included yet I didn't know until last minute the day before. she learned this a week before. Apparently she went to our professor complaining about my work saying that I did not communicate with the group as to where is was with my research. This was a lie! I could show messages of me asking ""Is it good?, Hows my work? what can I do better? When can we meet?"". All I got was thumbs up and vague replies as to when we could meet, essentially avoiding meeting altogether. Last meeting we were suppose to bring this up. Three women and myself- the group. Use three met up and promised to address the issue but it never came up, all of them completely avoided it. I didn't bring it up as I shook my head. It was last assignment of the year and the work itself was rock solid so our mark was in the bag. We got a 94% mark. I deleted AND blocked her.

This is just a small example of everyday life in this program.

My sister says that I will die alone for my strict policy. She claimed that she and her besties have had multiple falling outs. My reply was what kind of friends do you have where you can wrong each other repeatedly and be ok with that. Her reply was that ""people mess up and make mistakes"", my reply was that there was clear distinction between mistakes and bad decisions. Mistakes are where you did everything you could to avoid any errors and consequences and still something went bad, while a bad decision is where you knew all those consequences and did nothing to mediate or minimize them. I find that people tend to downplay their roles and actions by calling them mistakes when in fact (in my opinion) they were bad decisions which are malicious and selfish.

My sister claims that I must cut people slack for their ""mistakes"" or I will die alone. I strongly oppose this and wonder what you guys might have to say on the matter-mistakes vs bad decisions-my personal policy of holding people completely accountable. too harsh or rightly so?",02Jul2019,2
541,"I am 16 for context, working my second job as a line cook. I’ve been working at this place for 2 and a half weeks, however only one week of that was spent working. My boss told me he’d be training a couple other part time workers last week and he’d give me a call figuring out a more permanent schedule. That’s fine and dandy. However, it got to Friday and he still hadn’t called. I decided to try and contact him myself and no one picked up. I’ve been trying to contact him every day since, with other employees picking up instead and just telling me he’d call me later (hasn’t happened yet). He doesn’t have a cell phone so I can only call during work hours. 

Now today, after over a week of waiting to be contacted, I called and asked to speak to him directly because it was extremely important. See, my dad doesn’t work and my mom got laid off last week. I’m the only one in my house working. I need to make money. And I wanted to explain that to him, but instead of speaking to me, he just took the phone from my coworker and hung up. 

I’m getting the inkling that this is unprofessional, but I’m afraid to quit. I need the work, and they were paying me well. Plus I live in a small town and don’t want to burn bridges.

My neighbor was driving into her driveway beside our store and she hit the structure and the poles broke and the whole structure fell down as well. 

My dad hasn't experienced this before so we're wondering what to do, do we ask her to pay for 100% of the cost it would take to replace it? And if we choose to not replace it, do we still ask for compensation? How about for the destroyed flowers? 

Some extra details that could be important I guess, the structure can't just be put up again because the wooden poles actually snapped. Some flowers were just ran over as well.

First time posting in this sub! I'm a program director in training at a youth camp (ages 10-17) in California, USA and I've been delegated with the task of making the 4th of July a special day for our campers. I am hoping someone in this thread will have ideas. 

So far, the staff will be wearing red, white, and blue clothing/accessories, we have someone to sing the national anthem at morning flags, and we are going to rig up a massive Garrison flag to hang from our climbing tower. Any other ideas?

I should add that because our camp is in a National Forest, we cannot set off fireworks...

Our actual program and camp directors are justifiably nervous about singing any patriotic  songs because there really isn't enough time to practice them with the whole staff and ensure everyone knows the words.

557,"I (23/M) am verging on a decision for which graduate program to attend. I’m an English creative writing undergrad with a minor in cinema studies. I’ve applied and been accepted to 2 screenwriting film programs.

One is a top-ten film school that would be the best for me career-wise and school-wise because, of course, it’s in LA. I’m in Northeast Ohio. It’s also very expensive. So while it’s the best career choice, I would have to move there (most likely drive my car 1000s of miles) as well as pay for that large cost of tuition over a 3 year program. It starts in late August.

The other is a low-residency (meaning I don’t have to live on or near campus) screenwriting program located in Kentucky. It’s also a third of the cost and only 2 years. It starts in mid November.

Here’s the kicker: my distance gf (F/23)of nearly a year broke up with me several months ago, citing to want to work on herself (very valid). Her goal and what she wants to work towards in the future is for us to come back together. We still talk, snap, text, and visit (monthly where we still kiss and cuddle and become affectionate but usually nothing more) after we broke up because we want to be together but it just doesnt work for the moment. We are also (to my knowledge and from what she’s said exclusive to each other). I’m waiting on her and told her I would, and I would support her through this, however it’s not entirely certain we will be back together soon. The second option lends itself more towards this relationship-focused future. I very much love her and want a future with her but I don’t know if I should keep waiting around for her to want to make the leap for us to be together again. 

I’m leaning towards the second option at the least to bide myself time for me to at least TRY things with her while still getting a decent education and should she not want to commit, transfer programs to the first option.

TLDR: Grad school choices: one’s good for career, the other is possibly good for social/relationship life with an ex",02Jul2019,1

Alright so this is a classic „first world problem“ but I‘m somehow really fucking terrible at this one aspect, I just haven‘t learned to deal with that mentally and it‘s unhealthy. Simply put, this is anexample of the problem. I‘m a male, this problem applies to girls only.

Ex 1: I‘ll text a girl wishing her good luck for her first day at work, hopefully she found a good place. She does not reply to that. Ok this does sound really childish but if you don‘t have the right mindset, it pulls you in a weird state. Why is that a problem? Not because I blame her for not answering and that I want her to be a robot that‘s always available, but there is another issue...

I don‘t know where the boarder is. I don‘t wanna seem like someone who would suck up to her ass and wish her luck no matter if she cares about it or not. But I also don‘t wanna play the buthurt person who will never ask a word about her job again, cause she didn‘t wanna reply. I just haven‘t ever learned how to deal with a situation where you don‘t get the expected reward. 

I don‘t know, I have a really bad sense of doing something for a person just for the sake of it. I‘m obviously hoping I‘m doing her good by saying something like that. If I didn‘t do any visible good, I question if people deserve what I did. And then I have a stupid debate with myself wether I should care for what she does the next time or not.

Thanks, I know this is hard to understand, I hope I got the point across.

Recently i was approached by corporate and asked if i would write a list of all of the accessories i keep in stock to help the other stores figure out what they should be ordering that they are not right now. initially i thought 'no problem' and agreed, thinking this might make me look good to the folks upstairs, but then i spoke to my dad about it. He is of the opinion that i am basically giving away my 'trade secrets' for free and devaluing myself and that i should ask for a raise/promotion before helping the other stores do as well as my own. I can't  decide which is the best option for my career growth.

572,"I really don’t know how to say this, but I think I’ve come to terms with the fact that I might really want to have sex with an older friend of mine and the fact that she probably doesn’t feel the same has made me start to have negative feelings towards her. I know this is ridiculously immature, and I want to change how I feel, I just need some advice. 

Some background. I am a 22-year-old med student [M] and I actually have had a reasonably active dating and sex life up until entering medical school. Admittedly my dating life has slowed down drastically and If I’m being square my sex life has pretty much ended outside of one encounter. That said, I haven’t really been hung up on it because of medical school being so busy. 

My friend is a [29F] is a pretty good friend I’ve made in medical school. We’ve only known each other about a year now and while not besties or anything, we’ve definitely become pretty good friends. To the point we have talked about some fairly personal things including our sex lives to some degree. While she hasn’t been seeing someone new each week or anything, she’s had maybe 5 or 6 encounters in the year. Not by any means a ton, but for a grad student having to study most of the time and having been in 3 somewhat serious relationships in that time I’m admittedly a tad jealous she’s been able to stay so active. 

Things kind of changed a bit with her most recent partner. She and I had planned to hang out, and she unexpectedly just kind of never called or texted when we were supposed to go. I later found out it was because she was spending the night with a guy she was going on a second date with. Unlike previous times of knowing she had a boyfriend or date or what have you, this was I guess the first time I was completely aware she was busy because she was having sex and I unexpectedly was really jealous. The kicker was that I wasn’t jealous she was having sex, I was actually jealous of the guy. I know it’s an uncomfortable thought, but if I’m being honest I think I was jealous not only he was able to get her but also that he did it so quickly, in under a week and within two dates when in the past she’s told me she’s a third date type person.

At the time it didn’t quite register that it was jealousy. But it also registered that  I’ve admittedly started to think of her a bit more sexually. I won't go into details, but undoubtedly sexual based thoughts regarding her.

The thing is, while she’s never outright said something like “I have no interest in you” she has suggested the age difference is a bit much for her, that she doesn’t want to date/sleep with a classmate, and that she has a certain type (that I don’t quite fit). 

Since the recent guy thing, I’ve noticed I’ve been a bit more hypercritical of her. It didn’t quite click that I had been hypercritical of her until we were talking somewhat recently and she mentioned that I’m one of the few friends she confides in emotionally at the school. It was then I realized I had been critical of her, thinking poorly of her, and admittedly maybe being jealous of the guy she was sleeping with. I finally came to terms with the reason being that maybe I do want to have sex with her and I’m upset that it won’t happen. I feel like such an ass and I know it’s a horrible thought process to have, but I have come to accept that yes I think it is jealousy that’s been causing the recent negative attitudes and I just don’t know how to get over such jealousy. I know she in NO way owes me anything be it friendship wise or sexually, and I guess I’m just asking for advice on how to get over her sexually and just be a good friend.",02Jul2019,2

I have recovered significantly from the social anxiety but it has morphed into some sort of academic anxiety. I am currently attending college and taking a summer calculus course to get ahead. I had a 93% in the class until the most recent exam (the second to last exam of the semester) in which I got an overwhelming feeling of panic that led to my subsequent very low grade of a 60%  on it. Due to this failure my anxiety continued to increase and I did not go to class for the next two days for fear of facing the professor and other students. The final exam is tomorrow and I’m terrified that the same thing will happen again and that I will fail the class. I don’t know how to stop the anxiety and I’m scared to even go to take the exam. Should I take the exam or just sit at home and hide from it? If I take it how can I calm down?

They both have mental health issues and they are each going through a depressed period in their life. Because of this, both of them are constantly snapping at me (separately, they don’t team up on me or anything) and taking things out on me. They’ve both admitted they do this and basically said something along the lines of that because of their depressed state that I need to have mercy on them and accept the way they treat me without reacting negatively, and that if I don’t comply with that then “well then I’ll end up dead”. (I have mental health problems myself but I will say they each have it worse than me)

608,"I will try to make this as straight forward as possible as all the facts are kind of confusing.

Back in February 2019 I got a DUI. 

Previously I was seeing a certified social worker for therapy/help with drinking but she retired and I felt well enough to stop seeing someone. I saw her from April 2018 - November 2018.

My lawyer regarding the DUI case suggested I start seeing someone to get ahead of what the court may decide (on classes/counseling etc.). I assured him I already reached out to the same office where I was previously counseled and requested a certified drug and alcohol counselor.

I began seeing her not even a week after the DUI, and all was well. She was a little lackadaisical, but I enjoyed our sessions and just talking to her sometimes not even focusing on alcohol was really helping me.

Two sessions ago (2 weeks ago) she was extremely ""tired"". I mean literally closing her eyes while I was talking. I could tell it seemed like she didn't even realize her eyes were heavy and closing on her. I got suspicious.

This past session (yesterday) I reminded myself of her past behavior and that maybe I should keep an eye on her behavior.

Well as you may as well expect she again was ""tired"" eyes closing as she was talking or listening. This time I also noticed speech slurred slightly and this time I really paid attention - her eyes glassy and pupils pinned. Her office has very dim almost sensual lighting, so there's no reason why pupils should be pinned, they never were previously.

My best friend had a problem with heroin (3 years clean!) So it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the symptoms. Or the excuses (being tired is an easy excuse when your eyes keep closing...).

My problem is: I have to keep seeing her until the courts decides whether or not I need to take the court mandated classes or if I can take the classes privately (meaning continue what I'm doing with my counselor ie. The one I think may be on drugs).

I just don't know how to proceed because I really can't afford the court mandated classes (between $500 and $1000). And I don't know how I feel about confronting her as a patient.



What would you do in this situation? Should I ask my lawyer? 



And yes - DUI is a horrible offense (in US a misdemeanor) and for me, my case is being dismissed but this does not make what I did okay, and I still don't know why I chose to drive because even though I've had problems with alcohol in the past I have always made the right choices to not put others in danger.

616,"My ex and I broke up almost a year ago after an almost 2 year relationship with a 3 month break somewhere in the middle. When we broke up for the last time, he found out the real reason I had left him when we took a break the first time around. I still wasn’t over the person I was seeing previously and was unsure about my feelings. 

He was really hurt, but surprisingly was able to move past it and actually seemed like he still wanted to keep trying. He was showing me affection and we were talking daily and hanging out occasionally, but I met another guy. I told my ex that we couldn’t be physical and we were really broken up this time. I think he was upset about that and he told me he thought we shouldn’t speak anymore because it would help us both move on. I know it was right of him to make that decision. He stated “it’s not like we’ll never talk again”

So I started dating someone new and never heard from my ex again. It’s really weird because I never broke up with someone and left on such good terms while still caring about them so deeply. All the time I’ve been with my current boyfriend (who I think I will be leaving soon, unfortunately) I haven’t stopped thinking about my ex. I wonder how he’s doing and if he would even still speak to me. I don’t see why not if we left it the way we did and I just think maybe he never contacted me out of respect knowing I was with someone new.. but maybe also out of anger or jealousy. 

I keep having dreams about him as I always have and the days I wake up from those, I always go through our old pics and videos which I stupidly can’t part with. This just puts me in a hole and makes me feel more upset. Why do I do it to myself? I’ve been thinking uncontrollably about contacting him when I am single again. I’m afraid he’s with someone new which is fine and I would be happy for him, but also don’t want to be that girl and I have no way of knowing if he is single. I worry that he won’t respond, which I guess gives me more closure. I worry he might think I’m weird or desperate or anything else. And I really worry that maybe he has just grown to resent me. 

Of course, there were many reasons we didn’t work out. I take the good and the bad, although now it seems so much harder to see the bad parts of the relationship or him. Should I contact him? Am I being selfish? Will I regret it? I just can’t stop thinking about him whether it really was love or just infatuation.",02Jul2019,1

I've had to beg for money from my fiance every month for the past 6 months because I spent too much and am going to overdraw, and most of the time I overdraw anyway.  I've tried freezing my cards. No luck.  I microwaved them in a last ditch effort to get to them quickly and destroyed them.

623,"Hey guys, first time poster here.

I'm a 22 year old who just graduated from my university with a social science degree. I loved undergrad, and got a solid GPA. My plan for the last couple years has been to attend law school. I chose this because I'm interested in public policy, and want to do something to serve and support marginalised communities in the US. I took the LSAT a few months ago and did okay, enough to get me into a decent regional school. I'm fortunate enough to have about $150K in a mutal fund that would allow me to go to a regional law school with little or no debt. I've been preparing to retake the LSAT to get a better score and hopefully more scholarships. I've got my letters of recomendation subitted to LSAC. In otherwords, I'm well on my way to apply this fall and start in 2020.


However, much of the discussion over on r/LawSchool has made me question my choice. Sometimes I'm excited about it, sometimes I'm completely freaked out. I've never worked in a law office, or even had a full time job. Not only is there a generally negative attitude towards law as a career and the value of a JD, people say you should only go if you are absolutely certain you want to be a lawyer. How can I be certain at this age and with no actual legal experience? I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life at all. Its such a huge investment of both my time and money, and I feel woefully unprepared to make this decision. Am I just getting cold feet, or am I right to hesitate?


I started looking into masters programs (like an MPA or MPP) but most of the reddit discussion on those recomends pursuing them only if you have already started your public sector career.


My mom is encouraging me to stick with law school, because she sees it as a reliable path to a good career. Whenever I talked to her about my doubts, she seemed disappointed in me and said I was just psyching myself out. She was already unsure about me taking one year off between undegrad and law, and worries that I'll either forget how to study or get busy working and decide not to go at all. I've been telling people for years now that law school is my plan, and even just having doubts makes me feel like a flake and a failure.


 I've spent the last couple days compulsively googling ""is law school right for me"", ""employment statistics for JDs"", ""Law school vs MPA"" and so on. I'm desperate for some kind of clairity, some way to see the path forward, and I can't find it. I dont know if I can trust the advice of those I normally go to for help (my mom and my girlfriend), because they've never been in this situation before.


I feel so lost, confused and underprepared. Anxiety and depression don't help, and my bi-weekly therapy sessions haven't changed much. I'm exhausted, ashamed, scared out of my mind, and at this point just want to go live in a cabin in the woods or something.

625,"I'm sure others feel this way too. Having grown up around all this technology I can't seem to properly connect with the people around me. For example, when I'm at parties there are all these people that I'd like to talk to (Usually girls) and I just can't find the words to continue or even kick off the conversation I wish we could be having. This happens with everyone from my closest friends to old acquaintances to new love interests. I often leave the conversation with a feeling like I really could have shown this person that I'm truly interested in what they've got to say or I could have made some good progress within the relationship but I just malfunction as soon as I'm immersed in the conversation. 

How do you get around this sort of thing? I hate small talk because I feel like the other person will think I'm some sort of shallow person that can't come up with anything deeper than ""How are you enjoying the warm weather?""

I have tried to lose it and it just comes back on. I noticed that now that I’m “bigger” he has started to comment about it more frequently and tells me I’m doing everything wrong and I need to lose weight this specific way he wants to do it. He is a super healthy guy who does calorie counting and exercising but I just need something simpler and I have told him this many times but he doesn’t listen. To add to this whenever we go out he seems to stare at other girls who are super thin and it seems he just wants someone who’s thinner and it has made me super uncomfortable to even go anywhere besides work I rarely leave the house now due to feeling depressed about it all the time

629,"I rent privately in a relatively nice working class area, I rent in a 2 story block of 8 flats, 4 below 4 up top with one shared lobby door per top flat and I take it as a personal responsibility to make sure the main lobby door is always locked not just for myself but for the lady across the landing from me.

I take her personal security as seriously as my own, anyway around the corner from us is a halfway house.  Ex convicts drug addicts people with serious mental problems, live and let live okay but one of the residents doesn't have any social boundaries.  I've caught him trying to open the main lobby door when the lady across the landing left it off the latch while she got her shopping out from her car.  Luckily I was right behind him and stopped him.

Seriously he has no concept of keeping personal distance from others, if I caught him inside on the stairwell I'd have no option but to beat the living crap out of him and I'm a man of peace.  He gives me the creeps I don't trust him and he is a threat to women as far as I care.

He's done other stuff in local shops where social boundaries were ignored, myself and other blokes keep an eye on him everytime he's out and about and he always stops young women and old ladies to 'chat' with them.  He avoids me like the plague because I don't give a fuck what his problem is and won't put up with his bullshit.  He's even suckered my dad into feeling pity for him and I had to tell him a few facts including the attempted home invasion.

My lady friend when she stays over doesn't lock the main lobby door when she goes out to work or when she comes back, I've already pointed the local nuisance out to her and it's imperative she avoids him and never to hesitate phoning me should he try and corner her.

I know I sound like a POS snob but he also threatened to kill local kids because they cheeked him, I've been cheeked numerous times myself but never once did I threaten them.  He is all mouth but there is that nagging doubt at the back of my head of what he was inside for?  child molestation or rape.

I don't want to spook my lovely very friendly lady friend from a really nice suburban area but she needs to know who she can trust and who to avoid without seeming like a right wing nut job.  How does one do it?",02Jul2019,2
630,"I have a rough time since I graduated with my BS in Chemistry. It's a long whiney story. I've finally reached a point where I'm dead set on taking the path I've ultimately always wanted, becoming a rad science teacher. The problem is getting there.

&amp;#x200B;

My father has become very unwell, and has been told by all the diffrent medical proffessions that have seen him he needs to go hospital, if he doesnt, he will die. He likely has sepsis, but he refuses to go hospital despite being told everything, he will not listen to anyone.

Ive sat him down and asked him if he understands the situation, or if its what he wants. He just claims he isnt ill (very clearly is).

Do i continue trying to get him medical care where possible against his will, as he seems to not think he is ill?

Examples of behavior:

Threatens to take my medication away, constantly says I don’t need it, tries to stop me from taking it, tries to control it

Telling me my grades aren’t good enough, or that I’m not working hard enough

Constantly monitoring my homework and grades

Always telling me I’m not spending enough time on my homework, or I’m spending too much time on it – no in-between

Making me feel guilty for not spending every waking second with her

Interrupting me in the middle of homework (forcing me to walk down a flight of stairs, answer a question that could have waited until I was done, walk back up a flight of stairs, then try to pick up my train of thought where I left off, usually costing me another few minutes as I try to get back into my rhythm), then getting mad at me for asking her to not interrupt.

636,"So someone on reddit sent me a PM out of the blue basically trash talking me politically, probably in response to a post I made. Basically calling me a dumb kid and trash talking in a very long-winded paragraph. This reminded me of the [Navy Seal Copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta) because the message was really long-winded and kept referring to me as a kid. So I sent a modified version of the copypasta as a response, thinking it would be funny and clever. (Sorry if a lot of the words seem weird, they're common on a certain political subreddit (r/ChapoTrapHouse):

*""What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you fucking chud? I'll have you know I graduated bottom of my class in my postmodern neomarxist university course, and I've been involved in numerous secret brigades on The_Donald and 4chan, and I have received over 300 confirmed hog pics. I am trained in posting and I'm the top Patreon contributor in the entire Grey Wolves. You are nothing to me but just another chud. I will wipe you the fuck out with praxis the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, nazi. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Antifa Supersoldiers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for re-education, fascist. The re-education that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your ideology. You're fucking cancelled, chud. Antifa can be anywhere, anytime, and we can protest in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with milkshakes. Speaking of milkshakes, not only am I extensively trained in posting, but I have access to Antifa's entire supply of cement and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ideology off the face of the continent, you massive chud. If only you could have known what woke praxis your little ""based"" and ""redpilled"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have fucking logged out. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn (pardon the ableism) idiot. We will toss milkshakes all over you and you will drown in them. You're fucking cancelled, chud.""*

So I sent this, and probably about ten minutes later, before the person responded, I realized my mistake, deleted it and basically said ""Ok for real though, I don't agree with political violence and *blah blah blah polite arguments to compensate*."" They didn't acknowledge the long ass copypasta in any way and responded with another argument. At this point I was in full panic mode realizing how stupid it was to send something like that, so I typed up a short apology explaining (and linking proof) that what I sent was based off of a stupid meme and that I was sorry for sending something that could be easily interpreted as a threat. 

The person hasn't responded but they've been very active on reddit, so they're probably choosing to ignore it. But I'm still panicking over the possibility that I am now exposed to being charged federally for threatening someone over the internet. Like, what if they've contacted police?

This might sound really stupid to all of you, but I recently got in legal trouble for juvenile delinquency and am incredibly worried that this stupid, stupid lapse in judgement was a terrible mistake. Basically I'm hyper-vigilant over any possible violation of law. I'm actually panicking right now, and have been for a couple of hours. I've been on reddit for years where that joke is normal, and I guess I just got desensitized to it.

I (26F) live in a pretty big city with lots of opportunity. I recently got married to my husband (27). I have been working in tech since 2013 and I'm currently working for a small MSP where I have no opportunity for advancement. I would consider myself to be sysadmin level. My husband also works in tech for a school and gets paid around 10k less than I do per year. I am currently going to an online school that, while accredited, is pretty shady and costs me around $800 a month. I once had a lot of savings, but since I had to finance two moves and also go back to school, I only have about 1.5k now. 

We do not have any debt. We live in an apartment that costs around 1k a month including electricity.  We want to move into a house and have children. If I were to stop going to school and just work on certs, I could save the money I am spending and we could afford to do that in a couple years. However, I am afraid that I will not be able to further my career without a bachelors degree. I have asked some of my colleagues and have gotten mixed responses about the value of a bachelors degree vs certs.

Unfortunately, we do not have a support system. My father passed away when I was young and my mother is mentally unstable and lives in another state. My husband has a very loving mother and an older brother who has an established life with his wife and kids, but they live about 3 hours away and can't help us financially regardless. 

If we have kids, I want for one of us to be able to stay home rather than having a babysitter or using daycare until the kid is school age. Since I have had more time to establish a career (my husband came from a place where he did not have the opportunities I had) it would be logical for my husband to stay home, which means I need to make enough money to support my family.

I've always wanted to pursue a career in graphic design, whether that was freelancing or working in a firm...

Unfortunately, I  kept that desire on the backburner for most of my life because everybody told me it wouldnt be a viable career for one reason or another. 

Eventually, I started working a job that was not at all in the creative realm, but they randomly gave me all the tools I needed to start designing (creative cloud). 

I did it non stop for months and months, and saw my skillset grow by a lot. Eventually I was meeting freelance clients left and right and started doubling my income (all work was done not on the clock,obviously). 

One night, while just messing around on a creative project, I created a cool emblem and put it on a t shirt mock up with a fictious brand name next to it. 

I sent it out to some friends and they asked how much it would cost to buy one, and then they told their friends...and their friends told their friends. 

I reached out to a local community shelter as they have a silkscreen service run by those who live within in the community, and now my prints will also give back to the community. 

I'm intrigued by streetwear, but as a person guided by faith I felt there was a lot of negative vibes in the fashion, so I wanted my fictious label to be a faith based label. 

When I reached out to the community shelter, they told me about several folks who would be interested in funding a project like this.

Due to work and bills, trips back home became seldom, but he always stayed in touch with his family, sent them money, etc. In 2008 we finally were able to afford for all three of us (mom, dad, me) to take a trip there and had a really great time.

Fast forward to last September and my dear dad passed away from a horrible disease he'd been fighting for four years. Due to the nature of his illness he was unable to communicate his last wishes (or anything at all) to us. Despite not having lived in his homeland for a few decades, he always remained very patriotic and incredibly proud of his homeland. He only spoke Serbian at home, consumed almost exclusively Serbian media, foods, had 90% Serbian friends, etc. He remained proudly Serbian through and through his entire life and his passion for his homeland was truly infectious (in the best possible way), hence my making the decision to ship and bury him back home, where he'd be laid to rest just up the hill from his childhood home among family. I just know beyond a doubt that this is what he would have wanted- it's a beautiful and scenic part of the world, which he always spoke about so fondly. I will lay there one day next to him, too.

Due to having to deal with various international governmental agencies he remained in limbo and was finally buried in mid-October back home. It cost me a ton of money, but I felt good about the decision. The only downside would be that I couldn't visit his grave more than once a year on the anniversary of his passing. This bugs me a lot as I'd like to visit him daily, but his family (his brother, brothers wife, and brothers son) promised they'd go daily on our behalf since they go anyways for their son, so that was nice to know.

Here's the thing though... on our trip there (first one in a decade) they barely seemed to shed a tear for him. For the first couple days they shed an obligatory tear or two, but by and large seemed unscathed by the whole ordeal- the horrible nature of his passing or the grand gesture of returning him home. In fact, their demeanour seemed completely normal and even joyous- not at his passing of course, but just in general. They're good simple people leading a very simple village life and tend to always be smiling/laughing, but there's a time and place for smiling and laughing- not when the widow and son of your newly deceased brother is in deep mourning. They would daily cry about their son (my cousin) who passed away five years ago, which I of course understand, but they did it to the point where they completely neglected to grieve my father, who his entire life spoke about them with the highest praise, always sent them money, called them, etc. He even brought a dozen families here leading to a better life than they'd have had back home. It seems all the great he did and whatever nice memories he had with them went unnoticed and that really bugs me. They make about 150 Euros there a month and upon leaving I gave them 1500 Euros. They were thankful when I gave it to them, but not overly so- it was almost as if though they were expecting it or it wasn't enough. I was there to bury my father and grieve the immense loss in his beloved homeland, not to laugh and be bled dry financially. I felt at home in Serbia, despite never having lived there and visited only once before as an adult, but their behaviour sort of alienated me. It feels like they genuinely don't care or view me as family and simply want to maintain contact because they know every year they'll get money from me when I visit on the anniversary of his passing.

I really do feel horrible for even voicing this, because I want so badly to believe that they genuinely care- it's my fathers brother, for crying out loud!-, but their behaviour didn't make me feel so. They were incredibly hospitable- more so than I've ever encountered anywhere else before-, especially considering their means, but it's not about the food spreads they laid out or the fact they wanted us to stay with them or anything like that; it's about how they handled his passing.

Maybe their time and distance apart made them feel less connected to him, and I know that phone conversations aren't the same as in-person exchanges, but it just wasn't possible for him/us to travel back frequently due to money. Plus he was always sending them money and calling as often as possible- he was very much ""in the loop"". Another of his brothers lives here as well, but we barely see him. It just feels like they're ungrateful and it's a horrible feeling.

Now we're just a few months out from going back again and I hate that in my mind I'll view them differently than before. I've made my mind up regarding them and it'll be very hard to change it. Their son (my cousin, who's 18 years older than me) messages me every couple weeks, but they're always such short (literally one word) exchanges that it doesn't feel genuine. I made an effort earlier on, but now find myself regretting having buried him back home- I thought they'd care much much more. They're also constantly just going on about money, crying about how little they make and how much things cost... but little do they know our expenses back home are tens of times what theirs are in just a month. In a month my expenses are what they'd make in 4-5 years! My friend who's from there but lives back here also told me that people there, despite making so little, are used to it and have lived their entire lives on such salaries/budgets. I just wish money wasn't a thing...",02Jul2019,4
654,"Okay so recently got a miniature pinscher puppy, for those who don’t know, they’re quite small. But everyone who sees him just picks him up.

I want him to be friendly with people but people shouldn’t do this. So what can I do or say because I’m so tired of people doing this. 

Edit: I have tried telling people not to touch him. I’ve told them he’s a puppy and not sure of people. I’ve told them he’s in training and not to grab him. People just won’t eff off.

655,"To start off, everyone in my family (other than my mom) is overweight. I obviously don’t like being overweight but it’s not a huge deal to me because my body hides it well. My little brother (14)  however is more than just a little overweight, which although I don’t like, it’s ok because it’s his body. But what I absolutely can not stand is how much crap he eats and how little he does. Every single day my dad takes him to the gas station and gets him a medium ICEE and a candy. Although I think it’s extremely unhealthy I’d be ok if he got a little exercise, which he doesn’t.  He’s in middle school, but got bullied so the exercise he got from walking around the school and PE dropped to nothing when he switched to online school. He always skipped out of PE because his knees hurt, and he would take a pain pill almost everyday to get rid of the pain. I convinced my parents he doesn’t need to take medicine everyday and that he’s just overweight. My parents took him to multiple doctors all just saying it’s growing pains, but he legitimately thinks he has something wrong with him that makes his knees hurt.Literally all he ever does is play on his computer, and comes down for food. All summer and a lot of the school year he’s been living that life. It’s not all his fault though, my dads been out of work on disability due to an injury and all we really eat is fast food, which doesn’t help my brother at all. When my family goes shopping they buy a ton of junk food, which sucks. Although I love my parents more than anything, I can’t stand their decision making when it comes to my little brothers health.

657,"Hi y’all. I’m 24 turning 25 this month and my little brother is 18. He’s always been an A+ student, where I was always making terrible grades and slacking. He just graduated from high school, hasn’t applied to college, won’t apply for jobs (retail, food service, etc), and won’t learn to drive or work to get his Driver’s License. My mom and his dad spoil him in ways that I never was. He got a trip to the Bahamas for graduating high school and all of these crazy fancy things, but now my mom is tired of him asking for $$ and expensive things without a job. 

I can’t relate because I still went to college even with my crappy grades, worked all through school, paid for my own driving lessons, found internships and fellowships, and worked my ass off. I’m not perfect (I messed up financially more times than i can count and I’m still getting it together), but he’s in such a good spot to work on himself. My mom even offered to buy him a car! 

I want to let him know that it’s totally possible to still do something with his life, but he’s so used to having people wait and baby him that he takes everything as a personal attack. It might be a mental health thing and I get it (I just did an inpatient stint).

666,"I used to handle a region of payroll by myself, but due to changes in management they decided to merge the regions and make one woman the manager of both sides. 

I was hesitant at first, I liked my old manager.. I didn’t really like this lady too much due to past experience working with her, not under her. 

As a manager she micromanages EVERYTHING. When doing the payroll on my own I had a certain order and way that I did things because I was on my own. I worked off of the emails that were submitted. If I had work left over at 5 on Monday I would leave it for Tuesday morning because the deadline was not until 10 am. Then I would start another project that we do in Tuesday’s. Again, working off the emails and moving them to certain folders once they were done. 

Ever since she has taken over she makes us do things exactly how she does it which is honestly disorganized and senseless in my opinion. She makes us print EVERY email for no reason.. she says we have to print every email and then print Tuesday’s project on Monday as well and “flag it” by putting these dumb stickers on the paper to know that we need to revisit it. As I mentioned before I used to work from the email directly.. so I would move it to a project folder and flag it virtually in the email to know I need to revisit it. She gets mad when I don’t do it on paper like she does. 

She has been getting increasingly mad about the rate in which I get my print outs too. The way our job is, we have to print at the very least every 5 minutes. Her email antics make it even more frequent. And sorry but I don’t think it’s convenient or an efficient use of my time to get up and organize pages every 5 minutes. The way we work on Monday means VERY high chance of staying late if it’s not done on time. I don’t like making that a reality because of stupid print outs. One week I had to stay until 9 pm (I get there at 7 am) because she doesn’t let us leave until we’re done. Remember earlier I mentioned that I used to leave at 5 regardless and then finish on Tuesday. She doesn’t like that!  

Yesterday she told me “go get your paperwork from the printer” like I’m 6 years old. Today, I had gotten through a lot of projects in a span of 2 hours. There were 6 print outs to be exact. When I was done I went to get them from the printer but they were gone. After looking twice and asking someone if they saw my pages my manager comes out and gives them to me because SHE took them. Who does that? She gave me a disappointment look when handing them back to me as if it’s my fault she decided to take them? 

What do I do if she keeps being childish and petty about print outs? She is payroll manager, not keeper of the shared printers. Everyone in the building uses these printers. You know what I do when someone else prints a huge stack or pages and leaves it? I sort it and take my stuff out and put theirs in the designated basket that we keep on top of the printers. Why is this a hard concept for my manager? And about the other issues as well, what do I do if she keeps micromanaging things that aren’t her business like how I work the emails? Talking to the VP (her manager) wouldn’t work. I’ve talked to him about how we shouldn’t be staying so late before and he told me to talk to my manager...",02Jul2019,1
668,"I’m 14 and I’ve never dated anyone before, even though that’s quite normal, whenever my friends talks about some cute guy they just met someone just always has to say ‘Hahaha aren’t you asexual?’ And I deny it because it’s not true and then they’d keep trying to convince me that I am asexual as if they have a say over it. There reasoning is because ‘You’ve never dated anyone or found them cute.’ Even though most of my friends haven’t dated anyone either!

670,"This is a kinda long story, so I'll try to shorten it as much as I can.

My ""friend"" is planning a runaway. I say ""friend"" because to me he is nothing more than somebody I used to know. Some info on him: he is 14 (I'm 15), he comes from a broken family; his mother is a drug addict and sex whore. He has.. 3 siblings I think? And every one of them has a different last name. He is currently living with his grandpa/grandma, but apparently they are no better. (Really his grandpa is just an ass but that's about it). And he thinks the end of the world is coming.

Last winter, we used to sneak out at night and go to places, like abandoned barns, that sorta thing. I'm done with that now, and I'm trying to stay out of it. Now, to the reason why I'm not his friend anymore: I have a long distance gf, and we've been together for about 7 months now. Last month she lost her phone, for pretty much the entire month. After a while, I started thinking that she had left me. She's my second gf and I didn't want to become super depressed like when my first gf left me, so I started watching porn again and trying to get nudes from people. When my gf texted me, I stopped that.

Anyway, my ""friend"" was being a real asshole to my gf and to, well, everybody. He is always boasting about having 15 some ""girlfriends"" that he only uses to get nudes from, so I called him out. Then he called me out for what I did. I stopped talking to him after that. And that brings us to now. A little about his runaway plan... We live in Ohio. He wants to go to the southern boarder, and then end up in fucking Minnesota where his ""real girlfriend"" lives.

This is where I need your help, what should I do? He keeps trying to make me go with him, but that's not gonna happen. He claims to be sorry for what he did, and that he's changed, but I don't believe him. He's said that stuff before. I have three choices, tell him to fuck off, set him up for failure, or actually attempt to help him plan. I really don't think he's gonna get even to the next city.

Please help me.

Edit: To say this as basically as I can, my ""friend"" was a real asshole to me and I don't want anything to do with him but he wants to me help him run away to like, halfway across the country. Should I help him?",02Jul2019,1
671,So my Australian GF is coming to visit probably in August and apparently just because she's a foreigner she's not allowed on base where I live. My first thought was to check extended stay hotels in the area and see their rates but the cheapest place I could find was still over 900 dollars for 30 days. I make $11.53/h and get fucked in the ass by taxes every pay check. So every two weeks I'm only bringing in about $755. I then thought about checking short term apartments in the area to see if there were any affordable options but they were all either low income housing (which I don't apply for) or required a six month lease. I don't wanna take on a six month lease just so my gf has a place to stay. I just wanna spend time with my GF while she's here but I don't want her to have to save up even more than she already has and I don't wanna put myself in the poor house just so she can stay in some shitty hotel for a month.

673,"I don't know, if this is normal, but I am desperate.

All my summer holidays were the same. My mum would work and I would just drive from relative to relative so they could look after me. I hated that other kids go to vacation or stayed home and I just wasn't able to enjoy my holiday. 

Last summer, I got a boyfriend. I was old enough to spend my holiday home and get some part time job. I started working with my mum as a cashier + I helped to put goods on the counters. (I don't know how to call it in English). I enjoyed it, because I was at work just like 2 times a week, so I could visit my boyfriend, een when we both had work. This holiday, I thought it will be the same. I said to my mum ""Please, I know I am needed at work, but I don't want to work more than 2-3 times a week so I could see my bf"" and she said ""Yeah, sure, since you both work at the same brand of shop ( Something like when Americans say that you both work in Wal-Mart but in a different city ), we can sync your shifts so you can see each other."" I was happy to hear that and with that, I said ""Ok, just call me when you will be ready to make our shifts.""

Two weeks later, summer holiday starts and I got my shift schedule. It was terrible. I got planned to work at least 4 days a week, sometimes in a row, it was completely out of the sync we decided on with my mum and my bf and I was working way more than other teenagers under 18.

I was shocked. I am done. I was looking for one holiday I could enjoy, but it feels like high school didn't end, it feels like I just continue to attend school and I feel more stressed then in my school year. My mum said ""We will break the law, cause you can't work like that, but it doesn't matter, you can work like that, I (the manager) won't snitch it"". 

She just messed up everything we agreed on. I am desperate. My boyfriend says I should quit the job, that he won't mind that I won't make money or I should just say that I won't attend some shifts. My mum broke the agreement between them too. We can't see each other for 2 weeks because of our shifts. 

I don't know what to do. I cry every night when I think about it and I think about running to my boyfriend's house every day and not showing up. I am afraid mum will be angry, boyfriend will have a hard time making enough money for our little trips to Prague (Capital city of our country) and I just don't know what to do.

Cal me what you want. Say ""Be thankful that you have a job"" or ""Don't complain, she is your boss"" but we had an agreement and she thought that she could just ignore it because she is my mom. I am angry, sad and desperate. I hope some people will actually help me decide on what to do, and I won't get just mean responses...

So I have a crush on this guy (let's call him Tom) and we are pretty good friends. One month ago, I confessed to him and he said that he liked me too, which made me feel really nice. (we were still not a couple). After that we were just kinda back to still friends. I attempted to ask him out, but he declined, saying the weather is gonna be bad (it got bad but really late in the night) and I got demoralised. Prom came along and a girl pushed me and him to a slow dance. We danced but he wouldn't even look in my eyes or smile or absolutely anything. Tom just looked like he wanted to be anywhere else.

Afterwards, he stopped talking to me, he just looked flustered when I was around him in class. He started talking a lot to this other girl and that was ok since I though he must have lied when I confessed. (they apparently arent together)

Yesterday me and a bunch of friends wanted to go to the arcade. Apparently, Tom came along. I was ok with it, even though I tried to forget my feelings.

Before she has kids, my mom really loved video games. A Link to the Past has been lovingly nicknamed “Moms Zelda” in our house.

But parenting is a lot of work, and she stopped playing at the SNES to, well, be a mom.

Now all her kids are in their 20’s and she’s ready to play again! Only she hasn’t played since the SNES and is having a REALLY hard time playing a 3D game rather than a 2D one.

I want to recommend her games, but I’m having a hard time. The games I like are really dialogue heavy and are a bit too complicated for her liking. 

She really wants to learn 3D controls (and despite her frustrations, she’s starting to understand how to move the camera!)

So far we got two games she loves: Mario Odyssey and an indie game called Baba is You. I just returned Mario Maker (surprisingly she didn’t like it!) and I’m buying Breath of the Wild right now.

Her favorite games from the SNES are Super Mario World, A Link to the Past, The Lion King, Page Master, Donkey Kong Country, and the Jungle Book game.

Really, I only really hate people I don't know and my anger is at its worst when I'm working(or shopping at walmart).  Today, this woman came into our store looking to buy new dog food do to the recent news abouit grain free dog food, and since 75% of our food is made by the companies that were listed as dangerous, she was rudew to me and my coworker because of it. Her smug, tiny scrawled on eyebrowed face made me so engraged, I left for lunch early and I threw a massive fit in my car and i ripped one of the buttons off of the sleeve of my shirt. If anyone has any tips on how to deal with working in a society where customer service jobs are the majority, please give them too me. I don't want to get fired for eventually snapping on a customer, and I don't want to go to jail for punching some smug bitch in the face because of dog food.",02Jul2019,3

686,"I think I’m a beta male, and I don’t want to be that. 


I was raised by my mom and so I’ve never been taught on how to be a man, or, what a man should be like. I’ve never had a masculine figure to guide me. 

I’m soft, open, submissive and do not confront people. I choke in confrontations with other males and I hate it. I’ve even let women have power over me. It’s especially worse since I’m an introvert, and thus shy. I’ve been used a lot too. 

Im weak with females and I hate that. 

But I don’t want to be weak, I don’t want to be ignored in groups, I want to be dominant and powerful. So I’m always super inspired by masculine men, because I’ve never had such a figure in my life. 

How can I stop being such a weak kid and finally become a man?

I fucked up the title guys. It originally should be the one above.


So this girl is a relative of mine(married to my first cousin).She's a few years older than me and I'm 18. So yesterday was birthday. I got up early (I had an exam) and I went on Facebook for a quick peek. It notified me about her birthday.

So let's come the ""event"". I wished her happy birthday. Then I said where's the treat for your birthday. Then she said come to my house. Then i made the joke. It goes like this (I wrote in Bengali) ""No need to go to your house,just send a nude and It will be a great treat"".

And before she said anything I said ""Don't take this the wrong way, it's just a joke"".
She replied ""It's ok,you can joke with me"".

After coming back from the exam I saw another message. She said ""What's a nude?"" [Reminder: we chatted in Bengali, Bangladesh is not the most literate country]

THEN I said ""Pls don't tell anyone I told you this,nude means [Enter the Bengali meaning]"".

Then she got angry. Said why would you joke about such a subject. I thought you were good. I think of you as a brother. She told me to stop joking or else she would come to my home and slap me.

So how do I make up with her?",02Jul2019,1

One major part of our company culture is that we don't say ""that's not my job,"" when someone asks for help, which is why I've allowed this situation to get to this point. 

One coworker in particular is a ""business development specialist"" at one location (not the same building) of our organization. I provided her with assistance in downloading survey data for her department, which is a (small) part of my job as a data analyst. Since then, I have been inundated with questions about a) things I've already told her how to do and b) little things that she should already know how to do as an adult in  the working world.

Recently, she's been asking questions about VERY basic functions of Excel - I made her a step-by-step screenshotted guide of how to filter a spreadsheet and wrap text, and included a link to Microsoft's support page for Excel should she need anything else. She insists on continuing to email me for troubleshooting help (""text wrapping isn't working"" ""how can I make the font bigger and fit all columns on one page when I print?""), and frankly, I am at my breaking point. I am an analyst, not tech support, and I have other duties to attend to that don't involve catering to this coworker's every need, especially when as a ""business development specialist,"" she should be able to at least complete basic tasks in Excel.

723,"Recently (well ever since getting married) my wife has began just jumping to conclusions about absolutely EVERYTHING! Now I work in tech and you have to understand that any time I speak with her here recently its like speaking with someone who 'doesn't know anything about computers' and is 100% end user with constant PEBKAC problems. (PEBKAC = Problem exists between keyboard and chair.)  


We have been together for a solid 7 years but its like getting married changed her. Its not like everything about her is different but this one thing is really driving me crazy because I cannot get a very simple set of information out example:  


Lets say I have to tell her three things about her PS4 (purely hypothetical scenario):    


1. A button fell off of it. It still works if you just push the place it used to be.   


2. I didn't break it I found it that way.  


3. I can fix it but it would require taking it apart.  


Me: ""Hey I just wanted to tell you about your PS4 really quick there is a problem with...""  


Wife: ""OH MY GOD DID IT BREAK? I can't stand if it...""  


Me: ""What? No.""  


Wife: ""I mean what could have happened to it that isn't it BREAKING?""  


Me: ""Just let me finish... A button fell off of it but it still works if you just put...  


Wife: ""Did YOU break it? I didn't break it! I've been at work all day?! I mean what happened!?!?!?!""  


Me: ""I didn't break it, I just found it that way.""  


Wife: ""So you are saying I BROKE IT?""  


Me: ""NO! I didn't even IMPLY THAT!"" (This kind of shit is in almost every conversation here recently. If I say 'its raining outside' she will just start yelling ""SO YOU ARE SAYING I MADE IT RAIN?"" Like what the actual fuck?)  


Wife: ""Then how would it have broken. Things don't ""just break."" I mean what else could you mean by saying you didn't do it?""  


Me: \[Defacto sounding\] ""I work in electronics, they 'just break' all the time. You know that thing that breaks almost everything: Use.""  


Wife: (After a loud psigh) ""Oh ok nevermind. (Sarcasm) I guess it 'just broke' then.""  


Me: ""Well the thing is that I can fix it by...""  


Wife: ""Oh great! So it will be fixed by the time I get home!""   


Me: ""Uhhh no, I have to take it apart and we have to order a few things to fix it.""  


Now typically at some point she just 'forgets' or 'ignores' something I said/say. Just keep that in mind.  


Her: ""Well if we take it apart there is a chance it could break it. So don't take it a part.""  


Me: ""Ok I won't""  


She will then later 'remember' me saying that I could fix it and it would be done by the time she was at home. If I point out that she told me to not take it apart she will then say ""How would I know you needed to do that?"" and if I reply ""Because I told you that I would."" She will flip shit about 3/4ths the time and say ""no that didn't happen."" She has become so insistent that I began recording phone calls just to double check that YES IN FACT I DID TELL HER JUST THAT!  


Recently I've given up on telling her anything thats even slightly stressful/annoying because of how irritating it is that she won't just let me get EVERYTHING OUT BEFORE HAND. Seriously she didn't do this just a year ago before we were married and its like talking to someone different entirely. Its even worse in situations where I don't have all of the information. She will just make shit up outright and then claim I said it.   


(Another purely hypothetical:) If we are talking about a car thats broken and I say ""I think it could be the transmission...because""   


Her: ""Well how do you know that?""   


Me: I will then look at her and say ""What does a transmission do?""  


Her: ""I don't know. How should I know. I'm not a car person.""  


Me: ""Well I know that because it seems to...have problems getting the power from the engine to the tires which means we...""  


Her: ""I don't know what that means. What does that mean.""  


Me: ""What does what mean?""  


Her: ""All of it. I don't know what any of what you just said means.""  


Me: ""You don't understand what It means when I say that the car is having problems getting the power from the engine to the tires. That doesn't make sense to you?""  


Her: ""No. I don't know anything about cars. How could you 'just know that.'""  


Me: ""Ok you get in it and drive it down the street. Tell me how it feels because it probably...""  


Her: ""No, thats risky, I'm not good at feeling things out anyway. I mean what is a trasmission.""  


Me: ""A transmission is one of the things that puts power from the engine to the tires.""  


Her: ""but what does that actually mean.""  


Me: ""I just told you...""  


God forbid I say the words ""I don't know."" Or ""Yeah I know whats going on with this."" Because if I say either one of those things it works like this: ""I don't know."" ""If you DON'T KNOW"" Why don't you find out before telling me?"" (She doesn't say that, but its what she means)

  
If I say I do know something such as ""I know how to write on paper."" She will then assume I know the full history of how paper was made, how ink was made, where this particular paper was manufactured, what chemical components are in the paper and ink, and every potential use for paper and if I don't she just defaults to ""If you don't know why are you talking about it?""

It has been building up on me that I need to figure out what I am supposed to do with my life. I have been depressed because I can’t seem to find a job and I hear it all the time from my dad that I’m “worthless” and “can’t do anything”. It really hurts because I’ve applied at many places and have yet to land anything. With my mishap yesterday my dad said if I really didn’t want to go to college that I didn’t have to. I want to be able to find my purpose in life, I want to do something in the art field but I’m not good enough, knowing that all the kids in my class have been drawing since they were little and I’m here just starting to learn, it’s demotivating. I just wish I knew what to do. But I know that it takes a while but the time is ticking on whether I should go back to school and gain more debt than I already have.

726,"So... yeah. The advice that I need is not really based on the title in the sense that I don’t actually think she is going to slit my throat tonight.

Anyways:

I am 16. I have a twin sister. We have always fought and have been very competitive with each other. We are not close. I have always known that she is literally psychotic and crazy. But I have also known that she’s been very depressed for a long time. I always would put her acting out and rudeness as just part of her depression. A few months ago, she tried to commit suicide. I won’t go into detail except that it was apparently because of an overwhelming amount of homework. She’s a very high level student. It was very hard on me and she didn’t seem to care that it hurt everyone. She uses it in arguments all the time saying things like “maybe I’ll try to kill myself again” or “you’re the reason why I did it.” It hurts a lot. My whole family is torn apart because of it. I feel so bad for my parents. They do so much for her and have gotten her so much help and she is so ungrateful and is such a bitch to everyone. 

Anyways, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her now. I just let her walk all over me because I feel like if I stick up for myself she’ll try to hurt herself again. This is where the advice part comes in. How do I fight for myself while also being careful that I don’t trigger any sort of episode? I can’t keep on living like this. I am literally her door mat. All I can do is sit there while she insults me and cry. And then she calls me a pussy for not doing anything about it.

I wasn't really expecting to attend any high-end university or anything like that, but there are times where I wonder if I would've just been better off getting a GED instead of graduating with a record like that.

With a GED, I figure it would be a more appropriate documentation that represents my overall nature, while I was practically conditioned into getting the diploma. I got the diploma, but I'm wondering if I'm even better off, especially with the transcript and whatnot. Heck, there's been points where I wondered if it's possible to renounce your diploma and get a GED instead, because I'd probably do it instantly.",02Jul2019,1

732,"I know this is some girl advice post which isn’t a big issue like some of the others on here but I’d appreciate advice.

So I’ve had quite a few girlfriends by now not to sound braggy, I’m a 17 year old. I always really enjoy the person I’m with but I will always get bored and leave the girl when I have someone else I like. It’s such scummy and fuckboy behaviour I know and I hate myself for it because I know I hurt people by doing it. 

My most recent girlfriend I left because my friends told me she was slutty and I know I shouldn’t base my decisions on people’s opinions but when something like that is repeated to you it starts to manipulate your view towards that person. Since this I’ve had a few one night things but I really am making an effort and think I’m ready to be a loyal and perseverant boyfriend. I have friends and stuff but I still feel quite lonely and having a girlfriend fills that void and makes me happy. At my school I have a rep of having these short relationships and being a dick about it and it sucks because I can’t prove that I’m trying to change. I’ve exhausted my chances with girls at school because of this I think so now I’m in a really dark place as I’m longing to find someone but feel like its not actually possible because of what I’ve been like in the past. 

I know girls outside of my school who I could go for but I feel like doing that would just be looking for a relationship for the sake of it as I’m not sure I genuinely like them. Summer’s coming around which means everyone’s leaving on holiday so I won’t be able to find someone I truly connect with for a long time, which makes me super sad.

They had a baby and than another one, and are now fighting constantly and are splitting up. I never really got over Jane...

736,"Before I start ranting I need to give some background of course. I'm 16 m but when it happened I was still 14. I normally hang out on Discord, a platform where you have groups and can chat or call each other. It's great for finding people with common interests and talk about stuff. Normally someone creates a server and others can join. Mostly I'm in the server of a small YouTuber who does comic dubs and the some artists of the comics are in there too.
There are two friends who are really close and do art under one name. I'm not gonna give names, let's call one Alex and the other Plum. Anyway, we have a lot of fun and with time I was talking to Alex more. We were good friends and even though we talked about e-couples and stuff I never had a romantic interest. Soon we had more trustful talks, she was bullied and had terrible depression phases and was extremely self conscious. We talked a lot and it was going quite good. Another guy in the server made a bad comment about them which hurt her, it sucked and he left soon. I haven't learned anything, haven't I. We had a video call one day, we were having a lot of fun. For the record, I'm from Germany, she lives or lived in Bulgaria. During the call a mean comment slipped... It was about one of her pictures. Yeah, I fucked up. I didn't realize at first but after she hanged up it hit me. I got back to the chat and began apologizing. After like half an hour it seemed fine again. Bad mistake. We talked less and less until she eventually left the server. I had no other way of contacting her, not really. Of course I was worried. What if? Suicide, anything, I didn't know and It broke me. I tried to forget and it kinda works. But every time something reminds me of her I get this pressure on my chest. It hurts. It feels like I'm going to break and I want to cry. It sucks. From time to time I contact her or Plum through social media asking how they are. I never get an answer. I don't know if it's my fault or if I'm overreacting. If you read through all of this, thank you. This is means a lot to me and if someone experienced something similar or just has kind words I would be so grateful. I really needed to get this off.

Even though we are from different parts of the world we managed to keep in contact with each other. We scheduled a FaceTime date and he expressed that he was excited to talk to me. Then when it was time to make the call it was declined and he just disappeared and stopped  replying my messages.  But he was still looking at my social media posts. After a couple days of no contact I messaged him asking for some closure. He said I didn’t do anything wrong, he said our relationship was going really well, it was just life got in the way and he was having a rough time. I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said no. Then last message I sent him was if he wanted to keep talking. It’s been three days and he still hasn’t read that message (keep in mind he is still watching my Instagram and Snapchat stories). I now have no idea what to think. Am I being ghosted?

Well I saw a suspicious text so I went ahead and opened the thread. Sure enough it was messages with his girlfriend, I saw that it had been going on since May, that was the furthest back I could see their messages. 

Not going into detail here because it isn’t pertinent to the advice I’m seeking. He’s definitely having an affair, no if ands or buts. 

My parents have been married for 30 years, they were always a couple I looked up to. I grew up in such a loving household and I never thought it’d ever come to this. 

I have a close relationship with both my parents. I’d say about equally to my mom, as to my dad. I just don’t know what to do here. 

My dad deleted some of the texts in his thread, I’m assuming he knows that I saw them because the messages were open when he went back on his phone. I’m not afraid for him to know I know. 

I just don’t know what this would do to my mom, if this would break her trust in him and destroy their marriage. Do I talk to my dad, tell him he needs to come clean to my mom? Talk to my dad tell him I know and to stop? Just leave it and pretend nothing happened?

But, she had been having an afair, and while my son was out of town she emptied out their home of everything worth taking. Their children are young, early 20s, and on their own and tried to stay neutral by staying away. My son had PTSD but was fine prior to this happening. She works with PTSD veterans. She knows what buttons to push, and did so at every opportunity. I was in contact with my Son. He told me what she was doing, what she was saying. My son's friends have reached out to me, saying they feel she is responsible. I'm talking 17 different people. She disrespected him on FB the day after he was found. She disrespected him at the memorial. All the time playing the grieving widow. After she left my Son, I started receiving ""drunk"" texts from her. Forbidding me to speak with ""her"" children. Accusing me of turning them against her. Please note I had not spoken to them or even texted with them. I received so many nasty text messages I blocked her. Anyway, I have never had words with her, I see no purpose. I have blocked her on social media and on my phone. She borrows phones or buys throw a ways, I don't know which. For almost a year she has been harassing me. I new she was a narcissist, but over the past year she has demonstrated numerous sociopath traits. I get calls at all hours. She gets my Grandchildren to call or text me saying she needs to speak with me. I've told them I want nothing to do with her. I want no contact. I told my oldest Grandson to tell her I died! I want her to leave me alone. She has even sent messages to my friends and co-workers workers! People she has never met! Each time she does this it really upsets me. But I refuse to speak with her.

The first semester went okay, but the second semester (the one I just got out of) was the worst of my life. My grades were abysmal. I couldn't get anything done. Constant all-nighters. I gained weight. I was always tired. I knew I had to drop the job if I wanted to get my grades back up and get my life under control, but I couldn't get out of it (long, complicated reasons too annoying to explain). Last semester was honestly the hardest time of my life. 

I thought this summer would be a change of pace. I got a full-time job over the summer, and I'm taking a class at the same time, to try to bump up my GPA. It's been horrible so far. This job is the same job I had been working at for the last two semesters, but now I'm working full-time instead of part time. I liked the job. I thought it was a cool place to work, and I did genuinely enjoy my job. And now I can barely drag myself out of bed.

745,"Dear people of the United States. My name is Rusty Shackleford and I have singlehandedly discovered the greatest government coverup of all time. I have a fat and balding neighbor. For the purposes of this post he will be referred to simply as William. A number of years ago William chose to enter the US military. At the of his enlistment we was a semi-healthy young man. However, soon after his enlistment he received shots from the US army. He also was moved from his position in an armored division to the role of a mere army barber as a result of his increasingly average American build.  The other day William had to go see the medic at the fort because apparently now the army doesn’t want him to cut people’s hair. Judging his own haircut I wouldn’t blame them but that’s beside the point. When the doctor left he dropped some of William’s medical records which were highly redacted. When William asked me what I thought of this I knew there was only one answer. The injections from years ago were hormones designed to turn him into the ultimate attic commando. The chemicals lowered his metabolism causing him to put on extra fat to keep in the heat. This also made him able to hibernate for long periods of time.   I thought that before I proceed I should seek your advice. As we all no the internet is now the only place to find the truth, as agents of misinformation have been placed all around us.

My close friend has also talked to this teacher and he hasn’t told her parents and he’s apparently been very helpful, so that gives me assurance that he’d be the right person for me to tell. But the problem is, I’m very anxious and awkward. I know it’d be best for me to initially tell him face-to-face, but I don’t think I’d be able to do it. Should I try anyways, or should I email him/give him a letter? I’d be much more comfortable with this, but there’d also be solidified evidence of my feelings, and that also makes me anxious. Plus, our school board tracks emails I believe.

Moreover, what should I say or write? There isn’t a big reason behind my suicidal thoughts, it’s mostly self-loathing and utter hopelessness. Does anyone have any advice?

765,"So the end of February, my husband, myself, my daughter and soon to be son agreed to sign a lease with my sister and her boyfriend (my sister is not on the lease, though). Upon move in, my husband and I paid for deposits, first months rent, prorated rent, bought all the furniture currently in the home, and stocked the house with food. To say it was expensive is an understatement. They have not paid us back, and do not intend to. 

It started with laundry, as they have the laundry room in their bathroom and she would refuse to let me do my laundry on my set days for a long time. I bought all cleaning supplies, including the vacuum, broom, dustpan, carpet cleaner we went half on, etc. then it started an issue with food, where my husband and I were spending over $600 a month on food (we still are and only recently agreed to split food), and they were coming home with non essentials and foods for only them, seeming to only spend about $100 or so every two weeks. 

They have two pets, we all pay the pet rent, and my husband and I fronted the deposits and fees for their animals to be here, with the agreement that the animals would stay in their room. Of course, they don’t comply and my daughter has has her bed peed on, my bed has been peed on. I’ve told them if they want to pay back the amount we paid to have their pets here, the pets have free range. Instead, they lock their animals out of their room and she will flat out tell me they don’t owe us anything. 

All bills are in my name and I gave her access to recently have them pay their half on their own instead of transferring the money to me and having me pay. That turned into yet another argument because I asked her why she decided to do that, as if she doesn’t trust me, and I told her it took a lot for me to trust her with those as those accounts use my credit and such, and she told me to pay my own bills then. 

And chores. I have a chores list written on a whiteboard on display in the dining area. She follows none of it. She’s altered it to work for her, I bend what she wants and when she wants to do it, but she’ll let dishes pile up for two days, clean only what she wants to clean whenever she pleases, etc etc. 

I’m at a loss on what to do because we’ve paid our fair share, and theirs, and they’re clearly walking all over us. That money we’ve funneled into helping them could have gone toward my children, and they have zero sympathy or respect for what we’ve done for them. Is there anything legally that I can do to better this situation or, quite honestly, get my family the hell away from my sister and her boyfriend?

766,"Hey Guys/Gals.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll try to explain this in a way that makes sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really knew what career I wanted when I was growing up. I figured that one day I would discover that I had an aptitude for something, that I would enjoy it, and then I could turn it into a career. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that never really happened to me. Nothing ever really ""clicked"" as it seemed to do for others. I spent a lot of time in college trying to figure out what I should do, and eventually settled on IT. I was always a bit of a closet nerd, watched anime, played computer/video games, watched tons of SciFi growing up, that sort of thing. So a career in technology made sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got my degree a few months ago in Network Admin and Security and am working in IT with a pretty cool biotech company. I really enjoy the people I work with and I see a lot of potential here, and in this industry as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I struggle. I don't know why I can't get this idea out of my head, but for some reason, I have this belief that Ill never reach my potential in life unless I have a career in the (US)military. I feel like I could be at the top of my field, working for a company that does all kinds of good things in the world, but my whole career choice would never quite measure up to a life long career in the military. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of my problem is that I look at all my major character flaws, and it feels like some time spent in the military could help correct them. I am not a very disciplined person, I have a hard time getting shit done, I can't focus on things very well (confirmed ADD a few years back), I am overweight. I feel like all of these things could be corrected if I spent some time in the military. 

&amp;#x200B;

However:

A) I realize deep down that this is flawed reasoning. I mean absolutely no disrespect to those in the Armed Forces, but there are other careers that people find quite fulfilling, where they can reach their potential, and that are just as noble. I should be able to find that as well, and I get the feeling that finding fulfillment is more of an internal, mental hurdle.

&amp;#x200B;

B) Even IF point A were not true, I am in no position to join the military. As I said, I am not nearly in shape enough (not morbidly obese, but not in good shape either), my wife is 100% not OK with it, and she has some chronic illnesses that I don't think would mesh well with a military lifestyle. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get this idea out of my head that Ill only ever reach my potential if I join the military?",02Jul2019,1
767,"My best friend is a asshole he is a sexist and only thinks about him self: my friend always makes jokes about woman and I’ve known him about 8 years and I can tell he believes in his jokes he thinks he is better than most woman and that they’re just sex objects he also only thinks with his fucking dick if I would to be talking about issues I have or if I feel sad he thinks I’m a pussy and that emotions are stupid. 

He also only thinks about him self and I don’t think he has ever thought if I would be okay with something or not I mean today he was flirting with my crush and I talk a lot about her but he told me he wouldn’t talk to her but he ALWAYS breaks his promises without thinking if he could hurt someone he thinks he is the only fucking person on this world.. 

The problem is I can’t just leave him because I have a bound with his whole family  and they are the only reason I still come to his house but even they are really sexist

768,I'm friends with someone who has recently left his girlfriend. They are both here illegally. She has been harassing him. She put sugar in his gas tank... Twice! She stole his work permit and did God knows what with it. So I'm wondering if there's anything I (American) can do. The police say they can't do anything without solid proof.,02Jul2019,0
769,"I'm going with some backstory on this. It'll be quite long.

I've talked to a good friend of mine (also a classmate) about my relationship asking for advice, but I want a few more opinions about this.

I'm 18 (Male) and my girlfriend is 16. We'll call my girlfriend Ana in this story. We've been together for 6 months now (I know it's not that much and you might say that there are other relationships that lasted for years with bigger problems, but please, hear me out). 

The girl I cheated with is a good friend of mine, which we'll call Luna, also 16, just like Ana.

I am a dancer since I was little. Luna was a colleague of mine at the dance club. I was on a break for about a year and a half in the seventh grade and started dancing again in the ninth grade. It's been two years since I started dancing again.

Me and Luna got really close after randomly meeting at a local festival randomly again and going out for some time. I started developing a crush on her. Never told her about it until the tenth grade in a Summer during a trip organized by my dance club. She confessed to me aswell then, but she told me she used to like me, not that she likes me.

It got complicated afterwards, some useless teenage drama happened and we never got to be together. 

At the end of the summer, after still going out almost everyday and getting closer and closer to each other she told me she got a boyfriend. I knew the guy since I was in the sixth grade. They met when I called her out once and he came by to say hi to me. They started going out and we slowly stopped talking and hanging out while I didn't want to interfere with them and other reasons coming from their side.

I stopped thinking about her at some point and we've randomly met in town a few times. 

At the beggining of 2019 I started going out with Ana. We've known each other since 2017. Things were fine at the beginning, but lately, after a series of immature actions coming from her, it started to fade away for me. She got mad from little things: like telling her that she's paranoic after saying that a friend of mine was looking with hate at her. She ignored me the whole day and said that we're ending everything and that we're breaking up. 

She did things like this many times and I thought I can always just move over, I thought it wasn't something to worry about. But it got on my nerve. 

I always tried to offer her everything she needed. I neglected my friends to stay with her during lunch breaks (we're at the same high school), I neglected some of my daily routines, like writing and programming, just to talk to her so she doesn't feel like I don't have time for her. I bought her many gifts so she doesn't have to feel like she has a shitty boyfriend. I tried my best to be the best and offer her love, but after a while I wasn't giving her love anymore. I didn't feel that I love her anymore. 

Two weeks ago my friend, Luna, wrote me on Snapchat. She wanted to meet. She's been through some rough shit. She lost all of her friends because of her boyfriend. He was controlling her, what she wears, what she does, where she goes, who she goes with and she lost many good friends because of him. She thought she lost me too.

She wrote me on Tuesday morning. She told me she's going to France for a week and that she needs to see me. I missed her a little and I was surprised she wanted to see me. I told her we'll meet later that day, at 6 pm. I planned to go out with my girlfriend before. And I did. That's when I told her she's paranoic and all hell came on me. Many things happened. I went by her side apologizing all the time just to be ignored and yelled at a few times. She told me when she got home that she's giving me all my stuff back and that she's sick of everything.

I wasn't in the mood for anything and forgot that I told Luna we're going out. She called me and texted me but I ignored everything. I tried to make it all alright with my girlfriend.

The next day Luna sent me a Snap. She was crying. I asked her what's wrong and told me that she lost many friends and thought she lost me too. I felt really bad about it. She's a sweet girl and she doesn't deserve things like this to happen to her. 

I told her I'd go out with her after she returns back home from France. After that, we had a dance show and we had to go and practice.

Last week on Tuesday morning she came at my place. We watched a movie and talked a little about her boyfriend and how she lost her friends because of him, how he was an asshole to her parents and many other things. 

After a while I realized how much I missed this girl. She got on top of me and placed her head on my chest. We rested for a while and after that we started kissing. She got her shirt off and we continued to kiss. 

After a while we stopped and thought about it. We both were in a relationship. It wasn't fair for my girlfriend and her boyfriend. 

After we stopped we just went out. We talked about it and none of us feel any regret about what happened.

I'm not ashamed. I did cheat. My girlfriend doesn't know that yet. I want to break up with her. Not only that the love for her wasn't quite there anymore when me and Luna kissed, but after kissing Luna and spending time with her, everything faded. 

The only thing that's still stopping me is not love, is the fear of breaking her heart. My girlfriend is sensitive. She wasn't just a random girl to me. I loved her in a way and I care about her. Just not enough to continue being with her. I don't feel compatible with her anymore.

So, as the title said, my girlfriend got on my nerve too many times and I want to break up with her. That's also the reason I cheated. I also realised that I don't love her anymore after all that happened with Luna.

I intend to break up with Ana, but should I be completely honest about everything and tell her that I cheated?

I know it seems like some shitty teenage drama. It's not about my feelings here though. It's about hers. I want her to be happy, but I want myself to be happy aswell. She's in love with me, but I'm not anymore. 


Luna's boyfriend or my girlfriend will never find out about what we've done. 

Luna told me last week that she liked me a lot even when she started going out with his boyfriend. She just didn't want to mess the things between us with a relationship. She even cried because she felt bad she didn't take the risk with me. But right now she's still together with him and she's still trying to see if they can work it out. Telling Ana about me and Luna might lead to a bad situation, like her boyfriend finding out and messing their relationship.

Anyways, last night we were talking and he messaged me he was going to the hospital. I flipped out, because he was just rediagnosed with cancer (liver, stomach and small intestine). So it’s not like it’s just the flu. He was basically expelling blood instead of fecal matter when pooping, which is why he went.

He told me he didn’t have a charger and sent a screenshot of his battery on red. I asked if I could come bring him one and he said he didn’t want me to see him so weak. 

Around 9:30 last night, he didn’t see any of my messages (meaning his phone died).

Well it’s now 3:57PM, and I still haven’t heard from him. And he hasn’t seen any of my messages. I’m so scared and worried. We were suppose to see each other today (obviously not expecting that to happen), but I just want to know if he’s like...alive???

There’s a few scenarios I think might be happening:

he died (hopefully least likely), still in hospital w/no charger, discharged/went to work and is working so he hasn’t had a chance to charge/text.

But recently I’ve turned sensitive. I felt hopeless &amp; worthless during the second half for no reason. But in the end I felt a bit hopeful again since the way the guy did his speech was fantastic. Plus for the last 2 days I’ve felt noticeably better, even my parents noticed I was having fun and stuff again. 
How do I get rid of those negative feelings/vibes? 
Because when I think about them I overthink them and it destroys my progress to feeling better, I’m always so close yet my Brain decides to ruin it.

Anybody who’s gotten out of depression knows that you need to have the slightest motivation to change, or else you’ll stay stuck in the same place for longer.

778,"Sounds like a troll post, I know, but it’s not. Let me list some shit out for you that’s happened in the last few weeks, in order of occurrence. 

1. A childhood friend of mine got in a car accident and died at 21 years old. 
2. One of my two closest friends needed surgery to remove ovarian tumors
3. My boss called me at 7:30 am on a Monday to scream at me over projects I’ve been actively working on. When I told him the status of them, he said “I don’t want excuses, just say yes sir.
3a. Those projects proceeded to get delayed for another two weeks due to weather and the holiday this week. Also, a truck backed into a building I manage. 
4. About 50 feeder crickets escaped their enclosure in my bedroom. An enclosure marketed by the manufacturer as a “Cricket Keeper”.
4a. I woke up to one on my neck after cleaning my house with disinfectant, including moving all furniture. Twice. 
5. My boyfriend and I broke up, but then got back together. it still sucked. 
6. My bedroom got too hot one day while I was at work and my two pet toads nearly died (I installed an air conditioner that night). 
7. Today, my car broke down 75 miles from home and I had to get it towed. I got a full synthetic oil change exactly two months ago, and somehow it had zero oil in it despite no evidence of a leak or burning oil until today. It’s most likely totaled, I need it for my job, and I JUST finished paying off all my debt and started saving for a down payment on a new car. “Started saving” is key here. 
8. My other closest friend is moving away in a few days for grad school. She has no plans to return. 
9. I’ve, for some inexplicable reason, had my period for 6 weeks and counting. I am on the pill. Every time I go to the gyno, they fuck up the billing and I get charged $2k+, so I’m pretty hesitant to go. 

I’ve honestly hit my limit and need this series of unfortunate events to lighten up already. The stress of deciding what to order for dinner is somehow the thing that’s finally paralyzed me. The straw that broke the camels back, so to speak. I’m in the mood for spicy, but that’s as far as I’ve gotten.

782,"This week, I'm receiving an unexpected but substantial inheritance from a distant relative. I'm also in the process of extricating myself from a rough marriage, which I don't think my spouse is aware of, since I'd like to keep my profile low until I'm ready to take the plunge. (My therapist is working with me on this.) I haven't told him about the inheritance.

It's not that I'm worried I'll eventually have to split this money with him--I know I probably will--but I'm terrified that he'll want to spend it all on a business that we've been talking about for a long time. (He wants badly to get it off the ground, but I'm backing off for obvious reasons.)

We keep separate accounts, so I could easily put the money away and keep quiet, EXCEPT that my brother is also getting a share of this inheritance. They're good friends--brothers, practically-- and they talk about everything. It's only a matter of time before my husband finds out. As I see it, I have three options:

  
1. Try to get ahead of this by telling my brother about the state of my marriage and asking him to keep this information on the DL. This might not work because my brother is closer with my husband than he is with me and I know he can't be trusted with this info. (It's complicated and working out this dynamic just isn't relevant or possible right now.)

2. Get out in the open about how I'm planning to leave--well before I'm ready--so that I don't have to spend this money on the business and we can just work out whatever split the law mandates.

3. Just go along with whatever so that I don't have to drop this bomb yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, the marriage isn't great, and just telling him that I don't want to create the business anymore won't get me far and will probably make things worse.

785,"This one's a doozy. Be ready.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a friend (Let's call her Cathy) and I admit we have feelings for each other, some time in late February. For the next three months, we go through a repeating cycle of talking for a few days before having an argument ending with Cathy cutting me off. 

&amp;#x200B;

During these talking points, we barely speak romantically. We never do anything physical. We never even go on a date (the one planned date she cancelled and went to the same place with her friends on the same day), and rarely see each other outside of class. We never begin truly ""dating.""  When we do speak, it's Cathy's venting about her roommate, her ex boyfriend, school, or her mental health. Our arguments tend to arise from me being too busy to text. 

This whole arrangement has damaged my mental health, my sense of self-worth, and my trust in relationships, and my friends have repeatedly pleaded with me to block her on everything, but I just... can't. I care about her too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point toward the end of the semester, Cathy and I stop talking again. I proceed to go to a party. My dumb, drunken, deeply upset self starts to hit it off with a girl there, who we'll call Lisa, and we end up making out. Nothing more, nothing less.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it's summer. Cathy and I have kind of warmed up. Today, she found out from her roommate that I apparently ""hooked up"" with Lisa. Cathy is deeply upset with me, and is saying that I cheated.  We both are classmates in a very small program at a very small private college, and this is already spreading around like crazy.

786,"I am a 17 year old U.K. student studying my A-Levels. I just completed the first year, and to be honest it was hard. I had moved school after 5 year to start my A-Levels at a different school. A school who seemed to be more academically prepared. However once I arrived I felt terrified. I was petrified to answer questions in class, I second guessed myself all the time because I felt I had less ability than everyone else surrounding me. Throughout the year on my visit for period pain relief from the school nurse she would always make comments on how skinny I was. I was 7 stone 2 at the time as I was so nervous in the school I didn’t like eating lunches there. To give some context my school uniform included a skirt that falls to my ankles, the nurse never saw my legs. So she could only judge my weight on the top part of my body, and I can admit it seemed skinnier however my legs were athletic and in previous years I had gone to win many gold metals in sprint races, long and high jumps. This made me very self conscious. 

Within the first term a teacher had told me that I was going to fail my A-Levels, saying that I seem to fit in fine but lack work ethic. This killed my confidence as I wasn’t coping well in the new school environment. 

Another teacher was sympathetic to this, but unfortunately she left at the end of this school year.

And finally my last teacher, he was lovely but seemed to be distant and gave far too much homework that could have possibly been done. This put me under a lot of pressure to do better which ended with me becoming worse in my subject. However in the end when I began to explain what it had been like to go through this he sympathised with me. Unfortunately he can’t be my teacher this year, and that really bums me out. 

Throughout all the hardship myself, and my parents tried to reach out for pastoral care, which gave me no help. Each time was the telling me to take everyone in little bites. But no support was given.

Another thing to add was transit, I would get the 7:45 train into the city for school, the transit includes shoving, kicking, punching to get to the school busses. Giving no concern for other pupils or the public. And the idea of having to face that until I get my licence is horrendous. 

To conclude one last thing that bothered me about this is that they had this after school club for people who were struggling. And at first it sounded amazing, it was a extra session in a Tuesday that gave me extra support in the subjects I struggled with. However what it was was forcing students to spend 2 and a half extra hours after school to revise in a study hall with no help. You were expected to bring work. You were expected to fix your own mistakes. There was NO support. By the time I got home on Tuesdays it would have 5:45 and I would have to leave for my tutors straight away, meaning I wouldn’t have ate in over 6 hours. And once I got home I had to complete an hour of math homework which would often take longer because I was so tired. 

My question is, should I go back? Those are all the negatives, but I do have some really good friends that supported me the entire year which was amazing. But I’m stuck in what to do because going back seems to be my only option, and I feel if I go to tech or a different school it would just be a repeat and I can’t cope with that.

I don't have necessarily relevant writing because the writing I do in economics is just listing statistics and it doesn't read well. The only assignments I have to submit are from a...

political science class (but its profiling two congressional representatives so it mainly reads as a list of things they voted on and locations of their offices etc)

Philosophy class (its political philosophy but there is no ""politics involved, its theory about whether people have rights, what form of government is best and things like that. In all my philosophy writing I do have to choose a theory I agree with and explain why so my opinions are included )

Globalization class (I wrote about he IMF and World bank policies and the impact they have on developing countries. Also about different ways development can be classified. This uses various articles and data as sources and isn't opinion based. This is the only writing I have that discusses the economy)

796,"Okay so this is both serious and seriously embarrassing and I really need help cause I’m worried and I’m scared that my girlfriend gonna be upset over it and she did nothing wrong 


Earlier I was reviving a handjob and blowjob from my girlfriend for the first time and everything was normal, it felt normal, you know, how a blowjob and handjob should feel, but one thing, I couldn’t ejaculate, we went for 40 minutes and nothing came out, id hit the point of climax and I stead of the regular stuff coming out nothing did and the feeling of cumming gradually dissipated, and this happened around 3-4 time within the 40 minutes. 

I’m obviously worried for obvious reasons, this was my first time receiving these, so I’ve never experienced another person pleasuring me before, and I’m worried if it’s a health problem or if there’s a logical health reason that could be to blame. A second reason is I don’t want my girlfriend thinking she’s really bad cause, it felt great, she was great at it and she got me to the point of climax but just nothing happened and I was both confused embarrassed, and I don’t want my girlfriend putting all the blame on her when she did everything right. 

This is the first time this has happened too, when I masturbate I never have this problem. 

I know this is really not what this subreddits for but I’m serious and if I could get reasonable explanations behind it that would help

TL;DR I coudlnt ejaculate receiving a handjob and head from my girlfriend, logical explanation or a health problem",02Jul2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",02Jul2019,0

801,"So some quick background: about a month ago, I had a paper wasp nest removed from the under the awning of the entryway to my apartment. About a week later, a small group of wasps were hovering outside the apartment but they went away shortly after and I haven't had much issue with wasps or the like. Yesterday, I noticed a single wasp hovering around the corner of the porch covering (not the same place as the original nest). I went to investigate and saw three wasps just chilling on the wood panel. I'm debating taking some spray and hitting the area but I'm worried that if I do I will unintentionally disturb a much larger and unseen swarm. Is that a possibility or would I be okay to just wipe out these critters?",02Jul2019,1

I have this thing where if anything were to change my routine, I would get really mad and feel like I have no control. Reason why I'm writing this is because parents want to go to Vegas for a week, and I immediately thought about how this will affect my routine.

I gotta finish all of this before the end of the day or I get really upset. I swear, if one small thing changes this I get really angry and start contemplating on it.

I keep trying to write this, but then I stop, and I think how low I must have come to ask for help on Reddit, but thats what I’m about to do. 

I feel like nobody wants me around, I feel like I’d be making them happier if I just went away, I feel like a spoiled brat to my parents and all I do is gnaw at them for more. I’m never holding my expectations up in school, (I’m in quite advanced classes) My parents expect nothing less than a B, and I’m currently not living up to that expectation, which just makes me feel more useless. I constantly think suicide is the best answer, I know it’s not, but I just can’t stop myself. All friends around me are getting girlfriends, outside of school friends, when I’m just stuck to a couple of people that don’t know me too well. My best friend left our school last year, and so I talk to him on xbox, he’s the only thing that makes me truly happy and feel appreciated. But now I feel like hes started to drift away too

812,"I (21f) have had rocky relationship with my mom since early childhood. She has always been emotionally abusive and manipulative (hurling insults, looking through my phone and email, tracking me though my phone location, gaslighting, shaming, constant threats to throw me out, etc).  I wasn't a perfect kid but I was a socially awkward, straight-A student who was rarely allowed to have friends over, so I really never had the chance to get up to any trouble. She's also not a horrible mother. We always had food on the table and she always made sure me and my brother went to school and were safe but she has mental health issues that give her a short and violent temper. I have always had to hide a lot of things from her like my sexuality, friendships, and relationships in order to avoid her anger.

I would dream of running away from home and making a life without her.  By the time I was in high school, I realized the best way to do this would be to get into a good out-of-state college. When I managed to get a scholarship and move away to college, I though my situation would improve but she still spies on me financially. She opened a (joint) bank account with me when I got my first job at 16 years old and it is the only bank account I've ever have.  I have had a job ever since and pay for my own food/rent. 

The issue is that my mom will check every single transaction I make on my debit and credit cards and then badger me about what I purchased, why, where, etc. I'm a frugal person and rarely spend money on anything other than food, rent, and transport, so her response to my spending my own money doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  

I was wondering what would happen if I opened my own bank account. Is there any way she could find out about it? I don't want to do this to make any irresponsible purchases and blow through my money, I just want to have peace of mind knowing that she can't track my every move anymore.

This whole thing makes me feel really bad because I don't think she's an evil mom, but I need to be able to become my own person.",02Jul2019,1

Im female and as far as my age, all I’m going to say is Im under the age of 18.


I am extremely lonely and touch starved. It has been this way for a majority of my life but recent it’s been hitting hard.

I have tried making friends but it just falls apart. I am the person boys in middle school used to dare to ask out, because the thought of it was so disgusting.
Over the years it hasn’t got any better. A mixture of depression and poor hygiene (because of depression) has turned me into a fucking disaster. 

I haven’t even attempted a relationship for 2 main reasons.

1. The entire explanation above
2. I’m aromantic. It means I do not experience romantic attraction towards people. (i.e. crushes) You kinda have to be attracted to people to get into a relationship.

A little backstory: Me and family went on a little trip to go Atlantic City for the day, considering we live fairly close and all was well until we were planning to go back home when one of the cars that we took battery died and our Grandma the owner of the car became stressed out but after a while of driving back home slowly started to relax more. But when we went home our Grandma’s sister decided to surprise the family by bringing a loved relative to our home from Italy and surprise us. (Just so you know our Grandma is the best. She’s always helping people and loves us all deeply and has never had a history of getting angry easily and it was truly out of nowhere). And when we got home they were hidden in a room and when one of our family members that were in on the surprise got us all to come in the living room and get us sitting while they snuck out of the room and surprised us. It all went well till our Grandma suddenly just told them to get out and to never come again in our house or even set foot in the state ( Note that my Grandma is extremely nice to them l and is always happy to let them visit and loves for them to come by and is very kind to them in general. She is also pretty much the boss of the family.) I’m now being told by my cousins who were in on the prank to not talk to me unless were away from her and to expect them to never visit again. I don’t know what to do and I’m not sure if I should go talk to her or if that will escalate the situation.",02Jul2019,1
