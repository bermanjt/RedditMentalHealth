0,"Right now, I'm 28, I have a full time job working as a wireless specialist at my local Walmart, have a beautiful girlfriend, and make enough money to be happy and stable, but living with a roommate so bills are cheaper(which really dosent bother me).

Just this morning, my mother texted me asking if I wanted to be her apprentice. She owns a Locksmithing company that she built from the ground up about 20 years ago. Her father trained her and now she wants to train me. I can tell that she wants me to be her successor and take over her business when I'm fully trained and she wants to retire. She even offered to work around my full time schedule and pay me while training me.

It's an opportunity of a life time. Life changing. I make about 25,000 a year working my current job and she makes 4x that much and makes her own schedule and is her own boss.

No brainer right? Wrong. For me at least. I'm a nerdy, overweight gamer. I'm not really a hands on type of guy. Definitely not a car guy. Or a work outside guy. I love my job being inside, in A/C, working with cell phones and electronics. Having a set schedule every day. I'm a very planned person. I hate ""just winging it"" or when I have plans and they are changed or interrupted. Being a locksmith requires just waiting for the phone to ring, then go. No schedule.

I feel terrible though, because I know my mother wants the family business to stay in the family. I know if I did take her up on it, it would change my life. A lot of it for the better. More money, no roommates, nicer car. 

I don't know how to explain it really. I guess the best way to explain is have a job you love, but make little money, or have a job you dislike, but make lots of money.

Before you say anything about ""it's just a job at Walmart"". I've been there for about 5 years in the wireless department and have plans on moving to Verizon or at&amp;t. I have even went to a few interviews to them, but haven't gotten an opportunity yet to land the job.

I don't know what to do. Stay at walmart and try to move to verizon, at&amp;t or move up in walmart, or become an apprentice on the side of my current job eventually become a full time locksmith. The 1st has nothing guaranteed, but doing what I love. The 2nd is guaranteed,  but not what I like.",05Jan2019,1
1,"Before I get into my situation, a bit of background:

I’m in my freshman year of college and there’s this girl that I met at the beginning of the year that I’ve pretty much been in love with ever since. Like, head over heels in love. She was in a few of my classes and she ended up in my friend group so I got to know her and we talked a lot throughout the first few months of college. We became pretty close by November My feelings for her kept increasing to the point where I knew I had to do something about it. I didn’t think she liked me (I usually have a good sense about these things) but after a long time of debating I decided to tell her how I felt anyway. She told me she didn’t feel the same but she still cared about me a lot as a friend and that she hopes we can continue being good friends. This was about a month ago.   

I’ve been struggling the past month with trying (and miserably failing) to get over her. In fact, it feels like I just think about her more now than I ever did before.

Here is my dilemma: I know the best way to move on from someone is to cut them out of your life completely, but that’s impossible in my situation. She’s in my core friend group, she’s in some of my classes next semester, and she lives very close to me on campus. I see her every single day, usually multiple times a day. So taking space isn’t really a good option for my situation.

Plus, I want to be friends with her and spend time with her. I know that there’s nothing I can do to change the way she feels and I’m doing my best to let go of my dreams/fantasies of us together. She’s just genuinely a really cool person that I’d enjoy being friends with.

Obviously, I’m doing my best to take proper “precautions” to protect my feelings and help me heal (such as not being alone with her for a while and not texting unless necessary). I’m also seeing a therapist about this and some depression/self-esteem issues. While I know all of this is good and healthy, I still can’t seem to shake my intense feelings. I think that deep down I may still be clinging onto some hope that someday I’ll be with her, but I am doing my best to kill these thoughts.

All of this being said, is there any way to effectively get over someone when you still spend a pretty significant amount of time with them? I feel like the only sure fired way to get over someone is to cut them out of your life, but is there a way I can at least begin to move on and make seeing her easier?

3,So I finally gained the balls to ask out this girl I liked. I honestly thought I was gonna get rejected but she surprisingly said yes. The problem however was that she said she was gonna be busy for a while but she’ll let me know when she is available. I texted her and told her that it was no problem and that i was gonna be free anytime until i have to go back to school in a few weeks. It’s been two days and she hasn’t even read the last message i sent to her. It wouldn’t be that big of a deal for me if it weren’t for the fact that she still post on her snapchat stories which we have communicated through. I know i shouldn’t be fixating on this but i just can’t help but think that she’s blowing me off on purpose. I know i should probably wait a while but i have this irrational fear that she might forget about me find somebody else. I also don’t want to wait to long and become her pen pal or get friend zoned. Should i text her again or i would come off as needy? Should i wait a few days to text her back or wait for a response? What should i do?,05Jan2019,1

6,"So my dad is a high ranking official in my community. I have lived with that my whole life. I acknowledge that I am privileged in the fact that my family had enough money to help me through university financially and I come from a place where I was raised in such a way that I was socially able to be functional enough to get me a good job. Huge advantage in life. Yes I acknowledge that my name didnt hurt my professional situation. I feel guilty about this and I have tried my best to make myself successful on my own accord as much as possible and not bring up who my father is or ride his coat tales. Here is my question:

I was recently asked for some professional advice in my field (fyi it is not the same field as my dad) and I thought I did a really good job. I told my partner about what I had done and was really happy with myself. I said (this person) really seems to like me and what I do. My partner responded with 'maybe that is because you are (my dad's) kid. That really hurt my feelings because I felt I had done a good job and this person legitimately felt I had helped. My partner and I got in a big fight about it. My partner told me I need to acknowledge who my dad is when I think about my accomplishments. I think that is fair but in this instance I think I did it myself. Anyway my partner stormed off and wont speak to me now. My feelings are hurt and I feel like maybe I dont deserve the accolades I got. I feel sad now because I've tried my best to step out of my dad's shadow on my own. 

I got angry with my partner and my partner got angry with me. How do we resolve this? Am I just failing to check my privalege? Is my success in this instance because of who my dad is? I don't know. Maybe my partner is right. How do I deal with this emotionally? ",05Jan2019,1
8,"obvious reasons this is a throw away account I hope no one ever finds out is mine but I need to talk to someone some way about this. I just recently found out that when my children where younger my oldest son raped his sister. She was 7-11 and he was 10-14 years old when it happened they are now 17 and 20 years old. At first I found out someone had molested my daughter but she wouldn't tell me who so I arranged for her to go to therapy and see a doctor. from her visits she finally told her doctor who it was and because it was abuse of a minor the doctor broke confidentiality and told me I have 3 other children who have now been questioned by me, case workers, and doctors. None of them knew about it or where touched raped or any thing apparently it just was the older two involved. My eldest hasn't lived at home for about a year now so I haven't had to face him. I blocked him on social media and have only spoken to his girlfriend who apparently knew about it before I did tho she thinks I should just forgive since they both where kids. I haven't blew up I haven't broken down I am angry but is a numb anger I am also concerned about what happened to my son to make him even think about raping his sister as a child. I am feeling not connected to the outside world. I feel like I am living life but not really me like I am watching me live life and I am just blocking all this information. I don't know how to process this and my brain has shut off. Police social workers and a whole slew of therapy for the kids has been started. I feel like I should just crawl away and give up on life at this point because some where I messed up huge and I can't fix it. ",05Jan2019,1
9,"So basically my friend is Snapchat obsessed. When I hang around her she sometimes takes pictures to send to her streaks or put on her story. I might be making it a big deal out of it, but I want her to stop. I am extremely insecure about the way I look and I have a low self esteem. I usually don’t even take pictures of myself because I don’t want to see how I look. Basically everytime she takes a candid of me, I usually look terrible and it causes me to be even more self conscious. I usually tell her to stop or cover my face, but she still does it, please can I have advice, thanks!",05Jan2019,1
10,"I no longer can take naps due to several times I’ve decided to take a nap I’ve been waken up to bad news.

Another time I was awaken telling me my cousin had shot someone &amp; almost killed the person.

Another time I was informed my other brother was shot &amp; hours later died.

&amp; last night I was woke up by a phone call telling me my cousin had committed suicide

I’m so terrified to even sleep as I feel like life just hits the fan when I’m asleep. The feeling when you get that call and the words leading up. You just don’t know who it’s going to be this time or what happened. It’s so awful. I’m just really struggling. I know it may sound silly to some.

11,"i’ve been talking to this guy for 3 months and we got super close real fast, he admitted to liking me and i eventually developed those feelings back and we hit it off pretty hard, we got real intimate and spent so much time together, we texted every single day and DID stuff, he stopped talking to me out of nowhere and i don’t have him on any social medias bc he said he doesnt own any, however out of curiosity i looked him up on social media and found out that he had a long term GF this whole time. it’s been nearly 4 months since that happened and he thinks he got away with it. i do feel kinda hurt and i accepted it happening but the fact that he did this while having a gf is what i can’t get over. people tell me to tell her and i do want to, but i always second guess it and don’t have the confidence to. there’s a constant battle of either confronting him + snitching on him to his gf and let him get away with it. what’s also stopping me from doing this is because i care about his feelings more than mine /: i don’t want to hurt him by breaking him up with his gf or putting him in a low situation like me. i don’t want him to hate me either. if any of you guys could offer me advice or a way to confront him and his gf about it, let me know. i also don’t want to come off as weird when i confront them because he’ll wonder where i got his social media info from, but what can i say? i’m just lowkey a smart detective. /: this is hard to deal with but i need my peace and staying silent isn’t helping because it feels like i have unfinished business that i brought with me all the way to 2019.

TL;DR: after 3 months of communication with a guy, i find out he has a gf through social media that i looked up on my own. he ghosted me this whole time and isn’t replying which means he just left me. it’s been 4 months and i been wanting to take action because staying silent isn’t helping me regain my peace. what would you do in this situation, being an emotional selfless person?

Hello all. I moved to a new school and haven't really made any friends. I'm not sure what it is that's preventing me. I'm very shy and timid so maybe that's it but idk. Anyway, because of this, I spend a lot of time in chatrooms. Since the internet is so male dominated, I'm mostly talking to males (discord). I don't mind this really and I talk to lots of guys for hours in a platonic way about my interests of politics, sociology, etc.

But the issue is that guys don't want to talk about clothes or love with me lol. There's things that unfortunately society forces me to only be able to talk to girls about. I'd love to talk to girls about politics too of course, but I really like to indulge in my femininity sometimes. My current life situation doesn't give me much chance to do that with other people.

So anyway I'm almost not even sure what I'm asking my posting this. I just wanted to get it out. I guess what could I do at school or in my life in general to fix this?",05Jan2019,1
14,"I’ve been in an LDR for a little over two years with my boyfriend. I’ve noticed my boyfriend blowing off our plans to FaceTime or call last minute to hang out with his friends and he’ll come home around 4 in the morning each weekend. I feel like he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, but I don’t know if I’m just being crazy. He says he loves me and that I’m extremely important to him, but I’m honestly not really feeling that from him. He always says sorry for blowing me off, but continues to do it regardless. I don’t want to prevent him from having fun with his friends and having a life outside of our relationship at all, but I wish he would occasionally prioritize calling me on some weekends since we only see each other in person once a year.

Am I being too clingy? I’m trying to involve myself in other hobbies, and have some “me time,” but I don’t see it helping me. How can I stop this neediness of mine? I know it’s a problem and I want to work towards fixing it. I appreciate kind advice, thank you. ",05Jan2019,1
15,"I’m 36. My dad died of cancer 3 years ago. I’ve always had this “perfect” view of him. He was the kind of guy that would drop everything he’s doing to help someone else. I am very close to both my parents and had a great upbringing. A couple times now, my mom has made reference that he wasn’t always perfect. Yes, I’m realistic and know that no one can be. She knows that I hold him in high regards and has asked me if I want to know, before she just blurts it out. I have declined, but I think she really wants to get something off her chest. I have no idea how bad it could be. I know there was a time that he was coming home later than normal. He could have been up to something then. Cheating, maybe? Also, my mom would find money hidden places, but as far as I know, she never found out why he hid money (maybe $200 at a time) ...even after she confronted him about it years ago. She even found money hidden in his dresser after he died. Am I being selfish for wanting to keep only good memories of him? Should I have her tell me?",05Jan2019,1
16,"I’ve never posted here before, but here goes. Any input is appreciated.

I (18M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (18F) since July. We met at a journalism conference over the summer, found out we were both planning on going to college at the same school and decided to make it work long distance in the meantime. We’re about 500 miles apart but have been able to arrange visits to see each other on four separate occasions.

She’s amazing and I love her, and if you can believe that an 18 year old feels this way, she’s who I want to be with forever. Since I’ve been able to see her four times on a near monthly basis, I’ve gotten used to the reality of being able to see her reasonably often, thanks to our parents being flexible in facilitating that.

I’ve known for quite some time that her mother doesn’t really like the idea of her daughter having a boyfriend. It’s some combination of trepidation about her having a boyfriend before college (which is weird, doesn’t she know a lot of people are in relationships well before they’re 18?), having a long-distance boyfriend, and perhaps most importantly, a boyfriend to whom her daughter is incredibly attached. She’s been rather cold toward me and while she’s tended to be polite to my face (for the most part), my girlfriend has constantly told me about rude things she’s said behind my back and she seems to have a pretty intense vendetta against me for the sole reason that I’m dating her daughter. I get that moms are protective, but the fact that it’s gone from “she likes you as a person but she just doesn’t like that we’re dating” to “she says everything about you makes her feel uncomfortable” is really troubling.

So today my girlfriend told me that her mom had said we wouldn’t be allowed to see each other until college, which is a good 32 weeks away. I wouldn’t have been surprised if we’d come across some extended period of not being able to see each other but this is a total shock. I’m devastated, obviously, but I’m equally as devastated on my girlfriend’s behalf because I know how much it hurts her to be away from me. She often feels lonely and says that I’ve made her feel less so and that having me makes things okay. We’re clearly a great couple, and my parents absolutely adore her. They’ve been incredibly supportive not only in making sure we get to see each other, but also in just being kind to her. My girlfriend’s mom, however, has openly taken steps to see to it that we go extended periods of time without seeing each other, and has, as I’ve said, been rude to me for most of our relationship.

I should mention that my girlfriend’s dad is in the picture here too - he’s just a very quiet and reserved guy who doesn’t really participate as much in what happens in their family. My girlfriend’s family is totally a matriarchy and whatever mom says goes.

I don’t know what to do. If we lived in the same city, maybe we could keep seeing each other on the down-low, but that’s far from the case. We’re dependent on our parents for everything, so we really can’t handle this. I am not going to take this lying down, but there’s a line between pleading my case and trying to find a way to see her and coming off as a horrible person to my girlfriend’s parents who already inexplicably hate me.

If I may continue, I should add that I think I’m a pretty good person. I’m nothing but polite to my girlfriend’s parents, I clearly make their daughter very happy, and I’ve tried to be the best house guest I possibly can in the two times I’ve been allowed to visit their house. I wouldn’t just be saying I’m a good guy if I didn’t believe it. I truly can’t figure out what it is I’m doing wrong, if anything. My girlfriend’s mom is incredibly controlling and manipulative, and having been raised by perfect, loving, supportive parents, I see some of the ways she treats her daughter and it blows me away how poor I think many of her parenting tactics are.

So that’s my problem. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I (18M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (18F), and after a rocky start with her mother, her mother has decided that we won’t be allowed to see each other until we go to college together in 32 weeks.",05Jan2019,1

Knee problems and back problems, etc. at the warehouse it consisted of non stop manual labor riding a pallet jack, and old one at that so it was a bitch to turn. Twisting of my back left me going home to an aching back and my anxiety made my head go to the worst possible scenarios.

20,"So I live in Switzerland. I have now done 4 years of „Gymnasium“ which I think is college level. Currently in my second year studying business administration. I am now preparing for my exams and slowly realizing I get so extremely bored by these topics since they do simply not interest me and while I thought to myself „just get the bachelors it‘s not that hard“. I kinda realised that I probably wont be able to finish since I am already struggling on some exams and the jobs after that probably won‘t be much better. 

I am not sure if I should try to study something else which might turn out the same way or go for a job education (is that the english word?) in IT which would probably be systemtechnology. So setting up and monitoring machines. Which is a rather significant drop in salary and carreer options but it probably guarantees that I actually do something I like (I did setup a few computers/servers for the very small company of my father)

Any advice on whether a bachelors is worth it or am I just a whiny kid too lazy to learn? Should I go for the carreer or the “fulfilling” job?

A few days ago,
I was living/staying at my aunts 2 story rental apartment because my other auntie, G, was also staying there just to visit since the two rarely gotten to see each other.

We stayed there for almost a week and things was fun.
The most fun thing for me was i got to sleep in their spacious yet comfy/homey basement that their two kids used to sleep in. Who are now sleeping upstairs since they built a new room a few years ago..

And there was this big bed just for me. 
There was their old ps3 i got to play if i got bored, there was their new giant ipad they rarely used so my uncle gave it to me to play with and sometimes their big cuddly dog would visit me all the time

Anyway...
After staying there, it was time to go back home with G.

I packed my things, same old same old.
I was half asleep at the time, we had to leave really early which was 5 am. (G had a meeting in the city the day after at 9 am so we had to hurry). We left at 6 am then.

So i packed my things, half asleep, so tired and so dazed that i walked like a zombie the whole 15 minutes. 

I honestly dont remember half of it... i was so out of it.
I was too out of it, that after driving back home for 2 hours now, i slept for an hour, 
i got thirsty, so I started to ransack my purple bag-
And I saw my uncle's ipad. 

We called them but my uncle said to not worry and they'll come by in Christmas anyways. 
So i was just like.. 'ok then.. i'll just play with it in the mean time'. 'Watch some movies if there was any'.
It was my first time using the ipad so i expected that there would be a lock on it and there wasn't.

So so, i opened it.
There was a lot of apps and almost 100 notifications on his reddit app.

I got nosy and checked every app, played some of the games, checked what he wrote in his Microsoft Writer thing- there was only drafts , lists of emails and a nice romantic poem about wanting to ask the girl out but he was too afraid. 


An hour went by, i got bored of playing the games.
I thought i would end it on looking at the pictures. Which i hesitated to because... i put myself in his shoes. I felt an immediate no-no.
But curiosity got the best of me and i began browsing.

There was a lot of pictures, screenshots and albums he created. 

I admit, some pictures was half naked women in bikinis with big breasts. I totally understand. Lol. 
Boys will be boys and all that. 

I pressed back and i saw a 'special' album with the title that only had a '♡' on it. Most of the other albums only had numbers on them and short letters. So i got curious again.

I clicked on it....




I saw my pictures... 
Pictures that I took on my long lost iphone in 2014. When i was only 14.
My selfies. The selfies i took out of boredom. The selfies i took when i tried on every types of make up by watching youtube tutorials. Pictures that included only me. 
Selfies that i NEVER posted online or shared with my friend. 

I got a little scared and hella shocked. I didnt bother telling G. 
I just sat quietly and slowly scrolled down for 2 minutes looking at every pictures of me.
There was lots... even some selfies i dont even remember taking them.

What i wanted to know was how tf did he even get all of these.

It wasnt possible he had my iphone. 
Because i lost my iphone in a hotel, far away from where they live.
It had a complicated very hard password on it that no one could guess it.


.....
im....creeped out. 



Yes.. i gave it back to him this christmas. 
I didnt want to touch his hands or look at him the same way ever again. The whole day, i distanced myself from him and eventually went back home. In awe.
In the flesh, he's apparently a 'nice guy' and a 'sweet guy' that cooks for his family since he's a former chef. But now... im doubting it. 


No.. i didnt delete the album. Because i get scared easily and dont want to anger men. (Trauma)


I just wanna know if im either delusional or 100% right. 
Im confused.

Help

22,"I just learned that someone I used to go to high school with is posting anti gay, racist, anti anything that’s not Christian, and anti feminist posts on their Facebook. Normally I am not privy to this because Reddit is the only social media I find acceptable. This kid has the fucking gal to party with us every drinking holiday ( normally Halloween, st paddy’s day, New Years, etc). Ultimately we’re a group of friends that are comprised of these things that he is slandering: gay, non white, feminist, non religious or non Christian religions etc. Considering we all end up at the gay bar every time, and he always picks up a fat chick (another thing he also says he hates according to FB) I find his hypocrisy to be intolerable. I understand that he rolls with a different set of people now, and that, I guess he fallen into a more conservative state of mind, but that does not give him liberty to just abandon that one night, a few times a year, and pretend he’s not spouting hate the rest of it.

Tbh, I believe no matter what a person says, they are entitled to their opinions, but at least stand by it. You wanna say how much that people are destroying the country? Fine, but don’t shed your skin to hang out because we’re more fun, and accepting of who you are. ( ultimately I think he is trying to climb the social/ financial ladder, and the people he hangs out with hold these opinions, and he’s trying to fit in).

24,"I used to work out excessively and I had a very unhealthy relationship with food. I would hop from binge eating to barely eating anything at all. And when I worked out, I would do the same workouts. I really had idea what I was doing, but was too prideful to ask. I’m pretty petite naturally, but am currently “skinny fat” and I want to tone up. I’m not sure where to start. I have about 5-10 pounds I’d like to shed, or at least tone up. I want to have a tighter, more toned body. Where does cardio come to play? What foods do I cut out/ add in and what exercises are good? 

If it matters, I’m a 23f, 5’7, 135.

To key notes: 1.) I have a mammal allergy (Alpha Gal) and can’t eat pork, beef, venison, bison, lamb, etc. and 2.) I don’t want to go over the top. Not trying to become a body builder, or compete in shows or anything. Just a more balanced, healthy life.

Also my favorite character)

Please trust me when I say I don't really WANT the pocketwatch, but would it be stupid to give him both when he really only likes one character?

My mum had a depression when I was younger (8 years old) and since then she gets some anxiety attacks but she is so much better. She has always been an amazing mum and has pushed us to do our best. However, although my dad did help us through this tough time he always makes fun of her or b**ches about her to me (and others) because of 'what she put him through' when she was ill. He doesn't say anything encouraging and since the age of 10 he's been saying he will leave the house (I am now 20). These last few years have been so hectic with him saying he will leave my mum more often. This winter I came home from uni and it's as if everything collapsed. My dad has supposedly found a new place where he will be living as of next week but he lies so much I don't know if this is true. He only tells me this because he knows I will tell my mum.

I won't bore you with the details of her conversation, but by pretending not to be disgusted, I got her to say the following things:

\-Her weight (which is pretty high)

\-She works as a ""crush sitter,"" which is a ""job"" where she sits on children's heads for 4 hours to discipline the child.

\-She once crushed a young child to death in front of her Mom, who was ""turned on by it.""

\-The country where she lives

\-Her pay, which amounts to $250/hr

\-She regrets nothing.

She also sent several photographs of herself, including her face.  The last thing I sent her was asking whether or not all of this was true, and she never replied.  She said it all in such a nonchalant way that it seemed like she believed it was true, but I thought it was worth asking anyway.

The details of this incident were all very strange.   What kind of weirdo pays that kind of money to have a fatso sit on your kid, right?

So my dad is a high ranking official in my community. I have lived with that my whole life. I acknowledge that I am privileged in the fact that my family had enough money to help me through university financially and I come from a place where I was raised in such a way that I was socially able to be functional enough to get me a good job. Huge advantage in life. Yes I acknowledge that my name didn't hurt my professional situation. I feel guilty about this and I have tried my best to make myself successful on my own accord as much as possible and not bring up who my father is or ride his coat tales. Here is my question:

I was recently asked for some professional advice in my field (fyi it is not the same field as my dad) and I thought I did a really good job. I told my partner about what I had done and was really happy with myself. I said (this person) really seems to like me and what I do. My partner responded with 'maybe that is because you are (my dad's) kid. That really hurt my feelings because I felt I had done a good job and this person legitimately felt I had helped. My partner and I got in a big fight about it. My partner told me I need to acknowledge who my dad is when I think about my accomplishments. I think that is fair but in this instance I think I did it myself. Anyway my partner stormed off and wont speak to me now. My feelings are hurt and I feel like maybe I don't deserve the accolades I got. I feel sad now because I've tried my best to step out of my dad's shadow on my own.

One of my good friends from high school, we’ve raised our boys together, has recently told her son she doesn’t want him to hang out with mine as much anymore.   I can’t help but link this to the fact that my husband and I have recently stopped hanging out with her and her husband.  Where we had more kids and stopped hanging out as frequently they stopped having kids, stopped watching their kids and started swinging and doing coke and adderall to name the things I know about.  . They have admitted to all of these and feel no shame- which is fine- it’s their life, not mine- it’s not for me.  But you can see why I have no fucking idea why they think MY SON is going to taint theirs.  My husband and I hate her husband for reasons that mostly have to do with how he treats her.

I’ve read my kids texts, he’s gotten in trouble for the off color humor and was told to not text or send anything you wouldn’t send to someone’s mom.  I feel like if I confront her with this it could turn bad because of the resentment that has nothing to do with the kids.

I met her for the first time yesterday for about 20-30 mins. I felt comfortable with her and she was very easy to talk to. 

i have speech impediment and English isn't my native language. So i find it hard to convo irl which idm and she was aware of that.

Now, im perfectly fine with staying friends as she's a great person. However today, im not too sure what happened, maybe i somehow messed up when i met her irl but today she was giving me very very late respond  on snapchat and didn't show much interest. Thats alright, maybe she's busy? But then i send her couple of memes on Instagram, she just left it on seen. No matter what, in the past she always liked the memes on Instagram but today she just left it on seen. I'm confused and pretty sad about it.

I can‘t really reach out with my problems to my friends because it‘s not a kind of friendship you talk about such stuff because they wouldn‘t believe i have such problems.  

My family isn‘t either an option because even though they are open minded to almost everything and they really love me there not really open to such things, they think psychiatrist aren‘t doing anything etc. 


I don‘t know what to do now because maybe i don‘t even have anything of the things i said and i‘m just complaining  abou nothing. 
I could just go on with my life and trying to pretend there is nothing. I don‘t know any other option than this and not enjoing life or just not live throuh it. 

I know i‘m not in a position to cry about stuff because there are a lot more people having it worse than my and i‘m sorry.

40,"I currently live in the UK, and our education system means we go to a college for 2 years before potentially university. I got to pick which college I went in to, but I played it 'safe' and ended up staying on at a sixth form attached to my high school. A lot of my friends stayed on with me, however my real close friends moved away.

I'm assuming most people (especially men) have this dynamic of having some lads you hang around with, Vs having close friends. The main difference is who you can be vunreble around without being mocked.

The issue arises where my lads group are the most boring people I know and they never do anything together. Every day in my college is the same and it's starting to really get to me. Furthermore, they never know when to quit being assholes. For example, I am sensitised to certain sounds and I can't control it, they kept making these noises and I ended up hitting them and getting proper bollocked for it 

I am only 1 term in to my college, so I think moving is a possibility, however the other college has a different maths exam board, though the content is like 80% the same. Furthermore this college is a 25-30 min bike whereas the current one is a 7 min walk.

I just finished my masters in English Literature and had plans to go on to do my PhD. But the more I think about my time in college I come to realise more and more that I was there because I felt that, while I was learning, it felt like I was growing as a person. I want to be a professor but it's such a competitive field and in all honesty, I'm probably too lazy. Intelligent but lazy.
So I'm working full time as a kitchen porter, a job I took to pay my way through my masters and I'm struggling to find relevant work. But even if I did I don't know if it would make me happy. I have a girl who loves me and a great family, but I don't have purpose. I have (hopefully) a lot of years left to live but nothing I can realistically think of to do with them.

So before I go on I am 18, female and I live in a place where education may be a bit different. I live on an island in the UK and I'm unsure of how school systems work for everyone else so i thought i'd give it a little explanation. We start school around 4/5 years old, we go on to primary school which goes up to year 6 and then we go into secondary school from year 7 to 11. After this we go to college in which the island I'm on there is only 1 college and then we can fly out for university if we want and if not there are now becoming available courses for 'uni' over here.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason i felt i had time, I've always been the person to say i would like a gap year before I go on to working because i've always realised that the system we live in is to go to school, get employed, work till were old to finally retire and live the life we where told to live. I wanted the gap year because i thought that if i could just put that system on hold just for one year and live my life as we're actually told to do whilst we're young then i would do that before rushing off into employement. I've been told many times I'm a party girl and for me it seemed like maybe becoming a party rep (a party ambassador) for a few months seemed like the best thing for me.

I didn’t know how to respond, so he just said, “Don’t let it effect your relationship with him, but just know when it comes to anything personal during the bad times, he may not  be there. Now that I’m older and me and my siblings are adults, he can handle us, but back then, he had no clue.”

&amp;#x200B;

Ive spent the last four years working a lucrative job for a big famous company in SF and being generally unhappy. Two months ago, in a fit of misery, I applied for a job in NYC, closer to where my family lives. I got the interview, then I had an upswing in mood and decided I dont actually want to leave SF but the company was offering me free tickets to visit home to talk to them so I figured ""sure, why not, I'll interview"". The month before the interview was the best month of my life since moving to SF - I had an epiphany that all I need is to believe in myself and try really hard to treat everyone as well as I possibly can, got out of my emotional shitpile, made a bunch of friends, started dating someone I like, and generally feeling pleased in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I flew out, did the interview, loved the team, loved the project, and got a ridiiiiiculously good job offer. I was taken aback, called my family, and realized that they all really miss me and want me to come home. I realized I miss them too, and feel like I owe them something because they helped a lot in me coming out of my depression, could use my help for some things, and also I wasn't speaking to them for a very long time before this year due to losing my trust in them after some trauma in my teenage years in retrospect nobody was responsible for, and everyone acted reasonably during given their human flaws. I also have gotten very unhappy with my current job and the company I currently work for. I told them how much I was offered, and realized I couldnt really tell them I wasn't signing the offer without really hurting their feelings, since they knew I dont like my current job, knew I was offered an amazing offer to come home, dont have much tying me down to the area, and only started dating my gf/being happy a month ago, and so in a fit of emotion and temptation I signed the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

The start date is a long ways away. Post signing , im spending a lot of time with my girlfriend and her friends, and exploring cool hobbies I really like that you cant really do back in new york as much (the scene for some of my niche interests is much less developed there) and generally found ive acclimated to this area more than I thought I would. The list of friends I will miss and opportunities I wish I had explored is long. Realistically, I could find another job here - and I could continue to re establish ties with my families without moving back. I fear I may have made a mistake and I dont actually want to move - but I signed the offer and gave the company my word.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the ""right"" thing to do is stay the course, move for the job, and if necessary move back in a year after giving the company a fair amount of my time. I can probably use my newfound powers of anti-misery to make new friends, and re-connect with old ones - and build my life back home dispite the lack of specific individuals I really like and hobbies I will miss. Also, Ive talked to my GF about this and she is ok with doing long distance, particularily since I have enough money to fly back whenever I feel like due to being very wealthy/ privledged.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I cant help but feeling I may be making a huge mistake. I feel happy for the first time in about 15 years, it might not be wise to throw that away due to an impulsive action taken in a fit of emotion. I dont want to have to risk starting over again when I have a real chance at happiness right now by staying here.

I'm thinking that she means that if we had sex that it would be purely just for pleasure as we both have our own lives that we live. How should I bring up sex in this situation?

Anyway, one of my assignments is proving pretty difficult for myself and my friend to understand (it's a group assignment we have to do in pairs), so earlier today I decided to email my teacher and ask for a little clarification on a few things. 

To my surprise, I got a fairly lengthy and some abusive response earlier this evening explaining that she would not give out 'tips' two days before hand in and that any questions we had should have been addressed to her over the past two weeks... she then proceeded to rant about not being surprised that I was confused by the assignment and her handling out a fail grade wouldn't come as a surprise to her... I should point out that I've never failed a single assignment in my whole school life. 

The response seemed very angry and personal when all I was curious about was clearing up a few details of the assignment itself. She ended the email with 'I look forward to failing you on Monday'.

I’m starting college in 3 days and I thought I’d be excited for that, but honestly I just feel nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s such an empty feeling. 

The last time I felt genuinely excited and content was whenever I got to spend time my now ex-boyfriend and a short kinda romantic fling I had with someone recently that just didn’t end up working out. I know isn’t very good since I should be able to make myself happy without being in a romantic relationship. Not that either relationship was toxic and that I was dependent on them, I just genuinely would get excited and happy to see them even if it was only once or twice a week.

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I just don’t like this feeling and it’s making me irritable and act not like myself.

My boyfriend is an amazing human being, he’s so respectful to me, he’s even helped me with my social anxiety, he’s very funny and fun to be around but I’m just not as excited as I once was in August and September. It’s like I’m feeling “meh” about everything, if I see him fine if I don’t fine? If I don’t hang out with him for a while when I do I’m not super excited, I just kinda keep to myself and it takes a bit of coaxing to get me to talk and interact (I’m also an only child and don’t have many friends so I’m really used to being alone and entertaining myself) I also tend to be an overthinker, and I feel like I don’t love him anymore. Is it because of my anxiety/depression/BPD/mood changers etc? Or is it cause I really don’t love him? He’s so good to me I don’t want to lose him, he loves me and accepts me despite all my problems.

64,I recently purchased the Ancestry DNA kit and mentioned this to my stepsister on my Dad’s side. Her response was “oh so you can find your sibling?” Apparently my stepmom told her and said that if I had any questions I should ask my Aunt. I immediately started freaking out because although I had suspected something every time I asked my mom and Grandma both denied it. I knew if I asked my mom she would just keep saying no and tell me I was wrong. I decided to call my Aunt last night and asked her. She very reluctantly confirmed that my mom had a daughter when she was 17 who was given up for adoption. She said it was never spoken about again and because she was only 11 when it happened she doesn’t remember all of the details. My main concern is how do I bring this up to my mom? She’s struggled with mental illness since my grandma’s death and I’m worried about what this could do to her but at the same time I don’t think I can just let this go. I also have an older brother who has no idea about any of this. I’m just feeling like I’ve been lied to my whole life.

65,"I have a close guy friend that I’ve known for about 4 years. We met in school and now live in different cities. We text and talk on the phone a couple/few times a week like when the other is on their way to work or something. He tries to visit my town where we have other mutual friends and we all get together or I try to visit his town and get together with friends. When I visit, he frees up his schedule so I’m not alone while we wait for other friends. Now I don’t assume any of this means he has feelings for me, he’s just being a good friend.

He had a girlfriend that he’s known way before we met but only started dating about a year ago and I was there for him through some problems along the way, which I think strengthened our friendship. 

So recently, he’s been acting a bit weird and texting me sexual and suggestive stuff and we usually make sexual jokes all the time so the first couple of times that happened I kind of went with it but only as a joke and then changed the topic. This is only over text. On the phone we usually talk about our day and even talk about certain issues like politics, economics, etc. 

He’s been a bit off the past couple of weeks and Don’t know if he only sees me as someone to pass the time on the phone with and can get away with a bit of flirting. I know I shouldn’t have gone along with it and I won’t anymore, but I don’t know if He doesn’t view me as a close friend anymore? I feel like we don’t have many heart to hearts or share emotional things but it’s probably a guy thing and they don’t need that in a friendship?

68,"Throwaway account because I have friends who use Reddit.

I work part time as a manager at my father's business, the coworker who we will call Jane (not her real name) started a few months ago.

I don't feel comfortable with what is happening for various reasons including: 

1) I am in a committed relationship. 

2) She is in a committed relationship. 

3) I am technically her boss (and the power dynamic concerns me)

4) Since my father is the owner, I feel the power dynamic situation is worse

5) She is 17 and I am 23, which is a bit much for me personally

Objectively she is attractive, but not at all my type. Even if all of these other elements were not at play I still don't think I would pursue anything.

On her first day she came in wearing improper uniform. It was a really minor violation, and something I just needed to make her aware of. There was no discipline of any kind other than a ""Hey Jane, your socks fall outside of our dress code, don't worry about it today but in the future make sure that X."" She seemed very disturbed by this but seemed to continue her shift as normal. Later that day (still her first shift) another employee remarked to me that she had said something quite rude to him, and he was unsure how to react. At the end of her shift I let her know and asked her to be mindful of how others may perceive her and the things she says even if she doesn't mean them to be rude. At this point she burst into tears and told me that ""I sound just like her father"" (which was the first red flag I noticed). She then told me all about her strained family relationship and I wasn't sure how to stop the conversation so I let her vent.

&amp;#x200B;

A week or so later I was tidying up the break room while Jane and another coworker were having their lunch chatting about a party they had gone to that weekend (they're both high school students). Jane asked me if I ""get drunk"" and I told her that I do not, but also that that is not an appropriate question to ask her boss. She then asked me if I ""blaze"" and I told her that that is also an inappropriate question. She corrected herself and asked if I ""smoke marijuana"" I told her no but that the problem was not the way she asked the question, but the root of the question itself was inappropriate. I left the break room shortly after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my responsibilities include checking the bathrooms have been cleaned at the end of the night, and I always knock and then pause before entering the ladies room. A few days later I was doing my nightly checks and, after knocking and waiting like normal, opened the door to the ladies room. Jane was standing right by the door. She had her shirt off and made no move to cover herself when I opened the door. I turned away but kept the door propped open a crack with my foot and asked why she didn't answer when I knocked and if she was alright. She said she didn't hear me (which is bullshit) and added that I can come in and check the bathroom anyway. I told her I am not comfortable checking the bathroom while someone else is in it and waited for her to leave. After this incident I talked to my girlfriend about what had been happening and she (my girlfriend) said ""watch out for that girl"" and left it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

The next time Jane and I worked together she told me about how frequently she cheats on her boyfriend. I told her that was not an appropriate workplace conversation and she said ""maybe we can finish the conversation after work, and I'll show you what I mean"" I told her verbatim ""No. This is incredibly inappropriate. A lot of your behavior has been recently and I am uncomfortable. I am not flirting with you, please be professional."" She didn't say anything back and instead took a step closer to me and said ""If that's what you want"" in what was meant to be a seductive manner. I should have said something then but I just walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was in the stock room putting some things away and she came in right as I was finishing. I didn't think much of it as there were plenty of reasons for her to come into the room. She was right by the doorway so I said excuse me and motioned for her to step to the side. She said ""just squeeze by"" and I stupidly did. While I was shuffling past her she stuck her butt out against my pelvis and pushed me against the door frame while moving from side to side and said my name as if I was the one doing it. I pushed her out of the way and put a few steps between us. I said ""Jane. You cannot do this. I will file a complaint against you if something like this happens again"" and she basically said that if I do that she will file a complaint back against me saying that I have been sexually harassing her. Although my father is the owner of the location it is a franchise so he is not involved in HR. We have cameras but they do not record audio and there isn't one in the stock room.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that since I don't have any evidence it's basically just her word against mine. I don't think anyone believes I am the sort of person who would do that to anyone, let alone an employee, but if something is said I'm not sure what will happen. I'm not sure how to handle the situation and I'm not sure if there's anything I can do in advance to protect myself more. I

70,"I've had problems with eating-disorder related behaviors in the past but was never diagnosed with an actual eating disorder, but my parents think I've been recovered from those problems for roughly 6 months now.  However, around 3 weeks ago, I started purging again, and as soon as I did it once, I was instantly stuck back in the cycle of doing it consistently.  It's a lot worse than it used to be, and I have tried every trick in the book that I can think of to stop.  I'm worried I might have an actual eating disorder, and am concerned that since I've been expelling all my fluids for around 3 weeks, I might be dehydrated or have a lack of sodium or something in my body, which might cause a problem.  I'm concerned that if I pass out or have a significant problem, I will end up in the hospital, and then everyone will know what happened.  Last time I had problems like this, my family blamed me for causing problems and said that I just wanted attention, so I'm not exactly keen on telling them that I am struggling with this again.  If I tell my therapist that I've gone this long without proper nutrition, she might also tell my parents, or even worse, I could end up in a hospital.  I can't think of any options that won't result in serious negative repercussions that might cause me to spiral even further away from the healthy lifestyle that I hope to live.

75,"Okay, so I volunteer 4 days a week at the local dog rescue. I help train them, clean, walk them and feed them. Recently I've also taken an animal studies diploma so I can work as a vet's nurse assistant.

I came across one pup that I had an immediate connection with. He's sweet and despite coming from an abusive background, he took to me immeadiately. Though he was wary of literally everyone else, from day 1 he'd come over and lay on my lap. I've spent the last few months socialising him and getting him ready for adoption and he's almost ready now. Sufficient to say I'm hella attached. I suffer from mental health issues myself, but working and taking care of dogs has been extremely therapeutic for me. This pup in particular has been incredible. He seems to know exactly when I'm about to have a panic attack and comes over and alerts me to it and snuggles into my arm until it passes. I've always wanted to adopt a dog, but I've never wanted one specific pup more.

The problem is, I live in a studio apartment that won't let me have pets. I'd have to move, and unfortunately since my studio is rent controlled, if I do move it'll have to be into a sharehouse in a less desirable location. I've done the math, and if I move into a sharehouse with 1-2 flatmates, I'll be able to not only afford all costs related to owning a dog, but be able to put away a decent sum of money as savings each month in case of any emergency bills, and I'll also be able to afford the highest level of cover in terms of pet insurance.

It's not an impulse decision, I've been thinking about doing it for months now. If I make the move, I can more than afford it, but I'd have to give up living in a fantastic private space in a great location. My commutes will become 10 minutes longer. Either way, it'll only be for 12 months. After a year, I'll be moving to another state (pupper will be coming with me) for a better job that I've accepted and be able to live alone again.

My question is....is it worth it for me to trade in a great living situation so I can have a dog? I want to say yes, but I'm not sure if there's something I haven't thought about or if I'm making a terrible decision.",05Jan2019,1

I woke up around 12 and decided to  go ahead and see if i can go chat with some people.

I chatted with 2 girls (one was single and one had a boyfriend) and got their snaps (both of them looked alike and talked the same weirdly enough).

One talks to me, we talk about dating, blah blah blah, she didn't respond (turns out she blocked me).

I don't remember the her not responding part.

I go to sleep again, wake up and start texting this other girl (cause she messaged me and i thought the girl who i was originally texting messaged me back).

I start talking to her, we're talking about sexual stuff, personal stuff, blah blah blah thinking it was the original girl that i was talking to.  
We were talking about going on a date, laser tag, blah blah blah.

I'm here thinking she's single and ready to mingle,  and she drops the bomb that she has a boyfriend.

I should also mention our breakup was mutual, so he doesn’t have hard feelings towards me and I have none towards him either. 

Help? Should we tell him before we see him in person? Should we do it the day we return to school? ",05Jan2019,1
90,"I know there's a ton of these out there, but I've tried nearly all the advice out there and I'm hoping someone here could help me figure out how to make this spring semester much better than my fall semester. I've always been really good at school, but I started college this fall and nothing seems to be going well for me.

1. Roommate: she was trash. she was controlling and manipulative and for some reason, she wanted me to basically become her. She was always telling me that I needed to change how I dressed if I wanted friends (i.e. dress like you're going to a club every night, which I don't mind other people doing. It's just not my thing), always trying to set me up with one of her friends because ""once you get laid, all your problems will just go away"", and sexiling me all the time to the point where I would only really go into my dorm to change my clothes most days just so that I didn't have to deal with her. She got angry at me because I put up decorations and pictures, saying that she felt that she wasn't welcome in the dorm. Whenever I tried to bring up the fact that it was a shared room and that I had every right to be there just as she did, she would say that she felt as if I was pushing her into a corner and that it was affecting her mental health. She'd accuse me of going into her stuff and despite all of this, I was really worried for her health. She was on medication for ADHD and depression and drank a lot. If I asked her if it was okay to mix her medications with alcohol, she'd just tell me to mind my own business. As far as I knew, she didn't go to classes and skipped her doctor's appointments.  I never had mental health issues, but while she was my roommate, I never had any motivation to do anything, couldn't really relax anymore, and overall, just felt like shit. I didn't really have anyone else to fall back to because it's a new city for me and my family was so far away that they could never visit me.She eventually moved out of the dorm due to me ""taking up too much space in the dorm"" (that I was hardly ever in??) so that issue kind of resolved itself, but now I'm getting a new roommate for the semester and I am terrified because what if my new roommate turns out to be like my old one? I can handle a lot. I shared a room with my older brother for 8 years and even though we're polar opposites in every way (he's hyper/extroverted/night owl while I'm more quiet/introverted/early bird) I was able to handle it, but after roommate #1, I don't know how to even go about bringing up a conversation like that. 
2. College: I've always been really good at school--taking 6 college credits while taking 5 AP classes and doing a shit ton of extra curriculars while getting straight A's good. And I've always wanted to be an engineer. I came into the college I'm currently in with my calculus sequence and gen physics as well as getting a ton of AP credit, so I took honors chemistry, statics, fourth semester spanish and a seminar class. I only took one more credit than the minimum to be a full time student, but I struggled so much. I ended up getting a BC in chem, D in statics, an AB in spanish , and an A in the seminar courses, which means my GPA is now shot. To get into the college of engineering for BME at my school, you need at least a 3.5 core GPA, which won't happen for me unless I end up taking a ton of credits in core courses, which I know I won't be able to handle. I have to retake statics and honestly? I don't know where I went wrong. I will admit that I went into college thinking it was going to be just like high school, so for the first few weeks, I just cruised through classes. I went to the lectures, did the homework, and studied a day or two before the midterm. When I got my midterms (50% on both chem and statics) back, I knew that I had to change something. So I emailed the professors and talked to them. I started going into drop in tutoring, signed up for 1:1 tutoring, went to office hours, and put in extra time outside of that to just go through problems in the book. But my grades didn't get that much better. I've emailed the professors and TA's and they are all really good professors/teachers/people, so this is 100% on me, but I'm just not sure where I went wrong. I changed the way I studied (went from rewriting notes to trying different practice problems and went from memorizing to trying to understand the underlying concepts), but for some reason, the concepts just didn't stick. I emailed the advisor at my college and he told me that for now it's more important that I show that I can handle a reasonable creditload and write an appeal to the college. My professors and TA's have already told me that they would be willing to write letters of rec but I'm so scared for the next semester. I'm taking 4 3 credit core classes (the statics class, one math, one engineering class (required), and a comp sci) and even though I have experience with all of those classes, I'm now worried that maybe I don't have what it takes to get through college. My parents have always believed that I would be able to crush college but now they don't fully believe I can do it at this college and are talking about taking me out of this college and making me study CS at a community college. Now I just don't know if I'm cut out for it.
3. Scholarships/Work/Study Abroad: Because my GPA is so low now, one of the scholarships that I have (2 yr renewable one) might be taken away from me. I've emailed the board and they're giving me until the end of the semester to raise my GPA to a 3.0, but I'm just so scared. If I lose this scholarship, my parents will probably take me out of this college and transfer me into a community college. (also nothing against community colleges, it's just that I don't want to live at home, also despite all that I'm saying here, I really like the college I'm at.) I also can't seem to find any more scholarships to apply for because my GPA is so low and FAFSA believes that we don't need much financial aid. Are there any scholarship search engines that you guys know of that filters by those? I also worked this semester to help pay for some of my own food and tuition. I really enjoyed working, the pay was nice, I didn't have to work a lot of hours a week, and it was related to engineering so overall it was a really cool experience, but I don't know if I should quit the next semester so I can focus on my studies. It would give me a few more hours a week to study, but asking my dad for money is kind of like wearing a fanny pack: you can do it, but why would you want to. I was also planning on studying abroad this summer but my dad was only going to let me if I won a scholarship. The problem now is that my GPA is too low to be eligible for any of the scholarships. I was really looking forward to studying abroad. It's a place I've never been to but a lot of my international friends are from this place. I even started learning the language on Duolingo. I understand that it's a full semester's worth of tuition, but I would be taking 3 classes that are required for graduation there and it would be an amazing way to learn more about a new place. Do any of you have any ideas of how I could approach this convo with my dad? The minute I bring it up he asks me ""did you get a scholarship?"" and since the answer is no, he doesn't talk about it anymore. 
4. Health: Because of all of the above reasons, my physical and mental health is shit. I went into college knowing that I was good at something and the motivation to do something about it, and now I legitimately fear next semester. I used to eat pretty healthily and work out regularly, but I'm honestly not sure how to regain that balance again. I basically lived off of granola bars and juice this semester and went to the gym maybe once the entire semester. How do I balance being healthy with college workload? Mentally, I'm drained. I have one (1) friend and it seems like everyone else has made their own friends and are having a good time or studying together, and overall just succeeding. I feel like a fraud. I have very little motivation to study or even go outside at this point and all I want to do is sleep for the next forever.  But I want to get better. I really want this semester to go better than the last. How do I change my attitude about college? How do I get excited about learning again? 

sorry this got so long. I've just holding this in for so long that I think I kinda just needed to let it out. if you have any advice I'd love to hear it. even if you don't, thanks for reading til the end.",05Jan2019,1
91,"Hi everyone, throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

About 4 years ago I (f25) started webcaming on a popular site with my partner (m27). We didn’t expect to become a popular couple on the site but when we cam, we are the most viewed room. We are making a decent amount of money now, so much that it has become a side career that we fall back onto if we want to make quick cash (to paint a picture, we both have normal jobs as well but we could probably quit our day jobs if we wanted to and survive off camming). We have developed a bit of a fan base and have regular people who are on the site just to see us. I know there are people out there that record our shows and post them to other sites, so I knew that eventually my friends and family would find out but it has just recently started coming to their attention. Someone who I haven’t spoken to in a very long time has contacted me asking if what he saw was me. I denied it (not sure why I denied it, probably cause I was put on the spot?) but I’m just feeling really down and anxiety ridden about it. I don’t technically know if my family knows yet but this person is friends with my siblings and it’s only a matter of time. I don’t regret being an adult entertainer, it’s fun and I can use this money to pay of a lot of student debt or even travel around. I know not all people understand that this is a job that I get paid to do, with someone I’m comfortable with, because there is such a stigma related to porn. I guess I’m just not ready for the judgement from my family and peers.

I would just like some advice on how to handle the situation. Should I just come clean to my immediate family and close friends? Should I keep denying? Is there any camgirls or cam couples out there in this community that can offer guidance or has been through this situation? ",05Jan2019,1
92,My friend and I have this cat and mouse situation right now. we’ve had ups and downs wrong timings where were both into eachother at different moments. Recently me i told her i love her then she took two steps back and said she wanted to be friends. So I took a week off from talking to her just recently added her on social media. Shell send me a snap or two then disappear or insta dm and i wont respond but then ill send one she wont respond. Shell type in snap then erase it so i get notification. We started talking in person a bit because she goes to same bootcamp as me and start stretching next to me or in my view. Not really texting each other like we used to. I know when we start shell be like “i missed you so much” or “i love you” etc. its a cycle with this one. Then i get the feels and its this situation all over. I want to be ahead of her this time. I know she hides her feelings about me all the time. Randomly posts about me secretly. So how do i play hard to get? Shes got me in the hook but this time is different I think I got the chance to make all the moves. Act like i dont care and what not. Help. ,05Jan2019,1
93,"Let me start by saying that I love my girlfriend more than anything. She is the love of my life. But today something happened and I don’t know how to react to it or what to do. As a little backstory, my gf’s parents separated a couple months ago and she really didn’t take it well. Her dad decided he was not happy anymore and left. No infidelity no nothing, just unhappiness. This caused my gf to become very resentful of her dad and has developed a bit of anxiety and mild depression due to it. 

I’m always there for her no matter what. Countless times has she asked me to come with her whenever she goes to meet or eat with her dad and I’ve said yes every time. She asked me to go again with her downtown with her dad to eat, at the same time my friends who I barely see decided to hang out. I consider myself very social but at the same time pretty reserved in the sense that I don’t go out much or have many friends except for my gf and a couple of others. So my group From high school decided to hang out tonight and I wanted to see them. 

This really upset my girlfriend. We’ve been having a couple problems lately with her calling me unreliable and always being late (something I’m aware I need to work on). She called me unreliable again tonight because I decided not to go when I had never agreed to in the first place. But I didn’t go not only because I wanted to hang out with my friends but because I didn’t want to be in between again. I feel like if I’m always there nothing will be solved between them. She got to the point where she didn’t want to text me anymore and said she was going to block me if I kept talking to her. She gets upset when I try to give her advice about her father situation and yesterday she corrected me when I told her I understand, saying that I don’t, that I’m simply empathetic (which is true, I don’t understand because I’ve never been through this).

I don’t know what to do. How do I go on about this situation. Talking about it or fixing it. I love her more than anything but I hate to argue in this way. Especially  because she’s been getting very verbally or emotionally  aggressive whenever she’s upset, something that I somewhat understand given the emotional distress she’s being going through. Any advice would really help me out. Thank you in advance.",05Jan2019,1
94,"Alright, before I begin I just want to say, I’m not here to bash anybody. I just want to have answers and perspectives on this situation, because I genuinely need it.
So, I was on YouTube, (during my atheistic phase) and watched a couple of videos debunking theism, as usual. I made a comment saying how I’ve lost my dad while being an atheist and he was a Jehovah’s Witness and how’s it’s been a struggle for me ever since. Then this person responded to my comment and gave me his Discord. On that platform, we seemed to click. I asked if he had an iPhone (my preferred media of texting) and he said and I asked for his phone number, which he gave. Since I have an iPhone and an iPad, we talked on my iPad then in my phone. I messaged him everyday, for two days I believe, so I could get to know him better. We talked and we both had a lot in common, both liberal, gun control advocates, ect and our interest in sci fi. He even recommended that I watch this one anime, that I had completely forgotten about, and it had time travel and futurism. A couple of weeks later, my text messages on iMessage were turning green, I didn’t think much of it, because I also was texting someone and they turned green as well, but that was because they had a different phone contract. So I thought, maybe he’s busy with school. I texted him saying “hey” and “Heyyo” but I got no response. No responses were fine by me because he had school and moved up to high school and skipped 8th grade because of his high GPA. So I texted him, about once a month, but during October like three times a month. Then, I went onto discord and messaged him. 

He said, “ Do you not get it? I blocked you for a reason. Go away.” And I said “why? What did I do? Could you give me a reason?” He replied,” you’re dumb and annoying. There’s your reason, now leave me alone.” I answered, “ how about you actually prove to me how I’m dumb and annoying?” He then responded,” my girlfriends controlling what I say” he then showed me a screenshot from her girlfriend saying that he should tell me that I’m dumb and annoying.( so basically, she’s telling him to insult me, controlling right?) so he said that all three of us were going to y’all. His girfriend( I’ll name Ally) was being a cunt... to say the least. I told her that he can talk to whoever he pleases, and she said ,” excuse me?” And I replied you know what I said. Then Ally proceeded to call me a bitch and I told her she was childish. As more bickering started to come from her mouth, Jonah (the one I talked to and got no response for months) said I’m sorry princess, but I have to choose my princess over you. And I thought aww that’s sweet, he’s basically saying he’s choosing me (m names princess) over his gf but I soon came to realize that that wasn’t the case. He blocked me and chose his girlfriend. I felt like crying, I was really hurt, but then I thought, no, I have to know. I couldn’t just leave him with his abusive girlfriend like that! He’s a lot stronger than he thinks, and he was so scared of her
. 
So I made another account called Allis so I could message him. He accepted my friend request and I told him my name is Allis and I got his discord from someone else. But then I told him I loved him, platonically, and that I want the best for him. I told him that what he did yesterday really hurt me and I almost hated him for it. But I told him I stilled cared about him. He replied,” so you lied to me?” And I said no, I faked it. And then  he said that no you wouldn’t, you would’ve told the truth if you really cared. I thought if I said it from the start then you would’ve blocked me from the start, eliminating my chance to explain myself. I replied, yes I do, why do you think I made this account? He then responded ,” to stalk me. I replied I didn’t stalk you, I came here to compromise, maybe compromise isn’t the best word, but I still want to talk to you. He then said, that’s awfully selfish of you. Don’t you think.
I told him that he gutted me and apologized for not talking as often as I should, because I’ve been through so much lately. He then said I’m sure you have. I thanked him for understanding.

I then proceeded to tell him that I have to go back to school which I’ll die because it takes a toll on me. He then said that I was trying to guilt trip him and I told him I wasn’t trying to scare him. I thought, I’m just trying to let you know how important you were. He then said, Alyssa was right, you really are desperate for any guys attention. Then I responded, nope, I just like talking to guys that I care about deeply, and that means you! He then asked why do you care about me, to then I said because you’re my friend. You’re smart funny and cool. He then said do you not get this. I showed him the text messages of him saying he considers me as his friend, to which he said he pitied me, then I began to question if his girlfriend is controlling him again- which he said she wasn’t. He asked if I wanted the truth and I said yes. He admitted that the girl from yesterday wasn’t his girlfriend. She was his best friend. And he said he was complaining to her about me messaging him. He was debating whether or not to block me. He decided not to. Then they had some fun. She pretended to be my psycho girlfriend. He said that was the truth behind last night. He said, and I quote”, and what can I say, fucking with you was some very good entertainment.” I was dumbfounded. I kept saying hey and Heyyo to him like once a month. I never knew that bugged him. He said yes, you annoyed me. So quite saying we’re friends. I proceeded to apologize deeply for it. He then stated that talking to me was a chore, which broke me the fuck down. I absolutely hate being clingy, and seeing that just hurt me. I said he could’ve just told me to quiet down a little and that I would stop messaging him less. He told me then I still didn’t get it and I replied I did. He said you aren’t going to message me less and you aren’t going to message me at all. I don’t want to talk to you. 

I said, I guess you’re an ass then. He replied maybe to you to which I responded no in general. He told me to hate him but I couldn’t because I still cared. He told me to go talk to people who want to talk to me and said that it’s not like I led you on. Like he had the nerves to say that. I said that he did lead me on. I also told him that he could’ve told me to message him less and that I thought he had a different phone contract or some shit. He said he blocked me, Normal people would realize that. I said well I’ve never been blocked before. He said I’m asking you to stop talking to me, u derstand. And I said yes, duhh, he replied well we shouldn’t have an issue with it. My final words were, I’m always here ok? To which he responded, oh I know, I won’t be here, see ya. I said see ya...


I’m honestly very pissed at the fact that he didn’t tell me. We could’ve just worked it out but idk. What are your thoughts? Am I being clingy? Is he being an asshole? Let me know your thoughts down below.

Tl:dr he hasn’t messaged me for months after texting him once a month. He said that I was annoying him and I’m scared that I think I’m clingy. I just like talking to people ya know?",05Jan2019,1

So i work at a restaurant in a fairly busy area and i also have been working at a nightclub in the city for about 2 months maybe? A friend hooked me up with the job because i guess they were desperate for staff. 


So because i put the restaurant first ill always do a 12.30-5am shift at the club on saturday nights. Recently ive been picking up heaps of shifts at the restauarnt (split shifts on saturdays included) and because of this i cant really be bothered continuing with the club if its not necessary. 


So ive been messaging the manager because thats how he communicates with everyone. And i said i want to give my 2 weeks notice because ive been getting busier with the restauarnt  and he responds with ""thats ok ill make sure youre working next two weeks."" In response to that i simply requested if he can find others to work the closing shift because i dont know how many more split shifts im expecting within the next two weeks. Following that i reassured i can still work the regular shift if noone else can i would just prefer to not to given the fact ill be at my original job all day.


So its been almost half an hour with no response and im just worried i pissed him off.


Theyve been training heaps of new staff and they deffinietly have enough people  anyway.


Just to reitterate i only said id prefer if the shifts were given to someone else if possible but more than happy to work if need be.

My mother sent him $2,000 AU dollars just this morning, unsure about other times. After snooping through her IPad, we saw messages that were blatantly scams with a generic name. Constantly asking for money and “my love I am so stress,” etc, etc.

My brother says we shouldn’t bring it up and that it would be a good lesson for her. My mother is very self sure and is extremely likely to disregard what we say and think we know nothing because we are just kids. We don’t exactly have a healthy relationship with our mother, for she never listens to reason and only sees us as kids. She is more likely to get mad at us for snooping.

I think we should, for this is money that can be used for our schools, food, clothes and other things we need. No one deserves to be scammed. However, I know it would end in an argument.

101,"Long story short, I knew she had a boyfriend. We were okay friends (not really close friends). At first I wasn't attracted to her(the girl's all elbows and knees), but actually come to really like her personality. I know I'm no where near as important to her as other work friends, just a casual acquaintance I guess. I like to make her laugh, which is a challenge.

I asked her number for platonic reason sharing a band. Not really trying to breakup her relationship or anything. But I figure, it might be good in case I leave the job, and plus, all stones erode with weather.

She said her bf wouldn't like it. I say I understand. Tell her about the band, and then go bout my business. I was a little down, because rejection sucks, of course; but within 15 minutes, I was back to normal.

But then today, she completely ignores me all day. She sits one cubicle away from me. I tried to tell her a joke and she sent me an emote like 'talk to the hand'. Kinda had me down, much more down than the whole rejection, I guess cause I ruined the friendship.

I wasn't in love or anything, I just really liked her so I'm thinking about abandoning ship and heading to shore.

I'm thinking I should just let the dogs lie, and let my feelings die. My thoughts on this is I should just be terse (but polite), and not really interact with her. I want to avoid going to HR (of course), and mostly want to remove the awkwardness.

Is my plan sound?

Am I reading too much into one day of radio silence?

102,"Okay, first of all, I know that none of these feelings are logical, and I know I'm an asshole for them, so before I go on, I want to emphasize that I'm not openly an asshole to people in relationships. These are all inside feelings. But I really would rather stop having them. And I don't know if there's a way to do that. 

I have had one serious relationship in my life. It was an online relationship, lasting 2 years. I'm 26 years old, still a virgin, never even kissed with tongue, never snuggled with anyone, never heard 'I love you' in person from a romantic interest. I've never casually dated, never been openly flirted with, never been able to do any of that even if I try. 

This makes me feel like an absolute alien. I watch people around me, real people and not just TV and movie people, talking about their 'worst dates' and 'best dates' and realize I've never been on an actual date in my life. They talk about going to bars and picking people up and getting numbers and it feels so foreign to me, like something that DOES only happen on TV and in movies, but I realize no, it does happen, to many many people, just not to me. 

I have friends who dated in high school. No idea what that's like. Also thought it was a TV/movie thing until I grew up and listened to people talk about it casually. So I started to realize going into my 20s that I'm really not normal. Well, maybe not 'weird' but definitely not one of the many many many people who know what it's like for multiple people, hell, even just one, to be attracted to them. 

And so we're getting to the big problem, the thing I most need advice on. Literally every DAY that passes by that I'm not in a relationship gets more and more scary and empty feeling. I have every dating app that exists for free, make efforts with them, message first when I have matches, but I'm either ignored or the conversations just fizzle out no matter how hard I try to keep them going. I've gone to multiple singles nights in my area, got matched once, then was told by the dude that he wasn't looking for a relationship and was just going to support his friend.

And that's the big thing. I am trying WAY too hard. I know I'm trying too hard. I'm almost frantic to find a relationship, so unbelievably desperate that I feel it radiating off me. I feel as if I somehow find my ultimate soul mate I can justify all these years being so abnormal and not dating and having sex and whatever. And I feel like at this point, my standards and like.... red flags are so low it's dangerous? Literally dangerous. I feel like I would let myself fall into a relationship with somebody really abusive and scary and feel like it's worth it just because it's a relationship. That sounds extreme but it's something I'm really and truly scared of. 

So I need to know. What do I do? How do I become someone datable? Where do I go to find someone? What about myself can I change to open myself up to this? Because I'll change literally anything. I'd consider plastic surgery if it meant I would look more ideal. That is my level of desperation. Which is a problem I don't know what to do with.",05Jan2019,1

He's always been very involved in activities I've done, but it always feels like he's trying to live through me instead of letting me be myself. Plus, he's pretty much always disliked and made fun of me when I sang, only recently has he stopped that because I think he took the hint that it really made feel bad and pissed me off. 

I have a hard time being direct with him. To explain, when i was in high school, he was one time making fun of my brother for his weight, and when my bro got sad and went away, I asked my dad why he was so mean to my brother. My dad aggressively said, ""If I ever talked like you just did to my dad, I'd already be halfway down the stairs."" Essentially telling me he was gonna kick my ass if I didn't drop it.

He provided for me growing up, but Jesus that guy makes me feel like shit about myself within minutes of conversation. Just being around him is something I strongly avoid.

How can I let him know I don't want him to come? Should I just lie and say I cancelled it, then go anyway? I hate lying, but he doesn't take that kind of thing well... probably why my brother learned to lie so much. Should I tell him a bullshit reason like I want to feel more independent? I'd love if my mom came, but I just don't want him there.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend(24) and I(28) have been together for 3 years. 

In the last few months her family had decided to move out west and my girlfriend who has her own place decided to stay behind and work on her profession and remain with me. Over the holidays I could tell the separation from her family was begging to take its toll on her, she became distant and stressed. She also became defensive. For example, she would be upset with how many hours she was working and when i got upset and vented about her employers she would suddenly start defending them. 

Moving along, She had plans to visit her family over the Christmas break ever since they made the move. She did so, and when she got back i could tell something was off, even more so than the last month or so. So i asked her about it and she told me that it was too much on her to be so far away from family and that she was going to be moving back out west to be with them. Not necessarily right away but eventually none the less. 

At first, I wasn't open to the idea of moving, so it was met with resistance from myself. Long story short, we came to the conclusion that neither of us felt right about being so far away from family, and as terrible as it may be, we might have to go our separate ways. 

She left and we weren't sure that we were going to work out, The only problem is that i really feel for this person, and the more i thought about it the more i became open to the idea of moving and the new opportunities it would bring.

So i reached out to her, about a day after we decided it probably wasn't going to work to let her know that I've thought about it and that i am open to the idea and that we should discuss it. the only problem was that i was met with hesitation, she said that it isn't really where i want to be since i was so resistant to the idea at first. She feared that i would resent her for being the one to be further away from family. I assured her that this would be my decision to make and that there is a much better chance that i am going to end up resenting myself for letting her go over a 4 hour flight to visit family.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she is telling me that she needs time to think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are, What do you think she is taking time to think about if i have already decided to entertain the idea of making the move?

Do you think she still fears resentment, or could it be something else?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Its been a day since our last contact where she said she needed time to think.

 I respect her decision and want to give her the time she needs, but how long should i wait before reaching out?

 I'm sort of stuck in a relationship limbo where i don't know if i should be closing the book on this and begin the process of moving on or to start planning for one of the biggest moves of my life.

109,"So I made a post a month ago about a current situation with a friend I was in and I was given advice to let go of her. Well I made up with her but tonight she made me pretty damn mad. I was talking to her through text because she was dropping her boyfriend (who she asked me if they should break up a few weeks before) off at the airport because he was based in California (he's a Marine). She was upset that she had to say goodbye to him and I was telling her goodbyes always suck but then she says ""He's like my only friend and when he is gone I get lonely."" That pissed me off,I didn't let her know though. The reason it pissed me off was that I had been her friend for weeks and she had friends that stretched back to way before this motherfucker ever knew her. It hurt to read that and I felt awful for her other friends. She has so many friends and any of then would love to hangout with her if she would ask (which I told her) and she's only lonely if she makes herself lonely (especially if she's surrounded by friends). I guess I'm asking should I even try anymore? She obviously only sees her boyfriend as her only friend (even though she told me he constantly blamed her for everything). She said we never hang out but she's never asked but once and I had other plans that day so I couldn't. I know I asked this before and I'm sorry for not listening but we made up so I thought it was okay.",05Jan2019,1

113,"Sorry if this gets really confusing. I was just wanting a different opinion on my situation.

About a year ago I joined a new group of friends. There was about 6-8 of us and I fit just in. I've always been the type of person to just say something, rather than keep it to myself to be nice (probably not the best thing).

Basically my problem is that 2 of my friends are trying to kick me out (not inviting me to events or talking shit). There are 2 reasons why I think they're trying to kick me out. The first was probably my fault. The 2 friends have some issues and our group helps them with them. The problem I have with this is that one of their problems are that they're sad the world isn't perfect for them. I know that it sounds harsh and insensitive, but that it was is Happening. I told them this and they immediately got offended. They created another group chat without me (we were all talking on one group chat) after that. I didn't really feel remorse for it as they were being self deprecating.

The second reason why they have been excluding me is that we have been hanging out with a group of about 3-4 girls and they (the 2 excluding me) are jealous with my relationship with them. I live in a house with a lot of women so from a very early age I've been comfortable with girls. One of the guys whos trying to kick me out is dating one of the girls. I have known this girl for 8ish years, so you can assume we're pretty close. He knows this and get very jealous. If the whole group is hanging out and I'm there, he won't come. It really annoys me how passive aggressive about it. He has told her basically that he doesn't her hanging out with me. She told him that's not happening. The other boy really likes this one girl I'm also very close with. We've all only known the girl for about 6ish months. For some reason he acts like they are in a relationship (him and the girl he likes) so he gets mad when she doesn't love him automatically. She has made it clear to him that she doesn't like him. Me and this girl also have a bit of a thing going. We have talked about it and said nothing can really Happen because it would cuase e to much drama. We both want something to Happen tho. None of out friends know about this. The boy that really like the girl thinks that she likes me (the girl I have a thing with that no one knows about) and gets very mad about it. I have just kind of started to ignore him.



I know the simple Reddit answer would be to ""get new friends"" but I don't really want to. I'm very close with these guys and don't want to go through the whole ordeal of getting new friends. They have been doing this for some time and I have confronted them about it. I thought they would stop, but apparently not. I'm conflicted as to what I should do from here. Any advice would be helpful.

117,"Okay, so I'm a sophomore and have been struggling with a certain art class that I was forced into. It's this sculpture class (building 3D things). I have never been good with this type of shit but I know that's just gonna sound like an excuse so I won't bother. . I was kinda confused on some projects but I didn't know how bad it would get. During that first quarter we were assigned this one project that I just... didn't know what to do.

I really wanted to ask for help but you can probably tell that I'm the type of person who is really, really hard at asking. I just... didn't do anything. At all. And I continued this till' today. I regret not asking but I really didn't know what to say honestly. My teacher really didn't make me feel comfortable about talking to him when he blatantly says that I'm not doing anything once in a blue moon to everyone around me. No, I don't know anyone in that class. All juniors and seniors. I hated every time he would embarrass me, but I 'suppose' it was justified or something. I don't know.

My counselor (probably new) never told me I was going to be in it at all when we selected our classes the last year. I assume she put it in since I needed an art credit, which is fair... but I really didn't want to be in this class. She kept enforcing that I HAD to take THIS SPECIFIC class. I should have pressed her or something as to why I couldn't just take something else, but she was really just unhelpful to me and I had to oblige since the counselor knows all apparently. I emailed her (was way too afraid to ask in person) after but she only got to me 3 weeks later and of course told me it was too late to change.

Anyway, I saw that my mom got an email from the teacher like 2 days ago pretty much saying that I did nothing and wanted to discuss things I could do to get the credit. She hasn't seen it yet (she's old lol) and I'm afraid to show it to her.

I don't want to be seen as this lazy slob, I'm a B (sometimes A idk lol) student and always do my work. Whenever I go in this class and see that teacher I just get this god awful feeling and I'm sick of it. Been constantly crying alone because of it. I don't think I'm really that strong mentally, but I pretend to be. And it works. Life is really depressing right now, especially with all this talk about my future and shit. Pretty much certain at this point I'm depressed as shit. Please, help me. Should I open up about all of this or something like that?

119,"[THROWAWAY ACCOUNT] My girlfriend up with me on New year's Eve and it was a pretty shitty way to end the year ngl. We'd been together for 4 months and it was both of our very first relationships (we're both 14). We had a lot of small and weird traditions and shit like that together and thinking back to them is really depressing. She was the first girl I've held hands with and it felt so amazing but now to not have that along with the talks we used to have and the dates and all that is really hard to get over. We're both really shy too so it took us like 3 or 4 dates to actually hold hands and sit closer and have the physical contact and neither of us had gotten a first kiss yet so we were literally planning to do that on our next date and we knew it'd actually happen cuz on our last one I brought up the topic and we both hadn't a clue what to do and she was really late to be home so we said we'd get it next time and we'd make it really nice too but that's gone out the window too obvs.

And yeh ik first relationships never really work out and I'm young so it doesn't matter but I'd still appreciate any advice anyone could give me as it's really keeping me down lately and I smell like shit cuz of the stress (I'm fairly well maintained as it is but the stress stinks) and I have a terrible sleep pattern at the moment too because it takes me forever to sleep as I'm constantly thinking about her and have already had a good few dreams including her too.

120,"I recently met my partner 7 weeks ago, he is 23 years my senior, I prefer older men (no judgment please).

He is currently married with 6 children ranging from 25 to 6 years old, he has been extremely honest with me during this all about still being married - I dislike the thought of being the other woman but realise and take owness for my doing in this relationship.

I was extremely hesitant to enter into this relationship knowing he most likely isn’t ready for another relationship although he says he’s been emotionally checked out of his marriage for 12 years however stayed for the kids. They have been living interstate for the past 16 months.

His ex has recently found out about us and while she initially said she was happy is now starting emotional blackmail my partner with his youngest saying he can only speak to her once a week, that he must choose between myself and his children.

We recently returned from a holiday trying to enjoy every moment but knowing we had a lot of reality to come back to - after some phone calls from his ex, he told me he needs time and space, I was absolutely flabbergasted as the things we’ve spoke to each other and all his actions to date have said otherwise - I feel like I have been played.

I have given him time and space, allowing him to only contact me. He is in a dark place at current with everything from his self worth, to his family falling apart to feeling like he has no drive/passion to financial stress to pressures from his days in the Defence Force to childhood issues. He says he needed to fix all this on his own and didn’t want us to spiral down hence he asked for the space.

I have a connection to this man I’ve never felt before and he says same, this is someone I feel quite deeply about for only dating the short period we have been. 

He is looking to see a psychologist for some help on how to reconnect with the children over this issue, he is torn at them saying pick one or the other and I said to him he has already picked the children and I understand that, they will always be his babies.

I’ve told him I’ll give him a month to reassess where we’re at although I know which he is going to pick. 

I am absolutely in love with this man but fear even if we got back together this is a long process of issues he has to work through  and might not be emotionally ready.  As well would the contact from the ex ever stop allowing us to get on with our life.

125,"As a lifelong lover of all things reading and writing related, I know I'd enjoy majoring in English, Comparative Literature, Creative Writing, International Relations, Political Science, Journalism and maybe Communications. 

However, I'm aware that these aren't the most practical undergrad degree choices, so I'm hoping for advice on which might be the best path for me. 

Ideally, I'd love to be a writer. While I've always believed in the ""chase your dream"" lifestyle, I still want to consider more practical options, and how my passion can be fuelled into something else. I think, for instance, that I might enjoy speechwriting, public relations, maybe advertising. I'm not sure. 

With respect to financial prospects, I'm not materialistic. I just want to earn enough to live an independent life and be relatively comfortable, while still having a job that I enjoy. 

Of course, I've heard people claim that your major might not matter too much in the workplace, and jobs will be available regardless. But I don't like the idea of spending a lot of money, only for my degree to be irrelevant in my actual day-to-day job. 

Also, I'm fluent in 3 languages, so hopefully that can be an asset. Truthdully, I'd prefer not to major in Foreign Languages, but I do enjoy them, and would be open to the idea of furthering my studies in them.

Anyway, my rent rolls around and I left my job as server after reporting the kitchen manager for harassing me and he got fired. The staff treated me like shit after that so I quit. I got a new job that treats me better but pays like shit. 

So in my state of mania, I signed up for a sugar baby website while drunk with my roommate. A man offered me $400 just for dinner. I was skipping meals this week just to save money. I met with him, and he said that the $400 is if we made an arrangement (prostituting myself to him) and I declined and left the restaurant feeling like a complete piece of shit all the way home. I could’ve been raped, harassed or actually followed through with something  I didn’t want to do. The account was deleted as soon as I got home and couldn’t have been up more then 12 hours. 

I feel like the worst person in the world for doing this to my boyfriend. I wasn’t thinking at all, I was just thinking about money and surviving and he treats me like an angel. I’ve gotten sick a couple of times and I just tell him I’ve got a cold.

But then I basically had this thought where I want to live forever with my parents, and just thinking what would happen if I were to lose them. I had this thought for 2 days and I decided I break it to my parents. Having to stand for 10 hours+ everyday to serve food to the public in a Food Centre (In Singapore here we call it ""Hawker Centres"") I can feel the stress my parents have to go through. I've heard their stories before, my mother was an indonesian, and my father Singaporean.

&amp;#x200B;

But sometimes I feel really bad for them, while I'm at home chilling out, my parents are standing all day to give support to their family. And during their birthday's, all they get is nothing, just heavy load of work. We'd only say ""Happy Birthday"" on their birthday and nothing else. Unlike me, I get things for my birthday, a cake, something that I want too. I just feel like I want to give back something.

&amp;#x200B;

Also for all of the years they've supported me for 13 years, cared for me. And gave me what I wanted, made me cry and needed talk with my friends. Now I really wished I could fulfill my biggest dream, is to live forever with my parents. But  unfortunately, every good things must end. The good things I've ever had was my parents, giving me the love that a child ever needed. I wanted to spend time with them, but with the heavy load of work 6 times a week, it's nearly impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

I then told this thought I was having to my parents, and the talk they gave me was really touching. I've never heard such words before. What made me really happy, was when they we're the happiest people on earth, because of their children. I cried so badly that I kept on repeating, ""I want to live forever with y'all"" I'm really happy that I was born with 2 humans that really cared alot for their children.

131,"I started a new job in June 2018. When I was hired, my boss stated that 1. We should always be upfront if there were any issues and 2. If she asked for anything but I was working on other things let her know as we would adjust as needed. 

It is just her and I, so the workload is very intense. I asked for backup probably my 2nd week there as it is impossible to do everything with just me. There was a lot of resistance from the division head, so that got nowhere. Then the head hired someone and they became my backup. We became friends (previously did not talk to anyone, all day except boss sometimes) and would chat for a little bit everyday. 

My boss is not at work very often and probably saw us talk about 1-3 times total. The Friday before we closed for the holiday season, myself and my backup got there early. It was about 8:05am and my boss walked in, pushed my colleague away and listed something she wanted. I told her that I had a separate priority task (literally the #1 task that keeps her business running) to do and I would try but no guarantee. She left early that day and I confirmed with her before she left early a timeline and she said after the holidays would be fine. I also proposed we had a weekly meeting to go over events and tasks she needed completed to help me prioritize to do tasks. 

We returned from the holidays and my colleague told me my boss had gone to the division head and said we talk to much, referring to that specific Friday. We had only talked for 5mins. My colleague found out via her manager who has no affiliation with me. I then found out my boss further went to several different colleagues in the division (that are not affiliated with us) to complain in addition to the division head and told everyone I “refused to do the task she gave me” and all we do is talk and joke. She has said absolutely nothing to me or the colleague involved. My work, if anything has become more efficient as I now have mental and emotional support and we are clear in our boundaries and get work done first. This makes me question what else has been said about me, if she’s had issues and is not front up and I am really struggling with how to approach this.

I know it was dumb but I don’t need a lecture. I pulled out but unbeknownst to me I didn’t know she could get pregnant off of precum. She took a Plan B pill just to be sure.

137,"Picture this, I’m a 16 year old junior (female) in high-school. Before now I considered my self not to have many friends (and by friends I mean people to hang out with outside of school..). I go to a magnet school where lunch is around an hour long because everyone in the school eats at the same time and up until now I sat with a group of people who I considered my friends (as in acquaintances, friends that is). It’s a pretty large group of people and they call themselves the lunch bunch (in a nerdy sort of way and are by far what someone would consider themselves to be the ‘popular group’.

They have a group chat where they usually talk everyday and I was apart of for a couple of months but awhile ago i removed myself out of it because it started to get annoying and people usually ignored what I had to say. 

Here’s my dilemma: they are the type of people to have house parties. I only been invited to one (Halloween party) and I think the reasoning behind that was because I was in the group chat and they would probably find it rude to un-invite me. Since then they’ve got together three times (that I know of) and no one has even tried to invite me anywhere. This includes two and a half birthday parties and one New Years Eve party. 

Just looking on Instagram, i notice that they had another birthday party where I wasn’t invited even though I heard them talking at lunch, asking if someone was “able to come tonight”.

Honestly I’m so fed up with trying to have friends in high school and I’m considering just removing myself from those people as much as possible. Also I plan to remove all those people from my Instagram so I won’t have to see them hanging out without me.

Question: Is this a good a good idea or should I at least ask anyone what’s going on and why they are leaving me out??

P.S I don’t think this has much to do with this but I’m the only African American that hangs out with them and the rest are white with one person who is Korean.

139,"Sorry, if it seems like I’m rambling, I’ve got a lot to get out. Here goes...

I’m a 27y/o male. No debt, living with someone for $400/mo, and 3.5K saved. I’ll most likely end up trading in my car if I do lose my job.

Went to college for a year because I felt it was the right thing to do after HS. I’m not going to lie and say I took it very serious. I worked while is high school and college and decided I wasn’t going to waste any more money on classes I’m not fully committed to. So i decided to start working full time. I worked retail. I worked my way  to a store manager position. I felt like it wasn’t a “career” so I decided to get a job where my brother and uncle worked. Also, my grandfather retired from this company. I don’t really want to say the name of the company. Anyway, they had nice cars, dressed well, and had nice houses. I wanted that job. I obviously went there for the money. I got a job there, worked there about 4 years until I was doing the same job they were. Better pay, 40-80K based on how long you have been there. This past year I made just over 40k. The thing is I absolutely hate the job. Stressful, management is shady, long hours (10+), mentally and physically demanding. Like, 20K steps a day. Non stop. No time to eat. Go, go, go.  I lost 40 pounds the first few months. I come home everyday BEAT. I’m negative all the time. I feel like I’ve lost touch with myself. I’ve been consumed by the job.

So yesterday I may have lost my job. I won’t know until Monday, but I’m pretty sure I did. They made me take a drug screen that I know I’ll fail. I smoke Marijuana. (Haven’t smoked since, and think it’s time to put pot behind me too) Although I didn’t tell them that I did. Honestly, I know it’s going to suck trying to find a new job but I really don’t want the job back. I’ll accept it if offered but only to not have a lapse in my employment history and eventually leave on my own terms. I feel like the weight of that place has been taken off of me. 

But, I have no clue where to start, what to do, where to look. I’ve given so much of my time and energy to the job. I feel like I’ve lost passion for everything I used to love. Now that I don’t have the job I hated, I’m lost. 

Where do I go from here?",05Jan2019,1

i have been feeling really discouraged lately. i know theres a lot of people in the same program as me who are also going to be applying to the business school. i can still join a few clubs this upcoming semester, but the transfer application is due in February so i dont have much time. i think i have a chance, but its a long shot. i have to write two essays as well. i know that two months is plenty of time to write them (i have one in progress already), but i just feel so unmotivated.

143,"Hello! I’m 15F and a sophomore in high school.  Tonight my boyfriend and I tried having sex for the first time. The problem? His penis literally would not go in my vagina.  We used plenty of lube, so things were definitely slick enough; that wasn’t the issue.  The sensation was similar to just pressing your finger against your wrist or something - like it just wouldn’t go any further.  It also hurt quite a bit!  Sort of stingy but overall a very unpleasant, painful feeling.  He was able to get the head in I think, but it hurt and that’s as far as it went.  He also was able to get 3/4 of his pointer finger in, but that didn’t feel too good either - it hurt less than the penis but it still stung. I don’t know that I also was necessarily turned on before he stuck it in, like yeah, I was having fun but didn’t really have a warm fuzzy feeling down there, like I do when I masturbate. I’ve orgasmed before through clitoral stimulation with a vibrator, and this didn’t feel anywhere close to that. This was my first time, and I was definitely very anxious. I’ve never had a tampon or finger or anything up my vagina before today, so I figured my hymen would still be intact. But then how come it hurt but there wasn’t any blood? I don’t know, but I’m freaking out. I tend to have bad luck and I’m TERRIFIED that he’ll never get it in and it’ll always be as painful and I’ll never have a good sex life. Call me a hypochondriac but it sounds like vaginismus to me - another thing I’m terrified of.  All the girls I’ve talked to before said losing their virginity didn’t hurt them, but of course it just HAS to be painful for me!  Advice???",05Jan2019,1

147,"So I was writing an exam (I already differed it due to sickness) that was hard af and changed so much from the people that wrote the first exam( it was nothing like the exam review the prof gave unlike the “real” exam which majorly Was  from the exam review) , (I know from the 6 people writing it 3 are going to the dean to complain how the exam was unfairly difficult). I know that’s no excuse to cheat but I did anyway.

I went to the bathroom with my phone and was trying to look up solutions. The TA asked me before I went into the bathroom if I had my phone on me and I said no.

 Apparently the TA saw me through the cracks of the stall using my phone and (according to my friend that was writing the exam) he quickly ran back into the exam room and called the head TA. As I was exiting the washroom I see 2 TA’s escorting me back which was weird but I didn’t think much of it. 
As I was about to enter the exam room they said “we asked you if you had your phone in your pocket, and you said no” , what’s that in your pocket? 

I initially replied with I had my phone on me because I don’t trust anyone with it, however I was not using it. Then they said they both witnessed me using it( privacy violation much? Idk).  

They said you can continue writing the exam but we’re going to have to write you up. I said okay.

I’m second year engineering student and this would be my second academic dishonesty( first year I just got a 0 on one of my chemistry labs because it was identical to one done last year). 

According to my university website policy this will be a hearing with the dean, and may result in a 0 on the exam, failing the course, suspension for 3 years or expulsion, or just a warning.

What are my options here? 

I’m thinking of saying that I was really stressed and as a habit on my phone but I wasn’t looking up answers. Is that a valid argument? I’m afraid what if they might go to IT for internet history logs, will they do that,

My other option is saying I was reading a prayer on my phone? 

I don’t think there’s anyway of saying I was not on my phone in the washroom to the dean. If it was only one witness then I could have the hr said she said argument but 2 witnesses?? Last option would be I’m a good person and this doesn’t reflect who i and then sob story? I don’t know I’m lost.

one of my flaws though is that words can't always sink in easily, and simply being told things dont often do much, so being told that its just a game, while very true, won't help me in the slightest. i've told myself that when catching salt but i feel no difference at all and its just.. frustrating on its own. i *know* perfectly well that it's a game but that doesn't change a thing

151,"So, there's this very niche gonewild-like subreddit that I've been visiting for many years. It's gotten a bit bigger nowadays, but in the past it was a small enough community that you could name all of the most of the frequent posters from the tip of your tongue. One of these posters in particular, who I recognize from said older days, posts some really top notch content, so I decided I got myself wondering if they had more of it in other websites (like tumblr or someting, idk). With that in mind I then googled their username just in case and froze when read one of the first results. 

It was a archived page of a 4chan doxxing thread with A LOT of info from random people online, some phone numbers adresses, facebook pages... gave me chills.  For this particular person they had posted three of their personal emails, both their reddit accounts, and their facebook page.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is: all of this was dated from 2015. The person has been posting for like five-six years and hasn't ever stopped, so probably nobody saw the info or tried to blackmail them or anything. In the thread people also didn't seem to pay attention to their info, since nobody replied to that post-- which, at one hand not surprising since there were like 200 in the doxx list, but also little bit surprising because of the niche of their content, considering 4chan like bullying people.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I PM them? I don't want to freak them out, but man, that's some scary fucking shit. If I posted porn of myself I wouldn't want anyone to know my facebook.

152," Context : out at the bar with my roommate on her birthday , old feelings start coming back . So I start telling my new friend(whose my other roommates friend) about how I was having trouble suppressing feelings for my roommate.

An hour later were home and my roommate pulls me aside to say they just made out , instantly mad and upset I end up going to bed and sending him a text essentially calling him out and calling him a dick .

The next day he denies it and says that she kissed him and was drunk and he had zero interest , which I wanted to believe he seemed like a good guy. Normally I'd cut someone like this out of my life and be done and move on but since he is my roommates friend i have to continue to see him.

A few days go by and I honestly couldnt take him just being over all the time and stuff so I decided to confront my roommate that he kissed when she was sober to see if things had changed , I fully explained the situation to her including my feelings so she understood where I was coming from , at which point she ,fully sober, said that what he did was in fact fucked up confirming that he did make out with her .

At this point it has become a he said she said situation , with both people having completely opposite stories , again this is normally where Id just cut everyone out of my life but for the first time im basically in a position where I cant . So I just move my computer in my room to avoid everyone .

156,"I'm sorry if this is too long. 

I (30f) met my boyfriend (29m) about ten years ago and we've been together, as a couple, for four.  I really, really love him and i truly believe that he's my soulmate. However, we never really have sex. Not even when we first started dating. Whenever I tried to initiate something (i was always the one to start things) he would pull away, seem distant and tell me that he's not in the mood, so i would leave it alone and we would not talk about the encounter. We had our ""first time"" about a year ago. It was...bad. It took him forever and i *know* that he did not enjoy it at all, even though he kept telling me that he did and that it was wonderful. 

I am someone who has a pretty high sex drive, so i thought that him not wanting to have sex with me meant that there was something wrong with me--that maybe i was too pushy or that i wanted too much. I will be lying if i say that it didn't hurt my self-esteem. I confided in my two best friends about my situation and their ""best"" solution was for me to break up with him because it was likely that he was not interested in me that way and probably was seeing someone else. I thought and still think that this is bollocks. I do not want to break up with him because there's more to our relationship than sex, but i was still deeply hurt and confused. We had sex three more times after the first and it all went downhill from there. We started fighting a lot, he would go days not talking to me or wanting to be around me. After two months of this, we had a talk and he revealed that he was sexually abused through out his childhood by a male family friend and that it only stopped when he turned 16. He also told me that while in uni, he was raped by a stranger at a bar (this was around the time i met him) .  This has greatly impaired his ability to enjoy sex (not even masturbation) or to even have it. He says that he hates it and only had it  with me so i wouldn't leave him. 

I feel extremely guilty and ashamed at myself. I pushed him too much and essentially forced him to have sex by constantly talking about it and whining about our lack of intimacy.  I feel horrible, especially since i know he self-harms and though he's never told me, i suspect he has done it more and more after we started having sex. I don't know what to do because i wish to have children in the future and sex is something i enjoy. I desire my boyfriend but not like this, i love him too much to make him have it when he doesn't want to. I feel like he will never want to and while i honour his decision and respect him, there's still a part of me deep inside that questions if our relationship is going to work.

So, there's this very niche ""self porn"" subreddit that I've been visiting for many years. It's gotten a bit bigger nowadays, but in the past it was a small enough community that you could name all of the most frequent posters from the tip of your tongue. One of these posters in particular, who I recognize from said older days, has some really top notch content, so I got myself wondering if they had more of it in other websites, like tumblr or someting. With that in mind I then googled their username just in case... 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the results were scary.

One of the first links was an archived page of a 4chan doxxing thread with a lot, A LOT of info from random people online: phone numbers, emails, facebook profiles, fucking home adresses, all kinds of shit you don't want online, specially if you post yourself naked. Gave me fucking chills man. For this particular person we're talking about, the doxxer had posted three of their personal emails, both their reddit accounts, their tumblr and **their facebook profile**.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is: all of this was dated from 4-5 years ago. The person has been posting for like five-six years and hasn't ever stopped, so probably nobody saw the info or tried to blackmail them or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I PM them? I don't want to freak them out, but man, that's some scary fucking shit. If I posted porn of myself I wouldn't want anyone to know my facebook. But on the other hand it's 2015 stuff and nothing seemed to happen. Besides, it is indeed a very small subreddit with a little less than 1k members, it's not like anyone is going to stumble on their stuff from /r/all. Also, in case I do tell them, should I do it from my actual reddit account? Sounds like it'd be less freaky/creepy idk.

I don't know what it is, she loves me alot and it's totally different from my past relationships. The sex is great and we're always so in sync. But recently I've been having a itch so during one of those boring work days, I downloaded tinder and fired up my old account thinking I'll just fool around digitally and chat with a few girls

After a few days of swiping and being afraid my girlfriend would find out, I matched with this 35 years old divorcée. Upon matching, she went straight to the point and asked if I had been with/slept with a older woman before. I told her no and she askes me if I'm willing to explore it.. now I've never actually had a kink for older woman but I'm my mind I told myself to just YOLO and go for it. So after a few days of chatting and sexting, we agreed to meet for a couple of drinks at a nearby bar. One thing led to another and we ended up at a transit hotel fucking each others brains out for the next two hours.

Afterwards she asked if I wanna be her fuck buddy and I said yes despite knowing that it'll be a big fuck up.. now every time I look at my girlfriend I can't control my thoughts and I'll think of the time where I cheated on her with a milf and I don't know.. what should I do now..",05Jan2019,1

179,"I was recently thinking a bit about being single and decided to start pursuing a relationship. Then i started to feel really sad because i realized that i don’t even have any platonic friends that are girls so maybe I should focus  on that. It made me sad because I know a lot of really cool girls just as I know a lot of cool guys but I have never hung out or talked to them like I do with my best friends who are all guys. We’re not on the same terms as any of my guy friends. 


I think I know why I have trouble making platonic girl friends and I need advice to help me fix it. I am pretty socially anxious around new people. Honestly even around my good friends. When talking to guys I feel like I’m burdening them, but I’m getting much better at ignoring those thoughts. When talking to girls, not often, I feel like they think I’m interested in them romantically no matter what. When girls talk to me, some part of me assumes they’re into me romantically (kind of like thinking: “why else would they talk to me?”). 

Is there any way I can consciously practice this and make it go away so I can stop missing out on real friendships?

180,"For the sake of being as concise as possible I’ll try and run through the past 2 decades very briefly and will follow up based on questions in the comments! 

Here goes...

In 2nd grade my father left our family over the holidays to go on vacation with a girlfriend - he’s married to my mom. 

In 4th grade I saw his match.com account - I went to sleep crying nearly all of 4th and 5th grade because his account said “divorced” he wasn’t home by the time I was in bed many nights, obviously, and I wanted to ask my mom if everything was ok between them. Thank god I didn’t. 

*my mom did know, they attempted counseling but it made my childhood a bit ugly
If you can imagine* 

Through high school it continued, it affected my grades and my performance.

In college, I was away from home and tried not to think about it... Though it continued...

On my 21st birthday, my father was traveling for work - but a week later.. we were on a family trip and he offered to go to the bar with me for drinks. I was beyond excited. I went to charge my phone for a bit before hand and accidentally, he texted me nudes of a girl. We never got drinks that night. I deleted the message, pretended to be distracted with other family members and just ignored that he had ever invited me. He pretty much did the same. It really hurt me. 

He had a condo he rented through most of my childhood, basically for sex. 

He’s paid for vacations, trips, entertainment, cars, meals, educations, and so on for these random girls. All while I feel he struggled to provide some basic stuff for me. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a doctor - he can afford it. 

My tuition was always late, I never even got a graduation gift from my parents, through high school I slept in the living room on the family sofa. We lived in a tiny house prior to moving once I was out of the house. 

There’s so much more to it, but it’s hurt me. When my family gets mad at me I just think about seeing tickets to the baseball game in his wallet, hoping he’d take me only to find out he took some girl. I never even had a bedroom growing up.. 

Don’t get me wrong I am not trying to be ungrateful. I just feel so upset I was never put first. 

At this point it’s really getting to me. I’m 23yo. I moved home after college and while I work full time, I’m still around for interaction.  There’s lost of arguing and I have this deep anger over this stuff that surfaces everytime there is even a minor family disagreement or something g of that sort. Nothing serious I assure you. 

I feel horrible inside because I take it out on my entire family. I don’t want to be a bad person, but I feel like they are really growing to dislike me beyond repair. I feel silenced inside because I have never said what’s truly bothering me. 

Maybe this is all so stupid, I don’t know ... :( ",05Jan2019,1

182,"TL;DR: my boyfriend found out he has genital warts in high school, but it’s been five years and nothing has showed up since, until now. My doctor and the internet has told me that if you don’t get anything after about 2-3 years, you probably don’t carry the virus anymore. So that’s what I’ve assumed, until now. 

Not sure if anyone can really give me an answer but I definitely can’t talk to my friends about this. So as you read in the TL;DR, my boyfriend found out he had genital warts in high school, but since then (4 years ago) he hasn’t had a outbreak since. My gynaecologist told me that there is a good chance the virus has left him. So I went with that information. However, before we started to see each other, I unfortunately caught the genital herpes virus.. definitely super unfortunate as I only slept with one person between him and my ex, and used protection. 

Anyways, him and I went into this relationship fully aware of our virus’s that we carried, however we ignorantly assumed his was gone. But a few weeks ago, he had a wart come up. Now we haven’t slept together since, and he just got it removed, and it will be about 10-15 days before we can have sex again. 

But here’s the thing, unrelated to this issue, when the summer comes we are probably going our separate ways due to differences in what we want in our life. I will be moving to the other side of our very large country from him, and probably staying there. So we are going to be breaking up in the near future. Now after finding out he definitely still has genital warts, I’m at a complete loss if I should continue this relationship. I do NOT want to have both. Herpes is awful enough and I think having both would send me into a pretty bad depression. That being said, I love him so much and if I ended things early then we would both be completely heartbroken. If our lives aligned and I wasn’t leaving, I would 100% stay and continue what we’ve already been doing. 

I know we could just use condoms, but even when condoms are used properly they still break, and oral sex would be super boring. Even when they don’t break, they don’t protect you from herpes or warts 100%. And abstinence would just really fucking suck, considering we have sex like 3-4 times a week and it’s a huge part of our relationship.

So I don’t know what to do. End the relationship early? Just suck it up and use condoms, even though it’s still risky? 

Also to add, I definitely do not have genital warts. I am quite lucky that I have not caught him from him yet, and so far he has not gotten herpes from me. ",05Jan2019,1

184,"Throwaway to protect my identity and my boyfriend's identity.

This is sort of confusing so I will do my best to explain without giving away too much detail. My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year now. He does YouTube for a living.

His ex-girlfriend and him broke up because of me. Now he didn't cheat or anything like that. We were all friends, but eventually he developed feelings for me. He told me about this and I tried to give him space so maybe the feelings could go away. It didn't work, mostly because his girlfriend was really busy and they basically just decided it was best if they broke up. He made a video about the break up to explain to the people who watched him. He made sure that those people knew that the break-up was mutual.

Now here is the problem. He made the video 6 months after him and his girlfriend already broke up. He hid it from everyone, and him and I started dating before the video came out. Now he wants to make a video with me and tell everyone the truth but I don't want him to. I feel like people will hate me, and also I don't really want to be in the spotlight. How are we supposed to go about this? Do we make the video and tell everyone the entire truth, and how we started dating pretty quickly? Or should we just leave that out and say we barely started dating? Or maybe just keep it a secret forever?

If anyone is wondering, the ex-girlfriend is cool with everything, we all still hang out sometimes. There are no hard feelings. Anyways thank you anybody for your input, I appreciate it.",05Jan2019,1

186,"The title says it all but it’s only the start of the story. A year ago I made a bad decision after lifelong depression, a break up, job loss opportunity/ no job and lack of belonging with friends and family. These all may sound like excuses but I’m merely stating the facts as I own up that I failed horribly here and it’s my fault, I should’ve been better. Also I'm not looking for legal advice by the way, just advice I guess or maybe I just want my story out there, I don't know. I don't know anymore.

Throughout my life I’ve been shy, awkward, reserved and quiet to basically everyone except close friends. The runt, I would call myself as I was always the smallest, 5'2"", and most picked on in any social circle, directly or indirectly. I’m 26 now though I often get mistaken for someone who has just got out of high school. Not many will relate to this as a guy maybe, I’m not sure, but it hasn’t been a good feeling as I try and roll with the jokes and offhand comments about me. ""You'll love the way you look when you're older"", they say. I'm more concerned for the now though as I live there.

Don’t feel sorry for me though as throughout life I should’ve been more confident, more accepting of myself and my abilities. I isolated myself often as fitting in was just something I excelled at doing in reverse. Friends are just a commodity I wasn’t very good at attaining and every once in a while when I got some, I always felt out of place when being with them.

Fast forward to why I’m making this post and why I need help, advice, I don't really know. After reading this you may see me as a bad person, a monster, a victim, an idiot, or something in-between. I feel I’m a person who tries to do the right thing, to help people though I also feel I’m someone who views himself as not good enough because of my failures and thus deserves the worst.

A week or so after I got out of the hospital last last holiday season for trying to kill myself in the midst of changing medication and all I said before in the beginning, I met a girl online who said she was 18. She was a person who wanted to talk and was interested in my story and me as a person. I later found out she was not 18 but in fact 16. I should’ve stopped talking to her right then and there but I had already known too much about her family, her abuse, the cuts she inflected on herself, her seizures and the sexual trauma and rape she’s endured. I felt bad and I knew the pain of being deleted from someone’s life so I didn’t stop talking. 

She became sexual though, maybe because I cared about her troubles which is something she lacked, someone just plainly caring. Stupidly I was sexual back and went with her advances. Why did I do that? Why? Maybe I thought it was another way of helping, helping both of us through trauma. Whatever it was, it was a mistake. I ended up getting arrested and in trouble with the law, age of consent in the state is 16 though I learned it turned out she was actually 15, a month away from 16. We exchanged a few pictures and had sex, all a mistake. 

After the arrest, with my phone taken for evidence, I didn’t hear back from the situation for almost 6 months during which I had been going to therapy (now have two therapists), psychology testing from the suicide attempt and finally finding a bit of employment with being an on call IT guy, the field at which I went to college for. Also during this time I created a video game to help me deal with my emotions of my recent breakup, my suicide attempt and just everything that had happened to me throughout my life. The video game helped, helped a lot, and I started to finally get better with my mental health, my depression which plagued me my entire life. Then a letter came in the mail. 

The letter was from the state and said I was charged with the few pictures that were sent to me by the girl and talking to her when she was being sexual. I thought I was finally starting to pick up the pieces of my life and move on to healthy relationships, a healthy life. It just wasn’t really meant to be. I got an attorney, went through psychosexual testing, and a polygraph all to determine if I was a danger to society. All the testing came back positive for not being a threat which surprised no one. I knew I wasn’t going out in the world to create these situations and was not attracted to minors. I just want to help anyone who wants to be my friend, in a healthy manner of course and not what ended up happening with the girl. I’m drawn to those who have depression or other difficulties in life. I helped a friend create resumes to get a job, provided friendly consoling and just listened to the difficulties of any of my friends who needed an ear during this time. This makes me sound like a good person but I just see it as something good friends just do, something I’d want someone to do for me maybe. Speaking of which, If anyone is going through a tough time they can for sure talk to me as I'll listen.

Anyways the prosecutor looked at the testing and the evidence presented and decided to give me the offer of being a sex offender for 10 years with treatment for 3 years. This means no internet or computers. Before the offer was I would get a felony or two, probation, monitoring to check I was being good and I think a fine but that offer is gone now. The reason is because the prosecutor changed to a brand new prosecutor that hasn't dealt with these cases in the middle of my case.   

I don’t know if I can do this to be honest. I’m an introvert who has his entire friend circle online, my job is online, my hobbies, me. It sounds dumb but technology and computers and all that is who I am. It's like telling a person who loves and works on cars that they can never touch or drive a car again. 

The depression I beat back is overbearing now and I don’t think my mental health can take it any longer. My parents support me though I know how ashamed they are, ashamed by my existence. The friends I had created won’t be around anymore as I can’t contact them again, long distance friends/ the only ones who have endured with me. The job I have now is barely a job as the work has stopped and getting a new one in the field I went to college for isn’t viable anymore. I recently got a fantastic offer in my field, a job that will allow me to live on my own, a job to make everyone proud of me but now it will be all for nothing.

I don’t know what to do. I need help. I know the internet can be cruel and I know putting myself out here is probably going to paint a target on my back but I don’t know what else to do. There is very very very little sympathy for sex offenders but maybe there’s one person out there, just one, who can help somehow. 

I’ll link the game I made if anyone wants to play it and learn a bit more about me.

There are many things to click on so just hit enter everywhere and you'll probably find some dialog. If using the mouse, click near or on the object.

I know it's weird but hey this is my first ever attempt at a game I made in a few months.

In the inventory menu is a place to save or you can rely on the game to tell you to save at certain points. Alt F4 Exits the game or by smashing your device into the ground.

I’d love one day to create games with a good development kit like GameMaker Studio 2 or work for a game studio to create some interesting and compelling stories but I don’t think that’s going to happen now, ever.

They are not against me entirely moving out, but they wanted me to wait until fall, and also they are saying they don't like my friend who I am moving out with. I had already lived on my own when I went away to school, but I came back about a year and a half ago. Since then I have worked and I just applied to graduate schools. I just need my own space, being at home all the time is just making me depressed and this situation is making me just not give a fuck about anything.

Sometimes he claps right next to my ear, sometimes he twists bubble wrap right next to my ear, sometimes he uses a can of compressed air (used to clean keyboards) and sprays it on the back of my neck. He does it on purpose of course - he thinks it is funny I guess. It might be funny if he did it less often but it is so often that I am on edge all day at work.

195,I really want to transfer to a new high school. I am not happy at all at my current one and i dread going there every single day. I want to get out but I don’t know how to tell my parents. Please help.,05Jan2019,1
196,"*Sigh* where do I start?

I grew up in a tense and emotionally abusive household. But I love my siblings, especially my younger brother. I do love my mom, though she has anger issues, and my relationship with my dad has improved since I moved out two and half years ago. My younger brother still lives with my parents and has major issues with anxiety and depression.

Two and a half years ago I moved to the city to go to college. I’m 4 hours away from my parents’ house - freedom which I looked forward to my entire life. And I have a year and half till I graduate with a well paying degree. I have friends now (which I had almost none of when I was younger) and great paid internship opportunities. I’m almost always working, trying to pay for my own living expenses.

Sounds dandy, right? It’s not dandy. I hate my degree, and I hate almost every day of work in my field. It feels like I have to drag myself from day to day. None of my friends are close enough to fill this gap of loneliness in my heart and none of them are people that I could ever see myself getting close to anyways. An old shitty landlord is trying to sue me on top of this. And I hate the city - I miss the suburbs. 

Worst of all, I feel like I’ve abandoned my little brother, who now lives alone with my parents, who are still manipulative and stressful. After all my siblings moved out and he had to face high school by himself, he declined so fast. Started having panic attacks, dropped out of school, was even sent to a mental hospital for a week... not the person I know. He’s been recovering the past year and is doing better but still suffers from anxiety and depression. We were always best friends and when I go home he improves so much.

I want to be there for him, but I know I have to finish my degree. I’ve already changed my major once and changed colleges once (local community college to university) so I’m graduating two years late at this point. 

I don’t know what I’m expecting to get out of this post, but really feel that changing majors or colleges again is not an option, nor is moving back in with my parents. Little brother is 18 but I wouldn’t bring him to the city and he can’t support himself anyways. But if you have any advice to give, I’d be glad to hear it.

TL;DR: I’m away from home at college, hate my major, and miss my little brother. Little brother is stuck at home with emotionally abusive parents and doing poorly. And the whole situation just feels shit.

Thx guys.",05Jan2019,1
197,"So i'm a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic person, throughout the years i haven't always agreed with it and i'm not sure if i currently do.  I have a lot of far out conspiracy theories and thoughts about things that i will never be able to understand fully in this lifetime.  I'm at a pretty far out stage of my life and spend most of my time alone in my head.  I have a problem where I think everyone is reading my mind most of the time and I really don't like thinking negative thoughts about other people to the point where it can make me very anxious.  For example, I think racist words sometimes (i would never call someone a racist word btw, its like a subconscious voice in my head)  like i would see a black person and think the n word or see an asian person and think the c word and then I would feel extremely bad after to the point where i just think ""one"" over and over to not think of anything bad about that person.   It also happens subconsciously judging like i may think ""douche bag"" about a perfectly normal person or ""slut"" about someone who isn't that way at all.  I just want some advice on how to get these voices out of my head basically.  I'm on anti-psychotic meds but i think the answer lays in something more to do with how to control my consciousness.  All answers appreciated, my intention is to get help and not offend anyone",05Jan2019,1

199,"I need some serious advice, because I am just stuck. I am a 20 F, and am very close to my family. The man who I’ve always considered my biological father has not been in my life for about 11 years due to legal issues. It was something that made me feel very lonely and overwhelmed for a long time. Especially because the fact was Kept from me until I was about 16 years old when it was mistakenly told to me (my family lied and told me he moved to TX. I naively believed so). Anyhow, I chose to ignore it and did mentioned my frustrations to my mother but only slightly. Only because i prefer to avoid confrontation. 

Recently, however, a close uncle of mine (while intoxicated and seriously sad) revealed to me that my biological father may not be my father. In fact, he says that when I was born, the family was split and debated on who’s daughter they thought I was. See, the story is that my mother was involved with this man (her first serious boyfriend), and then with my “father” afterwards. But my uncle says that my mother was already pregnant when she began to date my biological father. And although my close family did ask my mother, they say she was very set and believed that I am my “fathers” daughter. I did figure out the guys name and found him on social media. After talking to a few aunts and uncles about 2/3 believe that I am this mans daughter. And the majority of my friends believe I looks so much more like this man than my actual biological father. This man has also reached out to my family members before and even recently, and some tell me he believes very much that he is my father. Apparently he even told my mother so when I was born. 

I do not know what to do with this. My mother is very prideful and I feel like she will not be honest with me. I look so much like this man, specifically during my toddler years. Should I reach out to him? Speak to my mom? Or should I do what I always do, avoid confrontation, and let it be. 

**TL;DR :** An uncle told me my ""father"" may not be my father after all. No one really knows who is, and my family is split on it. It has been a big family secret for years. My uncle gave me the name of the man who may be, and I am not sure how to proceed. Whether to confront my prideful mother and ask, or reach out to the man who I was told was always convinced that I am his daughter. ",05Jan2019,1

201,"Like any truly confused and lost person, I've come to the strangers of the internet for their insight. I'm basically asking, has anyone experienced this? Does it get better?

I've always been a driven and content person. I am relatively confident, healthy, successful and comfortable guy, have my own interests, passions and pursuits. I keep a fit and healthy life. Always maintained a handful of good friends. I've had a fairly good social life and have always had interest from women. Yet over the last few months I've found silence, hardships &amp; dismissal. I guess I just feel evicted from my own life.

I guess it started around my birthday a few months ago, a group of friends organised to do something for my birthday a week prior. They cancelled on the night. I wasn't given any real apology or explanation and haven't heard from them since. Not great friends, I get it, better off with out them.. But I've had what I thought to be good friends do this kind of thing repeatedly since then. There's nothing I did or changed in someway. I'm down to three friends, of which have all moved away due to work or other opportunities. I've found myself with absolutely no social outlets for months now. I feel like a loner, like no one wants anything to do with me. Isolated. The networks I had for support and blowing off steam, gone.

These feelings extend into recent experiences with women. I've always had a lot more interest spent on me than I've spent on others.. I've always had options with girls, they pursued me more than I them. If I wanted a date, I could find one. Now nothing. Even on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. I used to get more matches then I could manage, now relatively none. It feels like anyone I've known or don't know wants nothing to do with me and sees no value or interest in my company.

Lastly, in these months I've experienced problems with my own health. I've had major health scares of two people in my immediate family. My dog of 12 years passed, then my other dog has a terminal illness.

It wasn't an immediate thing, but these feelings of isolation, loneliness and being unwanted have slowly crept in. I sit in my home, thinking, what happened? Is it just bad luck that will pass? I'm trying to keep positive.

Tl;dr:

Relatively normal person has found their social circles change unexplainably, which has left them with no outlets. Had issues with their health and the health of those close to them. Which eventually made them question their own self worth. Looking for hope for change. I feel evicted from my own life.",05Jan2019,1

206,"This post may be long, so I’m sorry if it’s a mess to read. TLDR: brother tried to kill my mom and I, now she won’t discipline him bc she’s afraid of him but won’t admit it. 

My brother is literally a manipulative scumbag and idk what to do about it. Some background story: so me (I’m older by 2 yrs) and him have never been the closest, he always found ways to get me in trouble or fight at some point even if we were playing. He’d kick me and hit me and I’d push him away to make him stop and then he’d scream and cry, id be the one to get in trouble because “he’s just a baby”.  That schtick (sp?) went on until he was about 11... Another thing that usually happened; let’s say I didn’t do my homework or something trivial. Mom finds out. I’m grounded. Brother doesn’t do homework. Mom finds out. “Oh that’s ok sweetie just finish it up now” Just about everything he wanted absolutely HAD to go his way or he would pitch an absolute fit. Prime example: dad and step mom took us to Universal for a vacation (I was 15 at the time so he was 13) I wanted to eat at Harry Potter world, he didn’t. So he pitched a fit in the middle of the damn theme park and ran off by himself, promptly ruining the vacation for everyone. 

So, at home (we live with my mom, step dad, step brother) he has an Xbox or PlayStation or something idk what actual system it is but it doesn’t matter. Whenever he got it when he was 12 or so, every damn night he stays up super late, now that he’s probably... 17? He stays up until 4 or 5 am. Constantly screaming. I’m 20, and I live in the dorms on campus (on break now so I’m home) so it doesn’t bother me as much as it used to, but since I’m home I literally cannot sleep because of his screeching all night long. I’ve been asking my mom for YEARS to do something about this, and she just doesn’t do anything but go in and be like “ok sweetie, time to quiet down”. Yep. That helps. She won’t do ANYTHING ELSE about it because she’s afraid of him but won’t admit it. This is why: 

So one night, about 2 or 3 years ago I think, he’s screaming away on his xbox or whatever. It’s like 1 am. On a school night. I’m PISSED because I have not been able to have a good nights sleep in months/years bc of him. I get so fed up with it I wake up my mom and tell her to get him to be quiet. So she gets up (mind you, this is before she’s afraid of him) goes knocks on his door. And says “yo. It’s 1 am. Go to sleep” and he’s getting all snarky like “make me bitch” and all that shit. And my mom is like “dude get off now.” And they start yelling at each other. And my brother is trying to punch my mom in the face. I get up and I’m trying to push him off of her. Then he goes “I’m getting my knife” and gets this pocket knife my dad gave him and pulls it out on my mom, trying to stab her and push her down the stairs. I run into her room and dial 9-1-1 while trying to keep him from literally killing her. Then he goes to me and me and my mom had to lock ourselves in her room until the cops came. And when he realized I was on the phone he went in my room and broke a whole bunch of shit. Then went to his room and wrecked the entire thing. After that like 3 weeks later he shattered my moms windshield of her car with a bat, stole $300 from my room and “ran away” but actually went to the movie theater lmao. (He also went to a therapy place don’t worry about that..)

Ever since then, I haven’t spoken a word to him. And my mom has literally been walking on eggshells around this kid. He’s in cyber school (he’s like 17 I think) supposed to be academically a senior in high school, but he NEVER DOES HIS WORK because all he does is play that damn video game, so he’s academically a freshman in high school. Guess what my mom does about that? You guessed it! Nothing! 

As of right now it’s 1:30 AM and he’s screaming at the top of his lungs. Ever since I came home I’ve not had a good nights sleep except for the one beautiful night he slept at his friends house.  I literally am at a loss for what to do right now. I’ve been arguing with my mom for years because I can’t sleep where I frickin live. Every time she pulls the same sayings “I’M the mom not you!” “Because, that’s why!” Wow. Great arguments. I’ve tried confronting her about it, just straight up saying to her: you’re afraid of him aren’t you? And she just ignores me. The best thing I’ve got her to do (and this was just over this break so it’s taken her like 6 or 7 years to actually make an attempt to do something) is make the WiFi turn off. But guess what time it turns off? 2:30 AM. Great. 

I really don’t know what else to do at this point. I’m not financially stable enough to fully live on my own in my apartment or you bet your sweet ass I would be in a heartbeat. I just want to be able to sleep. And live happily in my own house without the fear that he’s going to snap again and actually kill us. ",05Jan2019,1
207," I’ve already taken two years of foreign language, which is how much our school recommends. During August, I decided to take a third year, and I’m now regretting it. While I got A’s my first and second years, I got a C+ this year. He teaches almost entirely in Spanish, and, like most Spanish speakers, talks very fast. I can understand him, but there are times it is too much for me to process. I’m struggling in his class, and even though I get help, it doesn’t do much for me. So here comes the question: should I switch out of this class for something else I want to take, or should I stay in for the rest of the year.

208,"Today at school, a guy that sits behind me in Calculus started whispering in my ear things that he had heard from fellow classmates from what happened at a party over the holiday break where I was sexually assaulted by two boys while I was black out drunk.

Things like:

“You wanted it slut”

“Care to add a third next time? 😉 “

“Lemme pound that puss, babe”

“Do you like them big? 😉 😉 “

These were all especially triggering for me because I didn’t consent to this sexual activity that took place. These two drunk guys basically r*ped me while I was black out drunk and someone opened the door and pulled them off me.

Then all this rumors started spreading the moment that we all got back from the break that I wanted it and that I requested it from them and that I’m a whore, a slurry, etc. I was never even given a chance to tell my wife of the story — which was that I went upstairs to play what I thought would be a couples’ game of King’s - a drinking game. And then they threw me on the bed and it all just happened like that so fast.

Anyways I have not reported it to the police since we were all underage drinking (obv) and I don’t wanna get in trouble; also they were stopped before orgasming and they also did wear condoms so I’m not worried about pregnancy or STDs.

So this fucking prick of a kid (actually he’s a pizza face loser) finally sets me over the edge whispering this BULSHITT in my ear, and I finally turned around, stood up out of my desk, and popped him, closed fist - straight in the nose.

Class had to be stopped and an ambulance was called because there was so much blood and his nose was def crooked after my hit.

I creeped his IG stories with one of my Finsta’s and he posted a photo of his crooked ass nose with a caption of “thots gonna get a lawsuit bitch”.

Was I in the wrong for doing this? I know violence is usually never the answer but I’m sorry I just had to show this mother fucker Thad sexual assault is not fucking cool or OK, ever.",05Jan2019,1

My girlfriend and I live in a private student housing complex near our college in separate 'apartments.' They each have 4 bedrooms with private bathrooms with a shared living space and kitchen. We have both had problems with our roommates. Mine are gun-totting, truck driving, homophobes. Hers are messy, loud, and love to party. Both of these are the complete opposites of us. Now I would be fine waiting for my lease to be up in July before moving out but my sweet girlfriend is forcing my hand.

She is fed up with her roommates and decided today that she is moving out and asked me to get an apartment with her. I would be all for this except my parents pay for my living expenses, groceries and my tuition and have already expressed apprehension with us moving in together will be 10 months together tomorrow, honestly feels like I have known this woman forever. As well if I do not move out with her she will move back home 45 minutes away (the complex is a 5 min walk from campus) and I will need to find a car to get me to grocery store and such. (My parents have given me a $5,000 budget to find a used car, \[not easy\], plus a little help in paying for gas/insurance until I get a job.) I have to figure all this out before I go back to campus from my parents house on the 14th. Plus I need to tell my parents she is moving out and I have lost my grocery store ride.

210,"This is my first serious-ish post on reddit but I need some quick advice. Here's the situation:  


I got a new phone and number a few months ago and I've only shared my number to a few close friends and family members. In the span of those few months, I would sometimes receive odd messages from unknown people and brush them off as ""wrong number"" type messages. I am still certain those specific messages (ex: an apparent drug dealer informing his clientele that he was back in business.) were indeed wrong numbers. This one however was odd and frankly creeped me out a whole lot.  


**You can see the screenshots**: [here](https://imgur.com/a/7kpiX5C)

But, essentially, a number from (I think?) Alabama (I live in Canada) sent me a series of messages. He knew my actual name and obviously my number, and claimed he found it online. The whole ""products"" part of the message seems excessively shady, almost comical, so I'm not sure if this is real and if I should take it seriously, but I'm a paranoid dude and have never had this happen before.

This could be a prank, but so few people know my number, all these people being trustworthy and highly unlikely to do this kind of thing, that I absolutely doubt that to be the case. Not sure what subreddit to consult so I thought r/Advice might be a good start.

214,"  Sorry if this post gets a bit ranty, but that's part of the problem. Couldn't find any other sub to post this in.  


  I have some serious tooth issues that need fixing. I need two crowns and some fillings. I've had them before, and each time (despite the claims of the dentists and other patients) the pain I felt for the following week or two was excruciating, I  would just sit around, failing to distract myself and (literally) wanting to die. As in, I literally prayed to God to kill me if the pain won't stop. This was always after the operation, the numbing during it was always sufficient (which is all the dentist seems to care about).  


  I have an extremely low pain tolerance, one that nobody around me seems to understand. They always tell me to ""toughen up"", ""deal with it"", or ""suck it up"" (even my parents as a kid). Pain that most can handle leaves me in unbearable agony. I told the dentist how much pain occurred after the operation, and they told me to get over-the-counter pain meds, which didn't help at all.   


  The last time I had a crown put in, the only way I got through it was some mild opiates I had (for completely unrelated reasons, coincidentally had the prescription at the same time as the crown). They actually lowered the pain to something more manageable. And despite the concerns of some, I did not get addicted or experience any kind of ""high"" or ""euphoria"", it just weakened the pain substantially. This is no longer the case. And i'm not willing to risk the legal issues involved with trying to obtain illegal drugs. 20 years old, so can't even drink alcohol to help. And no, I don't think it's some medical problem the dentist didn't find, they have done X-rays before and after my fillings and crowns, nothing was abnormal. Something about my brain apparently is just extremely sensitive to pain, far more than is normal.  


  But above all that, the worst part is that I know drugs that aren't harmful to me, that can make the whole experience a cake-walk do exist. Opiates, THC (not in a state where that is legal either), etc. But because some other people I have nothing to do with abuse them, get addicted, and die, they are regulated and I can't have access to them. And thinking about that catches by mind in a constant feedback loop of anxiety, anger, and hatred that sometimes leaves me shaking and on the verge of screaming. I know I shouldn't think that way, but I can't not. Being denied something that could help me for stupid reasons invokes the most intense anger, hate, and despair that I have ever felt. It makes me feel like I might have some kind of mental breakdown, it feels like it it about to consume me.  


  I know so many other people have problems worse than mine. I try to think about the people who have problems so much worse than mine, people whose lives are nothing but misery, but it doesn't help, I don't get ""perspective"", I just continue being just as intensely angry and anxious. I still feel like I am being consumed by my own hatred of the world. Any advice on any of the issues I have would be welcome. I somehow hold out hope that there's some magic fix to all this.

218,"*TL;DR at the bottom.*

So here's the deal. Sex doesn't appeal to me. It never has. Usually it's mostly uncomfortable for me. However I have a sexual fetish and have ""sexual"" desires, even though they're not inherently sexual. I can only reach orgasm with this fetish.

I also can't get off without reading erotica of this. I definitely can't get off at the hands of another person. They try for a good hour and then I try, but no use. It stops feeling good fairly quick.

I've read that it's better to just work around a fetish than cure it but there is no working around it. I can't have a normal relationship because I can't suck dick, I don't dirty talk, I have little enthusiasm for sex, and the only sexual interest I have is this fetish. 

The other problem (kind of a sub-problem) is like I mentioned, I can't get off without reading. I can't sit back, go at it, and get off. Even with reading it takes a good 40 minutes or longer. Without, it's nearly impossible.

I've never known anything else, it's always been like this, but I just want to be able to be aroused by normal things and get off without a phone in my face. I want to have a partner and not disappoint them with my lack of normal sexuality.

TL;DR: I have a fetish and nothing else arouses me. Sex is unappealing. I can't reach orgasm without reading erotica and no other person can get me off. Relationships are pretty much impossible.",05Jan2019,1

Recently due to actually never be able to get along with each other my dad decided to kick her out (there more reasons etc but thats not what advice im after). 
Me and my brother were having a conversation and talked about how he was happy about this decision. 
He told me he was happy because my step brother has been very sexually inappropriate towards my brother. He has been talking about wanting to have sex with him, even offering him money to stay quiet if they do. Hes been masterbating next to and ON my brother while he thinks my brothers asleep and also trying to cuddle him? He also talks sexually about others in the house and has issues with porn. 
Upon hearing this I immediately want to take some action but aslong as they were moving out by brother said it was fine.
Literally 2 days after this my dad tells me they are moving back in . 
My brother has asked me to talk to the adults and see what can be done. 

Im asking for advice on how to bring this up and possibly discuss it with them, for legal ill go to my local laws website. Im an 18 year old female  in New Zealand. Please any advice on how i bring this icky subject up thank you.

Sidenote: My brother knows ive posted here and has also told my step brother to stop doing what he is doing but he hasnt. My brother appreciates any advice thank you. ",05Jan2019,1

Some days are happy and some days are so irritating. Daily routine is so... monotonous. And apart from this, socializing gets irritating. Is it really necessary to be with friends everyday? Would it be rude if I was away from them? Is it bad to be alone for a while? Sometimes I feel like minding my own business but being with friends feels necessary. I can't manage them both.

222,"I'll try to keep this as a nice summary of the details as obviously I won't be able to explain every detail. 

I live with my girlfriend on a goat farm doing work trade for discounted rent, and that whole topic is another advice post just waiting to be posed. Anyway, this is about how we somehow arranged for my girlfriend's little sister to live here as well, with the condition that she would agree to fulfil her work-trade responsibilities. Just before she moved up here, I was offered legal cannabis trim work, at the time I was balancing 2 jobs ( a caretaker job and a landscaping job) as well as a mildly successful online etsy shop so I refused. A month passed, and she was now living here, she was also offered the legal cannabis trim work and accepted and started working full-time. At the time, she claimed it was the easiest job ever, and she's getting paid more than I am at my care taking job. 

2 months pass, and she is struggling to fulfill her work trade mostly because of negligence, not only that but she is absolutely terrible at saving money. She somehow blew $800 eating out and buying stupid shit her first month here.  I loan her money, maybe $20-40 in total, but I am also continuously making extra food when I get home after doing my work-trade farm chores, so that she does not go hungry because I know she will just spoon peanut butter out of the jar or eat out, otherwise. She also used our cooking oils, salt, spices, shampoo, soaps, and had never offered to buy toilet paper or paper towels. She was even using the land lord's laundry soap until my girlfriend and I got bitched at for it and had to force her to buy into ours, since apparently it was too much trouble to buy her own.

My landscaping job slowed down dramatically because of fall/winter and I accepted the cannabis trim job, I also decide to drop my caretaker job as it did not pay well and the schedule was convoluted and interfering with my ability to manage my etsy shop. Fast forward another 2 months, and she didn't fulfill her end of the work trade agreement, got kicked out by our landlord, she moved in elsewhere and I helped her move her shit. Ultimately, she has made if very difficult for my girlfriend and I to continue living here, and now I work with her and sort of rely on the money.

At our job, we get paid for how quickly and efficiently we trim cannabis. I started as one of the slowest trimmers but with persistence and a couple youtube videos I have learned how to shave down my time, and it has resulted in a much larger paycheck. People at work chitter-chatter all day long, I am literally trimming at twice the rate as some of our slowest trimmers. I don't like to look at the workplace as a social environment, but I am never rude to anyone and am always trying to be courteous and polite. 

This is where I need the advice bit. She is making up stories about my behavior at work (that I saw her approaching the building one day and locked the door, that I am stand-offish) and telling my girlfriend that I am rude and anti-social at work and that the way that I trim is obnoxious and loud. She claims to have a hearing disorder that amplifies sound, and apparently trimming sounds are giving her anxiety, especially my own. She feels like she had some huge hand in me getting the job, but I was offered it before we even got her a place to stay. I feel that I am simply focused on my work and attempting my best to stay focused so that I can get more money so that I can move away from my situation. I could easily find a room for rent, but I am really aiming to get an apartment of our own for my girlfriend and I. 

For the cherry on top, just a week ago, I loaned her another $50 for gas, so that she could scrape out an existence in January. I also completely funded a trip back to our hometown - 8 hours away - where our parents live (which was mostly to her benefit) so she could pick up clothing/furniture and Christmas gifts. I upgraded my phone as a Christmas gift to myself and gave her my iPhone 6s that was in beautiful condition for Christmas because she had destroyed her phone by dropping it repeatedly and her family could not afford to replace it for her.

I feel that her feelings are coming from a place of jealousy, insecurity, envy and shame. I feel that the obvious answer is to find different work, but I feel that I can actually mindlessly grind at this job and perhaps move up in the company as I actually have other relevant skills that I could offer the company if I weren't in a constant state of my own distress. I like that I can just mindlessly grind there, it is a great time to be in my own thoughts.

I don't know what to do, should I communicate with the owners of the company, the management team, or my girlfriend's sister? How do I approach them? What can I say without risking my job and relationship with these people.",05Jan2019,1

224,"So I'm currently going through a divorce and I know rationally that my ex has massively messed with my head. I have been physically sick every day since I left him before the holidays. I'm noticeably losing weight. Now that being said, I'm 5'8 and still over 200 pounds. I have a wide frame so I think quite thin at tube 180-190 range. I wasn't planning on meeting anyone until I returned to that weight since I've really only put in on in part due to my ex's lifestyle and in part after I'd been on birth control to treat pcos (so nothing changed in addictive exercise and diet but I gained 60 pounds in a 3 month span). 

Anyway, a month or so ago I started using IMVU to combat my social anxiety. At first I was grateful to start having conversations with people again since my ex kept me completely isolated (even from family). But maybe a week or two ago I met this guy on there who is just electric. He's easily the mosy thrilling person I've met on my life. I would settle for even being a friend of his if he wasn't interested in me. I just want to be in his life.

This guy and I have been really hitting it off and he's even gotten a bit flirty with me. So I gently tried to tell him about my weight. I think he's a little dense though since he didn't really get it. I imagine a guy like him prefers the kind of appearance I'm working for but don't yet have. I can't imagine him looking at me and seeing anyone worth while after all the amazing experiences he's had in life (he's also clearly wealthy while I'm about as poor as it comes but he definitely is aware of that one). Now he's talking about seeing me in a few weeks while he's in my neighborhood. I don't know what to tell him. I don't want to be rude and assume he's shallow, but I don't want to lose him from my life because of something as changeable as my weight. I feel like I should try to add him on something and send him a picture of me but I'm not sure that's a good idea. I'm afraid I'll loser him as a friend of I'm too pushy. What should I do? My ex keeps harassing me via text as well and it's really messing with my mental health. I feel like I'm in over my head.",05Jan2019,1

I asked my friends and family to report the account and all was well, however I looked up my name again recently, and there is another account.

227,"I met him after picking him up off the side of the road. He needed a ride to the gas station and back home. He had a home at this time, living with his grandfather. I invited him to come smoke and drink a beer with some friends and soon confronted him after realizing that he was lying to make himself seem cooler... This settled and he we have hung out a couple times. He hasn't lied about anything serious and took my criticism well after i brought it up; since then I can tell his effort to be more forthcoming, but i still worry that if he lies about something small, could that later be serious. 

I had him over, encouraged to get a job and work towards moving out of what seems like an abusive home in some fashion or another. From what he has told me i know this- his life is rough, rougher than most. He had cancer as a kid that should have killed him, but got lucky. He lived with his grandfather who gets unreasonably mad and kicks him out arbitrarily. Evidently for the last time a couple weeks ago. Since he says he has been living on the street. Also has stage 3 lung cancer.. He says he has undergone 2 chemo treatments which have left half of his hair falling out. His friends all tell him to go kill himself, i know, not friends.. and he has no family, nothing to help him out. His Aunt takes him to chemo and that's it. He says he got kicked out of all 3 local homeless shelters. His reasoning being that people were picking on him and he got kicked out for provoking potential violence or some shit. I can say he is definitely not a fighter and i haven't seen him raise his temper more than a 'damnit' here or there. 

After agreeing to give him a ride tonight to a friend's house, it turns out the friend never officially invited him over as it was a friend of a friend who was occupying the house and they were the one he was in contact with. IDK, a very confusing situation that essentially was him coming without being invited. I couldn't drop him off on the curb side, so he is with me for the night. I'm sorry for the wall of info, i am just really hoping someone has some insight/suggestions. Thanks.

TL;DR- Friend who has stage 3 lung cancer, is homeless and jobless is at my place for the night. He has been known to lie about trivial matters and i don't know if i trust him to stay longer. He has no one to turn to, how can i help him, if at all?",05Jan2019,1
228,"To start off, I'm a 20 year old Canadian girl who has only started their first real job in 2018. Before that I was always in school with random part time jobs. Anyways, I never ever learned how to file my taxes. My parents didn't teach me and I didn't learn in school. So I asked my parents who they paid to do their taxes and took mine to the same place, in 2016. 

My parents all got their tax return money back. But I guess inbetween the time I met this dude and he started on my taxes, he died or disappeared off the face of the earth or something. I have returned to his office, called many times with no luck. I forgot about it because I was 18 and stupid. 

This past tax season, in the fall, I tried to do them myself. I kept coming to the conclusion I owed money and I thought it couldn't be possible. I gave up and brought my taxes to a new place. This company does taxes for a lot of people and they seemed to be on track with helping me. Soon I got a call back from a guy who told me I OWED 2500$ to the government. Wtf? How could I owe money when none of my peers do? Anyways he asked me to bring in some forms from my post secondary school. I did, faxed them to him, then he also proceeded to disappear.... I went back to the office and they said they never had me on file or something. 

(Pause here to apologize if I sound totally stupid or out of touch. I swear I just don't understand these things :( )

So, I eventually got a hold of Service Canada after calling them for like 6 days, lol. The lady on the phone was very helpful and told me my taxes hadn't been filed in two years. This made sense to me but I didn't realize it was so serious because there has to be many teenagers out there who miss doing it? I can't be the only one who was never taught a thing about it. She said she would send me my t4s and tax forms from the past two years in the mail so I could file them. But the problem still remains I don't know how to do them and I don't know why I owe 2500$... Can anybody please recommend to me a course of action here, I don't think there are any other places in my small town that do taxes for people... ",05Jan2019,1

235,"So mid-2018, I had a root canal done on my back right bottom molar (not wisdom).
Ive been in the process of getting a perm crown, through several appts.

Now, some info—I have a gap in front of it. Old gap from abscess extraction in 2015-2016.

This molar is tilted and the endodontist told me I’ll likely need it removed in the future because of how it’s tilted—bad spot, hard to clean. In addition, the roots are blocking my wisdom (saw x-rays), and two of my molars roots are joined at the end.

My wisdoms, as I’ve last seen (fall of 2018) have no roots yet (Im newly 18 so not surprised).

My temp crown just fell off of the molar. I’ve had several appointments for it so far, it’s getting tedious.

I’m not sure if I should just say to hell with the madness and get this sucker pulled or if I should just let them crown it.

Like the endo said, it’ll end up being pulled someday anyway (most likely). Its roots are in the way of my wisdom, and two of its own are connected.

However, it’s the only tooth there atm and I heard that tooth extractions reduce bone density in the jaw.

We both pretended nothing happened and never spoke about it again. 

Eventually everything was back to normal. We all hangout and get drunk together and its great. But recently there has been this crazy sexual tesion between us when we all drink together.

238,"Throw away so that this can't bite me later and I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting 

This ""friend"" will be known as M and my other friend will be known as A for easier reading and anonymity 

I have known M for a few years and considering I'm young that means a long time to me (teenager for clarity). M and I have never been close only calling each other friends because we have mutual friends and haven't talked much until recently when we were both added to a Facebook group chat with several other people most of who I know personally. 

One of these people is A someone who I could consider a best friend so close in fact we make jokes about her sexual behavior often exaggerating it to points where if you know who A really is you would wonder if we were talking about the same person. 

Now comes the part that worries me I think that M has the idea that the jokes of A are actually represent her in a serious way and that the exaggerated A is the exact kinda girl he is into. I know for a fact based on conversations with him he has a crush on A something brought to my attention by another friend was that by this point M was rejected by A a total of four times by now. The reasons I believe that M believes that the exaggerated version of A is the true version of A are based on true quotes from him such as "" I wouldn't mind if A did... You know what, nevermind, nevermind"" making sure we all heard the sentence but never repeating it like if he told a joke that he believed no one heard. More than the quotes are actions he takes when in a video call with the group chat he normally just sits or stands or lays exactly how he was when he joined the call however slthe moment A joins the call he rushes to his bed takes his shirt off and lies down on his side every time and if A does not join the call immediately he will continue to ring her until he gets bored and leaves the call. 

Now for why I believe he is manipulave, M if ever confronted with his actions will do one of two things. One he will attempt to redirect attention to the person calling him out with this sentence but slightly modified "" wow (name of person calling him out) gets REALLY WIERD whenever it comes to A"" or two M will say these quotes in almost the same order ever time ""you hate me don't you"" ""I really should just go away"" "" I knew I shouldn't of opened up"" and a few others. The thing that pissing me of about option number two is that if M is a manipulater he is not trying to elicit a response of empathy from the person pointing out his actions but instead trying to get a specific friend to protect him. This friend has a very soft spot for people with depression and would do everything within their power to help but will also stand strong and will not budge once their mind is made up. 

I have told some of my friends what I think and they believe me but haven't or won't tell anyone else. I have emphasizes to them that this could be a crackpot theory. I am worried that I'm right and that M is now acting behind the scenes to get his way even willing to split up our friend group so that he would have less complications (side note if he does this but stays with the friend that has a soft spot for people with depression he would be on whatever side of the broken friend group that A is on)

So the advice I'm asking for is am I correct in thinking this am I in the wrong should I apologize for spreading false rumors or if km right what steps should I take to prevent my friends from being separated and A from having less help in dealing with M

I don’t really mind that since we’re friends and I can handle it- at the start it really threw me off though. He’d call himself a “broken man” and go in depth about his sadness.

I try to ask him questions to distract him, or when he tears himself down saying “I’m not smart” I’ll tell him he’s wrong, and he is smart, he’s just sad right now. He’ll always tell me he appreciates me checking up on him, that no one else does, blah blah.

All my life I was bullied which leads to me being extremely nervous with girls, especially touching my body due to the belly fat I've got, even though I'm quite athletic and go to the gym often but not having a visible six pack really messes my head up.

Anyway, I've met this girl twice. The first time, she literally strip naked and wanted to have sex with me. We ended up doing stuff, but I was too nervous to have sex which was a total deal breaker. Now this girl, she is gorgeous, and I have no idea why the fuck I wasn't able to even get an erection for the first 2 hours, but after a while i got more confident and we ended up doing something. Luckily she didn't mind.

She met me the day after. This girl is extremely insecure about kissing on the lips, yet she kisses me on the lips. It was easier getting her naked than having her kiss my lips, yet she does kiss me and when she's about to leave she always asks for one. She talks to a few other boys. 2 other. We have long conversations, and cuddles and I'm scared I'm starting to like her even though we agreed to have something physical only.

She's admitted to having some feelings towards me (she asked me what if I already have caught some feelings even tho I shouldn't) and liking me but I'm not sure whether this is true or not and makes me all fairly insecure, sometimes being blunt when replying and making a lot of questions to reassure my doubt.

Although I know this is a mistake as insecurity pushes girls away.

What do I do? How can I reassure myself she likes me? Yesterday, before going to bed, I told her I really liked her and for her to have a good night. And she replies ""yeah I'm so tired xx have a good night sleep xx sleep well gorgeous x""

Literally.

I'm not sure at all whether this is her showing off she likes me or whether it's all just a game she's playing in order to keep me around. Sorry for the long post, thank you if you can help me out a little...",05Jan2019,1

252,"It’s about to be my 4th semester at my local college, and I’ve been trying to stay a “fully loaded” student (4 classes per semester) since I got there, but it’s been really difficult getting the classes in the right order. I’m trying my best to keep gas costs as low as possible so I’m not driving more than an hour a day JUST for school. Here’s the issue;

The classes I require for my degree have to be at the 2nd campus 30 min away in a different city. I have completely drained my Gen Ed classes, so every last one of my classes that I need are now in that other city. Picking the times for these classes was a pain because they never lined up at all with what I would want my schedule to be, so I have 3 choices that I have talked to my advisor with:

1. Keep the schedule how it is now with 1 online class and 1 class on the 2nd campus from 4pm - 6:20pm (Tues/Thurs)

2. Have 1 online class, and have 2 classes stacked at the 2nd campus from 8am - 12:20pm (Tues/Thurs)

3. Same as the first but having an additional class from 5pm - 6:50pm (Mon/Wed)

I’m stuck and I don’t know what to choose. 

Option 1 would be the easiest for me to do, but I’d be 2 classes down and may have to take an extra semester

Option 2 would probably be the worst for me personally because I just don’t have the physical ability to wake up that early effectively anymore. I had an 8am class beforehand and it was torture

Option 3 would solve most of the class deficit but the issue is that I’d be driving to the other city every day out of the week and that will hurt my gas costs significantly.

As for my job situation, I quit my job before the year started so I could focus all of my efforts on school but this semester is falling apart for me and having these classes so far away and so staggered will hurt however many hours I get at the job because I’d either get a lot of hours crammed in the week so it’d be a mountain of stress balancing work and school, or I’d be not getting that many hours during the week which would mean that I would have ZERO weekends off and no free time.

there entire tone sounds flirty and like they are talking personal.  I'm not sure if this is just my mind playing tricks, I have NEVER questioned her, or been the jealous type. but just recently a customer texted her some hearts and she texted a smiley face with a tongue out, then when confronted, she said it's a much older man that has came in regularly for years, he occasionally texted and asked how we are doing, or about the kids, yet I have never really met him. that comes in with his wife, I had to still explain what his intentions were, why she should NEVER text customers, and that isn't very appropriate in a relationship. we've been together 8 years, this is all of lately.

Hey y’all! 

I have been struggling to get motivated and then stay focused on whatever the task I started. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety as well as depression so that also plays a bit of a factor. As well as that I love to procrastinate but I am also a pretty big perfectionist. To try &amp; counteract what I have going against me{or at least trying too}. I will try and make a to do list, because I love a nice &amp; pretty to do list. But, I will either make the to do list over and over again until it meets my perfectionist standards or I will make it pretty intensive &amp; it will becomes way to overwhelming.

It will get so overwhelming that my anxiety will then begin to tell me “There is no way you can complete this whole list and to the standards that you have set, so why when complete any of them? You will just disappoint yourself and others.” 

I have tried a variety of things to combat all of this &amp; accomplish whatever task I need to get done, but I haven’t found anything that really works. 

I am looking for any advice, tips or ideas that y’all would be willing to share that will help me with my lack of motivation, discipline and focus.

263,"I have been dating my GF (currently ex) on and off for 3 years. I have dumped her twice. However, I always seem to come back. I was scared of  having a legitimate future with this girl, and we are currently only 18 but I feel such a strong bond with her. I dumped her because I was worried I was missing out on ""Single life"" stuff like partying, clubs, hooking up, etc. But in the past month of doing these things I found out I hate it, it gives me nothing compared to when I was with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Point is, I called her and she suggested we try this phase were we are kinda committed (none of us can hookup with anyone and it is to see if our feelings stay strong) and she is using this method because I have left twice... The problem is is that in this phase (obviously) she is very distant and emotionally detached but gives off hints of wanting me to stay talking to her whenever we do. I am very confused and hurt, but I think I understand why she does it.

&amp;#x200B;

264,"I have a group chat with four of my close friends from high school.  We're all in college now so most of us live far away from each other and can't see each other often.  One of my friends has been saying stuff on our chat along the veins of ""I hate myself,"" ""I'm so lonely,"" ""Why can't I die?"".   He'll often go on dramatic rants and then leave the group.  I believe this all stems from not being able to be with a girl he likes, and loneliness from not having a good friend group in college.   We have told him multiple times to try the free counseling offered at his college, but he either gives a noncommittal response or makes up a poor excuse.  I even sent a detailed email to one of the counselors at his college about his behavior, and even though I know he gets the emails, he still refuses to go.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on for the past five months or so, and recently we have been mostly ignoring him when he goes on his rants.  I feel guilty for this, but in the past whenever any of us would respond or talk with him he would just get worse and respond pessimistically without listening to us.  Since he keeps ranting on our chat he has to want some kind of attention, and I'm not sure if we should keep giving it to him.  Should we keep talking to him or ignore him?

He offered to give me a lift home and drove up my driveway to make it easier for me to get in.
The second occasion we talked a bit and he let me in close proximity to look at IG posts and offered to walk home with me (he lives nearby) if I couldn't get a lift.
He also apologised on behalf of another creepy friend for his behaviour which is nice.
We are having another catch up and he contacted me privately and not in the group chat to ask if I wanted a lift there and I didn't know if this meant something or he just found it more convenient but if it were me I would have offered in the group chat. He also said he could wait around for me as I had repairmen over.
I thought I might of caught him glancing at me and my body when we were swimming but I can't say for sure. 
He also said to come and find him at his upcoming birthday party if I ever feel uncomfortable.


However, he didn't complement me and offered to help our friend and his parents do various things and told our friend to thank his parents for dinner. So he might just be a kind person? 
I really like him as a friend but would possibly consider him more if it means anything...

270,"A bit of back story.  My husband (35) and I (33) became friends with a lesbian couple early last year, we met in our local pub.   

Margaret (50) and Hillary (25) both suffer from mental health issues, Margaret has 5 children and 2 grandchildren that she is not allowed to see due to her issues and on going violence between M and H.  It is also worth noting that Margaret lost a baby boy due to health complications. 

My husband and I had been trying to conceive for over 2 years and M and H were aware of our struggle, even offering surrogacy at one point. 

Fast forward to now and I am 4 months pregnant and we couldn't be happier about it, except I have major concerns about Margaret's ""excitement"" and I am deeply worried she sees my unborn child as a replacement for her deceased baby.  

Here's some of the things that make me worried;

1 - insisted on buying things for the baby that my husband and I wanted to get, no big deal but she got extremely angry when we tried to politely decline.

2 - constantly asks me how ""her"" baby is whilst trying to rub my tummy.

3 - I referred to the baby as him in passing (we don't know the gender) and she grabbed my coat demanding to know if the baby was indeed a boy.

And this is the reason I am really worried:

4 - my husband and I are looking to move from our one bed property before the baby arrives.  Margaret suggested that the baby live with them if we haven't moved.

I'm a first time mom so I'm probably just being ultra sensitive but I am genuinely worried that Margaret is looking to replace her deceased baby with mine.

My boss, Steve (fake name) has always been very nice and friendly. I rarely worked with him, really, mainly just his son or wife. However, since I’ve came back, Steve’s been scheduling us together more than ever. In all of my shifts this week there’s been times where it’s just me and him alone in the restaurant. That’s never happened before.

So last week he starts asking me about college, parties, and stuff. I answer and tell him all the cool stuff I saw, but after a while it leads to sex. I am a bit uncomfortable so I just let him talk and share his stories. He’s always been really outgoing and talkative so I didn’t think much of it.  However, next shift, it continues. He’s asking weird stuff to me now, what my kinks are, weirdest place Ive had sex, how many people I’ve slept with. I give him vague short answers for most of it, but thankfully another person comes in for their shift so he stops talking about it. The rest of the day is normal until I go on break, he joins me and I don’t know how it came up but he started explaining his philosophy of monogamy. He tells me he cheated on his wife with a 18 year old about 10 years ago, even states “what they don’t know doesn’t hurt them”. I didn’t think much of it then, I only told him I would never cheat on my boyfriend but before I could shame him for his actions he had to leave. When I got back, the girl I was working with mentioned it was weird he went in the break room with me, because he never does that with anyone. 

Cant remember exactly when but he showed me his porn collection on his phone the other day and I told him “Steve, that’s something I really don’t want to see.” A couple other things happened, but you get the picture. He’s being super sexual and I’m uncomfortable now. It’s been about a week since all this started and I have no idea what to do.

I want to think he’s not trying to sleep with me, I’m trying to believe he’s just being friendly and talkative but he’s making it really hard to give him the benefit of the doubt. I’m concerned because at first, I was responsive and open to these conversations so I don’t wanna blame him, but now it’s just all he talks about with me.


What do I do? I feel awful, he’s been cheating on his wife for years and now he might be trying to sleep with me. It’s a family business so I’m very close with his wife and his children.

I’ve had two real adult relationships with men, both were quite toxic. 

One was a really nice guy but I still ended up being abusive to him. He would be ‘nice’ to me and I would feel insulted. I was very in denial that it was a relationship, although it was up and down and sometimes it was perfect when I didn’t think about it.

The other was abusive *towards me*, and I think I liked this. He was married and into rough sex. When he was abusive I didn’t feel morally liable for it.

I also got in a fight with a gay man quite recently while drunk. I started it.

I’m quite scrappy, but I’m an adult now and getting into fights and having bruises etc, it doesn’t match with my respectable image I have at work.

Basically, I can’t really handle things and it isn’t getting better. I chose to not date men because I think I’m a bad person when things trigger me. I think I did the right thing? I mean I don’t want to hurt gay people.

I’m also in pointless expensive therapy. Is there a point to that? A part of me wonders why I am bothering, people don’t change.

However, I realised this wasn’t going to earn me money. It most definately can! If you manage a bank roll and divide plays weekly in units. But I was never that organised and don’t think I ever will be, and I’m 21. I’m actually positive in profits (I track my deposits vs withdrawals strictly), however, my wins are high and my losses will be high too, so it feels like I lose a lot and my stomach sinks. I walk away temporarily but always find myself crawling back.

How do I stop it/completely remove it. Cause it’s easy to delete the app and redownload it. It’s easy to say “I won’t look at the races” but then start looking into them.

I wish that I could tell him that I like him back... then he wouldn't feel alone compared to everyone else and all that. The issue is that I care for him... as a friend as well as a romantic interest, however I feel the absolute pressure of having a successful relationship like everyone else around me. There is a lot of turbulence surrounding everyone in my life and I'm afraid that if I don't make a decision I could end up isolated. I'm not saying that I would be using a relationship to mask difficulties in my life-- but I don't know how to function in a relationship. Now, I feel guilty because of trash my friends have been saying that ""You're too innocent, It'll never last"" and  my personal feeling of inadequacy compared to my friends experience.

Recently, my friend has been flirting with me more despite what one of his friends has said against it... I'm entirely conflicted on whether or not to pursue or not-- since he obviously cares about our friendship... and thinks about more.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm feeling**

 For the past 5 years I've been suffering with Depression at least twice a week. My depression mainly started from me over thinking (I believe) and comparing myself a lot to others. I believe everybody is a lot better at most things than me, and I always come second best in everyones life. For example, girls I've been talking to and trying to get close with choosing over guys over me (and then ignoring me from then from even being friend) and at the moment my best friends are drifting towards other people. Usually when I arrange to meet up with them it's followed by ""who else is coming"" or ""I'll text x and y and see if they wanna come"" or ""I text x and he's also coming"".

&amp;#x200B;

I get nervous, scared, anxious and anxiety a lot nowadays about things that I have done in the past or making up fictional scenarios in my head. I have a very low self esteem and really am pretty shy inside (Although I try to put on an act that makes me seem not).  A combination of these puts me into severe depression that often give me heart burn and panic attacks. Sometimes I shake and my left or right arm will start to feel tense and fatigued uncontrollably. Recently, my dreams have started to be those where I'm doing something wrong and I get caught, then I wake up feeling stressed in the middle of the night and have to calm down then try get back to sleep. I can't remember the last time in the last month where I haven't woken up in the middle of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Following up, I feel like I don't have anything to give others, that my friendship is not really good enough for most people, and I believe it's because of all the mental problems that I comes with. I don't tell others but I think they can see through me. So I really would like to remove my depression and therefore I believe my whole life would be sorted and better.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the root of my problems**

one of my most recent issues and problems is I feel like I'm a very socially awkward person nowadays and I feel like it's due to the depression I've been having that has turned me this way. I am a social and outgoing person, however it just seems that I find it hard to make friends and even think of things to say to others (I run out of chat very quickly) and keep others attention nowadays. I've joined university three months ago, and I really haven't made any friends besides the people I already know there previously and my flatmates. This just makes me feel like others don't care about me, and I feel often that I'm second best in almost everything. I try to be social and talk to other, nobody really approaches me so I mainly initiate but it seems that others don't want to give me the light of day which makes me feel like i'm unwanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big thing is, I'm often called out for my flaws in a joking way (most times) by others (it's just the way we joke with others nowadays) and I do take it at the time but later It just makes me feel terrible when I reflect what has been said, and I realise I don't have any really good qualities. Some of the things I get called out for are being Skinny, having a big forehead and genuinely shit hair, being quite a nervous person (probably due to my depression) and recently I've become quite a \*slow\* person. Even teachers would call me out on this. I try not to let things affect me but when I'm being singled out, I makes me compare to others and I see them there is something wrong with me as it seems I'm the only person that has this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I am quite lonely and don't really have many people in my life that I really feel do on a personal level care about me as much anymore. The thing that make it worst is that I isolate myself because I believe that If I told my close friends or family they will look at me even more different and this would fuel my anxiety and make me worse. I don't want to feel like I have a problem and would much rather keep these things to myself and deal with them myself.

&amp;#x200B;

somehow, recently I have started having lots of disagreements with a lot of people in my life, them or me now cutting them off. I hate this and I like to be friendly with everyone but It seems that as I've got to a mature age 18, I'm starting to fall out for small reasons with people and I'm often the one to take the blame and want to apologies first. With my friends, I see that the conflicts they have with other people over time seem to fade, but with me people hold serious grudges and I don't know why, I try my hardest to do the right thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I'm trying to fix myself**

1 -  I genuinely try to stay positive and put things aside usually use the sayings, *One day at a time* and *time fixes everything,* but it seems that I always have a mental breakdown somewhere in the week.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - I have read up on pills that could help me such as  magnesium supplements which are meant to make you happier and have been considering buying them. Sometimes I do think about buying xanax and having a tiny amount a day until I feel normal but I don't really want to mask myself completely and I don't like the other effects of the drug such as forget-fullness, laziness and intoxicated state. I do want to go to the doctor as seem if I can get some mood boost tablets or something to even out my hormones as I really think It would help me, but I feel this would be embarrassing for me, and I would have to be clinically depressed so I want to try sort this out myself.

&amp;#x200B;

3 - I know this is not the right thing to do but I compare myself to others who have it worse, and it makes me feel a little better and grateful for what I already have. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 - I try to distract myself, If I'm left with my mind alone, I can really get into my head. Small things like watching tv or making spotify playlists.

289,"I need some unbiased opinions from people and not sure where else to turn...

I have to fill you in on some backstory first... it may be a bit of a read, sorry.

So 8 years ago I was 20, living at home and in a very bad space both physically and mentally. I was 250lbs and I had always suffered from bad depression and anxiety but I was at my absolute worst. I thought about taking my own life every day and I went on stress leave from work because I couldn’t face going in. So I was at home alone, depressed, very obese and incredibly miserable. One day, I saw an ad online for a guy selling hand raised baby parrots. I had always loved birds, and had some when I was younger, so I asked my mum if it was ok and decided to get one. I thought that having a pet might give me something to live for and give me some happiness in life. He was a sun conure and as soon as I picked him up I loved him - he was this adorable, fluffy dinosaur that snuggled into my neck and rolled around in my hand just being generally cute as heck. I ended up naming him Spyro and after having for a few weeks everything just seemed a little brighter... I had a reason to get up now, he needed fresh food and fruit... I had things to fill my day with because he needed training and attention... I started talking to people on bird forums and the parrot subreddit so I felt less lonely... Spyro has his own Instagram and everyone loved him... I felt like this little bird had saved me and I loved him so so much. We did everything together and one day while we were browsing reddit I found the keto subreddit - I managed the gather the courage and motivation to try it and over the course of 10 months I lost 70lb. I felt like a whole new person and everything was looking up for me, I even found the most amazing boyfriend. 

But... things got bad again. I thought that losing weight would’ve fixed my depression and self confidence issues, but it didn’t seem to help as much as I thought it would... I fell back into a self hating spiral and my depression got really bad again. I started pushing my boyfriend away, I didn’t go out anymore, I didn’t even spend as much time with Spyro anymore. He started developing a screaming problem because of the lack of attention and I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of a sun conure scream but... imagine the loudest thing you’ve ever heard, double it, then increase the pitch by about 1000%... it’s incredibly grating and unpleasant, haha. My depression kept getting worse and eventually I started to become suicidal again... I was back where I started and now I felt even worse, if that was even possible. Spyros screaming was driving me insane but I was too depressed to fix the situation and was at my wits end... My bf couldn’t deal with me and Spyros screaming and broke up with me... I don’t blame him. Then I lost my job and I was diagnosed with an auto immune condition. 

I just couldn’t cope anymore. My mum decided a change of scenery might help so we made plans to pack up and move to a new city... but I was worried about finding an apartment with Spyro and his new screaming problem... I was also worried I wouldn’t be able to look after him anymore and that I wasn’t giving him a nice life anymore. I decided I should rehome him. After searching for the perfect person for months I found a really lovely lady to take him... she had a few kids and Spyro seemed to immediately bond with her. I was so upset, but also happy I found someone nice... I sent him off with her and we moved out. I couldn’t cope with the judgement from my friends and followers about rehoming him so I just lied and told people who asked that he died... I felt terrible, but I just felt like I couldn’t face the judgement. I have seen other people online been torn apart for rehoming an animal and I just couldn’t deal with the added pressure of it... so I lied. 

When we got into our new house I found a new job. I was earning good money so I could afford to start seeing a therapist and taking medication. It helped immensely, I couldn’t believe how much of a difference it made to me. I felt like a different person... I could get out of bed in the morning, I started going to the gym, I made new friends, went on dates... I was happy... but in the back of my mind I also regretted rehoming Spyro. Especially because after I got proper help everything became so much easier to deal with... we didn’t even end up moving into an sperimentale, I could’ve probably had Spyro there without any problems. I hated that all of this came at the cost of him... I kept in contact with the woman who took him and she sent me updates, videos, pictures etc... but it was painful. I couldn’t talk about him or look at his photos without crying... I felt like asking for him back, but her kids adored him... and I didn’t deserve him anymore. For almost 5 years I felt like that. It was the biggest regret of my life... but I tried to use it as a really tough life lesson to learn, but it still hurt a lot.

After missing him all those years, I decided to finally get another bird. 8 months ago I adopted a really sweet Galah cockatoo named Flossy. I love her to pieces and she is an absolute joy. I train her and take her out to cafes on her little harness, she even comes to work with me! She’s the greatest, I finally felt for the first time in years that the hole in my heart Spyro left had been filled. 

But today... today the lady who took Spyro sent me a text message. She said that all her kids have moved out of home now and he isn’t getting much attention. She wants to give him back to me, if I want him... I couldn’t believe it. I felt so overwhelmed and shocked honestly, there were nights I lay awake wishing so much I could get him back... and now I’ve been offered the chance. It just doesn’t even seem real

I know you’re probably thinking I’m insane for even thinking about saying no after all that, but I’m worried. I’m worried that flossy and Spyro won’t get along... I’m worried about how I’ll find my own place with TWO birds let alone one... I’m worried about what my friends will think of me. I feel like my real friends will understand that I was in such a dark place that I felt like that was my only option but... I still feel like such a horrible person 

I feel like this is a dream come true... a second chance to right the biggest wrong in my life, but suddenly I’m hesitating

I feel like I still worry about the future... I feel like my life has gone nothing to plan so far, I plan for things that never happen, I end up just rolling with the punches half the time so... why am I so worried about what ifs and buts? 

I don’t know... just typing all this and getting it off my chest has already helped immensely... any advice or opinions would be really welcome, I feel so overwhelmed that this has actually happened to me after all these years of missing and regret and sadness

I have set up a day two weeks from now to go meet her (she is a 10hour drive away) to see if Spyro even remembers me to start... but I am still not 100% sure what I should do

Thanks for taking the time to read my story anyway :) ",05Jan2019,1

295,"2019 was gonna be my year.  I was gonna kick ass and take names.  I was gonna set goals and achieve them.  I was going to actually be the person I tell people I am.  Unfortunately I have already broken one of my resolution and the pathetic part is that it is probably the simplest and most achievable one.  I was supposed to give up smoking and vaping for the new year.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context.  I am a 24 year old boy who is 7 classes from finishing college with a computer science degree.  However I have been 7 classes away for the last 2 years.  I have been working full time with a moving company during those 2 years.  I pay for basically everything I have except my phone bill; I am still on my parents plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I had done good the first 3 days with no urges at all and was feeling pretty confident that this resolution may be attainable.  I live with 2 of my friends and they smoke cigs and both hit juuls like they are fucking Mike Tyson.  Seeing them smoking or vaping in front of me didn't bother me at all.  I didn't crave it and barely paid any attention at all.  Looking back I think I didn't mind it or worry about because I was too full of this smug arrogance that there wasn't any way I would break my resolution.  What a self disengaged arrogant asshole I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Well tonight was the first Friday night of the new year and I went out with my buddies.  We went to dinner and I had a few beers.  My friends were smoking their juuls in the restaurant (what entitled millennials smoking inside I know we suck) and for the first time I felt like asking them if I could get a hit from them.  I sorta playfully grabbed my buddies from his hand and just held it for a few seconds thinking to myself how much I wanted to hit it.  I somehow rationalized in my head that if I was already feeling this strong of an urge to hit it 4 days in no way I was gonna make it 365 days so why not just hit it now.  Fucking weak and stupid.  I didn't hit it then, not due to personal strength but because my friends new about my resolution and my ego wouldn't allow me to give them something to mess with me about.  I gave the juul back to my friend and even though I didn't smoke it, that little tiny event felt like a massive L.  I knew that if I was already trying to piece together excuses in my head an trying to validate quitting then I was in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

We left the restaurant and walked to the bar next door.  I took a couple shots and then it was game over.  I asked one of my buddies who didn't know about my resolution if I could hit his juul.  I did it in such a cowardly way.  I made sure my roommates didn't see and I hit that thing like it was an oxygen pump and I was underwater.  I have no fucking will power.  The saddest part to me isn't that I only made it 4 fucking days without smoking some stupid ass vap.  It's that I cared more about my friends messing with me about failing my resolution.  I actually cared more about them knowing I failed then I did about failing in general.  My roommates don't know that I broke my resolution and I know that in the morning tomorrow I will probably be a rat bastard and lie to them if they ask and act like I am some decent human.  I am a poor mannered fool.  

&amp;#x200B;

So the part were I ask for advice.  I guess I want some advice on how to handle the rest of the year in terms of my resolution.  Do I scrap it? Do I chalk this one as a fuck up?  Also any advice on how to become the kind of person that cares more about failing my resolution instead of people knowing I failed.  Obvoiusly I know this is stupid so if the advice is just ""you should care what people think"" thanks but that isn't gonna work.  My slithery snake of a soul is gonna dodge that.  I guess this post is more looking for advice on self appreciation or something like that.  Woah this started a New Years resolution post.  Whatever fuck it I'd love any advice especially if you can relate to this cowardly mentality I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Just want to clarify I'm not depressed or anything serious.  I know many people deal with that and I'm lucky enough to not I am just pissed at myself.  I also know people struggle with real addictions to terrible things that are way stronger than some soft ass vape/cig. So to those people I am sorry if me bitching about nicotine is disrespectful or anything.  I know I sound like a bitch talking about nicotine being to hard for me to quit.  I probably sound like a bitch because right now in life I am a soft, weak, loser of a 'man' and I am gonna have to piss or get off the pot soon in terms of growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very big tough love guy and am hard on myself.  But I respond well to it so don't let my self-deprecation scare you at all.  It's the South Carolina in me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you gals and guys have a great weekend.

296,"TLDR that is also pretty long: will I be considered employable in China with only one year of work experience, six months of unemployment, and one year of language school?

Please assume that by the end of language school, I will be knowledgeable in Python and R, and have the fluency of a Junior high school student in Chinese. Money to fund personal study and living expenses is not an issue as I've saved up enough and am debt-free.

----------------------------

During the six months, I will be studying Chinese in preparation for the start of an intensive language course in China. I'm currently a beginner but want to start off at a good level so I don't waste tuition by going through easy things I could have studied on my own (shapes, colors, etc.)

During that time, I would also put further study into finance (my field) and learn coding (R and Python; hoping to learn enough that I can forego using Excel for big datasets)

I know I can do all these things with a full time job, but I love studying and believe that the results of studying in the time off vs. studying while working will be much greater.

My mind is telling me it would be alright, but I've also read several horror stories about people who quit to travel, pursue their passions, etc. and had a hard time for several years afterwards.

For further information, I graduated from a good school with honors just last year, and have been employed full time in a great local company for the past twelve months. I'll be 25 by the time I'm done with language school.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. Cause it's all my fault. I'm really shy in person and don't show much affection, so whenever he wants to kiss me, I just hesitate and feel even more shy. And I rarely take pictures of myself so whenever he asks a casual pic of me (cause I was on vacation and we were apart), I try my best to take a decent one, but still I rarely send. And that disappoints him (not only that, I'm talking generally), I know it. And that makes me sad and disappointed as well. Again, it's not that I don't want too do all those things. I do wanna kiss him and cuddle with him and make him happy, but I just can't seem to do it, cause I never did these things with anyone &amp; so, it's difficult for me to adjust to all this. He is awesome, smart as hell, kind, sweet and really handsome.

I called her friday and she had me come in and fill out allbthos information, meanwhile two people showed up while i was their wanting interviews as well. 1 i got the mpression was for the job i was taking. 

Just as she was putting me on payroll all of a sudden supposedly their was a government shut down or some such crap that made her haft to wait?

So now im being asked to call again on monday, this seems highly unusual to me.

Am i missing the hint here or what? Im getting the impression she didnt want to hear from me in the first place, but couldn't she just tell me instead of asking me to call her?, she knows im going to call and she will eventually need to hire me or tell me to f-o.

Im frustrated specially after i filled out all this paperwork to be hired. I would rather just be told ""no"" than to be put through this.

My other dilemma is i have consulted someone but their advice was helpful hut also not.
They told me to call her and say i had another job offer and i needed to know of she was actually going to hire me because they wanted to interview me too.

This sounded good at first but im now realizing i dont want it to cost me this job or ruin my chance's because their is no ""other job interview""

300,"I was on my iPad (which I dont ever use) last night and I stumbled into my photo gallery, and noticed some pictures weren't mine. I thought it was strange, so I investigated and figured out that my little sister's (15yo) screenshots from her phone were backing up on my iPad. In deleting pictures from my iPad, I started reading screenshotted conversations of hers. A couple screenshots were texts from her friends asking how she is doing/if shes okay. She kept asking them if they told anyone. I should tell you guys that she also had screenshotted sad quote posts, and I found out she had been cutting herself last summer (she assured me she was feeling better at the time, but I havent talked to her about it since). Anyway, the last text was from one of her friends I dont know and it said ""I didnt tell them what happened at the party. What that boy did to you."" Thus, it seems my little sister was sexually abused/assaulted which led to a period of depression that could still be happening. I'm concerned, but I have no idea how to approach the situation. Should I be direct and ask her? Should I just tell her that her photos are synced to mine? I'm panicking and need help. Any guidance or advice is much appreciated. ",05Jan2019,1

309,"Hello /r/advice. Today I am asking you to help me plan my life. 

I am a 21 year old male, currently living with my parents. I have a girlfriend of the same age who also currently lives at home. We would like to move in together in the next few months (we did live together previously, but I lost my job and we decided to move back home when the lease expired) . We live in Canada. We currently only have very little in our savings accounts but are working on changing that. We would like to have 1-3 children starting in 5-10 years.
We're currently both working minimum wage jobs and finishing our high school diplomas because we initially dropped out due to mental health issues.

The one and only thing I'm truely passionate about is music. Listening to music, reading about music, playing music. I have a band that plays locally and are hoping to go on a small tour soon. We play minimalist rock 'n' roll inspired by The Velvet Underground.

I understand that this band has a niche appeal and will never give me a serious financial return. My plan at the moment is to graduate and go to local university majoring in something that will actually get me employed and minoring in music. 

I'm not certain about what I should major in. I wanted to major in math or physics because I'm capable of doing well in those subjects, find them fascinating, and think they would give me many options for employment. However, I don't think I could handle the workload or stay interested and focused for four years.

At the moment I'm working at a burger joint. I'm considering becoming a night watchman like my father because of the tremendous amount of basically free time in which I could work on songwriting and whatnot. Is this a good plan for my immediate future as I wrap up my high school in the next few months and then move on to university? 

What else should I be doing now for my future? What should I study in uni? I'm not very focused or motivated and I worry university may even be too much for me. Do I have other options? Most importantly, what line of work can support me, and my future small family, while also giving me ample time to play with my band and occasionally go on the road touring for a few weeks?

These are my questions. I'm interested in hearing your suggestions.",05Jan2019,1
311,"Hey there Reddit, I'm currently writing this with the intended purpose of seeking advice on this matter.

A little background of me, I suffer from General Anxiety Disorder, which means that I cannot stop worrying about everything such as how my life will turn out among other things. I also cannot get rid of my past horrible memories and every time I think back it induces a lot of trauma and pain in me (PTSD?). In terms of socialising, I'm a formal speaker unlike most of the guys around my age, I'm extroverted when talking to those I'm comfortable with, but very introverted with people I do not know well especially girls around my age. 

Backstory: There is this girl in my school who used to be my classmate several years back. One day, her father passed on and I had news on it and I decided to comfort and give her my condolences by talking to her, but she mistook my kind intentions for being insensitive, annoying, a piece of shit, attention seeking, the list of negative adjectives go on. It got even worse when my other classmates heard of what she labelled me as and they too started to label me as that as well (since she was rather popular whilst I was a simple guy). She became cold and passive-aggressive towards me for the rest of the time we were classmates.

Looking back, this incident definitely scarred me and did a lot of irreversible damage to my skills in socialising with girls of my age since they keep on misunderstanding me due to my aforementioned way of speaking even though I only have good intentions and try to clarify with them. I sometimes feel that I have to make amends with that girl because I still feel that I might have said something that must have disturbed her in some way.

I really need advice ASAP because now I'm starting to worry about how I will get a girlfriend in the future and whether I will even have one in the first place.",05Jan2019,1

Last night, I had too much to drink and I said some things I shouldn't have said. What I did was that I went on Instagram, flaunted my grades and laughed at my friends that didn't do as well as me. A lot of people saw the story I posted and some were nice enough to call me out for such disgusting behavior.

When I woke up this morning- hungover, I started to realize what I've done and I truly have never been so disgusted with myself in my life- ever. I don't know what to do but feel so ashamed of what I have done and how much of an asshole I've become. I feel so shameful of my egoist arrogant rant and actually cannot believe why I would actually bring myself to say those stuff.

I've since deactivated all my social media accounts and I'm scared. School is starting and I so afraid everyone is going to look at me and think ""That guy is a complete dickhead"". I'm not fearful of being judged that way but because they're probably right. What do I do? I want to be a better person really. I want to be able to find it in me to actually be humble and capable of being genuinely nice but I just can't shake off these feelings of fear, regret, guilt, shame and anxiety which are slowly consuming me because of one disgustingly wrong hubristic rant which I decided to broadcast to everyone for which I cannot even rationalize or comprehend why anyone, let alone myself, would do.

313,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I have a younger brother who is consistently abusive to everyone around him.

A little backstory:

We come from a quite privelaged family and we are constantly travelling. My parents work I  the United Nations so we are consistently changing schools. My parents spend countless of hours working ensuring we have the best. I love my parents very much.

But recently I have begun to fear for them. As this is my last 3 months before i leave i have slightly become detached from my family, preparing applications, studying and such. I noticed something I hadn't noticed before. Looking back my brother has always been the smartest in the family with the highest performance and grades. He was always misbehaved and my parents were trying hard to correct that with him.

Recently in the past few months I have realized how psychologically abusive he has become. He constantly gets what he wants. He cares for no ones feelings. He caused my mother to cry and Mather to lose his temper countless times. He plays mind games with everyone and I can see it is taking a toll on my parents. If he doesn't get it his way then no one will.

Now my fear comes in what will happen to this family and to my parents when I leave. Now i try to keep him in check and help my parents as much as I can. He raised his hand at my father yesterday. I thought he was gonna hit him. But he didn't. At least not yet. He keeps threatening to go to the police with abuse charges if we do anything to him. I fear for my parents as I will be leaving the country to continue my life and studies.

316,"Hey guys, just a little backstory...
I'm currently 15 (16 in less than 2 months), I'm a male sophomore. Ever since birth, I have felt this lack of true connection with not only my peers, but with my own family. To clarify, it's not that I don't love them, its more like there's this wall between us that they can't see and that I pretend isn't there. This has led me to live a life that feels phony. I have no problem talking to people or making ""friends"", it's just that the relationships I form feel fake and superficial. Long story short I go home feeling the same amount of isolation and loneliness as before. 

I also have problems being myself, due to the fact that I don't know who I really am. I put on this more social, funny persona when in public. I adjust the way I behave based on who I am around. So that the other person(s) can feel more comfortable around me. I try to tell myself that these ""personas"" are just exaggerated versions of who ""the real me"" is, but I can't help but fear that I have no real personality, this makes me feel quite empty inside...

(additional info)
About a year and a half ago I was in a romantic relationship that changed my life. For the first time I felt connected with someone else. It was glorious and felt too good to be true, and that turned out to be the case. So now I'm back at stage 1. Feeling isolated from everyone. 

I don't know if it's some form of social anxiety, I doubt it. I don't know much about social anxiety but heres some info I can give that may or may not help determine that: I don't get nervous in social situations and I don't really care about what others think of me. I just think It'd feel nice to feel like I'm not alone for once despite having all these great people in my life. 

 I'm not the type to try and self diagnose myself with all these mental illnesses or even talk about this to trusted love ones and whatnot so that's why I'm asking a bunch of strangers on the internet. 

I hope I explained that sufficiently in my jumbled thoughts. I just don't want to feel this way anymore yakno? If needed I can explain further, just ask. I'm willing to answer anything at this point if it helps.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He called it 'educational'.

325,"So here's the background story. My now ex-girlfriend and I knew each other for several years. We always hung around each other and where friends at first. As the years pass by we start to grow into liking each other. I thought we would grow old together with our son. 

  
After being together for almost two years we started to think about having children. A year later and our beautiful boy is born. During the time she was pregnant with our son I started noticing some minor details. She ignored all my bedroom advances. When I wasn't home I would later hear that she had some male friends over the floor. She would only tell me that she had friends over, if I asked what she did the previous day. At first I did not give it much thought. She did have some male friends, so I wasn't going to make a problem of it. 

  
Some months later during the pregnancy (she was around six months pregnant), I asked here if she would like to have a date night. Go out to the movies, or go for dinner somewhere. She thought it would be nice, but at each 'date' night she wanted to bring some people we both knew, all male friends. I wanted to make her happy and didn't want make a big fuss of these things because of our son still developing in her womb. This went on for several months, and we rarely had a night with just the two of us.

  
Skipping to the part after our son is born. Here I started to notice bigger details of what could be going on. When our son was 7 month old, I would go out from time to time. She insisted because I worked so hard I could get a night off. So I agreed. This happened several times and each of the given times I would go out, she would ask me: 'Are you going to spend the night there?'. I thought it was a strange thing to ask but did not give it much more thought. One night, a friend, brought me home, while I said to her that would be sleeping over at a friend. I come home to find the door locked, she never locks the door, never.

  
While our son was growing older, she began to become more negative towards the outside world. She only sat on the couch and didn't say anything. When asking her about how work was, she would reply with a single answer; 'Nothing much' that were the only conversations we had. When our son started to grow accustomed to his bed time routine, we were having more time to spend which each other (he slept from 7pm to 7am.). I wanted to make her happy. Any problems that she had, I tried to resolve them. She is a great mother, so I gave her compliments, compliments like 'Your a great mother'. I tried talking to her about our relation and spilled my thoughts and observations. Told her that it would be best if she would tell me what's on her mind. She did not want to tell me anything cause accordingly to her there weren't any major problems.

  
During the time of her pregnancy and while, our son was growing older with the months. I gave advances in the bedroom, all the advances that were given were declined. Perhaps there was something that made her not feel loved. She said there was nothing that didn't made her feel loved.  
When our son was around one year old, I couldn't handle it anymore. Being in a relationship without love, having no interest in me and constantly getting told that I didn't do it correctly. I talked to her about our relationship and asked her if we should see a relationship therapist. She said that our relation could not be saved. After she spook those words we ended it.

  
Some months pass in which I would ask her almost every day to make a plan for co-parenting. All under the eyes of a mediator. When the question: 'What do you think of this mediator' got raised she would tell me a general excuse or would say that she would look at it later that day. Six months later we found a mediator, but when we would confer over a date she would still make use of a general excuse or postpone it. In the six months it took into finding a mediator, I found out that she was sexting with someone unknown to me. I read things like 'he will be away soon, so you can come over during that time'. These messages were from when our son was 4 months old. Sadly I couldn't browse farther back into the message history. When confronting her about these messages she would say that nothing happened. Which I find hard to believe.

  
Our son looks a bit like me, but I still feel uncertain that nothing happened. Because her behavior, making up excuses and the things that happened during our relationship. I am uncertain if I should do a paternity test.  


TLDR; Had a relationship, two years in we start talking about having children. She gets pregnant and doesn't want to do things together anymore (going to the movies, dinner). All the bedroom advances are ignored. When our son is about a year old, I ended things because it didn't work out. Start talking to her about going to a mediator to draw up a co-parenting plan. She tries to evade every attempt to confer for setting a date to go to the mediator. Later on I find out she was sexting with an unknown (unknown to me) male-friend. Read things like 'he will be away soon, so you can come over during that time'. Now thinking of doing a paternity test.

326,"Alright so before this post makes me look like an asshole let me explain. We currently live with his mom. I’ve always had a feeling something just wasn’t right with her because she acted strange and I would hear her talking to herself. My boyfriend just wrote it off as his mom being goofy but I don’t think he was ever aware that it’s not a normal thing to do. I’ve known people with mental illness and so I kinda know what to look for. Anyways, I was looking for a pen about a month ago and stumbled across some medications his mom takes. She takes a large dose of an antipsychotic and antidepressant daily. I know it’s none of my business but here is what really gets to me. 

He has been really struggling lately. He keeps crying to me saying he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him and why he feels like this. It’s been happening a lot recently. I asked him if he has any family history of mental illness and he said no and he was 100% sure. I am so hesitant because I want to tell him about the situation with his mom because clearly him or any of his other brothers have no idea and I know stuff like that can be genetic. What makes me even more mad is he cries to her saying he doesn’t know what’s wrong and she says nothing is. They are muslim so she lights some incense to “get rid of the bad spirits” and tells him to pray. It makes me soo angry because I know he needs to see a psychiatrist first and foremost. When I brought that up she goes no they will just give him pills that make him crazy. 

So reddit, what do I do? I hate watching him struggle. I told him to make a psychiatrist appointment anyways and ignore his mom but do I tell him about the antipsychotics? I know it’s none of my business but i’m legitimately worried for him. Also, if I did tell him i’m risking ruining our relationship and my relationship with his mom if he confronted her. ",05Jan2019,1
327,"I won't beat around the bush here but I work in a very small organization and one of my ""colleagues"" is visibly masturbating under his desk, he's too brazen to realize that the 3 - 4 inch slat under his desk puts his ""show"" on full display from certain angles. 

I'm a male as well and it is... distracting at minimum, disgusting at median and face punchingly stupid / nucking futs to even have to bring this sort of topic up!

He does what he does, several times a day, seemingly with no end. I'm sure this is a case of masturbation addiction but I DON'T CARE, how no one else (doubtful) has noticed (and not reported it, I assume) is just mystifying. 

He doesn't manage anyone but he is in a unique position of quasi-authority, he has the ear of certain members of management and it is just making me feel insanely uncomfortable. 

I mean, how does one report something like this, which is entirely and completely odd?

I have stood idly by for months, a bad work relationship with this particular person is a ticket to the unemployment office (or so I'm led to believe, he's gotten multiple people fired for ""catching"" them with porn in their Internet history.

As we are in the same department, we both directly report to the same person and I just don't know what he will do, I haven't been at this place of employment for long and I'm just afraid that reporting this will simply result in my termination.

330,"Okay. I live in an apartment complex. My apartment window is nearest to our little parking lot, and the windows are basically made of paper. I hear people have conversations. I can hear the rustling of plastic bags, that's how things the windows are. Normally that's fine. I'm not going to stop people from talking outside or anything. 

But I have this new neighbor (I think it's them? I haven't been able to see who it is in the car but it's one of my neighbors). Every morning this person gets in their car and when they do so they set off the alarm. This car happens to have a very VERY loud alarm. This is different than a normal car alarm. Multiple percussive beeps that shock me awake every morning. Like a beep and a bang at the same time. It's awful. My body physically will not let me go back to sleep after. 

And I don't mean like it beeps to unlock. I mean like the burglar alarm. Over and over multiple times. (My mom's car would go off like that if you used the key to get into it instead of the electronic key. I think that's what it is? It stops when he turns the car on.)

My schedule is one that I tend to go to sleep late and wake up late. But this person gets in their car around 7 every morning. Including weekends, and it is disrupting my sleep. (Bad health related things happen when I don't get enough sleep. I neeeeed sleep.) What do I do? I've thought about leaving a note on the car explaining that the alarm is loud and it's right outside my window, so if he could for courtesy try to get in his car without setting off the alarm or at least park somewhere not right outside a window (still right outside the building, just a few spaces over). That seems reasonable to me, but I know how other people are. I could also talk to the rental company and ask them to leave a note to everyone on their doors asking them to be mindful but they're kind of assholes.

331,"Backstory: Y’know that one true friend that is there for most of your life? He is always supportive, kind, understanding and is like a brother from another mother? I’ve known him [Nickname: Jack] for nearly 13 years now. We met in high school and have kept in touch since. His wife was born with a large cancerous tumor inside her left lung. She wasn’t expected to live past 2 weeks because she was too young to have surgery. She, against all odds, and by the grace of God, managed to live up to the age of 9 when they said it was safe enough to do the surgery and take out the tumor. All went well and she pulled through. She lived through her childhood and into her adulthood which is when she met Jack. They were happily married for 8 years until she unexpectedly died. Back in 2015, she was diagnosed with lung cancer again. The cancerous tumor that was removed had cropped back up again. She was receiving successful chemotherapy and was being treated until, just last month, she stopped breathing in the night. A blood clot had made its way from her lung to her brain, and caused an aneurysm. The doctors told us that she died instantly and painlessly. She went to be with her Heavenly Father.

Jack took her death really hard. Harder than I have ever seen before. He stopped responding to my messages, doesn’t answer the phone, and just recently, I found out that he had stopped going to work. When his boss called me (I’m his emergency contact) and told me he hadn’t shown up for work that week, I panicked and rushed over to his house. Thankfully, he hadn’t taken his own life. We talked until 11:30 PM and I told him I had to go to work the next day. I went home after that.

What do I do? He has been devastated by the loss of his wife. He told me that he can’t find any reasons to keep going. I didn’t know what to tell him, and I felt like I was talking out of my ass. I don’t think I left any lasting change in our conversation. How do I help him in a way that is helpful?

***/Just a warning: Self harm + Suicide mentions\\***

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there. I am a sixteen year old high school student suffering from depression and separation anxiety.

Around a few days ago, my last single friend managed to get into a relationship with somebody they really love. Of course I am very happy for them, why wouldn't I be? However it was then and there that I realized that I am the only one of my friends left who isn't in a relationship which made me feel extremely sad and lonely.

I am honestly not sure where this feeling comes from, so I need a bit of help.

Two years ago, I was in a relationship. The relationship ended because of my partner cheating on me. Because my mental health was so horrible at the time I attempted suicide and started cutting again because I felt so useless. After being discharged from the psychiatric hospital I decided to focus on myself as I couldn't bring myself to talk or trust anybody for a long while. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my ex-lover I haven't craved for a relationship since which is why my sudden feelings of wanting to be in a relationship again are so strange to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal?

Is this temporary?

I am not sure what to do with my feelings...",05Jan2019,1
334,"My boyfriend (23) and I (22/F) have been together for almost 6 years. During the first 5+ years all of our friends were smoking weed but neither of us had any desire to do so. I liked the fact that he didn't get caught up in it all the other guys in our friend group did/have.

Anyway, he went away on a boy's trip about 3 months ago for his birthday. He mentioned that they spent the whole weekend being stoned the whole time. I didn't care, he had fun and it didn't effect me so whatever. Around the same time we moved into our own place together.  

In the first week of us living together he started smoking it when he had friends over, it was a little weird cause I just wasn't used to it but I told myself that there was nothing wrong with him trying it and I shouldn't be controlling about it.  

Week by week he started smoking more and more and now he is stoned every day.  We've been off from work for the last two weeks and I have been out and about and go to bed way earlier than him and still saw him having a bong 5+ times a day just while I was around.  I don't know if this is a lot? The second he gets in the door from work he's on it.  

I've now told him I'm worried about it and it stresses me out. Especially cause he talks to me about wanting to get married and start a family.  I just find it sooo unattractive (which he just gets offended about)  but when he's stoned I feel like he's just looking through me and he is slow to respond and just annoying.  At first when he was just doing it a little bit it was fine,  he was loving and affectionate, no problems - now I feel like he's never not baked. 

He gets shitty at me anytime I try to talk about it.
He says I just need to trust him that he knows what he's doing and that things aren't going to get out of hand. I have taken a step back because I'm sick of trying to explain why I hate it and I also acknowledge that he needs to make his own decisions. 

In the meantime I just don't like feeling like I'm being unreasonable.. The fact I don't like him doing it isn't enough to make him stop or cut back.  He just gets annoyed because ""there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and I'm not addicted, I just enjoy doing it"" I have tried marijuana once and didnt like it so I can't tell if I'm being unreasonable or if his usage is over the top.

336,"  (Just some quick info about everything, we’re in highschool, the guy’s mom died awhile ago and his stepmother is pretty controlling-I’ve only seen him twice outside of school in four months). 
 I’ve been dating this guy for about four months and just within the first month of dating him he was starting to act like a dick to my friends. I didn’t realize this at first because I believed he was a great guy and all, but after a couple months my friends and I went out to eat and they confessed all the stuff that was happening. One of my friends said he was calling her fat, porch monkey (she’s mixed) ext. my second friend said that he was calling her idiot, bitch, ext. My second friend told me it got so bad that he’s made her in an extremely bad mental state. I apologized for him and after that I told him all the hurtful things he’s been doing...
 It seemed to work for a week but then they were back telling me he didn’t get better and he’s still doing the same things. Each time I confront him and he tells me the same things, “they’re just annoying.” Which, granted, they can be but that doesn’t give him an excuse to belittle my friends. He’s also super clingy and he talks about how he wants to marry me (we’ve dated for four months and after two weeks he said, “I love you.”) 
  So now I want to breakup with him but he’s told me multiple times before that he’d kill himself if I left. I really don’t know what to do because when he says that stuff I’m pretty sure he’s serious. He has cuts on his arm from where he attempted in the past. He says I’m the only thing that makes him happy and nothing else does. I’ve tried to get him into other things to make him happy but he says nothing works. It’s just too much pressure for me right now (I’m 15). I’ve already told my parents and he’s gone to a therapist/seen the school counselor. I’m just stuck at this point because I really don’t want to be in a relationship now.

I wasn't all that close to anyone but I still missed the community. 
What I then did might've been wrong of me to do, but I can't turn back. I joined on an alternative account that I made. I started talking there a lot and got closer to people that I only just kinda knew existed before that. But nobody knows it's me on the alternative account. 
There's one person in particular that has gotten closer to me, but they only know me as the identity related to my alt account. They did know me before that, but we weren't close at all. I want to move forward with that person, as friends. But it doesn't feel right that they don't know that I am another person than they think I am.

339,"I started my job in March after the owner of the company approached me at my previous job. While in the transition process there were some promises made that have not come to fruition. I have gotten the job I was promised but it has not come with the compensation that was discussed. I was told that by moving careers I would take a pay cut initially, I started at $35000. However it was on the understanding that after 6 months of training with the person that held the position previously, I would hold “the most valuable position in the company, and it gets paid like it”. The previous job holder was supposedly taking a promotion at our parent company and moving out of town. Well, I have since learned that the owner is having a long going relationship with said person. And when I was hired they were broken up but have since reconciled. She gets all credit for anything I do and shows no signs of leaving the company now. We get our raises yearly and for mine I got moved to salary with only the cost of living raise , 3% or roughy 76 cents per hour. I now can’t even get paid for the overtime I work. I feel like I’m in a worse position than before. And I’m stuck in a hard place due to personal relationships. To make the situation stickier the owner has since become a family friend that I have to see at tailgates, birthday parties etc. every weekend. While his wife texts me at work asking about the “relationship” he has with my supervisor. I’m thinking about going in and demanding something change, what do you all think?

347,"A little back story that led me to this decision;

When I was 17, i graduated high school and went straight to college for 3 and a half years. I eventually started getting confused about what i was in college for and fell into depression about it, so i decided that I should take a break from it for about 6 months. My mother wasn’t exactly supportive of my decision and couldn’t really wrap her head around why i would want to leave basically in my senior year. My step-father was the total opposite, being very supportive because he made the same decision when he was younger. 

So from about Aug-Dec 2017 I worked full time and then in Jan 2018 I started back up in school again full time. At this time i wasn’t working because from past experiences in college working part time and going to school full time wasn’t ideal and I couldn’t handle it. So I decided not work and just focus on my school work. Fast forward to the end of my spring semester and throughout the summer of 2018, I was not working but also couldn’t find a job, was on a few interviews, but still couldn’t find a job. So i decided to contact my previous job and they accepted me back. Fast forward again to today, I’ve been working and going to school but only doing part time for both and it’s been working for me, but I also know how much I make does not help my situation in anyway. I don’t want to sound like a typical millennial but I do pay a few bills and with what I make paired with some money that I inherited from a dead relative, i still don’t have enough to save up. 

To add, my family also just got a dog, in which I was against because of the attention they need and how much money they can cost and was ultimately outvoted and I now find my self paying for certain things for the dog, which I’m not against  but I didn’t want the dog in the first place and it doesn’t help me save up money like I want to. Also as I’m currently writing this post, my mom specifically decided that I should start paying rent... which I also can’t afford to again, start saving up. 

I’m now 22 and just really confused, my mom is so encouraging for me to move out and start my own life but i don’t think she understands at all that that I am financially unable to do so. I know I can talk to my mom about how I feel about this, but my mom is very hard to get through and I know she won’t understand me.

It’s difficult to explain. Especially as I type this on my phone past midnight in rage that has last about three weeks.

I work in a library and the dean gives all this preferential treatment to the librarians. Now I’m actually getting my masters in library science right now and no disrespect to anyone who has it but it’s not rocket science. Anyone with time and money can do it.

Back to the point, not only do they get special treatment, but they treat me like garbage/second tier employee. We get information months later. My opinions and ideas are never listened to. Everything I want to do implement has to be asked to my supervisor who has no clue about my job and then she in turn just asks the dean...like I don’t get it. The they underuse me, I like many of you can do so much with just a smartphone, much more then they can do but instead I get treated like dirt.

I’ve told everyone at my job this even my supervisor but it’s really the dean who needs to here it. She is the one who employees the hierarchy and maintains it.

I’ve only been there a year and I’ve tried to just roll with the punches and think big picture like just finish my degree as I have plenty of free time at my job, but I just can’t be like that. I care too much and I don’t like being treated like this. Especially when the librarians abuse the system like leave several hours early or just hang out in their office all day.

What should I do? Is it just me? I really want to tell the dean but I’m pretty much attacking her so idk what will happen.

Something everyone will be hearing about within a year.  I even foresee super bowl adds.  Within a couple years will likely over take largest competitor that leads the industry now with household named products and services.

Ok enough about the startup.  Friend tells me I'd likely get over $130k all benefits paid plus a moving package.  I would be working in an incubator (Google that if you don't know what it is).  I haven't discussed with wife yet.  She has a low opinion of my lofty goals.  She doesn't want to move again.

352," 

I  don't know even know where to start with this one. So, I'll start where  I think this started. Around April/May last year I  was quite low about  leaving university and not having anything to do after I graduated. I  mean, really low. Obviously, I applied for jobs/internships, even amidst  the last stretch of my dissertation piece, so I would be prepared. Side  note (this also becomes relevant to the story): my parents are really  terrible when it comes to understanding my emotional wellbeing. My  Father is void of emotion and I've never once spoke to him about how I  feel about things (whether big or small), my Mother engages but often  turns things into an argument. Like, she doesn't think I should show  emotion or vulnerability, and turns it back on me as if I don't have a  right to be upset or feel low.

During  my job application process, I received a few rejections, and a couple  of interviews. One that I focused on in depth was a three-month  internship in Amsterdam. During my break, and just before I left  university completely, I had a Skype interview with the company in  Amsterdam and they got back quickly and told me that I'd been accepted.  The only thing is that it would require financial support from parents  to live there. Cut a long story short: my parents never gave a clear  answer as to whether they would help. There was a lot of gaslighting  from my Mum's part and essentially silence from my Father. Literally a  week before I was meant to start, even after arguments and going back on  promises, my Mum said she'd support me if I found somewhere to live.  Giving me a short amount of time to look, which was incredibly  difficult. Obviously I was beyond grateful, was never told where the  money was from, but was really grateful. To add another difficult layer  to the story, I also heard from a company in London who I progressed  with to a final stage interview for a full-time job, the catch was that I  needed to be in Amsterdam at the time of the interview. I really wanted  to hear what my parents had to say about my options, since the job  wasn't solidfied whereas the internship was. I didn't want to be in a  situation where I literally had nothing. Personally, I felt like my  parents were both really bad communicators and always tiptoed around  giving a clear answer that I needed to hear. At this point, it sounds  like I am being needy, but parents are all I have and I needed there  advice on this situation. All in all, it came down to me going to  Amsterdam and skipping the interview.

The  internship was great and the experience was nice, but only three  months. I was back to square one when I came back and had to start  looking and working hard on creating CVs and looking for jobs. There are  no opportunities where I live, it's a small town and it's a horrible  place to live quite frankly. Both my parents know I don't want to live  here long-term, even saying things like 'you can move to London when you  get a job' and 'commuting to London is easy, everyone does it' to help  me with decisions in the past. Basically, after a few interviews  (outside of my hometown), my Dad did suggest that it would be hard for  them to financially support by moving away instantly. My Mother,  however, would often contradict him (though I'm not sure if she was  telling me what I wanted to here). The fact is that they both let me go  to the interviews, with one in London being the one I was ultimately  accepted for. Afterwards, silence from both of them. My Mum basically  told me to forget about looking for a place, that rail prices were too  high, etc. To enjoy the Festive period, I put into the back of my mind.  This past weekend my Mother, again, gave straightforward insuinations  that I could move to London. Even looking at hotels and pricing things  up for me. I spent the past two days (when I start on Monday) looking  and contacting people about rooms, when I queried her about being able  to find a place. What I feared would happen came true, she went back on  her word, told me she wouldn't be able to pay, and that the budget was  really low (a budget, she and I both knew would not be able to provide  accomodation). I literally broke because I couldn't believe my emotions  were being played with. If the answer was always no, all I needed was a  firm and straight forward answer. Instead my hopes were up and then they  were trodden on at the last minute. I'd put SO much effort in arrangng  viewings and literally taking an early mroning train so I could make  this work.

I  feel grateful for what my parents have done for me, but I despair the  emotional toll it's taken on me and how much of a burden I'm made to  feel. What I needed was clarity and understanding, but instead my Mum  likes to kick me while I'm down nd make things difficult. Even bringing  things up like how I have no money (which this job would've helped with  and I obviously would've paid any money I owed them, including the  Amsterdam trip back-as she's used this against me in arguments, telling  me I have to pay it back when it was never said that I would have to  (again, I would, it's just the inconsistency and lack of clarity that  fucks up my mind) and that I can't go back to my university location (as  I would sometimes when arguments got too much) anymore.

My  mental state broke last night, I'm over-analysing this whole last year.  About how I should've went to the job interview in London instead of  Amsterdam. How my Mother is using my as emotional playtoy to raise my  expectations and drag me down at the last minute. I can't bare to look  at her or even speak, and my mental health is at an all time low. I  can't speak to anyone, I don't know what to do about this job that I'm  supposed to start on Monday and I can't see any brightness in the  future. I genuinely don't know what to do.

Also:  I 'd like to add that My Mum had also told firends of mine, and family  members, that I had got this job. So, basically revealed that I had a  new job to go to, which surprised me because I knew there would be a  chance it might not be able to work out. So, now I have to face the  embarrasment of telling family and friends that it didn't work out, when  it could've been kept quiet by my Mother. We're currently not speaking  at all, since my Mum always tries to one-up in playing the victim when, I  personally feel, that she's the one who is being emotionally abusive  and dragging me through the mud instead of providing straightforward  answers. She has a horrible tendecy, and dreadful past, of big lies and  dishonesty. Pretending that conversations assoicated with this situation  exsisted when they never, telling me last-minute information that she  knew would mean this wouldn't work out. This is also the woman who said she couln't attend my graduation because the dog couldn't be left alone, which means I couldn't go as my Dad was the only person who could take me. Again, he was silent on this.

All  I wanted was to be successful and do people proud, but what it's caused  is emotional anguish and a terrible relationship and outlook on my  parents, where I feel like I've seen the worst of them and want nothing  more to do with them.

353,"I live in the Northeast US, and have for my whole life. I'm recently divorced (as of October) with two kids (he has custody). I see my kids whenever I can, but that's not often. I have issues with depression and anxiety, but it's slowly getting better.

I have seriously contemplated moving across the country (Utah) recently. For a year. I don't wanna permanently leave, because I don't want to be away from my kids for that long, but I need a change of scenery.

354,My moms boyfriend always spends time at my house (moms house) he practically lives here. My issue with this is he has a son so it just bothers me that he would be okay with spending the holidays over here and not with his kid.  The reason why I know he doesn't really see his own kid is because he works in the mornings and gets off work around 4pm and he is always here at 4pm. Even this Christmas/new years/thanksgiving he spent it with us. Am I wrong for worrying about this persons character? I already told my mom how I felt about it..but then my brother said I shouldn't complain about it....but idk what do u guys think,05Jan2019,1
355,"I’m in need of some advice on how to handle this situation. Yesterday, two Great Pyrenees very aggressively charged at me and my Australian Shepherd (45 lbs) while walking on the street past their yard. The more aggressive one was easily over 120lbs, no exaggerations. Both dogs were much bigger than my dog, who was playful and excited through the whole ordeal, expecting a new play buddy. 

Some background info.. I live in a little neighborhood that is at the bottom of a hill and kind of sandwiched between two very busy main roads in our city. There are about 6 blocks that I have to work with that are safe even though most don’t have sidewalks. We weave in and around the alleys and streets. We are pretty limited space to walk but I try to do at least a mile each day and then follow up with fetch in our big yard. there are no sidewalks on the streets heading up the hill so it gets a little dangerous to walk up the hill any further than a few blocks because there are a lot of blind spots and it’s a narrow road. 

Also should note I already have to avoid the front of my house because the neighbor across the street has two pit bulls that are aggressive and rarely on leash and have no fence. They are not very responsible or reasonable people, so I just avoid it because I don’t even think a conversation or a call to the police (I’ve tried) will help. 

We’ve been doing this for several weeks. Yesterday while walking two blocks up from our house two HUGE (over 100lbs easily) Great Pyrenees charged at us. They clearly were getting shocked by an electric fence and shock collar and one retreated when that happened. But the larger of the two continued to charge at us while snarling and growling. I was afraid to continue walking more than a few feet at a time because when we moved the dog charged more. I started yelling and after about 30 seconds the owner ran out from behind the house but could not control the dog. He kept apologizing while I was still just afraid to move and I told him I didn’t want to move until he had his dog. He never did gain control of the dog but we were able to slowly move away while the owner attempted to get the dog out from the middle of the street. The dog was getting shocked intermittently during this time because he would make a different sound and wince, but it did not make him go back to the yard. 

I was so upset and immediately ordered Halt! Dog pepper spray on amazon when I returned. I knew better and knew I should carry that with me and I’ll never make that mistake again. But honestly this dog was so big I don’t even know if it would have helped. 

So here is where I need advice.. do I make a visit to this house today? I would like to tell them that clearly the shock collar is not an effective way to keep your very large dog from leaving your property. He broke through it two different times during this event and was on the street charging us. My fiancé thinks I shouldn’t go knock and that I should just avoid that house. But it’s on a corner with a front and back yard which means that eliminates two side streets and the street that runs beside it. Plus we turned in the alley across the street when we left and could see straight down to the owner still trying to get control of the dog. That doesn’t leave us much walking area for us. I’d love to hop in the car and walk him elsewhere but I only have about an hour because I have to go back to work, so during the week that’s not doable. 

I’m sorry for the huge wall of text but I’m upset and not sure what to do at this point. Any advice would be appreciated. ",05Jan2019,1
356,"Here’s the current situation. I work 8-5 daily, he goes to school and gets home at 4. My 2yr old is in daycare (3 houses down) and my wife works all kinds of weird hours. He’s at home alone for an hour after school; the sitter is close and we also have awesome neighbors. 

My son has my old iPhone. I set him up with an app where he can text and call over WiFi which works, just not consistently. If he ever needs something and my wife and I are not available, he has a lot of other options.

He’s been staying the night at a friends house once or twice a month for a while but they don’t have WiFi (none of my business to ask why). He asks his friends mom to text/call us whenever something is needed.

I don’t feel comfortable not being able to text him or vice versa. This alone would say, yep, get him a phone. 

Here’s the issue:

He uses his phone like a game system. Plays fortnight along with all the other apps trending. I have a password on his phone so he has to ask each time so that’s my fault and I accept it. I’m worried he’ll “forget” to connect to WiFi and eat our data. 

He’s responsible, for a 9 year old. That being said, he still does the things you’d expect a kid to do. I’ll talk to him, he’ll be good about things but a week down the road he’ll “forget” the rules.

Do I get him on our plan and ban phone games? Do I just make the best of our current situation since it’s mostly working? Some parenting advice would be awesome since this is the first time I’ve been in this situation.

He’s not going to the sitter for an hour because she’ll charge us (yep, that kind of person, otherwise she’s really cool and takes awesome care of our 2yr old). My family is out of the picture entirely, my wife’s family has their own jobs and stuff, so family support for an hour isn’t available. Lastly, his school does offer after school care but it is a significant distance away in relation to my job, our house, and everything else; I’d rather not consider that an option.",05Jan2019,1

361,"So I have three roommates: my best friend (this is our second year living together in this unit) and a couple who moved in earlier this year. According to the couple that moved in, their room is always very hot, so they want to keep the AC on at all times. (This has been true from Auguat until now.) This was fine earlier in the lease, but we're currently in January. The temperature has been fluctuating between 30 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 10 degrees Celsius) for the past two or so months, and consistently between 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit for the past few days.

Best friend and I don't want to end up footing a massive electrical bill, as it frankly seems kind of ridiculous to cool the apartment when it's practically freezing outside. Normally, we split the power bill four ways; they each split the cost of their room. 

The couple is convinced that their room is just hot because it's on the interior of the building, while my best friend and I's rooms are on the exterior of the building. My best friend is convinced it's because they keep a monstrous gaming computer in there running at all times, and that they don't keep the door open enough to circulate air out of the room. I don't think we had these issues with the guy who lived with us last year.

Any advice on fixing the temperature disparity or helping me address the social aspects of this situation would be greatly appreciated. I'm currently in the process of contacting the landlord to try to get information on the building layout; there could be an extra factor that we're missing that's causing the room to retain heat.",05Jan2019,1

363,"i've liked my best friend since three years. i'm making the feelings die down now and it's going pretty good, i guess(and hope).  
it started with a little crush; he was a new-comer and seemed lonely so i approached him in a friendly manner to find out he was very nice person and interested in knowing me. since he was new in our class and older than most of us, he stayed quiet mostly and barely knew anything about the environment. we had similar interests and personalities so we fit together really well and always had each other's backs n shit. we liked and disliked the same things and shared our problems + gave each other advice. he was/is an exceptionally good person and my stupid little crush soon developed into much serious feelings.  
i was CRAZY for him the first year and i used to get reallly jealous and stuff every time some other girl followed him on Instagram and he followed back. i tried my best to not let it show since i wasn't his girlfriend and i did not own him. i guess it worked well since he never actually knew i liked him, except 2 times when i talked about us and how grateful i am for him and he deserves better(which made him think i like him?), to which he replied that relationships are risky  and complex and he does not want to loose me in one. i agreed with whatever he used to say because i didn't want him to think i like him. i don't know why i do so.  
anyway, he was never really good at conversations and i was eager to know him and his life so i made a fake Instagram account to follow the people, who weren't our mutuals, and know how he is with them. i felt terrible and guilty doing so hence i deleted the account after a week or two. he never found out. he did bring it up once, how some strange girl followed him, and i brushed off the topic.  
that was nearly 3 years ago. i used to go out of my way to help him, and i still do. i make his notes, sometimes, and send him supportive texts regularly so he feels good about himself.  
he takes me for-granted sometimes and it hurts but i force myself to get over it. i feel like im the one who mostly invests more in this friendship. it may seem like he does nothing but he does a lot, too. it's just that i'm the one who gives more and that bothers me some time. then i remind myself that i do it out of love and how much he means to me and it fills me up with warmness. i think of the things he has done for me, too.  
i used to get affected deeply by all of his actions; he could make or ruin my day without even knowing. it really pissed me off how i let one person, who somewhat crashed into my life, be so important to me.  
i forced myself to focus on his bad habits. it did ruin my mood, sometimes, but it convinced me that he wasn't the perfect person that i thought he was and that i could find better people. i avoided him sometimes and made myself busy with other stuff. i hated myself for doing so but i knew i was limiting my own growth by being so dependent on him for my happiness and making every decision  of MY LIFE by considering whether he would like it or not.  
i tried making new friends and now i'm over 65% of the feelings i guess. sometimes i feel like he likes me back and i can sense my feelings pouring back into my heart.  
i'm too much of a pussy to confess my feelings since he's brushed the topic off twice + he dated someone last year + he blocked me every where and avoided me irl when i joked about liking him (it was a joke circulating on twitter and i thought he knew so i sent him a text saying i like him the non-platonic way. he got anxious, i told him it was a joke and apologized and he blocked me lol.  
i don't know whether i should completely get over him or wait for him to like me back similarly someday and maybe give dating a try?

The building and the area it’s located in leaves a lot to be desired.

380,"As of yesterday I am in a weird situation. Myself and my buddy (we will call him J) both work for a maintenance company. Part of what the company does is contract us out to fleets for maintenance. 
This means we travel to the fleet’s location and spend the whole workday there making sure their equipment is up and running. 

When I first started doing work for this fleet about a year ago, there was another experienced technician working as the foreman. Shortly after I arrived the foreman had to transfer to another state due to family matters. I was then promoted to foreman. That’s when the parent company sent J to come work with me at this fleet. We have both been with the parent company almost 5yrs, we are the same age but J is far better technical than me. 
It was nice to have someone so experienced under me so I could give him direction on what needs done while I handle more of the customer relations and money aspect of the operation. 

Fast forward about three months and I recommended to my supervisors that J get a promotion to TechA, which is the top tier and highest paid technician level. I was told yes. So then I told J he was getting a promotion. Then corporate came back and said no, they couldn’t justify a promotion since the fleet we work on is practically brand new. This really made J upset. Understandably. 

Shortly after a tech from a different fleet was fired. They ask J to fill the position but he still wouldn’t be promoted. He said yes. Then out of nowhere, I get a call from my supervisor saying he wants me to go to the fleet J said he would take. So in front of J, I said, “I thought J was going to that location?” After some back and forth between the supervisors they decide that J would be the one to end up going. 

After J leaves, they send me a newbie. He is 19yr old with almost zero experience in the field. Things got really hectic when he arrived. He requires much more training, direction and borderline micromanagement. I express to my supervisors that since J left things are much harder for me and even though I just had gotten a good raise a couple months ago, I felt like I deserved another. My supervisor comes back a few days later and says, “Good news! We talked to corporate and we are just going to make you a TechA.” This is far more of a raise than I was anticipating or even asking for. 

I honestly have no clue how to handle this. J 100% deserved that promotion more than I did. Both our families live far away from blood relatives so we often go on double dates with our wives and we hang out quite a bit out of work. 
I fear J will think I somehow orchestrated this. Again, it was not my intention to get a promotion. I just asked for a pay raise. 

I feel like he might quit if he finds out but I also feel like I’m lying to my friend. 
Should I tell J about the promotion?

However, she harassed me multiple times, once coming up to me and calling me a c\*nt because she believed I was stealing him away from her, leaving notes on my door, and spreading mean spirited rumors about me being a few.

It's an interactive class and we'd more than likely be group together at some point. She's made my life a nightmare. I get anxiety just at the prospect of her being near me, let alone having to touch me. I don't know what to do. Should I email my professor and ask not to be grouped with her? Or should I drop the class and sign up for an 8am class instead? I don't know what to do but it's giving me such a spike in anxiety that I'm freaking out. I don't want to miss out on an easy class I'd love, but I also don't know how to coexist in a room with her without hurting my mental health. Whats the better choice? What would you do?

And be real pissed if she didn't reply. There would be novels and novels of my text with a few punt replies from her. This repeated over the course of years. So we do occasion meet up when she's in town and we are gonna meet up soon. So for some weird reason I had this idea of making up some excuse so that I could delete my chat box off her WhatsApp . I mean , there's loads of embarrassing self pity and clingy texts in there. There's literally heaps of my shit with her one reply. I have become more goal oriented in life now so I don't do that shit with people anymore. So is it a good idea to go ahead? Cause I just feel like , I wasted a lotta time on this girl and she has all those texts in there. It burns me up. The other alternative to that would be to just let it go. But HOW?   
SOME advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",05Jan2019,1

394,"Hi, so to start, I would like to share a little background information regarding this part time job I’ve been doing for the past 3 months. 
I was approached by my Best Friend to help his parents company as a marketing part timer drawing 950 nett a month. (In my country an intern pay is the same amount)

However, being in this job, I’m given other tasks such as handling calls, doing graphic designs, customer relations, email respondent that is unrelated to marketing on top of my actual job scope. 

Basically the workload I’m doing daily is, 
1. Facebook and Instagram postings with curated creatives that I have to craft, 
2. Answering enquires on email and social media
3. Designing posters/banners/fliers etc (so far I’ve made around 10 of these)
4. Responding to any calls that is unrelated to booking an appointment, etc complains, sales
5. Going around each outlet to inspect work 
6. Planning ads and articles with partner companies  
7. Revamping and managing a cashback system
8. Helping the boss to fill out his company surveys as well as asking his employees to sign employee form
9. Liasing with clients
 
Information between the boss and employees differ and there are multiple occasions where I’ll get the wrong information but the task has already been done and I’ll be getting the heat for mistakes that are not mine as the boss is not open to listen.

Recent event has pushed me to question my work and the effort I’m putting in. One of their smaller chain outlet have closed down. Customers who have bought packages from them are requesting a refund but the company refuses. I was asked to handle emails regarding the refunds as well as respond to angry clients’ lawsuits. 

When I first started this job, I was told to use a set template to reply these clients saying that a refund will be processed but in reality, that was never an option and in turn, the issue has been taken to a lawsuit which I have to respond to. This is something that ticks with my work ethic and the boss is adamant on it. 

Am I being underpaid and should I voice it out, or is it considered rude to question my job and it’s scope itself ?

402,"I‘ve been crushing on someone for over a year now. He got kinda famous tho through music now in the past few months (He went from like 10k to 600k in not even a year) and he is getting out of reach more and more everyday, especially for someone like me it’s impossible, even if he was still not known. I‘m really proud of him tho since he finally gets the recognition he deserves but it still kinda hurts.
I regret never having really talked to him in the past when I had the possibilites.
I actually went to a small show of him last month but I didn’t get the opportunity to talk to him because I got dragged away. 

Knowing I’m never gonna be with him crushes my soul. I truly think I have never met anyone with such a mindset, so wise and pure and that  all in general individuality. It made me lose interest in everyone else and not wanting anyone but him. If I would meet him now he would probably just see me as someone who listens to his music.

403,"TLDR: I manage a branch for a small bank. I just discovered that over a month ago I electronically transferred ~$10,000 to a customer (to an account at another bank) on the same day that a coworker had sent them a check for the same amount to close the customer’s account. The customer had specifically requested a check. This is my first mistake in a year an a half. Do I try to let my boss know as soon as possible (he is on vacation and I would have to use my personal email)? Or do I wait until Monday? What can I expect to happen? Can the money be retrieved? Will I be fired?

I am the branch manager (as of 3 months, been with bank for 1.5 years) for an online branch of a local bank where I live. I am highly trusted my superiors, and I do a very good job in my position, although I started as an entry-level employee (just for some context). 

Earlier this week, another manager brought to my attention a negative balance in a bank-owned account that only my department/branch usually uses to do electronic transfers. A negative balance isn’t usually a big deal; it could mean a just a simple error, and an easy fix of transferring money from another account to balance it.

I spent the last several days going through hundreds of transactions, trying to find the mistake. I finally found it late on Friday night after everyone else had gone home.

It turned out that at the end of November, I electronically transferred ~$10,000 to a customer’s checking account at another bank on the same day that one of my employees printed and mailed the customer a check for the same amount. So the customer got double the money they should have. The request would have come several days before the actual closure date (maturing CD account), and we have specific ways to track requests that, I assume, I just misread. I sent the funds to an external account that the customer had previously used to fund the CD with us. That is the most common way to return funds at a CD’s maturity, so it wasn’t random.

This was my first (significant) mistake since starting with the bank.

I went home that night panicking and crying. There were no other people in the bank working at that time. My direct supervisor is on vacation. I don’t have his cell number saved, but he can still receive emails. I can’t go back into work today because the alarm does not disarm on Saturdays (my office is in an office building, not at a branch), so I could only use my personal email to reach him.

I haven’t dealt with this before, so please pardon my ignorance.

So my questions are: Should I email my boss as soon as possible about the error using my personal email at home, or should I wait until Monday/next week to tell anyone? (I think he is back from vacation on Tuesday). What can I expect to happen? Will I certainly be fired?

When thinking about it, I was never socially successful, thus I think that I value myself by my academic/creative achievements instead. And logically I know I'm doing well.

But it's not enough. I keep setting goals for myself and cracking under the pressure/getting super stressed out because I feel like on a global scale I  must be shite. 

Thoughts going through my head:
1. I should apply to this summer school in Germany, this open call, this internship in NY, and this one, and this one for this famous architectural firm.
2. I need to somehow make money so I can go to these night classes, so I can go to this city, so I can socialize.
3. I need to learn all these additional programmes because that's what this, this, and this firm needs.
4. I need to read in this subject for class, in this one for educated conversation, in this one for research to later be used in a project.
It's insane. My mom just had a chat with me and told me I need to relax and that I've plenty of time. And it's true; a nervous breakdown won't help anything, and I should enjoy my youth.

408,"So I (20s) just spent a few days at my aunt's house and met my little cousin (8), for the first time. She spent the entire three days attached to me (Reddit, I'm not exaggerating, the only place I had peace was in the bathroom) and now that I've left she got my number from my aunt and has been calling me nonstop even when I tell her not to.

I am still not sure if it was a joke (people joke a lot about dark stuff these days and I know she watches edgy youtubers because she told me about some) but she said she would kill herself if I don't return for another visit?

I know this sounds freaky and maybe fake? I am freaked out. I don't have a lot of experience with kids and I don't know what to do here. I blocked her number for the time being but I'm not sure if that is a good solution. She may try calling me from her mother's phone though what I am hoping is that she will get bored and move on. I don't want to make a big deal out of it since kids do embarrassing things and it may be blown out of proportion if I tell her parents or other family members. I did tell my mom about it and she isn't sure what to tell me either.

Other points that may be relevant

1. She seems to not have a sense of boundaries with other adults too? She apparently texts her teacher all the time? Weird to me but maybe it is a younger generation thing.
2. She said she does not like going out with one of her friends since that friend talks to other people.

416,"Before I get into my situation, a bit of background:

I’m in my freshman year of college and there’s this girl that I met at the beginning of the year that I’ve pretty much been in love with ever since. Like, head over heels in love. She was in a few of my classes and she ended up in my friend group so I got to know her and we talked a lot throughout the first few months of college. We became pretty close by November My feelings for her kept increasing to the point where I knew I had to do something about it. I didn’t think she liked me (I usually have a good sense about these things) but after a long time of debating I decided to tell her how I felt anyway. She told me she didn’t feel the same but she still cared about me a lot as a friend and that she hopes we can continue being good friends. This was about a month ago.   

I’ve been struggling the past month with trying (and miserably failing) to get over her. In fact, it feels like I just think about her more now than I ever did before.

Here is my dilemma: I know the best way to move on from someone is to cut them out of your life completely, but that’s impossible in my situation. She’s in my core friend group, she’s in some of my classes next semester, and she lives very close to me on campus. I see her every single day, usually multiple times a day. So taking space isn’t really a good option for my situation.

Plus, I want to be friends with her and spend time with her. I know that there’s nothing I can do to change the way she feels and I’m doing my best to let go of my dreams/fantasies of us together. She’s just genuinely a really cool person that I’d enjoy being friends with.

Obviously, I’m doing my best to take proper “precautions” to protect my feelings and help me heal (such as not being alone with her for a while and not texting unless necessary). I’m also seeing a therapist about this and some depression/self-esteem issues. While I know all of this is good and healthy, I still can’t seem to shake my intense feelings. I think that deep down I may still be clinging onto some hope that someday I’ll be with her, but I am doing my best to kill these thoughts.

All of this being said, is there any way to effectively get over someone when you still spend a pretty significant amount of time with them? I feel like the only sure fired way to get over someone is to cut them out of your life, but is there a way I can at least begin to move on and make seeing her easier?

Today we were talking to each other on a video call and suddenly I heard a sound and it was her little sister's voice. She kind of said ""should I turn 'whatever she said' off?''. I immediately hung the call up and didn't reply to her messages for a while she kept saying ""WHAT HAPPENED?"" ""WHY DID YOU HANG THE CALL UP?"" and after a while I replied ""LIAR"" and then she asked ""WHY? What happened?"". To what I replied ""You know it, don't act innocent"" and while we were exchanging these messages she video called me twice but I didn't pick up until the third time. Then she tried to explain that it was her sister who came to her room to ask her if she should turn the lights off because it was getting late night.  I since I know the map of her house completely and was wearing headphones while on the call, I could tell that the sound didn't come from the place she was telling it was. I was pretty sure it was coming from the side of her phone. After I told her that the direction she is telling is not credible, she said that she came a little inside the room and then asked her about turning the lights off. I don't believe her explanation since she first said that her sister came to the door and then said she came a little inside and that's because I thought the sound was coming from the side of her phone.

Until recently, we happily lived in our apartment with out 2 dogs and cat. One dog is hers, the other dog she rescued and I've been taking care of, and a cat I rescued a few months back.

I supported her through cancer surgery (shes clear now) and got her treatment for her undiagnosed parkinsons as well as got her blood pressure medications under control and worked to ease her slowly off suboxone. It's been difficult. I take care of all the finances and shopping and cleaning. She is in pretty good condition now and seems to think she can help herself and doesn't need my assistance. I know she feels guilty because she feels she's limiting my life, and she kinda is, and basically we both speak our minds.

She recently has stopped taking her anti-depressants and pain medication without telling me or tapering off of them, and after throwing a tantrum wants to move out, and honestly I really want that to happen as well because I'm frankly exhausted. Even if this didn't happen, it's still healthier for both of us if this happens.

Today I had to go with her and return the dog she rescued back to the shelter, even though he was a great dog I had gotten attached to him, because I have to find a place on my own now and she doesn't want him anymore.

Now I feel compelled to find her a place to live that will have her dog, she has SSI every month.

He had a stroke in his early-mid 30’s (a milder one, most likely due to smoking) before most of the weight gain. He also has sleep apnea which comes with its own host of issues. 

I just don’t know what to do, I’m so scared of losing him and I don’t know how to help him lose weight/quit smoking. I have so much anxiety about it every time I see him eat or smoke a cigarette. I need him to get healthy. What can I do?",05Jan2019,1
424,"Hey r/Advice, i just turned 17 last december and i am affraid i have a problem with drugs/alcohol/addiction.

I started smoking weed when i was 12. Started off innocent but now i can hardly remember the last day i was sober. I used to drink a lot at parties when i was 15/16 but friends ditched me after i broke up with my ex around 5 months ago. I always used to prefer smoking weed on my own. But never drank a drop of alcohol when no friends were around. Now that im not invited to parties anymore i started to get drunk occasionally on my own. I'd never thought i would do something like that and it really concerns me and i feel like its just a slippery slope into a downward spiral. Currently im in my first year of uni but besides that im doing absolutely nothing with my life.

How do i get my shit together and stay off the substances? I want to achieve something in life. I just dont know what and how to get out of this lifestyle.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",05Jan2019,1
425,"My workplace recently had an opening for a manager due to ours going AWOL about a month ago and the deadline to apply is fast approaching. My college who I consider a friend applied and seems very confident he will get the position. However, he doesn’t drive and has a tendency to piss customers off with his blunt mannerisms but knows a lot about sales. Due to pressure from my other coworkers, our temp manager who manages another store and my family (mostly my husband) I applied last night. I don’t know how to tell the my friend who applied that I did and worse still if I get an interview and he doesn’t he will be crushed. He’s been with the company A LOT longer than I have and his sales are way better. Meanwhile I’ve been doing all of the operational stuff that the manager would be doing besides making the schedule as well as dealing with any customer escalations. I don’t feel I have a chance but if he finds out I’m worried it will be awkward. 
My friend already mentioned he’ll quit if he doesn’t get the job or he’ll try to get transferred out of the store. The only idea I have so far is to tell him I applied to get my husband off my case. ",05Jan2019,1
426,"I don’t know why I feel so unhappy.  I normally visit my family every Christmas and have a nice time.  I don’t usually get depressed like this when I come back.  I’m from the east coast, and it truly just feels different going back to my hometown from where I am now (Bay Area, CA).  But I normally bounce back to my life and feel relieved to get into my routine and sleep in my own bed again.  

Before I left, my bf and I were doing well and spent time together having fun and going on outings in our new community (we moved recently).  While I was away, we texted frequently and both would often say how much we missed each other.  We’d also watch some shows on Netflix together (when my family went to bed and I was just hanging out in my room).  When I got back yesterday, we were happy to see each other.  But, suddenly, after a few hours, I felt a sense of regret over coming back.  Bf tried to get sexual and I was in the mood, but he noticed a small piece toilet paper stuck on my genitals and got some tissue to wipe it off.  It’s not his fault, but it completely put me out of the mood and sent me into a spiraling depression.  I already deal with a lot of sexual problems because of some sexual abuse and rape incidents that happened in my past.  I have a hard time having sex and keep building these negative associations with it.  My bf tried to reassure me that it wasn’t a big deal and that it happens sometimes.  But I just felt extremely self-conscious and upset.  All I could think about was “why did I come back?” over and over again.

I haven’t been feeling like I have relationship problems with my bf or anything.  He is always supportive and tries to be understanding and make sure I’m okay.  So, I don’t know why I just got so upset.  

I know it’s normal to miss family, but for some reason I am just feeling extremely depressed about going back to my daily life.  It’s not my job... I teach and love my job.   And I don’t feel sad at all about going back to work.  I just feel sad about being home.  

There was a computer game I was excited to play at home, and my bf was really excited for me to show him around in the game.  We tried to play yesterday, but I just couldn’t for more than a few minutes.  I had been playing this game with my 14-year old cousins, and I think it just made me sad because I miss them.  My bf can sense that I’m depressed and has tried to help, but it seems he’s now feeling down and thinks I’m mad at him.  I don’t know if the weather is affecting me because it’s very dark, rainy, and gloomy.  I have a little bit of stress because my first day of class is on Monday, and I just don’t feel like myself right now.

I don’t know if there’s anything anyone can say about why I feel like this.  But I keep crying and feel an extreme amount of depression.  I don’t know what’s wrong.",05Jan2019,1
427,"To give some context I've known this person since kindergarten (around 14 years) and I just don't know if I'm the person who's toxic or not.
Recently I've been reading some old chat groups I was in with her, just to have a look at old times, and everytime I had a different opinion/value, just disagreed on anything with her, I got either got yelled at, called an idiot or just been humiliated in front of others. Even more recently, when I try to joke around with her (ex. Her mom used to be in a circus group when she was young so she was very flexible, while my friend(?) isn't, so i just said she didn't get her mothers genes , and i know that flexibility like that isn't inherited, it was just a joke, she took it like an insult (?) and started to explain to me that that's not how it works, etc. in a mocking way. I also made a comment about how she should've entered the circus too (to be flexible since we were on that topic) and she said that she would hit me for that (which I can understand how it could be taken negatively but I wasn't saying/meaning it in a malicious way)) , she says that if I wasn't her friend she would hit me and the way she explains things to me, it feels like she's treating me like an idiot who doesn't understand anything. It's gotten to the point that I would tear up when she does things like that, I even had a mental breakdown yesterday over this, just thinking if I am the stupid one, maybe I'm the one who's offensive and insensitive and my opinion is really that dumb. I also dread meeting up alone with her, without other friends, because I'm somewhat scared of what she might say to me. At this point i just really don't know.
I should also add that this type of stuff has been happening for around 4ish years, it's just gotten worse, from my point of view, this year and I've only started noticing and thinking about this in general the past few weeks.

428,"Hi everyone,

So my girlfriend (F/21), lets call her Amy, recently decided to abstain from any sexual acts until marriage. She is doing it for religious reasons and I'm not as religious as her. I initially had problems with her choice but I respected her decision in the long run. I still need advice however because I wasn't raised to live this type of lifestyle so I don't know how to navigate a relationship without sex.

Most people are opposed to post-marital sex because of the chance of sexual incompatibility. I understand this fear too, however, Amy and I have had sex before and on a regular basis almost. We have the same libidos as far as I'm concerned.

I know I'm young and most people would say that I need to explore my sexuality first before settling with someone and making such a huge commitment. I have a disability which has sort of automatically barred me from being an average guy. My friends think I have potential, but I'm not interested in hookups. I'm more so interested in loving someone and having sex if you know what I mean?

We had PIV sex in the beginning but it was too much so we just resorted to other things. I had been fine until she decided that we were gonna stop all sexual things. Meaning no genital stuff. This I guess is where the dilemma comes from.

I was initially disproving because I had no clue how to rationalize the decision. I'm not religious so there's no reason I would make this decision on my own. I guess I'm more upset because I want Amy but can't have Amy. Can't really do anything about it unless I pressure her and that's immoral.

Look guys, there are other reasons why I'm staying, but going into those reasons would make this a book rivaling War &amp; Peace. My conclusion was that it felt better to stay, rather than to break up and have sex with some random girl.

I guess I need any advice, even if you think I'm stupid, cause I know my friends think I'm the dumbest guy on Earth. How can I make sure this is a positive in my relationship? What sort of problems will arise if I go down this path? What is your advice in general? I honestly appreciate any response here, anything you have for me. Even if you call me an idiot (please explain though). Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great year!

TL;DR

Girlfriend wants to abstain from sex until marriage. I had difficulty with the decision but it doesn't bother me anymore. We have had sex in the past. Can you give me any advice on how to handle this?",05Jan2019,1

We also don’t get paid very much either, and live pay check to pay check.

433,"First, a little background information on me. I graduated from university in 2015 with a degree in Economics, and took a contract position managing data in an administrative environment. That ended in July of 2016, when I found a position processing mortgages, and started in July 2016. I was at that job from July 2016 until Feb 2018. And that is where it started to go downhill. I applied for a few months, and nothing really came up, so I took a temp position in May 2018 that was similar to the job I was laid off from. I finished the contract in August 2018. Afterwards, I started applying again and got a job as a pricing analyst in November of 2018. While I'm still here, this company has started doing layoffs and I know that the new hires are typically the first to go.

To visualize this, my work history is as follow:

Graduated University: 2015

Data Management Job (contract): August 2015-July 2016

Mortgage processing (perm): July 2016-Feb 2018

Unemployment: March 2018-April 2018

Second Mortgage Job (contract): May 2018- August 2018

Unemployment: Sept 2018-Oct 2018

Pricing Analyst: Nov 2018-Present

Honestly, if I get laid off again, my resume is fucked. I don't know how to explain all the to employers all these layoffs and temp jobs, and I think it makes me look like a bad candidate. Also, I have about 10k in savings and no real attachments, so it is possible for me to move to get a new job, especially since there are not that many jobs where I live, I'm just not sure where to move or what to apply to.

436,"Hey reddit, question- so I'm a 19 year old male and, as such, I was spending a morning alone ""relaxing"". Now, as I was ""relaxing"", by myself, on the internet etc. etc. I found myself looking at a particular explicit GIF that contained someone looking just like my ex exposed with another dude. In my opinion, I thought it was my ex with about 95-98% certainty. 

We broke up on fairly bad terms over a year ago as we had different, uh, creative visions for the relationship. I was starting college as she was finishing high school, and so the distance made her into someone who really damaged me, and I think I damaged her as well. Now, I'm ambivalent about her being with another guy (neither one of us cheated to my knowledge, and I have a new girlfriend anyway), but I'm concerned that this was posted without her permission. I don't know her circumstances at the moment and, while it's within the realm of possibility that she was okay with this post, I would like to give her more credit than to change from completely being not okay with photos of herself exposed without her face being posted anywhere to posting amateur porn on the internet with her face in it.

Complicating this is that there still is the possibility that this isn't her- there are a lot of people in the world, and even though I knew her very well and saw her all the time, I could be wrong for any number of reasons. I couldn't find any video source to check the voice, which I could confirm matches up against hers.

Do I respect the fact that she doesn't want to talk to me and assume this was posted with her permission? If I do engage her, should I through a third party? What if it isn't her? And if it is her, then what?

FYI- the best solution I've thought of so far in terms of engaging is asking whether she owns a shirt like the one that the girl in the GIF was wearing through a third party and, if so, engaging her, but I don't think there are any good answers really.",05Jan2019,1

So recently my dad has been REALLY unpleasant to be around. Him and I have had issues throughout the year with what I wanna do with my life. He ignores almost everything I say and wants things done his way.

This is something my siblings never ever see because he favors them all over me because I’m a black sheep.

446,"this is really hard for me to type out. i don’t want to go into much detail because it’s hard for me to talk about. i’m not embarrassed, and it’s really out of the ordinary for me to have difficultly saying something, so i don’t know why this is so hard for me. 

so i dated a guy from late September to mid November of this past year. to cut to the chase, he wanted to do... things. and at first i was on board and totally down, but there were a few times where i wasn’t in the mood to do stuff. i didn’t want to do certain things and he would ask and i would say “i’m not in the mood” or “i don’t want to right now, sorry” and stuff like that but he just wouldn’t take that as an answer. he would persist. he would ask again and again. and if that didn’t work he would be like “ok then do [seemingly small sexual task i still didn’t want to do]” and i would. because i’m a push over and saying no once is hard enough. then he would be like “ok well you’re already basically doing [task]. just do that.” and just keep going and pushing things until he finished. 

i didn’t want to do what he asked me to. but i’m a push over. i’m a yes man. and saying no once is difficult for me. saying no 7+ times in the span of 30 minutes was nearly impossible. i just felt so bad for “blue ballsing” him or rejecting him. and he would apologize afterward. he’d say sorry and apologize bc he knew he shouldn’t push it. but he acted like such a hurt puppy that i felt bad telling him he should be sorry. so i would just say that it was ok and leave it. 

i want to cry. i told him no. i said no in every way i could. **i said no**  and he didn’t care. and his previous girlfriend was very stand-off-ish when it came to physical contact with him. she didn’t like kissing him and she definitely wouldn’t do more. so i felt like when i said no or rejected advances i was just like her. but guess what? i was talking with her recently and he tried to do the same shit with her but she stood her ground. that’s why she didn’t like touching him. i should have stood my ground. it got to the point where at the end of the relationship if he so much as brushed past me i would want to vomit. or cry. or maybe both. 

he never physically forced himself on me though. he got really close once when we were high and i tried to get away from him and he just kept following me and grabbing me and persisting. but he’s smaller and weaker than me. he couldn’t have actually raped me or fully forced himself on me. if i fought him i would have won. so was i even assaulted? am i over reacting? is crying right now typing this just me being a little bitch?  god i don’t like talking about this but i can’t stop now. 

**tl;dr** : my ex would persuade me into doing things i didn’t want to do and i would oblige just to get him off my back, even if i had said no thirty times that night he would just keep asking and i don’t know if that counts as assault but god, i *feel* so violated. i want to cry when he gets near me. i hate this and i hate him.

The potential new job means no more stress for FDH, a bit more money and stability. He'll be working regular hours with steady pay in a government position. I know he really wants it. He's applied for the same job in our state 9 times without getting it so he applied in a far away state and got it. 

We've never been to this town and don't know anyone there. 

I like where we are now. We own our home and have two cats. 

The job he has now is very stressful for low pay. His boss calls him several times to fix things he can do himself while hubbys on vacation. The pay is very irregular. It depends on how many student he has. One month can pay 800 dollars and another 3000 dollars. This is really stressing him out and I want him to find better work, but he can't find it in our state.

I'm scared that a new place combined with my illness will isolate me. I'm also scared of the moving process which is a lot of work and requires a lot of energy that I don't have. 

He says that not moving because I'm scared is stupid, but if I legitimately don't want to go, we won't go. 

I don't want to stand in his way, but I also don't want to move. 

We talked about him renting a small apartment there and traveling back every weekend, but that doesn't work since I'm depending on his care. I can't drive and no stores in walking distance. I also can't get myself to the doctor or anywhere else.

How can I get out of this and stop procastinating? Is there a way to make essay-writing bearable? (One is about the show, I still can’t manage to write anything, so making it about the show is out of the question too.)",05Jan2019,1

452,"So my mom told me I dress like a guy yesterday. I told her I understand how in society wearing hoodies etc. Is seen as dressing as a guy but I don’t see clothing that way. When I was younger I always went against the rules just by questioning things and went with the more logical route. I never understood why someone would say flowers are feminine because to me flowers grow from the ground and it belongs to everyone and isn’t restricted to just one gender. I actually think it’s ridiculous if you really think about it. Same thing with pink being a girls colour and blue being a guys colour. Colours are just reflection of light it shouldn’t be assigned to any gender. I think clothes are just fabric and doesn’t belong to any group no matter what design but society. Men back then use to wear skirts, or have long hair etc. I’m a very deep thinker this way and choose to live like this. I shop both men and women’s. I’ve never liked dresses or skirts and not because of them being traditionally “women’s” but because I don’t like my body in one single gown (dress). I’m a very awkward person and like to be comfortable. I tried to explain to my mom that me not liking dresses has nothing to do with rejecting traditional female clothing but that everyone has person style differences. I’ve never listened to her before because I know she’s very close minded and judgmental but I won’t lie and say she didn’t get to me. What should I do? Is she right? ",05Jan2019,1
453,"So last year was kinda bad for me and 2019 doesnt look so promising either. Thats why i recently started thinking about traveling somewhere solo. One destination that came to my mind is japan as i really appreciate the japanese culture also from what i have seen Hong Kong looks amazing too.There are a few things though that make me skeptical. First of all i am just 18 and i  dont know if travelling such a long distance and switching so many flights will be too much for me. Then there are my parents who if they find out  i am planning to go to Hong Kong will freak out. I really dont know what to do. Should i go for it? Wait a few more years ? Or choose another destination? I really need some advice.
By the way if anyone has ever been to Hong Kong can you please tell me if it is an easy city to navigate? 
Thanks.",05Jan2019,1

16 IS THE AGE OF CONSENT WHERE I LIVE!!!!

So my brother moved back home with me and our parents because his apartment burned down in a fire unfortunately. He was roommates with his best friend, I'll call Joe. Joe doesn't have anywhere to stay, so my parents are letting him stay in the guest room in our house. My parents travel all the time for work, and for the past couple months its just been me, my brother and Joe. At first he treated me like a little sister, but whenever my brother is not around, he flirts me. I told him a story about last year when I was changing in the bathroom at school and some boy opened the door on me, seeing me half naked and ran . Joe murmured ""I wouldn't mind seeing that"".

I find him extremelyyyyyyy attractive and we hang out all the time now that he lives with us. He asked me the other day to a movie and I said yes. He then asked me to be his girlfriend. I told him I'd have to think about it, because I know my parents would not approve. But everything inside me wants to say yesssssssssssssss. My brother would also be pissed if he found out though. Any advice??Should we date and just keep it a secret?

**tldr- My brothers best friend, who is 22 wants to date me (16yrs old) and has asked me out. I want to and find him really attractive, but I know my parents and my brother would not approve and be pissed. What should I DO? Maybe keep it a secret until I'm 18?Helppp? I am very attracted to him.**",05Jan2019,1
455,"So since Thursday night when the thing happened resulting in my dog and I living out of my car. Fortunately I am emploed, have a little savings, and have someone to babysit my dog for a few hours on weekends so I can do my lyft driving for extra. I found doggie daycare for the weekdays while I'm at my main job, I worked out my budget and plan and I'm solid, this is just gonna have to go on for about the next 4-5 weeks. 

Today was when I had to leave my friends house before her landlord came by to ""inspect"" (no dog allowed), so I went to grocery store and organized my car, threw away a lot of stuff, arranged it so it'll be easy to switch from day mode to sleep mode. Then we went to the dog park, then the regular park, stopped by my other friends house for a little bit for coffee and a visit and secret ulterior motive of me needing to poop, hung out at petco and bought two $1 chew snacks and spent dinner in their parking lot, and now we're back at the dog park as the suns setting but it's still to early to find a place to park for the night. Pretty much the whole day I've just been struggling to keep busy without spending money and trying to conserve gas. I'm just bored! Most days I have work, but this is the weekend and my weekend dog care pal isn't available till next sunday. So today and tomorrow is just like, welp. And I guess every other non-working time between now and february. 

I've got a laptop but I'm a little paranoid to sit in my car watching videos or anything. I have been writing in my notebook a lot, and when I was organizing I realized I have a completely blank sketchpad and some color pencils so that's nice. I unfortunately lost all my books except for a calving and hobbies collection and umbrella academy comic books. I read comics so fast though. Not calving and hobbies as much because it's enormous but I'm already halfway through umbrella academy. How am I going to not go insane? ",05Jan2019,1
456,"20, male, just realized that all my life I've acted according to the groups I hang out with, and tbh sometimes I enjoy the ""act"" and when I don't I literally avoid people altogether until I feel I'm ready to ""act"" again, and when I'm alone I'm either working or just auditing and judging myself all the time, trying to improve myself to win people around me, basically people run my life, and it's all my fault, I guess realizing this is a big win for me now, I wished I had some way to find who I truly am.

Should I conduct more sessions like this with myself?

Or is everyone's condition literally like me?

It'll be preposterous to act according to my mood, if that's what ""being yourself"" means.

Any input is highly appreciated, thanks.",05Jan2019,1
457,"I (female, 30 years old) live alone in an apartment building in manhattan (4 apartments stacked on top of each other in a walk up). I moved in about 1.5 years ago, and briefly met my downstairs neighbor a couple times when I first moved in, and she seemed very friendly. She's about the same age as me, she's pretty and nice, and looks like someone I would hang out with in day-to-day life (no immediate red flags).   


As the year went on, I noticed that she was watching every single Instagram story I posted but she doesn't follow me (I didn't even know her name until I was curious about this mystery viewer). Now, this wouldn't be super weird if I was posting daily, but I post maybe once every 2 weeks... and every time I post, she usually watches my story within 2 hours of posting (even though she doesn't follow me). This makes me think shes constantly checking in on my profile -- unless theres some app that I'm unaware of that notifies you of people who post that you dont follow? Either way, it is so odd. On top of that, I find I \~always\~ run into her at her front door. She just happens to be leaving as I'm arriving. Maybe I'm being suspicious, but I've only run into my other neighbors like once in the 1.5 years I've lived in the building, but I seem to run into her every week. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid, but its almost like she hears me coming up the stairs and then she decides to step out into the hall.

Anyway, I have a job that doesn't allow me to have a private instagram (I need to do work related stuff from my account that is public facing). But I definitely hold off on posting anything too personal. Either way, what do you guys think? I'm not really sure if theres a solution to this issue but I'm feeling freaked, and I'm sure she's digging into my life in other ways that I can't like I can on Instagram.",05Jan2019,1
458,"This is obviously a throwaway account because I don't want to be found out.

Today I went to my boyfriends house and we got a bit sexual involved but not full on intercourse. He didn't get near that area when naked . At some point he came and after that he wiped his hands with a wet wipe. We stopped being sexual after and we just chilled in bed. I can't remember much about what happened but a couple of mins later ( after 5 minutes or more I think) he touched me inside that area with his hands or he had his hand near that area but we can't remember for sure as we weren't aware of the time and everything else so we can't remember exactly but that's what I think happened. His hands were dry but is there a possibility to get pregnant by that? Can you get pregnant if the hand is dry for less than 5 minutes? I'm panicking a lot about it and I don't want to get pregnant. Please help me. ",05Jan2019,1
459,"So recently me and my girlfriend were talking about first times and losing our virginity came up. I knew she lost it at 14 and to my knowledge she was not very mature until recently so that was a little uncomfortable for me. I know she was extremely immature until much later when she was 15 then she grew a lot over that summer, she started actually looking her age, and she also went through a really rebellious phase. I also knew that her boyfriend at 14 was an awful guy who generally did a lot of shitty things to her. I know he cheated on her 3+ times and now I believe he may have raped her. We were talking and on the subject she said it hurt a lot. She said she was crying the entire time telling him to stop. She told me how awful it was. I started to hint towards the fact that maybe he raped her and she just ignored me and stopped saying anything more. I’m sure it’s a sensitive subject and she doesn’t want to say anything but I want to do something. I mean what kind of 14 year old kid rapes a girl. I know this is just me freaking out but I want to fly there myself and kick the shit out of this awful degenerate of a human being. I want him to resent ever touching her, defiling her, and resent his entire existence.",05Jan2019,1

462,"Hi all, 

I went 50/50 on a home with a roomate. We are both military and signed the closing contract together, splitting everything down the middle. I got a no-notice deployment, and had a friend move into my room when I left and is paying me rent while I am gone.

463,"My SIL wrote a massive several paragraph tirade on Facebook insinuating it with my alcoholic mom. 

My mom abuses alcohol on a daily basis, comes across emotionally abusive, and is an overall shitty person to live with (for now until I get a better job &amp; housing). 

I know my mom is a terrible person but when I would go and stay a few nights at their home (to escape the mental/verbal abuse of my mom's drinking) I felt uneasy being there after a while. I would literally have to stay 2-3 nights each week or two depending on my mom's mental health at the time.

 I thanked them each time &amp; offered help for anything but felt something wasn't right in my gut. Then the day after I left they had an argument with each other (he told me) and asked if I could stay that night and he refused because his wife wasn't happy at the time. That scenario might not have anything to do with me but thought I'd share it.

My sister in law has no doubt tried to help me countless times with getting social security to food stamps &amp; overall support and I've thanked her each time but she'll casually trash talk my abusive mom in front of my brother and I each time I go to their home as well as her own mom. 

It makes me so angry because she's talking ill of her in front of me (however I want to move out asap) about it and it disturbs me. 

My brother is controlled by her I feel but I also know that my whole family is toxic. 

I remember she found out about my YouTube account videos and how I was documenting my abuse stories &amp; what I felt about her at the time (she wasn't happy) and said I was ""fabricating"" these stories. So then I talked to them directly and apologized and both my brother and I cried together after I had cut them out of contact for 3 months. Meanwhile she was standing with her arms crossed and kept giving me this angry look while I was hugging him. That happened about 7 months ago and we're not like that anymore. I've learned from that incident that I shouldn't assume what people think and only face my reality with what I know. 

I don't completely trust my SIL in my gut but I also know she's not a terrible person either.

If you want I can elaborate if you need more details. 

What's the best approach to this drama by sister in law?
