0,So basically to put a long story. My best friend and I ended our friendship 3 years ago and we were best friends for 10 years. Most of our friendship was us arguing and then saying sorry and back to normal so like kind of toxic. The last summer of our friendship she stayed at my house and I think us being around each other 24/7 was the nail in the coffin and our friendship ended over something really stupid. But she is the one that ended the friendship. I haven‚Äôt seen her since but she ran into my sister a few months ago and told her she hopes one day we‚Äôll be friends again. I don‚Äôt know if I should text her bc I was t the one that ended the friendship so I don‚Äôt want to be the one to text first but I really miss her. Advice??,25Dec2019,1

3,"So if I'm in a bad mood, having a bad day or having extreme mood swings I let it out on others and feel guilty about it later. But I'm in such a bad mood at that moment that I don't apologize for my behavior and just ignore the feelings of my close friends.
I know that affects their/  friend groupes mood and want to stop myself from getting mad at others for my own inferior feelings.
I appreciate every comment thx.

Iv been working voluntary in a charity shop and there was an older lady who works there normally named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam me and Sam  were tagging clothes about 10ft apart ...anyway they were asking how old we were: 

üîπSue: I‚Äôm 48

‚óæÔ∏èSam: *bubbly points up to the air* I‚Äôm 31

üîπSue: *looks over at me* how old are you? 

üî∏Me: 29

üîπ‚óæÔ∏èSue and Sam : *act surprised* awwwww are yer!?

üîπSue: when yer birthday?

üî∏Me: November 30th 

‚óæÔ∏èSam: *bubbly points up again*  mines 21st

üîπSue:  oh close birthdays eh....gonna have a litttle birthday bash? *laughing a little*

‚óæÔ∏èSam: (very seriously and abruptly reacts) 
 Ooooo no, ooooo no. Oooooo no, don‚Äôt think my fella would like that, don‚Äôt think my fella would like thaaaat *shaking her head a little* (seemed very arrogant with her reply and loud too) 

She stinks really bad too so the audacity from her to act like that 


 Her bf is in prison whilst she‚Äôs in community service for the same crime idk what it is and he does call Her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes and fancied another guy in the shop (who called her all sorts to me because of her hygiene) but has poor hygiene BO and looks like a hard drug user. ‚Äôm A guy. The fella would be out if prison by the point of our birthdays tbf",25Dec2019,1
5,"Dont get me wrong, i have a good amount of friends, and a few who i regularly text with but none of them actually want to hang out with me. The last time i ever got invited to a party / hangout was in elementary school, and whenever i ask someone to hang out they either dont respond or they just straight up tell me no. Im naturally a very positive person but this even makes me a bit sad. Is there something im doing wrong or something i could do better to actually have some face to face social contact with friends?",25Dec2019,1
6,I am a broken person and i dont know what to do about it. I want to heal from all of this but it just feels like its a part of me. I was homeless for a month at 19 and all my family turned their backs on me and pretended i didnt exist. I have good friends but im burdening them with all my negative thoughts. There was so much abuse in my life. I got so many emotional scars from it and i dont know if they will ever go away.,25Dec2019,1

8,"this happened last week..Its quite a  complicated and my friend lets call him (A) and i used to talk like 4  years ago,  but we're good friends now. My friend came over to mine to go out and brought his current bf (B), who i know, and another one of his ex's (C), who i also know through (A)

Me and (C) are friendly with each other alot, wont go into too much detail, but are  similar minded on quite a few things. I   just get good vibes off of him all round. Problem is on the night out  we're dancing very closely as i do with everyone tbh, but i can tell its a bit weird, good weird as we're both drunk.

But granted at this point he (C) was kinda all over me in terms of  trying to feel me up, suggestive dancing, so that's what was partly on my mind, but also why i asked my friend to get his permission on what i said next. 

In that moment i separately ask my friend (A) if i can 'fuck his ex', which rubbed him wrong.  My wording was so wrong on this but my thinking was was more like i don't know anything about your old relationship with (C). I think i might seriously have a thing for this guy because we talk alot and just seeing him again i felt good weird, so  would it be a problem if i took  it further.  this is what i should've said.  Personally i'd I'd rather have asked (A), than just let it happen  because if he's not okay then no. now i'm a mad anxious guy, socially awkward my only reference to all this shit is tv because i was never allowed out as a kid because strict parents,  and as dumb as it sounds, anyone gets with anyone on tv.  They did it in friends twice !!

Now i feel like a dick a massive dick, and so besides myself for hurting my friend and seeing his reaction because it just hurt him big and that the last thing i want to do and i could see that. mmy rlationship with (A) as a friend has ever only been up and down when it comes to guys... just not over the last half a year.. we got ourselves to a really good place, the best place and i fucked up.. Just because for me it's always been a if i'm not dating you its open game, doesn't mean i should just feel the need to ask that/ assume everyone is okay with that kind of thinking, but i am direct and blunt like that, and he knows that. it's no excuse, im just  genuinely hurt he could still be hurting or that  he feels betrayed. 

Even still at the end of the night i kiss some other random dude infront of everyone, looking like a dick  on all fronts  to everyone, to  (C) cos i look like a player and A (because i put him through stress to get with another guy and makes it look like i'm thinking with my dick, in my defence i enjoyed the kiss as i had kissed him before a long time ago) but basically it was for (A)  to see that i don't want (C) because no guy is worth our friendship.  i learnt that with my Ex who tried controlling who i see, i just didn't let that happen with (A) . I dont think he really got this however, but i also didnt tell him so i cant be angry at that. 

Before we leave to go home we hash it out outside club talk about it apologise, and he said that the fact one of his best mates did asked him that ( which i didnt know i was at this point, never had one before) confused him so much..and with me never having a best friend it was kind of a bittersweet moment really, as if i undermined the friendship, which i dont because he's my rock,  but in that moment realised he kinda actually is my best friend. I'd always tell ( B) his boyfriend how he seems happy with him and how he's my rock and i try and be his. 

Even the next day  sober, i fully apologise for hurting him, and what i said, like a full proper apology, accountability and everything and he said its okay because we both said and did things we didn't mean to that night.. which we all did. As in (A) and (C) almost ended up fighting over something separate. 

He said we're okay which i want to believe him but i just dont know. Like we spoke like regular after, I just feel like maybe space is the right answer. I know i've needed space almost like a friendship break from him before when  said he accidentally sent me dick pic when i was with my ex, or some other random shit he did in the past i didn't agree with so i feel we could bounce back from this okay.. i just need to get out of my head but just not sure. 

To make things even sightly more awkward. after the night out we all share a bed as in (me A and B) which is quite normal cos house space is small especially  with (C) being there, but i woke up to find (A's) arms around me, fingers interlocked and everything, legs wrapped whilst his bf is sleeping on the other side of him which has never happened before so i'll try to not misread that and i'm like 0\_0... I CANT  ever mention this. It's weird because  its very hard to mistake me and (B) his bf, as our body types a very different and i went to bed first, and earlier, so that level of closeness for me and ( A)  is kinda funny, 

&amp;#x200B;

what can i do to stop myself freaking out, but also just get my best friend back?  also Merry Christmas!!",25Dec2019,1
9,"Had a friend of mine get into an aggressive argument with another person down near my high school, it started to hint at a fight once the guy put his hand on my friend as he pushed back. It then devolved into a yelling match but besides that my friend after word was quite shaky in the legs and looked like he was going to cry despite not actually fighting.

11,"Hi, I've never posted anything in Reddit before but I'm in need of some advice since I don't have many people to ask. I don't know whether I should continue to pursue a relationship with my father anymore. 

Most of the drama started when I was a teen. We fought often, especially when my parents divorced and he got engaged to someone else (f39) who I felt he would me aside for sometimes. My mother moved in with my grandfather because she cannot live on her own. I don't remember the arguments too well anymore, but they were usually about my attitude. The last argument we had when I lived there was about library dvds and how long I studied for (I was 18 at the time and this was my last year of high school). I was so upset the next day that I went over to my grandfather's and stayed a week. In this time he never reached out to me and changed the lock on the garage so I could not get back in without talking to him. The school social worker recommended I live on my own in a shelter, which is where I went after a week and I lived there while in high school for three months (I could not live at my grandfather's for reasons). 

My stepmother asked me to come back once and would write some letters, but I never heard from him and I was too prideful to go back at the time. That January, my grandfather passed away and I was close to him. I moved into my grandfather's house while things panned out and he never reached out to me about it. He and my stepmother cleared out my entire bedroom two months after I left and threw the stuff in the basement, so he did contact me about moving my stuff out February and we did. In March, my mother and I moved into a condo, and I was so severely depressed about my grandfather's passing and the drama with my dad that I checked myself into a hospital for a week, where nobody visited me. He only sent me a text, and he was informed that I was there. After getting out and going through a recovery program while ending my high school year, I invited him to my graduation while out with my aunt (my mother's sister). He sent me an email telling me they were not going to go and that I had not earned the gown and honors I was being given. This hurt me because I had made everything up in school after being in the hospital and still met all the same requirements for those honors. Only my sister (f17 now and 15 at the time) and mother went, who ruined it but I won't go into too much detail about her now. 

Basically, in order to get into contact with him again, I had to take the full blame for everything that happened and apologize, which I did because at the time two ago I did not have many friends or family and I was yearning for him to someday invite me to the Christmas and thanksgiving parties and love me again. For the last two years, he's made it my responsibility to call him and get into contact with him, and he never calls me outside of my birthday once I suppose. I haven't been very good about returning his return phone calls, and went 8 months without talking to him, due to a mix of anxiety and maybe hurt. On the phone calls, I agree with him on everything and haven't been honest on how I am feeling because I'm scared if I am he will get mad and not talk to me again. This year I called him a bit more, but he went a little bit without calling me back either. This week he called to wish me a merry Christmas and happy new year and said he would not be sending anything and that I shouldn't either. He also said that it sucks that things are the way they are but that I should have stepped up as he asked me to. 

I think that deep down I am still upset about the way that things played out, and I live with the regret that I left the house. I know I was wrong to do so and I probably wasn't very easy to deal with as an 18-year-old kid sometimes, but I feel like he was perfect either. It's been easier to just not talk to him this year, but procrastinating talking to him is not a good solution either. Should I be honest about how I am feeling, should I continue to apologize to him in order to keep in contact with him or should I just stop talking to him altogether? I don't know anymore, but I want to respond to his phone call with the right response but I don't even know what that is anymore. I appreciate any advice thank you.",25Dec2019,1
13,"We are together for 14 months and a few weeks ago we were sleeping at my place. In the morning i wake up while she was lying next to me texting on her phone. I see the name of a guy i never heard of and as she notices that i opened my eyes, she turned the phone so i cant see anything. I did not say anything about it. I know her instagram password and i logged in to read the messages. I know its not the right thing but i could not resist as her behaviour was weird. What was realy happening is that she was in her home town a few days before and went to a bar where her best friend works. The guy was the boss of her friend. She had told me about the evening, the boss gave her half a liter of whine for free but she told me that they did not talk much and he left them alone and she left early. A few days ago she went again to her home town and one evening she went to this bar again but told me that she was alone with her friend and nobody else was working. The next day she went with her family to the village of her grandparents and the guy asks her when they will leave exactly and if she arrived. So they must have talked the day before. She answeres him and seams to want the conversation to go on and also answeres his instagram stories. She deleted many texts with him. She sends screenshots of the chat to her friend and says that he is weird. When the friend told her she wanted to talk to her on the phone about the guy, my gf said that its not possible because i was home so she could not talk about the guy. She never told me anything about him although i asked her about the bar and the evenings she went there. I will see her again in two days and i am realy pissed at the moment and dont know what to do next. I think the best thing to do is to wait until i see her and then ask her about the guy and give her a chance to explain herself. I will tell her that i saw his name that morning when she turned the phone away so i dont need to tell her that i logged in her instagram. On the one hand side i dont believe she cheated on me because she tells her friend that he is weird but on the other side she answeres his  messages and even reacts to his stories and hides him from me. I cant sleep those nights and i want to ask her but i want to see her reaction so i dont want to do it on the phone.",25Dec2019,1
17,"I was born in 1989, left handed. I started learning to write at four. My parents saw my left handed writing and, in their infinite wisdom, decided that I should be just like everyone else, or else. They had their reasons, I guess, xenophobic Eastern Europe, early post-soviet era, being generally dumb, all good reasons for this decision. 

So I was forced to use my right hand for everything, quickly lost dexterity in my left hand, and have been right handed for more than 25 years now. I have also been exceptionally clumsy. My handwriting is terrible, I keep dropping shit, my hand shakes a bit, whenever I chop veggies it takes seconds before I cut myself, I can‚Äôt make precise small movements. 

My questions are: is it possible that I‚Äôm clumsy because of the switch, or would I be this way anyways? Can I learn to use left hand at thirty years old without harming my ability to use right one? Can I catch up and gain enough left hand dexterity, or is it too late? Is it possible that my original dominant hand has more dexterity potential?

19,"Hi, I am 22f and I feel as though I keep failing myself. I'll list the things that I feel I have failed: 
- I do not have any friend friends, I always have to put the effort in or else they will never contact me. When we're together they say I'm great and shit but once we part ways it's as though I don't exist and I feel as though I have failed that aspect of life. 
- my relationship is complicated because of outside influences and it feels as though it's another thing I have decided to choose and have just made my life ever harder than it had to be. 
- I do not have a job yet because I'm still studying but I am studying something that I hate and I'm not really even good at. 

That's just some things but I feel as though they are the fundamentals of life and I really fucking suck at life right now. Idk what to do. I guess my advice would be what are some things I could do to just be happier? Likeable? Etc",25Dec2019,1
20,"hi there

thing is, my 2019 has been shit. including attemped rape, emotional abuse, my parents divorcing and trying to drown it all up in alcohol. as a personal thing, i feel fat and ugly, no one really wants to ve friends with me unless they need something. like at school, i dont have a ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù, and im always just in the background. i go to whatever parties and things that people invite me to - but i dont invited to a lot og stuff. its like i have friends but i dont actually matter that much to them anyways. atleast not compared to how i value them...

the only person i want to be with is my boyfriend. i leech on to hum whenever i have the chance because he makes me feel so good about myself and i really love him from the bottom of my heart. he means everything to me. but at the same time it feels like hes the only one i got and im afraid of messing it up resulting in having nobody again. he knows i feel this way but that just kinda makes me feel evern worse for putting pressure on him

so the thing is, i like kinda want to die. but then again i dont want to cause im scared of it, but also im not scared. ive felt this way since i was really young and i guess i just want to dissapear really. dont come with the ‚Äúypur family will miss you‚Äù and ‚Äúits selfish‚Äù cause i fucking know but i still cant get over the fact that happiness is always temporary for me. i work so hard to obtain it but it dissapears immedeatly. i try so hard ro connect with the people i enjoy spending time with, until they someday eg make plans without me and i feel so abandoned and like i cant trust them. idk what the fuck is wrong with me and ive tried to talk about it with my parents and it always ends up in a ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and a hug but its like it doesnt matter to me. like i cant love myself so its irrelevant. im 17 and a frmale btw

i dont know what i want to be or do with my life and i just want to sleep forever and constantly be dreaming cause i cant stop crying

ive tried therapy but it doesnt work. what do i do???? i cant find a hobby that makes me happy cause everytime i try to do something i get upset if its not perfect even though i know perfect takes practice. i dont want to feel this way forever so wtf do i do",25Dec2019,1

22,"My boyfriend and I have been together other 2 years now and my patience for his mother and half-brother is thin now. 
My mother-in-law is a severe alcoholic and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. She can be a mean drunk and she's sent rude text messages at night to me. My boyfriend addressed this with her but she only got extremely defensive. 

My brother-in-law is also an alcoholic and racist - as well as being ""extremely broke"" (supposedly) . He will get into racist rants when he's drunk and it pisses me off. I don't say anything because he gets aggressive when corrected when intoxicated. Recently as well he's been begging my boyfriend for money. He begs my father in law all the time but now has turned to my boyfriend for money. Luckily my boyfriend won't ever give him a lot but the part that drives me insane is when he than turns around and suddenly buys something super expensive.

This account is not 'me' it's just a way for me to ask for help/advice and/or share/vent about stuff without revealing anything about myself.

I identify as a male and I am genetically horrifying to look at, I am naturally ugly with crooked eyes, a fat nose, a 'potato' face, acne on my face and even chest, my mouth moves weird and uneven when i talk, my smile is crooked, my bone structure is not proportional (No I am not just overweight, I am fairly well-trained with a workout routine between 4 to 5 times a week). I am very, very ugly, but I am not an incel if that is what you would call it, I am not virgin, I have had plenty of male and female partners but I am ugly. The bags under my eyes from not sleeping and the scars covering my arms and legs from fights and self harm is not helping either, the loose skin from weight loss and the stretch marks from gaining weight is not helping either.

Help me, help me to accept myself or a way of improving my looks in any way, I am a bisexual masculine man, any tips would help.

30,"My mom was currently diagnosed with dementia and is staying with us now in our new house. My 21-year-old niece (I'm her uncle) was raised by my mom (her grandmother) so we bought a $100 ticket for her to come for break so she could see mom. I picked her up at the bus station at 5:15 am and she was really snappy and irritated because she had to wait for the bus driver to grab her luggage after his 10 min break. I was asking her how her trip went and she just sounded annoyed and said ""great"". She didn't even say thank you. Later that day my mom, niece, and daughter took a walk to the river. In the middle of the walk, my niece turned around and was angrily walking away. My mom was going after her and it ruined our walk. When we met them back at the house I asked my niece, ""Why did you poo on our walk? You kinda ruined it. If you ever do that again we won't take you anymore."" My niece: ""Fine. Whatever."" Then my college-aged daughter snapped at my niece and said, ""Stop the attitude with my dad. He picked you up at 5:15 am!! DON'T TREAT MY FATHER THAT WAY!"" My niece went up to the room we set aside for her at our house.

I went up to her and asked, ""What is this attitude about?"" She says, ""You always treat me like I'm stupid and a kid!"" I said ""Can you find any examples of me doing that? You probably won't be able to because I never did. She didn't say anything and I said, ""See. This is your imagination. If something's wrong just say something. We're both adults so I will talk to you like an adult. We have rules at this house. Sorry about that."" She says ""Look you have no idea about the things I am dealing with!!!"" I'm like ""Don't raise your voice. I can tell you that there are other people who are dealing with much worse than you. Think about what we're dealing with. We're trying to move in sick people to take care of them. We're dealing with people who have real problems. If I didn't care I wouldn't have picked you up.""

31,"So pretty much we bought a 3 piece sectional from Ashley Furniture the Monday before Black Friday. The soonest delivery date was on Dec. 26th. So it was longer than we wanted to wait but because of the holidays we understood and purchased the sectional with about half down.

Alright cool, so we hurried up and had to get rid of our old couch and chair the morning of the 24th. Well come mid day we get a call from an Ashley representative that 2 of the pieces will be shipped on the 26th but the last piece (the main couch piece) is delayed. We have to drag it out of her when the last piece will be here. Finally, she says January...2021. A whole fucking year! We are reasonably upset and try to talk to a manager but she says to call the store we purchased it from. So we do, and it is closed of course.

36,"ok so i need advice,

so my boyfriend of 8 months stood me up. i invited him to this party for 2 months straight and it was an important family gathering for me. i wanted to introduce him to the family and i had told everyone he would show up and i was so excited to introduce him to my entire family. he called me 2 hours before the party saying he wanted to go with his friends to their party beforehand and he'd be a bit late so i was like alright i'll compromise and it felt a little shitty but i could get over it.

later that night i got a text that he was coming over and that he was done at his friends place. cool im so pumped now. and then an hour goes by and he calls me and tells me he'd rather watch the football game at home than come to the party w me. the party was already well into it and i was so heartbroken i wanted to just go home and cry but i had to stay for another hour and i just kinda sat there w my family trying not to cry. my family kept asking me when my boyfriend would show up and i said he was held back at work because i was so embarassed and ashamed that my boyfriend would rather watch the game then come to this event with me.

later i called him and i sobbed and he kept apologizing saying he didn't know it was that important. we've talked for a bit and he's really apologetic but i feel so different from our relationship now. i feel like i barely get to see him and when i do it's so short and i just feel so lonely and my boyfriend helped for a bit but after that it really shattered my heart and i feel so different about our relationship. he keeps telling me he wants to fix it but i dont even know how to feel about trying to continue it anymore. i just need some advice i dont really have anyone to talk to about this.

thanks.",25Dec2019,1
37,"I have been best friend with Niamh (fake name) for about 2 years now but we have know each other for about years. A few months ago she met a guy and they very quickly fell in love. We used to call each other for hours every night and would text all the time. Since she met him we rerely talk and the conversation is always about their relationship and all the nice things he has said about her that day which is really cute but can get annoying when it's the only thing we talk about. Every time we talk she cuts over me and just continues to talk about herself. Another issue that bothers me is that she has mentioned a few things he said along the lines of ""he didn't want me doing that"" or "" he told me I couldn't do that"" which has really bothered me. I voiced my concerns with those comments to her but she said she doesn't mind him talking to her like that. I'm really lost and don't know what to do.

Do you forgive or move on from relationship where they cheated?

I asked him if he knew my reddit user and he said ""No"" but he was on my phone a long time ago on my reddit snooping through.

I am so paranoid because this is like a diary to me and if he is lying (which he does) he knows me in an intimate way I am not comfortable with.

How can I know for sure he doesn't know my user? How can I check my followers? And, I am a head mod at some reddits, should I delete this account?

46,"I've been depressed for well over 2 years now but it's picking up and worsening. I have completely lost motivation to get up in the mornings and will go out of my way to not do so. I recently moved schools and at my new school you only go on campus for 4 hours a week so I don't really have the opportunity to socialize. my parents are sort of racist in the sense that they think all illegal immigrants are killers and psychos and I live in San Diego so I don't really get to go outside with friends. I have two people I can actually call a friend and I lie to them constantly. I've only ever been in small schools or home school so I lie to make up for the fact that I haven't lived much of a life. A lot of kids have stories about crazy shit that happened to them or something but I just don't have that. I never really got to go outside and play in the neighborhood. I was always inside or at one of my two friends' houses. I  I want to go out and be a kid but at the same time I really hate being put into social settings. I still enjoy things but once I actually go to do something I just start to wish I were home. I don't really have a place where I actually want to be. I want to be home but when I am I just wish I could be out, but when I'm out I start to wish I were home. I have talked to my family in the past but they've never taken me seriously. Every time they just assume it's because I'm a teenager and I have a hormone imbalance but even if that's the case how is it helping to just brush it aside like it's nothing? I can't find the courage to ask for help over the fear of being mocked and them just saying it's me being a teenager. On top of that what happens next? I don't want to make my parents shell out hundreds of dollars on a therapist so I can feel a little better. I think it's also important to mention that I'm not suicidal. At least not in the sense that I will actually go thorough with it. I want so badly just to stop existing. To stop feeling anything. Every day I think about how nice it would be if I actually had been able to build up the courage to just prop up a knife and fall face first into it. I know this is counter-intuitive to what I just said but I don't think I'll ever kill myself. I just can't do it. I'm scared of what's on the other end. All my life my parents were Christian and I've always been told that suicide is murder and that you'll go to hell for it. I don't know why I'm even asking the internet and I know most of you are going to say that I should talk to them but if there's any chance, can someone help me find the words to better help them understand how I feel?

I feel I have a very good relationship with her and my wife has an even better one with her (or atleast I thought so, my wife has told her numerous times that we would be more than happy to pay for any birth control or raise a child should she get pregnant and want to keep it). We are pro life and should our daughter have gotten pregnant, we would have done our best to convince her to keep it and support her all the way, but if she still wanted to abort it then we would have let her. A few days ago my wife walked in on our daughter throwing up and having bad diarrhea, she was cold, pale, sweaty, and in a very groggy state. She was taken to the hospital and found to have septicemia, it was revealed she had been pregnant (12-14 weeks) and was too scared to tell us, so she hit her stomach with a hammer over and over again until her baby miscarried, this was about a week ago (according to her atleast). When my wife and I found out we both hugged her tight and told her we loved her very much, but that she didn't have to do that and that we wouldn't have been upset with her. She was crying because she felt bad for not telling us and thought she was mad at us. We are mad at her, to us she just killed our grandkid and hurt out feelings by making us think she thinks she can't trust us. We are not showing our anger because we don't want to ruin our relationship with her or make her recovery more stressful on her. My wife and I feel like shit for making our daughter feel like she couldn't trust us. tomorrow for christmas we are going to put her on skype and have her visit everybody at the party we usually go to, we plan on telling them that she got really sick and is in the hospital and leaving the self abortion part out. As of now, the bill is a little of $10,000 and will get larger as her stay at the hospital goes on. I just want to know, are me and my wife assholes?

After partnering with our Fulfillment Center we have concluded our investigation and have confirmed that the items claimed as returned have not been received by Nordstrom. At this time, Nordstrom has made the decision not to issue a refund or replacement as was requested until the items have arrived at our facility. 

So I contacted the customer service and the responses that I got was: 

**Customer service**: Our team that processes the credit denied the credit. They are not going to issue any credits for this order.

I(24F) have been concerned about my little brother(22M) for sometime. For context, I am currently pursuing a PhD in engineering and my little brother has been living at home with our parents for these past four years. During this time he has been attending a great community college with a strong track record of transferring to the local flagship state school.

However, he has followed a pattern of signing up for classes and then dropping them due to kind of silly reasons, the biggest being he is a perfectionist; anytime he gets a Bad or starts to genuinely struggle with the course material, he just drops the class. It definitely doesn‚Äôt help that our parents cover his class fees, and when he drops those classes they aren‚Äôt refunded. As one can imagine, this is a very frustrating situation for all involved. And it‚Äôs not just me who is concerned- my dad and our paternal grandparents have all expressed concern, and as I haven‚Äôt lived with them since I left for undergrad when I was 18, I feel powerless to reach out to him and offer advice and guidance.

But interestingly enough, within a few meetings, I adore her. She's smart, funny, and just seems like such a kind person, and I just have that weird gut feeling I used to get when I'd meet a girl who'd become a best friend. 

But like I said, I've been not the most social with girls of late, and I'm afraid of coming off desperate or that she'll feel like she has to do stuff with me because she's trying to fit into the family and I've been a part of it for years now.

64,"*LONG POST WARNING*

I was recently on a trip to see my girlfriend for a few days. On the plane home, a woman sat next to me and was very loud and intrusive. In the matter of a few minutes I heard about how she had a very tight vagina, about how she was wild when she was my age (22) and how she is still really wild (mid 40‚Äôs). She told me about how she loves to have sex. I was not being playful or flirty though I was engaging in discussion. Because she was being so in my face, I was pretty monotone. I‚Äôm very committed to my girlfriend, I‚Äôve never cheated on her and would never cheat on her, and I plan to marry her. 

She was on a vacation and to be nice I asked if she had any pics from her vacation and she started to unreservedly show me all of her pictures (in a bikini and a bra). She had a button accidentally undone on her shirt and she looked down and saw it and buttoned it up and I joked that I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about it. And then she unbuttoned that and the button above and told me she was still wearing a swimsuit as she proceeded to show me her bikini. I‚Äôm not going to lie I was very turned on but I did not want to engage with her at all, I just wanted out of the situation but was also aroused. Which made me feel terrible. 

She showed me her tattoo as well that was basically on her lower belly and pelvic area. I do admit I was asking some questions that would make her want to show me more etc. Questions like ‚Äúis your swimsuit still wet, what material is it‚Äù. When she showed me all of it she was feeling the material and I genuinely can‚Äôt remember If I asked to feel the material or if she asked me to, and I did feel the material of her swimsuit and basically feel her boobs. She was super loud about getting wild and stuff and I took my hand away. She asked if I wanted to fuck In the bathroom and I told her no. At this point I had already told her a little bit about my girlfriend. I wanted to avoid her after that because I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen. I put in my headphones and got on my phone. I had also already discreetly texted my girlfriend telling her to pray for me because I was sitting next to a crazy girl. 

This woman then grabbed my hand and placed it inside her swimsuit directly on her bare boob and nipple. She said ‚Äúyou can feel here‚Äù and I said no I can‚Äôt do that and removed my hand and scooted completely away from her. I was in a middle seat and got as far as I could. I felt sick to my stomach. I fell asleep for about 45 min. When I woke up our legs were touching and she was fingering herself under her purse while watching a movie. I was really turned on and not thinking straight because I had just woken up and I sort of rubbed her leg with my leg. I didn‚Äôt do anything with my hands. She had unbuttoned even more and basically taken her boobs (in her bikini out) and she told me she was really hot. She put her hand on my leg and felt my erection outside my pants. She asked if I wanted to touch her and I told her no because I have a girlfriend. She said we should fuck I‚Äôm the bathroom again and told me my girlfriend would never find out. 

Eventually she took her hand off and asked if I wanted her to keep touching me and I told her no, and I scooted away again and avoided her for the rest of the flight. She got up and told me she needed to go to the bathroom to get herself off. 

These are some of the other things I remember her saying to me (which I didn‚Äôt respond to or said no to): 

-Let‚Äôs just go in the bathroom it will take 2 seconds

-I just wanna fuck you so bad

-Will you let me out I gotta go get myself off in the bathroom

-Let‚Äôs just get naked

-Want to fuck in the bathroom, what you don‚Äôt have a condom? 

-Your girlfriend would never know, she wouldn‚Äôt even believe you she would think you‚Äôre crazy

-Thank God for sluts, they ruin the world (in response to me saying I couldn‚Äôt have sex with her bc I had a girlfriend) 

-Can you touch me

-You should‚Äôve brought a condom, you need to start carrying those around

-‚ÄúWe could be doing that‚Äù in reference to a movie sex scene on her tv 

I called my girlfriend as soon as I got off the plane and told her what happened. I was holding in tears and she could tell. I couldn‚Äôt give her complete details as I was still in the airport. My mom was picking me up and I immediately lost it when I got in the car, sobbing. Since then I‚Äôve told my girlfriend more, the only thing she doesn‚Äôt know is that this woman felt my erection. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I feel like I cheated but also I felt like I was harassed and violated. I didn‚Äôt ask for this situation, want it, etc. I told this lady no, I ignored her at points, etc. 

My question from all this is: what do I do? My girlfriend feels like I cheated and is hurt too. I know there are things I could‚Äôve done better and differently and could‚Äôve been more firm with this woman. I just need advice",25Dec2019,1
65,"My little sister (15f) has recently told my mum that she is interested in girls as well as guys. For context, I have been out as bisexual/queer to my parents since I was 17, and they are accepting of it. Without my sister's permission, my mum told all of her friends this development, even though this is something that my sister is very shy about and still working through herself.

I have just heard from my sister tonight that a few months ago my mum had these friends around our house for one of her girl's nights, and they had all been drinking when one of them brought up the topic of my sister's sexuality with my sister (not the group as a whole, it was a side conversation with her). Obviously she wasn't part of the group, but she was around/in the house and got dragged into this. This woman - who has known my sister since she was little - was tipsy, and said something along the lines of ""you're not interested in girls are you, your mum told me you were"" and carried on with that type of questioning, expressing dismay that she doesn't want my sister to turn out to be that kind of person, in a clearly homophobic vein. Panicking, my little sister told her that no, it's was just a phase (note: I'm not here for a discussion on how well my sister handled this - bearing in mind that she was/is a questioning minor terrified of losing the goodwill of a trusted adult), and this woman proceeded to express relief and the same homophobic attitude toward the idea of my sister having a same sex relationship.

This conversation left my sister feeling shamed - shamed for her interest, and shamed for feeling that she had to lie about it.

Apparently, my little sister brought this up with my mum at a later point, who got defensive about her right to tell her friends in the first place, as well as spouting things like 'you shouldn't be ashamed of yourself' as if that justified her right to tell everybody. As far as I know, she has never called her friend up on it. 

I am fuming, with my mum for tolerating someone with these views as her friend, knowing that I am queer, and given her comments to my sister, but of course am mostly furious at my mum's friend for talking to a minor in such a hateful way (no matter the tipsy/light tone in which it was delivered). 

Honestly, I am thrown as to what to. This happened a while ago, but it has clearly impacted my sister a lot as she is pretty reticent when it comes to opening up to me (I live in a different city and we are not as close as I would like - although she knows that I am there for her if she needs to talk about anything). I don't want this woman around my sister, and quite frankly I think that she needs to be called up on her words, however much I don't believe such a callout would get through to her. I don't have her address or number, and would need to go through my mum to get to her.

What should I do?",25Dec2019,1

69,"Around August last year I met a girl online and over time essentially got into a LDR with her. We called and face talked daily playing games together and I eventually flew over to meet up with her last August and we had an amazing time together and got on very well, as we did online.  
Ever since then I moved to uni (last 3 or 4 months) and her life seems relatively the same, however we started talking less and less, despite me being more free to talk at uni. We stopped video chatting nightly and stopped playing together as a whole and she had become straight up unfun and toxic to talk to, which had been a thing for around a month before we met.  
I think about her daily, despite still trying to me on, and he been trying to open up with friends about her and our past to get opinions.  
I'm considering talking to her about the last few troublesome months of our relationship, despite it effectively being dead (however we do share texts every now and then, like a few every couple of days) as it may provide closure, but I'm also worried of reopening old wounds. I'm happy to go back into a relationship with her but only if we can address the problems we had and can work on them, but I'm not sure how to impose this as I'm a heavy ""people pleaser"".  
I've also been seeing a GP and have been considered for ADHD, so this has been messing around in my brain. And I have tests coming up after Christmas break.

84,"I already told the story on another subreddit so I'm just going to copy and paste it because I dont have enough emotional energy after writing it the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

 So I just a crazy turn of events happen last night. I am 16 years old and suffer from Bipolar, an Anxiety disorder, and often suicidal thoughts. Last night, I was trying to talk to my mom about sex and what would she think about me having sex after I turn 17 (In my states of the USA, it would be legal). She started to be rude and upset. This was not my first time asking her this question, but I always just wanted her to change her answer to be something like ""You are going to do it regardless of how I feel. I just want you to be safe,"" but no. She said something similar to ""I dont you having sex while living with me,"" in a lot ruder tone and turn of phrase. We continued to argue for a little while and she brought up a lot of things I do not do. Like how I have a habit of not cleaning my room or doing chores. So she finally said that she did want me to be in her house that night, and since a couple of days prior I met my Uncle for the first since I was in diapers, she wanted me to stay with the home for the night. I was almost hysterically crying, but I pulled my self together somewhat and called my Uncle at 10:30 pm at night. He didn't pick up. So I went into my room, pack some clothes, and started walking for the hour and a half to his house. 30 mins in, my mother started to call me and text me. I never answered the phone calls, but she was texting me things like ""I am so sorry. Please come back!"" and ""Where are you?"" I never answered her texts. This is not her first time where she has gotten really mad and done something really outrageous. Just a few days prior, she told me that I was her biggest stress in her life. Something I was worried about my entire life, but this was her first time kicking me out of the house. Ever since she told me that, I was ready to kill myself. While I was walking to my Uncle's house, I was thinking a few times that I could just walk in traffic and die, but I never did. At some point, my mother found me and started to drive alongside me, trying to talk to me, get into the car and all that. I didn't want to. I did not want to be in the same room, let alone house, with her that night. I would rather be in freezing temperatures where I can see my breath than be in that car. I was just so tired of everything she put me through. She uses all the privileges I have ( such as game consoles, expensive laptop, and art supplies ) to tell me that I am not in any real problems. When I got to my Uncle's house (This would be our 2nd time ever talking to each other btw) it was close 1 am in the morning. I knocked on the door loudly and got the attention of my Uncle. I was expecting him to immediately open the door after I said who I was, but he didn't. Just to let everyone know, my mom was right behind me, in her car. Waiting, for what seems, for me to make a fool out of myself and go back to her and her warm house. My Uncle was not having it that night and asked me for my mom's number. I gave it to him, and he few minutes, he told me to go back to her. Just go home. All of this without opening the door to look me in the face or be in a warm house for a few minutes. I was devastated. He told me multiple times that he would help me out with anything that I needed, and it just felt like I was being pushed to a place I did not think was a good idea to be in at the time. It took me a few minutes, but I walked to my mom's car and knocked on her window. She lowered it, and we talked for a little while. Getting basically nowhere. We were just blaming each other for everything. It was maybe an hour before the cops came. Turns out, my Uncle's neighbor called the cops because of suspicious activity. I didn't know what to do, but the cops came up to us and asked what was going on. I said ""Family troubles"". The cops then asked what kind. I didn't know how to answer that. I was pulled aside from my mother and was asked a lot of questions about what was going on. I explained everything up to that event in very simple terms. One of the officers asked if I knew what happens at night and then explained that It was very dangerous to roam around at night. I said I didn't care, and that it was hard to care about that since I wanted to kill myself. I then told them about the fact that I wanted to walk into traffic and die. They asked me If I still wanted to do that, and I said yes. After that, they started to get ready for me to head to a psychiatric hospital. I was kinda relieved since I was explaining to my mom that I think it was a good idea for me to head there since I was having too many suicidal thoughts, and the fact I had to convince my self not to do it every day. I was searched, cuffed, and was put in the back of a police car. Once we got there, I was searched more, asked a bunch of quests by a nurse and a doctor. I was kind of hoping I was going to stay there for at least a night. I didn't know this, but because I am a minor still, my mother had to give written permission for me to stay there. I was so broken and pissed at hearing that. I had no other choice, but to go back home. After getting home, I passed out at close to 4 am. I no longer want a relationship with my mom, and I'm actively trying to find ways to get out of here without any friends (Since I have no actual friends. I was in an online school since 4th grade) and no family ( Since my Uncle obviously does not want to house me or deal with any of the actual struggles of mine. Not to mention, I can't even face him after this. He is just going to see me as a cry babby run away. )

86,"This year was a great year for my wife and I - Work was great, we adopted this wonderful pup, who got along well with our other dog and cat, we got engaged, and finally in December, we got married. A week after our wedding, we flew to visit family for the holidays, and were looking forward to getting back to our regular life, when something unexpected happened - Our puppy passed away while we were away. Our friend who was pet sitting had called us to tell us that she had thrown up etc, and she had taken her to the vet, and eventually needed surgery to remove a foreign body, and had passed away during surgery. 

It is a devastating feeling - The fact that we weren‚Äôt even able to say goodbye to her. Moreover, all of the previous week had been busy with wedding stuff, and we weren‚Äôt able to spend as much time with her as we normally did, and all of it makes me feel guilty. Everything feels like a bad dream and I want it to end. I feel selfish for going away this early after the wedding, rather than wait a bit to get her normalized etc, and maybe we would‚Äôve noticed her throwing up earlier, and taken her to the vet. I feel a bit angry at our friend who pet-sat, even though she did everything she possibly could‚Äôve done.  Every now and then, I feel close to accepting that this has happened, but looking at random pictures, or even looking at her favorite chair brings all the memories flooding in.

I have never actually grieved for anyone in the past - The most recent death in the family was my grandfather, who was 90+ years old, and I didn‚Äôt have a particularly close relationship with him. I want to know if and when things will be okay, and how to cope with this loss.",25Dec2019,1

Secondly the reason I'm here for advice, I have a so called friend I say this because I found out that she had removed me AGAIN from her Facebook. This time because my hubby flirts with her and I sent her brother a Christmas card (he sent me a card first) but I didn't send her one, I was told by her brother she wasn't sending anyone a card. For the past 40 minutes or so I've had to defend myself as she blamed me for this whole this whole thing, she told me I didn't give her my address when she asked but she didn't ask me once this year, she then said that I've never given her my new address but she sent me a card last Christmas to my new address. She then tried ""your husband flirts with me so you must hate me"" not the case. We both have health problems but each time we talk about them she plays a game of one up, she has to have the worst health and mobility problems. We've been friends for years and she has always created massive fights over nothing.

102,"I‚Äôm in my mid twenties now and ever since I was about 14 she has been very mean to me and most of the time it is without purpose. She yells at me for trying to do basic things, snaps at me if I try to give my opinion, belittles me in front of family and always tried to embarrass me whenever I introduced a boyfriend. I do snap back at her sometimes but only when I have lost my patience but never to a big extent just trying to correct her. I have a sister who she never yells at, speaks to with respect and acts like she is her perfect child. My sister is aware of the treatment and thinks my mom just has some weird issues with me for whatever reason. My parents haven‚Äôt been in the best health the past few years and my sister and I take care of them on top of running my father‚Äôs business because he can‚Äôt anymore. Thankfully I have my own house so I get my space. It‚Äôs getting harder and harder to be around her; when I try to talk to her about how she treats me she just either ignores me or just yells that she doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and doesn‚Äôt stop being on the defensive until I let it go. We do think she has some type of mental disability as she‚Äôs always been very anti social and acts off. Part of the reason I think she is mean to me is I look like her but I cannot think of another reason why she is so nasty to me. Today while I was helping prepare some parts for Christmas lunch for tomorrow she just started telling me how horrible my hair looked and I needed to grow it out like my sister. I have a nicely well groomed bob and I prefer my hair shorter. I almost started crying but just let it go.

103,"I had this dream about a year ago that it was about the rapture. The dream starts off with me in a line with other people that the line goes all the way to my house for some reason, the line goes right through a city that is on fire and burning with people burning and screaming in the fire but the line has a shield that protects us from what is all happening to the world, skip fordward a bit and  i'm right in my house kitchen with other people inside while were all surrounding and listening to this one man in the middle who I believe or think was Jesus or God that he was talking about something but we all couldnt hear what he is saying to us while his mouth moves but no words come out, the dream ends there and then I of course wake up.

I'm struggling to know my own limits, struggling to know what it's possible for me achieve and what isn't. But the truth is that I'm afraid, afraid of not achieving any of my goals, afraid of not being a better person for those who I love. I have too many things that I want to experience in life! But I can't experience all of them. It seems simply impossible or highly unlikely. Could someone at the age of 20 who never played an instrument became the greatest pianist alive???

105,"So for brief context, my partner died at the beginning of the year. They died young, and tragically, and traumatically. We lived together for two years, and at 24 years old I was not only left to try and sort out funerals, families, and official business, but I was also stalked and harassed by ex partners of theirs in the aftermath.

I've been doing better lately, but a sort of friend who I am not very close to decided to get me a gift for Christmas, this was already uncomfortable for me as the package was very large, and they had been talking about it excitedly for weeks, and I didn't think we we're close enough for gift giving at all, never mind one so large and extensively thought out...

When I opened it, it was full of doubles of gifts that I had gotten for my partner in past.   
(Additional context, they loved Red Pandas. They obsessed over them. Almost every gift they ever received was a panda.... I still have the originals of these gifts.)

It really shocked me and hit me very hard when I was trying to keep my spirits up at this time of year. I immediately burst into tears, my housemate came to check on me and immediately noted of the gifts that ""That was a really bad idea""

I know the person that gave them to me is very well meaning and they didnt want to hurt me, and while I'm normally a big advocate of open and clear communication, I really don't know how to broach this with them. We don't talk often at all and they strike me as the type to think a bridge can be built with good intentions... but this is a boundary that will need to be set to prevent further shocks",25Dec2019,1

114,"Gist: My boyfriend is 25m, I'm 26f (year and 2 days older). His younger sister, 20f, is 'emotionally stunted' and dating a much older, potentially drug-addicted man, a month younger than myself, 26m, despite being a straight-edge 15yo on the inside. Last time I saw his sister before this past Thanksgiving college break, she was like an over-attached, vaguely-incestual seeming 10yo to her older brother and wouldn't leave us the f*ck alone, including when we were moaning loudly in a locked room. She came back from break and suddenly seemed to turn 14 and newly (and bitchily) pubescent with an older boyfriend, who has a dubious personal history. My bfs parents only interact with people from their home country, in which girls under their legal age of consent are regularly married off to fully grown adult men, not helped by his mother's family being the coutry's government, which is known for rewriting birth citificates in order to complete said marriages. His parents are punishing him for being concerned for his sister rather than being concerned for her well-being (or his). I also find it worth while to note that he basically raised his sister rather than their parents. It doesn't help that that they hate me for being white, even though his sister's boyfriend's family is hisorically of the same culture as mine (germanic western new york pedo-hick) and also for being older than one day younger than he is. (My immediate modern-day family is upper-middle class and lives 20 minutes from his in Nassau County, Long Island). I don't think I've ever been so angry in my life, SOS!!!

Note: for anyone offended by the term 'third-world', it was the most commonly-understood, far-reaching phrase to describe the situation at hand, so I'm hoping for empathy and understanding and logical advice, thank you!

tl;dr - Boyfriend is being punished for being worried about younger sister (whose emotional understanding is even younger than she is) dating an older man, and his foreign, old-school parents aren't worried for her but punishing him for being so. Their dad admits boyfriend is very smart but his sister is pretty dumb in unrelated conversation.",25Dec2019,1

I've been at the company for 3 years and everything was fantastic at the beginning. It's only over the last year or so that I have been noticing intense double-standards from my boss. It always seems like she says one thing then turns around and expects the other. For example, she tells us to take time off but then is constantly emailing and texting me needing things on my weekends and days off. She also mentions that she does not like micromanaging but needs to have her hands in everything and makes the staff feel like they afraid to make decisions and do things on their own. 

Lately, it seems like she hardly trusts us with anything and keeps increasing pressure on all of us to do more and more when we are already swamped. I especially have been feeling like she takes advantage of me lately as every little thing seems to become my problem to fix (even when it's something that doesn't really involve me). 

I'm at the end of my rope and can't take on much more of this pressure. I'm struggling with whether I'm missing something or if she's always been like this and it hasn't come up until now.

For a year after his speech was a little slurred, had horrible memory was perpetually unsure of what was happening, but after a while this became the stable norm. He could have a conversation, even if the details wouldn't always make sense on account of the memory.

Well, almost 2 years after that stroke, his conditions suddenly got worse and he can barely speak. The slurring is 100xs worse.

The problem is that his mother is in charge of all the medical information and talks to the doctors and case workers. She won't let anyone else in the family have access to the doctors, not even his children, so none of know the specifics of his conditions just that he had the stroke and is suddenly getting worse.

My question is the rest of us, mostly the cousins, are wondering if there is anything we should be suspicious about and what we should do if the mother is not giving us any information. Is it normal for someone who has had a stroke to suddenly get really worse 2 years later after a year of stable condition?

123,"Throwaway here for obvious reasons. 

I moved out into my first apartment earlier this year and have truly been ""adulting"" for the first time in my entire life. Besides living in dorms for college and having an apartment in grad school, this is the first time I've been by myself a few states away from my family. I've met some new people, started a job in my field and have started to figure out who the real me is, etc. It's great.... but also I've been getting real with how my past has shapen my self-worth and confidence. 

The issue is that whenever I come back to visit my family (it takes me about 6 hours to travel back home) it seems the closer I get to reaching home the more vivid past emotional trauma surfaces in my brain from years of shit my mother put me through as a kid. I don't have an issue talking to her on the phone hours away, but when I get home I just can't help but to be cold and hostile to her. 

My earliest memory of my mom is her calling me fat and saying she was embarrassed to be seen in public with me (of course looking back at photos, I was anything *but* that).  She constantly tells me to lose weight and now I'll admit I have weight issues. I have binge eating disorder that no one in my family knows about. I emotionally eat because in a way I used food as I grew up to distract myself from the pain I was going through and it became a terrible habit and now I'm trying to correct these behaviors in my mid-twenties.

My mom and dad used to get into a lot of really bad fights when my sister and I were younger. The two of us would get dragged into these fights and we'd cry so much, my mom would usually leave and drive off somewhere and not come back until my dad had either me or my sister call her to come back home that night. Then the next morning we would go to school acting like nothing had happened the previous night. I think that really fucked me up. Not just the fighting, but then having to push my emotions aside the next morning and not reflecting on what just happened. 

I remember my mom beating me and my sister. One time my sister, who was probably 8 years old at the time, pissed my mom off and she made my sister stand outside in the frigid cold at night with no coat on and I just have this vivid memory of my sister crying looking at me to let her in and my mom threatening me not to help her or else she would hit me. Honestly, I'm tearing up just writing this. I just can't forget that and it's been several years. 

My mom would tell me to die, to go to hell, tried kicking me out for 'talking back' a few times when I was a teenager and told me she wishes she never had me. She also used to always make a point in telling my sister not to be like me when she grows up (she said this when I was high school, so I hadn't even 'grown up' myself yet...). My sister and I are now very close and she understands the abuse my mom put me through and always sticks up for me -- even to this day. 

How do I stop letting these emotions resurface every time I come home and visit my family? I've already caused one fight between my mom and I since I've been home for the holidays that I'll admit was caused by me being completely cold to her. Have any of you gone through something similar? 

Thank you.",25Dec2019,1
124,"First of all, Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas, hope you guys are having a nice time, although reading this thread I guess some people aren't. 

So I had a crush on this girl my junior year of high school. It was pretty apparent that she felt the same, but basically I fucked up (not gonna dwell into how) and she started dating a friend senior year. She was a pretty close friend in high school, so basically every time I saw her in class or whatever, I just kinda swallowed my feelings until it was in a pit, and I never told her how I felt. I was just like whatever man, just move on with your life.

Fast forward two years, and I haven't moved on a single bit. Now I attend the University of Washington and she stayed in Michigan going to UofM. She had broken up with her boyfriend, and before Christmas break we were talking of meeting up yada yada. We have, and I feel the exact same. She seems really excited to hangout and everything, but I'm leaving again to Washington soon. I still have this mask on whenever I see her, and when I go to sleep that pit I talked about hurts. I've liked other people but they all went away, but this one just continues to stay with me and I wish I could do something about it. Telling her about my feelings is not the move in my opinion, because she broke up with her boyfriend relatively recently (month or two ago) and I'm gonna be all the way in Washington so I'm really just stuck.

I'm thinking of transferring to UofM (out of state tuition hurts bruh) and she gets really excited when I talk about transferring to a Michigan school.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way I didn‚Äôt Say anything. she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",25Dec2019,1

136,"Am I truly dead inside yet? Am I just an empty body which consumes resources as it makes its steady decline. My life is a fucking shit show of misfortune. So many people I was ecstatic to have in my life are gone. The same people that made me laugh no matter what. Why is it I form connections with people that are reckless? Drunk drivers, drug users, ex-convicts. Only a few of the types I have associated myself with in the past. Is it to add more excitement to my life?

My dad's last five years were spend confined to a wheelchair. Death came swiftly. At first it was a simple cold, which rapidly turned into a terrible case of pneumonia and within a week he was dead. It happened only a few months ago. Being by his side for the last few days brought along a roller coaster of emotions. Fear, sorrow, and panic in ways more intense than I have ever experienced.

My mom no longer has control over her muscles, and as a result the only way I can see her smile is by looking at old photographs. No matter how much control she loses I can always understand her by looking into her frayed eyes. The eyes that had seen so much but now were limited to a whitewashed room.

First off, I know this maybe something that doesn't feel like a big deal but I just really need someone to listen and understand me. (thank you in advance)

I am a doctor from a foreign country, studying for an exam (a huge exam) that would let me work in the US. I've been studying for almost 2 years now, on and off. I had a lot of distractions in between but other than that I've been working hard. I've moved my date for my exam a bunch of times, solely because I was underprepared. My parents, who have been so supportive, didn't understand why I was moving it. They're not physicians, so they don't understand how difficult this whole journey has been for me. Anyway, I'm scheduled to take my exam in a week, and I'm super unprepared. I want to take another month and a half to study. It doesn't make much of a difference in the long run. 

The problem is, the last time I moved my test, they were SO upset. They acted as if I failed and I brought so much dishonor to our family but eventually they got over it. Now, I'm here and I don't know how to tell them that I'm changing the date of my exam again without them making me feel like I'm complete trash. I just need some advice on how to tell them.

It's not personal but it's incredibly lonely for me here because the friends I do make, all seem to move away because they don't like it here either! I also hate the weather. It is very cold here and I have seasonal depression which makes it difficult to live my life since we only get about 5 months of sunshine a year, the other 7 I'm basically fucked. 

I moved away over the summer but I had to come back because my job fell through and so I have been living at my parents. I'm 23. I was just kind of figuring my shit out and working different jobs. I have decided I want to finish my degree and I want to move out to Arizona to do it. It seems like a good fit for not only my career goals but also my lifestyle. I think I'll be really happy out there. I applied to the school, found an apartment and signed a lease. I am going out there in January but I haven't talked to my family about it yet. 

They are gonna say I am being impulsive and I can see why they would say that- but for me it's now or never. I am between jobs and I either leave this state or I get another job that holds me back. I need to go! How do I leave on my own terms but make sure they don't hate me for it. We aren't close and that's part of why I don't like it here either.

He invites me everywhere, drives me everywhere, texts me all the time and we share the same interest. I'm not interested in him. I simply can't comprehend how it got this far. I confessed this to my friend a bit soon, but she would've suspected things otherwise and I don't want to drag this situation along ending up in a position that's far worse.

After about a year I have only come to realize that trying to bury the emotions have done nothing and they have only grown stronger. And in recent I learned that she isn't gay, but bi. And in other light the relationship while strong in places has a few giant holes. I am close friends with both members and one is polygamous and the one I have fallen for isn't. After talking to them individually about their problem neither wants to budge on their stance while neither wants the relationship to end. I have talked to the polygamous one about my feelings towards her girlfriend (who has absolutely no idea as far as I know). And she told me effectively that it is a tough situation and she would forgive me for pursuing it. This has been a thorn in their relationship for a better portion of a year.

158,"Apologies for format, I‚Äôm on mobile.

My girlfriend (F19), we will call her Amber, and I (F18) have been together for about 3 months now, and it was pretty soon after her and her ex, who we will call Jane, broke up. They were together for around 2 years. Towards the end, it was not a good relationship and Jane was very emotionally abusive by invalidating and making fun of Amber‚Äôs mental illnesses. My girlfriend has very homophobic parents that have still not completely accepted her being gay despite being out of the closet for the past 6 years. Amber‚Äôs parents only started to like Jane about a year into their relationship and when they broke up, her parents were reluctant to move on as they had built a relationship with Jane. Now Amber and I are in a serious committed relationship and she doesn‚Äôt talk to Jane at all anymore. The problem is that Jane still talks to Amber‚Äôs parents frequently and continues to have an ongoing relationship with them. This causes Amber‚Äôs parents to bring her up a lot, and Jane even sometimes comes over to their house to talk with them while Amber is out. What pisses me off is that Jane is in a whole new relationship too, so there is absolutely no reason for her to continue trying to talk to Amber.

I just found out that Jane came over to Amber‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs house while they were spending time together on Christmas Eve. She had dropped off presents for Amber‚Äôs parents AND for her. She got her a pride t-shirt and flag and some lotto tickets. The only reason that Jane is somewhat in Amber‚Äôs life still is because her parents refuse to move on and continue to allow Jane to be around. It feels like Jane is still avidly trying to get back into Amber‚Äôs life romantically. I feel like there is no reason for Jane to continue talking to Amber‚Äôs parents as frequently as she does if that weren‚Äôt the case. Jane comes up to her all the time at our university and tries to talk. She will text her and ask why she isn‚Äôt responding. I have asked Amber not to talk to her because I have a history with my partners cheating and she has willingly accepted and understood so she doesn‚Äôt talk to her.

Amber‚Äôs parents do not want to get to know me because they liked Jane so much and are convinced that they will end up back together. I have absolutely no intentions of leaving Amber anytime soon and I am positive she feels the same, otherwise she wouldn‚Äôt be as honest with me about what her ex does as she is. An issue that Amber has is that her parents are extremely controlling and overbearing and will force her to be nice to Jane and exchange pleasantries when she is around. They even forced her to open Jane‚Äôs Christmas gift and watched her do it. She doesn‚Äôt see a way to avoid this from her parents considering she lives with them (she is saving to move out) and because of the way that they are.

I need advice on how to deal with this situation in the meantime. What is there that I can do to? I feel so helpless just watching my girlfriend‚Äôs parents force this person back into her life when neither of us want her there. I don‚Äôt understand why Jane would even give her a Christmas present when she herself has a new girlfriend. The only reason she is still around is because of Amber‚Äôs parents. I am very frustrated and I just want Jane to leave my girlfriend alone. 

Tldr: Girlfriend‚Äôs ex continues to try to be in her life and her parents facilitate conversation between them. Ex got her a Christmas present, I think that is crossing boundaries. How do I deal with/fix this problem?",25Dec2019,1

For example today. I tried putting myself out there and be more social and when I did, something someone said and their tone just threw me off. It made me feel like they were judging me. Maybe this isn't so, but I always feel this way. I always feel as tho, everyone is judging me and my every move.

She drunkenly admitted that she hated how one of her sisters was the pretty one, one was the smart one, and she was the other one. 

I've tried to be understanding. Ever since then I've made an effort to stop being an insufferable know-it-all. I didn't realize the negative impact this trait had until she mentioned it but I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings or be viewed in a negative light. But that didn't help. 

She's been getting worse as she gets older, she's just so angry and vile all the time and it's gotten to where I can't stand to be around her. She also HATES talking about anything emotional or any conversation where we might try to resolve our grievances. She absolutely refuses to voice when something someone does upsets her and instead holds on to it until the weight of all these issues crumples her and she lashes out. 

I can't talk to her, I can't make her happy by changing my actions, and she refuses to even tell me most of the time when or why she's upset. I'm at my wits end with her. It's gotten to the point that I'm just about to cut her off completely for my own sanity.

Cut to today, Christmas Eve and she‚Äôs looking for the bottle that I stole to make drinks, and because she‚Äôs always told me to tell her the truth and she won‚Äôt be mad (which is a lie anyway) I decided to (hopefully) dodge a bullet and tell her straight when she asked, yes I did take it.

It's to the point where, if I didn't have a four wheel drive vehicle, I probably would have gotten stuck in the mud by now. I tried asking the neighbors to be a little more considerate, I contacted the landlord and told him what's going on, I even got a little passive aggressive and parked like a dick right back (that backfired), but nothing has changed. 

I (angrily) swore last week that the next time he shows up and parks like this, I'd call the towing service and have him towed, except this little voice in the back of my head keeps nagging me that it wouldn't help the situation and I would just wind up as ""that neighbor"". I have a four wheel drive truck so its not like parking in the grass is hurting me really... 

Does anyone have any suggestions or should I just go ahead and call the damn tow company? (I'm also starting to wonder if he can claim Tenant Rights since he's here so frequently...)",25Dec2019,1

174,"I little info before hand, i  have an older brother who is really into this Tartaria, mud flood, star forts and church‚Äôs spirals stuff. 
So Im really skeptical of what he‚Äôs saying but i also want to know why i don‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôs s saying. A lot of his stuff seems like possible but implausible explanation for things that are easily explained by other means. However i dont have any knowledge of counter arguments to what he‚Äôs saying. On the other had if anyone has solid proof for any of this stuff id be glad to hear about that too.

Specifics 
Whats with the star forts thing, my brother said that, how is it possible that the exact same structural shape is present all over the world. His explanation is the empire of Tartaria from which the star fort comes from. Im thinking man, doesn‚Äôt the star fort come from europe or europeans, also the star shape is pretty universal, its not crazy to think more than one or two people came up with that idea(because it works so well)

Whats with the church spirals and all that energy stuff. Essentially he‚Äôs saying that why would people put useless spirals on church‚Äôs if not for harnessing energy. My thought is dude its a beautiful shape, lots of structures have no practical value other than to show wealth and praise to something.

Maybe im lazy to not search this all by myself but hey whats reddit for.

I confronted him about it and he told me it was nothing to worry about.. I didn‚Äôt question it too much until I told his cousin about it and she told me that was her 14 year old cousin.. I told her to message her and send screenshots of their conversation if they ever talk. Well sure shit, she comes into work a couple weeks later and says I have something to show you. She shows me the screenshot of him attempting to sext with her. This isn‚Äôt the first time either . It‚Äôs happened 4 or 5 times before. I‚Äôve forgiven and forgotten so many times because of the past he‚Äôs had.

176,"So let‚Äôs start off by saying, this is my first pregnancy scare (F25). 

My bf (M32) has been very outspoken about the fact that when I go to doctor, and if I am actually pregnant, he would like for me to have an abortion. 

We have spoken about unplanned pregnancies before this, and I‚Äôve always said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready to have a child‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have a child yet‚Äù. And he‚Äôs agreed. He‚Äôs always told me ‚ÄúI want you to be the mother of my future children‚Äù. Which is sweet. He has also told me that he wants to wait another 5 years to have a child, that way he will be done with his masters, and have money. And I get that. I seriously do. But yesterday we had a conversation about what we would do if we find out we are pregnant. And I told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. One thing is talking about it, and another is actually doing it. I would have to think about it‚Äù. 

He then told me ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt do that. You can‚Äôt say one thing, then decide on another. I thought we were on the same page with this. Just know if you decide the opposite, I will grow to resent you.‚Äù  

I didn‚Äôt respond  to that. I just sorta shoved my face with food, and walked away. 

I just know I‚Äôm not ready to have a child. Neither of us are remotely ready financially. Perhaps I‚Äôm being a little emotional right now, but I feel he‚Äôs putting his wants before mine? (Which is normal. I get it) Like I feel when it comes to a future child it has to be on his terms?  

Logically the answer would probably be abortion. I mean combined we have $50 to our names right now. 

But... if I decide against abortion, would I be throwing the relationship away? What are your thoughts? I have nobody I can talk to about this. And I created this new account here so that it can‚Äôt be traced back to me.  I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm torn about the impending decision, or his response to mine.

Two of my friends are on the outs. Friend P has decided to take some space from her friendship with friend M. Friend M has been out of the country for the last month. In the meantime the rest of us have planned our holiday and not really considered friend M because she is not a core member of our friend group. Well, friend M is back and has inquired about spending Christmas with us at our house. I'm in an awkward position because I don't want anyone to have to spend Christmas alone or to have to be in the middle of drama that doesn't have anything to do with me. Friend P has already said that she just won't come if friend M is here. I haven't told friend M what our exact plans are yet because I'm stalling. 

What is the most diplomatic way to handle this situation?

Backstory- friend M is an older woman that I consider family. She is an incredibly difficult, but sweet and well meaning person.  Pretty much everyone that has had a relationship with the her has needed to take a break from her at some point. Myself included.

182,"This was a rollercoaster of an evening. First, it‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs birthday. Second, I have known for a few years she‚Äôs had a drinking problem but haven‚Äôt known how to talk to her about it. I‚Äôve confronted her a few times and she‚Äôs shut down. Now, I basically don‚Äôt talk to her after 8pm as a rule. I get too frustrated with her, say something mean, and we get mad at each other. 

My husband and I were over for her birthday tonight. I tend to keep track of her drinking - she was 6 drinks in, and we were opening Christmas gifts (we always do the night before), when she seemed kind of weird. Couldn‚Äôt talk, couldn‚Äôt read, couldn‚Äôt walk. She seemed to be falling over too. She stumbled to the bathroom, where I followed her and lurked outside. She fell in the bathtub (loudly) and so I went to help. She is thankfully OK, but she immediately started crying and got incredibly embarrassed. I put her to bed and kept checking on her. 

Now here‚Äôs the crazy part, after this happens my dad says, ‚Äúoh didn‚Äôt you know she uses prednisone?‚Äù ‚Äî well apparently she has been using low doses (5-10mg) for SIX YEARS since my grandfather died. So the weird, out-of-it drunkenness? Alcohol interacting with a prescription drug. (Which, relevant, she has the ability to prescribe for herself)

So apparently this has been going on for 6 years and while I just thought it was alcohol abuse, there‚Äôs medication involved too. Granted it‚Äôs not the worst drug out there, but the long-term effects look terrifying. 

Tomorrow (Christmas! Yay!) my husband and I are planning to just tell her last night was super scary and we don‚Äôt want her to ever drink while on that medication around us again, and that we‚Äôd prefer she went to a doctor about it. What else should we be doing?? She‚Äôs extremely sensitive and strong actions like taking away her prednisone/alcohol or saying she needs therapy or even rehab would *not* go well with her. (TBH my dad seemed terrified that she was going to be pissed with him for even telling me) 

TL;DR: discovered mother‚Äôs prescription drug abuse tonight, have to talk about it tomorrow but she‚Äôs a gentle soul. How to approach? What to do?",25Dec2019,1
183,"It ruins my day every time we visit and my wife thinks it's OK and defends the mom as ""that's just her way, she won't change.""

Some context - 3 kids, two are 8, one is 6. The wife is Chinese, the dad is American. My wife is Chinese and used to be a live-in nanny for the family. 

  
The parents have no parenting style. The dad literally just says ""Alex, you think about what you just did and why you shouldn't do that, figure it out, you can't do that."" And that's it. Doesn't explain shit or teach. Doesn't discipline or show authority. Same with the mom. She tries to bribe them with toys or straight up money, or fake, empty threats of taking away toys and allowance money.   


It's sickening to watch, the kids don't listen to them or the instruction of any adult. They rudely talk back to their parents and when told to go to bed they reply with ""YOU SHOULD GO TO BED DAD YOU'RE OLD"". They tell their mom that the food she cooked for Christmas tastes like garbage and refuse to eat it. They'll punch or hit people (me...) as hard as they can if they're upset about something. Or when they're playful, they'll run up to people (me....) and scream in your ear as loud as they can while you're eating to scare and stress you out. Right in front of the parents, who don't do shit about it. Ever.   


Today may have been the last straw, I guess confession bear time - I lightly smacked the little boy when he screamed into my ear and told him that while his mom won't do anything I won't put up with it anymore and if he does that again it'd be the last time. He chilled WAY the fuck down because I guess it was unexpected and the mom was concerned if I hit him hard, asked the boy and he told her no I just tapped him gently (which is true).  when the other fat boy punched me I simply punched him back and asked how does he like being hit.  


Would be real sad if my marriage came to an end but I'm pretty sure my wife will defend the woman and the kids. I don't want to visit them every month just because she and they are close friends and I don't want my wife to have that kind of shitty parenting ""style"" either, which I'm concerned about.   


How would you deal with this situation? Tell the mom I don't like going there because of her kids behavior and deal with the fallout? Say nothing and just not go and deal with my wife being upset? Flat out divorce the woman and break with the family and move on with my life? Yeah I'm that tired of that family and their brat kids....

I am 20 and feel old and lost and like I already had the glory days and they're gone. I am very maculine looking I started testosterone and my freshmen year I was femme and pretty. I had so many memories freshmen year of college. We ran into a sugar daddy that ended up in a sorta car chase thing, this girl was on some wild sort of substance and there was a brawl type fight in our dorm as we watched, we befriended a wild stripper and went to her house parties, we went to some random people's 21st birthday, I joined a sorority for three weeks and went to a paitn swap, I fell in love, and attended parties of random tinder matches. We have so many stories and absolutely NOTHING has happened this semester. I think it is because I am trans/ugly and no one wants to hang out with me and has made me regret my life. I feel like I already had my glory days and I am starting to feel old. I wanna join some sort of greek life like a sorority/frat to make me feel part of something again.

I was closeted in a small, private Christian school and felt so different from all the kids there and was smothered with political agenda, wayward beliefs, and all I ever wanted was to be like all my normal friends who went to normal high school. I also homeschooled for three years and met some good friends all of whom I do not really speak to other than one person who has remained my rock.

190,"I‚Äôm going to pour out my story here because right now I have no one to talk to about this.

It all started because I (a female) am very good friends with a boy. We like each other, yes, but we both agreed to remain friends for the time being.

He‚Äôs probably my best friend right now. We talk a lot, texts here and there throughout the day. He‚Äôs also probably my only real friend that I physically see.

My parents are those people that believe I shouldn‚Äôt date until I‚Äôm 20, all my friends should be girls, no seeing boys unless absolutely necessary, etc.

I was so afraid of losing my friend that I didn‚Äôt tell my parents about him. 

But my parents found out, and they thought I‚Äôm doing something ‚Äúbad‚Äù because I‚Äôm hiding it.

We‚Äôre fricking harmless. We send each other silly kitten videos and memes and just, you know, talk. My parents saw this (by reading my phone) and I was ok with the compromise my dad came up with. I was actually fine with the compromise. No talking after 9 (my dads afraid I‚Äôm gonna send nudes even though I‚Äôm too self-conscious to wear short sleeved tshirts without a hoodie) and no talking before school. Annoying, but understandable.

But then today they told me, ‚ÄúThe rules are changing. No talking to boys. You can talk to him at school, but no texting.‚Äù

I‚Äôm crying just typing this out. This is my only friend. This is the one person I talk to. This is one of very few people that makes me smile. And they just banned me from him.

And then they didn‚Äôt understand when I was upset. I tried to explain. ‚ÄúYou basically just told me to stop talking to [insert name of my best friend from before the big move.]‚Äù

But they aren‚Äôt budging. They said, ‚Äúthis is different.‚Äù Why? Because he has a penis? I just want to be his friend. They accused him of, ‚Äúblowing up my phone,‚Äù even though I was the one who texted him FIRST and I was the one WHO ASKED HIM A QUESTION THAT HE SIMPLY ANSWERED. He sent two texts. Two. But when my friends from across the country send me 50 texts at once, it‚Äôs fine.

So I just basically lost my one friend since we moved across the country, and I have no one to turn to. I even told them this. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs your only friend you need to make more friends.‚Äù

I‚Äôve cried so much over this, Im crying right now. It hurts so much. We didn‚Äôt do anything. I wanted to kill myself.

I could get an education and get a good job, but no one will hire me if I haven't done fast food or retail first.  I also need to get a job before and during that education.  I just have no idea what to do.  My only options are working at McDonald's or a grocery store, but I can't do either of those because I don't have the mental capacity.  I honestly have no idea what to do.  

TLDR; I can't do retail or fast food jobs because I can't work around people, handle stress, or multitask.",25Dec2019,1
200,"Long story short, I met a dude on the internet about 5 years ago. We‚Äôve been best friends for 3, dating for 1+1/2.  He‚Äôs 19M from TN, I‚Äôm 18F from CA. Yes I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs real and I‚Äôm not being catfished. 

I told my parents about him 6 months ago. They weren‚Äôt happy and they‚Äôre not happy now. My parents pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist and urge me to get a boyfriend even though I already have one. So far, I‚Äôve tried to convince them to let me see him, but to no avail, and his parents are the same way. 

I have a lot of money from working, I have a passport, I have time, and I have friends who‚Äôd be willing to come with me. Sometimes I wonder if I should just buy a plane ticket and make a run for it. Visit him for a week. Stay at his place, or stay at a hotel nearby with some friends. 

The only reason that I won‚Äôt is because my parents will actually take me off their will if I do, and I think I have a sizable inheritance which would be extremely dumb to give up. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to convince my parents to meet my LD boyfriend?",25Dec2019,1

202,"I initially considered writing what was pretty much a massive essay, describing my background and all the shit leading up this but ultimately it seemed unnecessary and overly dramatic, so I skipped it and decided to just describe my current situation. This all being in an attempt to get some clarity on what the fuck is wrong with me, and why I do what I do.

So, I've had contact with psychiatrists for several years due to me not being the most stable of individuals. During my younger years they were puzzled as to what was going on. But as I've grown older, through my teen years and into adulthood two ideas have been mentioned several times. Some form of personality disorder, such as sociopathy and schizophrenia.

I've been told to go to a clinic where they can properly diagnose for this, but have feared to do so as I feel like even it's true the confirmation will change how I act. I'm scared that knowing that I am a sociopath will mean there are things I cannot have in life or that being schizophrenic will mean that I'm insane.

The part that scares me is that I feel like it's entirely possible as I spent a lot of time trying to do what I think is ""good"" and ""right"", but deep down I lack any real feeling for any of it. I react, as far as others would say, oddly to things that should cause distress, sadness or worry. I've always find it easy to hurt others, when I feel they deserve it, this until my adults years always felt like justice, but now I feel that really it's just the fact that I enjoy ruining things for people that slight me.

So, as for the advice. I may write a longer post at a later date when I have the energy for it, but, based of the shitty and short description does anyone thing that I need worry that I'm sociopathic or schizophrenic?",25Dec2019,1

The dream starts off me with me rescueing a little girl from a grizzly bear on a bicycle, I try my best to get as far away from the grizzly bear as I can but no matter how fast I pedal the grizzly bear always seems to be able to stay caught up with us,     I pedal and pedal as fast as I could that i'm pushing the bicycle to its limit, the grizzly bear somehow gets so close that I could feel its nose on my back, thinking for a moment that were about to die, the grizzly bear for some reason stops and dissapears, thinking were safe, I pedal hard and fast to get to a safe distance from the  grizzly, I stop and thinking that were safe from the grizzly bear that I check to make sure that the little girl is alright but when I do check on her, I find her gone, panicking and thinking something terrible has happen to her that I go back to go try to find her and save her from the grizzly bear, I look and look but I cannot find her anywhere, many years later have passed by since I could never fond the little girl that I rescued from the grizzly bear, later on I find myself sitting in a church thinking of what happened and blaming myself for all what happened to the little girl, the pain and loss hurt so bad that I breakdown crying because it hurt so bad.

I‚Äôve met people who are so full of life ..they are so interesting and inside they are full of stories about experiences they‚Äôve had. 

I have none as I have never done anything. I‚Äôm not a risk taker or adventurer. 

I struggle with anxiety and depression and I never feel like doing anything. I also do not have friends to try anything new with.

208,"Hey! I have concerns about wondering if it's alright to not have any hobbies in life.

Don't get me wrong, I've had plenty of hobbies in life. Mainly writing poetry, making music, and playing basketball. Other things I've tried out are also playing guitar, working out, singing, making art, reading, and photography.

But for some reason, my hobbies get boring and become more like a chore. I didn't enjoy trying to grind out on playing guitar all day and started to not look forward to it. Writing music became boring and all my songs started sounding the same. Basketball became something I was no longer interested in. 

And now it seems all I do is go to work, go to school, spend time with friends or family here and there, and hang out at home.

I get very bored with my life, but I also get very bored of hobbies and don't want to do them.

But I feel that if I don't have any hobbies, I will become an un-interesting person and nothing will make me stand out to other people. But it seems like every time I start enjoying something, I stop enjoying it and it becomes more of a chore.

So is it alright to not have any hobbies? How do I get past the boredom of life? And why is it that I am always falling into this mindset of enjoying something, only for it to become a chore and I begin to lose the fun in it?

Hoping to get some thought-provoking answers on this! Thank you:)",25Dec2019,1
210,"Let me start by saying I‚Äôm 23 and I live on my own but I still do holidays with my parents and receive some support from them as I finish up school and get started in my career. 

Every single year on every major holiday or vacation since I was a teenager it‚Äôs been a fight with my mom about what is allowed to be posted on Facebook. I hate not having any control over what of my private life is made public. I love social media and all but I‚Äôm really particular about what my real name is attached to. I have a rare name with a unique spelling so I‚Äôm the only person that comes up when it‚Äôs googled so everything about me is found super quickly and easily. 

I would really like to run my own architecture firm. My general impression so far is that many designers are very judgmental and picky about outward appearances. I do not want anyone to be able to access pictures of me in my matching pajamas in charcoal face masks with my family. It‚Äôs cute and I like taking the pictures but I don‚Äôt want anything online that could lead to me being taken less seriously. 

Also it ruins the fun of matching and being silly, knowing that I‚Äôll have to fight to keep the pictures from being posted on Facebook. I really do act like myself with no inhibitions to goof around with my family so I feel really vulnerable and violated knowing that any stranger can access these pictures. Even if my name isn‚Äôt tagged, it‚Äôs not difficult to navigate to my mom‚Äôs profile since she tags me in interesting article. I don‚Äôt have a lot of activity there from other people or myself since I mostly use Instagram so her name is featured very prominently. 

The conversation will be awkward no matter what and my mom genuinely thinks that my concern only comes from a place of a bad body image. It‚Äôs a factor but I don‚Äôt think that negates my right to privacy. I don‚Äôt want her to take it personally but she is really sensitive about it because as a teenager, I handled the issue in an immature and inarticulate way. 

I‚Äôm considering changing my name on Facebook to a different spelling which will also lead to some awkwardness. I‚Äôve mentioned it before and it turned into a guilt trip about how I am ashamed of my super fun special (/s) name or that I‚Äôm ashamed of my family.

To be perfectly honest, my parents do have a lot of weird issues with privacy regarding me and my siblings. Every single right of privacy I have has been taken with a massive and tiring struggle (even though I am an adult) with finances being held to keep in check. I‚Äôm working on being more financially independent but I don‚Äôt want to lose my relationship with my mom just because she isn‚Äôt paying for me so I‚Äôd rather not make it into fight. 

TLDR: I don‚Äôt want my mom to post my goofy pictures on Facebook and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her so that she‚Äôll understand.",25Dec2019,1

212,"I live in an apartment, and I have neighbors that are extremely rude. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the apartment below me, or the one on the other side of my bedroom, but after tonight I‚Äôm pretty confident it‚Äôs the people below me based off what I know about them and what I‚Äôve heard tonight. 

As I write this, it‚Äôs currently 12:40 a.m. Christmas Day. I‚Äôve been awake for almost 20 hours. I finally get to bed and get to fall asleep and I‚Äôm woken up by my neighbors screaming at each other so loudly, I can hear what they say. They‚Äôve been doing this almost every other night for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs just getting worse. The last time this happened the wife/girlfriend (I‚Äôve never met them, but she kept screaming something about wedding rings tonight), she slammed the door to their apartment so hard, I could hear my rattling furniture (the doors to our individual apartments are heavy and close hard on their own, but when they‚Äôre slammed, it‚Äôs LOUD). Tonight, there was screaming and shouting and they just kept getting louder and louder and louder and slamming things so hard my whole freaking room was shaking/felt like a small earthquake. Their fighting woke me up and now I‚Äôm too anxious that it‚Äôll start up again (because they‚Äôve been at this off and on for over and hour now) to be able to fall asleep again. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure they have a new baby ~2 months old, because I hear a baby cry all the time and I know it isn‚Äôt my next door neighbors, and the wife/girlfriend‚Äôs voice sounds like the voice that talks to the baby. Their baby used to cry all the time and they did nothing about it. She‚Äôd just be kinda rude to her baby and tell her (I could hear her clear enough to tell it was a girl by the name and the fact the wife/girlfriend saying something to her boyfriend/husband that ‚Äúshe won‚Äôt stop crying‚Äù) to stop crying. She‚Äôs always sound so frustrated with her baby (this was a month ago almost) and say things like ‚Äújeez STOP crying already!‚Äù Or ‚Äúokay that‚Äôs enough. STOP! I don‚Äôt want to hear it anymore!!!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Their constant arguing is seriously disrupting my sleep. Whenever they fight, it *never* happens any earlier than 10:30 at night. They‚Äôre always loud and rude. When they aren‚Äôt fighting, they have a dog the put in a kennel and it whines and cries for hours. The poor dog has such a high pitched cry that I hear it every time. When the dog isn‚Äôt whining, they‚Äôre blasting music and have the bass so high, my floor vibrates. That‚Äôs what happened tonight, before the fighting started. They had it blaring until right after 11 pm, and things were quiet until about quarter after and that‚Äôs when they started fighting. They‚Äôre STILL fighting. One or both of them have the habit of blasting their TV in the middle of the night, waking me up. 

Do I go down there and kindly ask them to keep it down? Do I have to just endure this and accept it as apartment life? They‚Äôve only lived here since the middle of October, and there hasn‚Äôt been any issues with any other neighbors. I can‚Äôt sleep with those doors being slammed constantly like they are. It‚Äôs hard to accurately portray how heavy the front doors are to be enough to shake my room, but it‚Äôs bad.

To clarify, I briefly had a crush on him a long time ago, but there‚Äôs absolutely no romantic feeling between us now. We‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs girlfriend/boyfriend.

I was in his city for a few days last week. I let him know in advance, and he suggested that we meet for dinner including his friend. I thought it would be nice to get to know her, and said sure.

Since they had to go to a show, they wanted to meet for lunch instead. I had made a plan to go visit a town nearby during the day, so we ended up meeting for dinner after the show.

His friend was very talkative and dominated the conversation most of the time. She also said something mean about my background while he stepped out to take a phone call.

I feel like we didn‚Äôt get to catch up at all. After we said good bye to her, he didn‚Äôt even suggest that we get a drink or coffee somewhere else. We don‚Äôt get to see each other very often, so I feel hurt and think he acted a bit distant this time. When we saw each other in summer, he was not like this.

I think I need to be considerate of his situation as he might have been busy or feeling bad. However, I just feel hurt snd got an impression that he was not really interested in seeing me this time. We don‚Äôt even live in the same continent.

Anyways, this one specific ‚Äúfriend‚Äù always seems to paint herself as the victim whenever being confronted about a situation, even when it‚Äôs very clear that she is in the wrong.

She still doesn't have a job even though there were PLENTY of opportunities, and a few days ago her car payment was due ($310) and she asked if I could pay it with my paycheck and I told her I'm not since it's her car and she needs to pay it.

This all began when my girlfriend of 2 years cheated on me with one of my best friends, broke up with me, and started dating him the next day. As you can probably guess, this tore my life and my friend group apart. Pretty much all of my friends (friends I've literally known since first grade) took their side and left me to fall into a deep depression for months. My closest friends never really thought to ask if I was okay, and nobody bothered to lend a hand to me. Still to this day, I'm forced to be in the same friend group with the ex girlfriend that cheated on me with my ex friend because they're the only friend group I have. I have nobody else to go to.

I think about how I wasn't good enough for her and how she left me for someone I trusted. Due to the depression this caused, my grades fell and I was grounded. I'm still grounded and cannot hang out with friends at all. This just makes me even more depressed and I feel like I'll never be the same again.

I love her so much and we do everything together, from midnight WalMart runs, to movie nights, dinner and studying, to even spending most nights together. She always tells me that she loves me and wants to be together even after college.

I may just be overthinking things, but the one thing that is bothering me is that she completely refuses to tell her parents that she is seeing someone. We facetime nearly every night during our breaks, and if her parents walk in during our conversation she immediately turns the laptop away so that they can't see that she is talking to someone. Also, she has met my parents multiple times and wanted to come home with me over fall break (she obviously didn't tell her parents that she was leaving campus to visit her boyfriend's hometown in another state. We also had an awesome time over this break). Finally, she had a boyfriend before me which her parents not only knew about, but had a strong relationship with- going out to eat and spending time with him. This girl and I have now been together twice as long as her previous relationship. Whenever I bring up telling her parents she gets extremely uncomfortable and feels horrible that she hasn't already told them. Part of her feels that it is too late to tell them. Again, I love this girl and it's clear that she feels the same way. Am I overthinking this, or is there something possibly wrong with me that prevents her from telling her family about me?

I‚Äôm drunk and it‚Äôs been two days since I‚Äôve cut myself. I had made it three weeks and two days before then, but shit happens, you know ?

I‚Äôm sitting here watching dumb videos with my siblings on Christmas Eve and the thought crosses my mind, 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go upstairs and absolutely rip into your arm ?‚Äù

I know that I shouldn‚Äôt, but the thought won‚Äôt go away unless I do it. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting here, maybe to distract myself for even a little while? I don‚Äôt even know what to title this.

I know that a lot of people just scroll past these things even if they may be super serious, but if anyone has any advice, I‚Äôd appreciate it :)

Screamed ""fuck"" so loud everyone in the shop heard it and just stared at me in shock. I felt horrible.

230,"So, here's the scoop fellas.

I've been pretty adamant about one girl in particular being the one--the one in which the infatuation stage has transformed into something a lot more beautiful.  We've been good friends since grade school. I'm now a Junior in college. We've always had these typical back and forth jabs at each other, the cute kind. Like the whole ""ew its you"" sort of thing whenever we greet. I've invited her to every high school dance, and she's accepted with glee. And the more I go on, the more I start to notice some...new things. My heart flutters when she's around. I'm attentive to her and only her when she talks. I twitch and move my leg a lot more when I respond to her. 

The problem is: I have never had a girlfriend and I'm deeply afraid of rejection. Or the chance she may never see our relationship--the grade school buddies one--the same again. Or, the worst of them all, I pass on the chance to date my one and only. How should I approach this? She's living in Indiana and me in Georgia, so I don't get to see her often. Two days ago, we got coffee, and that was the first time we met in 6 months. I was thinking of writing her a letter of some sort?",25Dec2019,1
231,"I‚Äôm a student in high school, and my dads main focus is making sure I get a B or better average in school so I can go to a university. I do everything he tells me to do regarding school, I email my teachers, always ask questions, retake tests, take university prep classes, and take the college entrance exams. When I have a C (or below) in a class he goes on like hyper speed to get it fixed. Usually it only goes up ONCE he *stops* nagging me finally and I can fix it the way *i want to*. I know this is how a lot of parents are, but my dad is dead set on me going to university. My dad and brother were both valedictorians and went to very prestigious universities and I don‚Äôt know IF my dad is comparing himself or my brother to me, but I just don‚Äôt have that gene inside me. I do alright in school. I get A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs, and C‚Äôs in my harder, college prep classes, I do my homework and try my best on mostly everything. 
The thing is, my interests don‚Äôt line up with my dads idea for me. He wants me to be a computer software engineer (which has NEVER even been a slight interest to me) and wants me to go to university. 
My interests are more like languages, because I‚Äôm learning Spanish and Chinese and I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs what I enjoy doing a lot. I also like things like fashion, but I don‚Äôt know if that would ever make its way into my career. 
But the more important thing is, after I graduate, I just know I cannot jump straight back into school. I definitely need a gap year, and on top of that, I don‚Äôt know if I want to go to university. There‚Äôs a local ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù college that I like because of their international studying program, and I could picture myself going there. I know if I do, or don‚Äôt, either way I cannot live at home anymore. I am seriously tired of living with my family. 
If I do end up being an international student, that‚Äôd be nice and everything, but it‚Äôs still not my *A* plan. My A plan consists more of moving in with my boyfriend, maybe getting married and having a kid. This might sound like a stupid decision, but a college education has always been a second priority to me. I know that going to college is just something I‚Äôm doing because my dad wants me to, not actually because I‚Äôm excited or wanting to go. 
I just don‚Äôt know how to make this all happen. At 18, I have to move out. I just can‚Äôt live at home anymore. But also I cannot go to college right away either, I need a gap year. But within that gap year I might again, move in with my boyfriend and start something different from there. 
I want my dad to know exactly what I‚Äôm thinking, but he will get angry. Since I was born he‚Äôs been breathing down my neck, counting the seconds until I go off to college. How can I tell him that it‚Äôs just not something I want, at least not right now. 

Tl;dr: my dads future plan for me (university) it‚Äôs completely the opposite of what I want. I want a gap year, a husband, a family, college education to me feels like a second priority but I also know I probably have to go. Even if I do go to college, it‚Äôll probably not be a university, and
I‚Äôm going to major in something like language, something he thinks is a terrible idea. How can I let him know that this is something I want badly even though he won‚Äôt like the outcome?",25Dec2019,1

For as long as I‚Äôve known him he has been a kind of flake and either bailed on plans, won‚Äôt text me back for hours, days, or weeks at a time, and won‚Äôt apologize. 

I also at times consider him extremely cringy due to him failing classes by playing his Nintendo DS during class, spending over $500 on magic the gathering cards ($300 since high school graduation in June), saying outdated memes in public, and says things like ‚Äúlook at this dood‚Äù, ‚Äúboi‚Äù, and other random sayings from vine or TikTok. 

He is also very disrespectful of his family who works their ass of to support him and his younger, autistic younger brother (16M). B has a job at Walmart and refuses to pay rent, help with living expenses, or save money for himself. 

B has failed all his courses in community college by either not showing up, not trying, or by playing on his phone in class.

237,"So I've recently been thinking about how important it is to reach out to people who are struggling and let them know that they matter.  I think a common thing is to say ""my DMs are always open"" which is great, but what if you're dealing with a situation you don't know how to handle?  What if someone expresses suicidal thoughts or talks about a really sensitive topic?  One wrong move could be costly.

238,"*LONG POST WARNING*

I was recently on a trip to see my girlfriend for a few days. On the plane home, a woman sat next to me and was very loud and intrusive. In the matter of a few minutes I heard about how she had a very tight vagina, about how she was wild when she was my age (22) and how she is still really wild (mid 40‚Äôs). She told me about how she loves to have sex. I was not being playful or flirty though I was engaging in discussion. Because she was being so in my face, I was pretty monotone. I‚Äôm very committed to my girlfriend, I‚Äôve never cheated on her and would never cheat on her, and I plan to marry her. 

She was on a vacation and to be nice I asked if she had any pics from her vacation and she started to unreservedly show me all of her pictures (in a bikini and a bra). She had a button accidentally undone on her shirt and she looked down and saw it and buttoned it up and I joked that I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about it. And then she unbuttoned that and the button above and told me she was still wearing a swimsuit as she proceeded to show me her bikini. I‚Äôm not going to lie I was very turned on but I did not want to engage with her at all, I just wanted out of the situation but was also aroused. Which made me feel terrible. 

She showed me her tattoo as well that was basically on her lower belly and pelvic area. I do admit I was asking some questions that would make her want to show me more etc. Questions like ‚Äúis your swimsuit still wet, what material is it‚Äù. When she showed me all of it she was feeling the material and I genuinely can‚Äôt remember If I asked to feel the material or if she asked me to, and I did feel the material of her swimsuit and basically feel her boobs. She was super loud about getting wild and stuff and I took my hand away. She asked if I wanted to fuck In the bathroom and I told her no. At this point I had already told her a little bit about my girlfriend. I wanted to avoid her after that because I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen. I put in my headphones and got on my phone. I had also already discreetly texted my girlfriend telling her to pray for me because I was sitting next to a crazy girl. 

This woman then grabbed my hand and placed it inside her swimsuit directly on her bare boob and nipple. She said ‚Äúyou can feel here‚Äù and I said no I can‚Äôt do that and removed my hand and scooted completely away from her. I was in a middle seat and got as far as I could. I felt sick to my stomach. I fell asleep for about 45 min. When I woke up our legs were touching and she was fingering herself under her purse while watching a movie. I was really turned on and not thinking straight because I had just woken up and I sort of rubbed her leg with my leg. I didn‚Äôt do anything with my hands. She had unbuttoned even more and basically taken her boobs (in her bikini out) and she told me she was really hot. She put her hand on my leg and felt my erection outside my pants. She asked if I wanted to touch her and I told her no because I have a girlfriend. She said we should fuck I‚Äôm the bathroom again and told me my girlfriend would never find out. 

Eventually she took her hand off and asked if I wanted her to keep touching me and I told her no, and I scooted away again and avoided her for the rest of the flight. She got up and told me she needed to go to the bathroom to get herself off. 

These are some of the other things I remember her saying to me (which I didn‚Äôt respond to or said no to): 

-Let‚Äôs just go in the bathroom it will take 2 seconds

-I just wanna fuck you so bad

-Will you let me out I gotta go get myself off in the bathroom

-Let‚Äôs just get naked

-Want to fuck in the bathroom, what you don‚Äôt have a condom? 

-Your girlfriend would never know, she wouldn‚Äôt even believe you she would think you‚Äôre crazy

-Thank God for sluts, they ruin the world (in response to me saying I couldn‚Äôt have sex with her bc I had a girlfriend) 

-Can you touch me

-You should‚Äôve brought a condom, you need to start carrying those around

-‚ÄúWe could be doing that‚Äù in reference to a movie sex scene on her tv 

I called my girlfriend as soon as I got off the plane and told her what happened. I was holding in tears and she could tell. I couldn‚Äôt give her complete details as I was still in the airport. My mom was picking me up and I immediately lost it when I got in the car, sobbing. Since then I‚Äôve told my girlfriend more, the only thing she doesn‚Äôt know is that this woman felt my erection. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I feel like I cheated but also I felt like I was harassed and violated. I didn‚Äôt ask for this situation, want it, etc. I told this lady no, I ignored her at points, etc. 

My question from all this is: what do I do? My girlfriend feels like I cheated and is hurt too. I know there are things I could‚Äôve done better and differently and could‚Äôve been more firm with this woman. I just need advice",25Dec2019,1

Here's why I'm so conflicted: Important for context: I'm trans. I'm transitioning from male to female. I want to change my name, get bottom surgery, the whole nine yards. When I shared my feelings with my father a couple of years ago, it was a shouting match, which combined with an abusive ex clinched my decision to move to another state.

245,"Hey, guys!

So, I'm 17 in my senior year right now. I'm wondering if I should go to college or not. I have lots of things I enjoy doing. I like to make music, work out, read, write poetry and journal, and make art. But I don't know what I want to do for a career. I understand this normal for many teenagers, if not all.

But with college coming up soon, I'm wondering if it will be the right decision for me.

Money is not a concern for me. I'm more concerned with being happy with what I'm doing and who I am in life.

I've thought about many things. Being a therapist; although being in therapy myself, I was very dissatisfied with the state of the mental health services and I feel I would not enjoy being such a f'd up system that I subjectively don't believe really serves people to the fullest potential. Being a personal trainer. Being a nutritionist. Being an musical artist. Being a field biologist. Being a park ranger. Being a neuro-scientist. Being a lawyer. Being a dentist or doctor.

But I have no idea how to know which career I really want to strive for. And I don't want to go to college just to find out I was chasing the wrong thing and end up in debt for something I'll never use in my life. I don't want to end up regretting this decision.

I will do 2 years of just general classes before transferring to a bigger university, so I would have a little time to think about things before rushing into a major. However, what if College is not even meant for me?

I'm such a multi-dimensional person so I am really clueless as to what I want to do. I almost feel as I won't be fully happy with anything I do.

What is some great advice you could give me in finding out what career I really want to pursue for the rest of my life? I would love to hear your answers; it may bring me some relief as-well ahaha.

I‚Äôm no poetry guy or anything. Joined the community just for this. I‚Äôm no good in English but tried to write this; it‚Äôs no poetry just some fancy words.

I‚Äôm shit at this anyways so it won‚Äôt be a surprise. 
It did come from my heart however cramps it is. If it‚Äôs not good doesn‚Äôt mean my heart said that. All good. So it‚Äôs as follows:

For thy mote thee body‚Äôs haste?
For which thee soul thinks meed;
For thou, thee body beguiles thee soul;
For thou, thee body gives solace to thee soul;
For without thee life‚Äôs in woe. 
Thy is the genesis to this anomalous prodigy;
For thou, thee body made thee soul a fiend. 
For thou thee body did soo much, for thou, whom I never met, pageants thy face with natures owne hand painted. 
For which thee needs to say to ye,
What thou should do to thee;
As thee say hi to ye?!

Thee thy and all that are the fancy words. Just don‚Äôt be angry, it was my first literal try. Just let me know if its got potential(probably not).

247,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but it's been on my mind recently. There's more information in my post history. I'm not suicidal, and I didn't and wouldn't do it because I wanted to die.
My next appointment with my therapist is some time in January so I'll bring this up then.

I used to have a problem with that particular form of self harm. I stopped because I was just tired of dealing with the consequences, and I've always mainly dealt with my emotions with food. Two instances come to mind:

My parents (they didn't know they were self harm scars) kept saying my scars were ugly and they've put a lot of emphasis on the correlation between my looks and my worth as a person. 
Once, I was told to go to the guidance counselor and they said that a teacher overheard that I had been cutting myself. I told them it was my cats and that's all that came of that.

It was a hassle to hide, and it was obviously
a destructive habit. But, it did deal with emotional pain without making me overweight.

I don't know if I can exactly describe the feeling. I didn't feel happy when I did it, but in the moment, I felt a little better. My anxiety was at it's worst at the time and it would make me feel calmer. (In elementary school, I was sad and my best friend punched me in the arm and said something like ""The pain cancels out the other pain"" and that's how I see self harm.)

I feel lonely and I'd rather be more focused on my arm hurting then the fact I'm lonely. I'll only get worst if I start again, but I want to feel less lonely.

There are so many changes to my looks and personality I need to make before I'll even be able to stop being lonely. It will take months and I don't want to deal with it for those months. I'm confused on what to do.",25Dec2019,1
248,"I had a pretty boring Christmas Eve. This is my first Christmas without my mom, and my brother.  They're 12 hours from me. I'm here taking care of my Grandma she's not doing amazing, she doesn't really do anything at all but we were supposed to go to church tonight.  an hour before we were supposed to go she told me that she didn't want to go anymore, so I said okay.

I just depressingly laid in bed most of the day, I was looking forward to coming and feeding the colony of stray cats that I feed every night.  There's some by this restaurant and then I walk about a half a mile to this trailer park and feed however many show up.  

so there's this black cat that doesn't get along with any of the other cats and I have to put her food far away and try and guard her because all the other cats try and come in push her away and eat her food.  So I was standing by her and these other two cats came over, I went to step over so that I could intervene between her and the other cats.  At the exact moment that I brought my right foot over she turned right (to run away from the other cats) and my foot hit her right in the face.  She turned right even though I was going left, because we were across each other facing opposite directions.  

It was just the absolute worst timing.  I know it was an accident and I'm doing a good thing bringing them food because otherwise who knows where they get it, but I just feel responsible like maybe I should have seen it coming and I should have just moved like a slug.  Because the thing is I wasn't swinging my leg hard but I was repositioning my body so it wasn't a soft movement it was a regular speed movement.  I just feel like she thinks I tried to hurt her and I have a soft spot for her because she's so ostracized by all the other ones. she ran away from me and the other cash try to take her food but I took her food and moved it towards her.  

I moved the other cat's away and I walked away to let her know I wasn't trying to hurt her so that she could eat some more.  She started to eat again and I'm consumed with shame and guilt.  This is the worst emotion for me to face because I have issues, and I was just looking forward to a positive half hour with the cats.  I just feel like I ruined it and I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that I love her but she's a cat and she doesn't speak English.  

When I was leaving I made sure to pet her softly and speak softly and try and explain that it was an accident and then I have no intention to cause her harm.  I know that dogs don't have a good memory, do cats have a good memory? 
Is she going to remember this when I come back tomorrow night?
Should I be concerned about head trauma or her teeth or anything? I'm 130 lb 5 foot 5 I'm really small guy, but like I said I was just moving my foot regular speed because I didn't expect her to do that.  it felt like a solid contact so I just know that I'm going to stress about this until who knows when.

I enjoy sex with you a lot‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah babe‚Äù then acted upset when I gave him short answers back because he literally didn‚Äôt do anything to further the convo and I felt stupid for sharing my feelings. He said he didn‚Äôt want to just parrot my feelings back so just said yeah. 

We also had talked about kids and toys and I said yeah our kids aren‚Äôt getting crazy amounts of toys I want them to do stuff outside and he said ‚Äúyeah, mine are getting secondhand items from my brothers kid‚Äù I felt like he didn‚Äôt see a future with me. 

I told him happy birthday last week and he was nice and said: ‚ÄúI love you too so happy I met you and then re connected with you we knew we had something special and we are killing it now! The best bday present ever is knowing I got you to look forward to from here on out 30 and onward!

251,"Christmas this year was VERY difficult for me financially. At the last minute, I managed to get a few presents for my 2 children (12, 1) to open Christmas morning with me. I was very excited to be able to do this with them. 

Baby fell asleep around 10 PM and I dozed off on the couch and wake up at 1 AM to tend to the baby who had just woken up. I went to go outside for a smoke after I got her back to sleep and  I noticed shredded wrapping paper all over the floor. I was afraid my cats tore all the presents open but when I looked closer, the presents were missing. I put 2 and 2 together and realized that my 12-year-old daughter woke up and she decided that since it was after midnight, she was gonna come downstairs and open every one of her Christmas presents while everyone else was asleep. 

I busted in her room and woke her up to scold her and she looked so confused like it was the Christmas Procedure or something and I actually felt bad for being so pissed off. I can't stop being pissed off and I don't know what to do about this. I don't want to take the presents away from her because it wasn't much, and honestly, the majority of it was stuff she needed.

She is usually so mature and absolutely knew better. I never have to punish her, so I'm at a loss.  She is generally an amazingly well-behaved kid and I'm proud, which is why I'm so shocked. I've never had to punish her, like ever, and I don't know what kind of punishment would be appropriate for doing something like this at her age.",25Dec2019,1

5) lie in bed for so many hours and miss college for no reason even though I'm short on attendance

7) feeling of frustration
8) guilt for no reason

But ever since that episode (the second episode I ever had in the span of a month), I felt like I don't feel schizophrenic at all anymore. Like all my superstition just went away because I didn't die that night. I always mostly believed that all of my schizophrenic beliefs are made up also just for personal comfort but after that I experience I am ignoring these ""signs"" or patterns because I know I'm just over exaggerating.

I used to think I had OCD but now I think I always just took my anticipation to the extreme and I've calmed down quite a bit in what I thought was OCD.

I know for a fact that I have social issues that I don't know how to explain well either. Sometimes I think it's social anxiety, other times I think it's ADHD, other times I think it's both.

TL;DR: I don't know where my problems begin and end, I don't remember ""episodes"" of any of my (apparently multiple) disorders.

He is also very disrespectful of his family who works their ass of to support him and his younger, autistic younger brother (16M). B has a job at Walmart and refuses to pay rent, help with living expenses, or save money for himself. 

B has failed all his courses in community college by either not showing up, not trying, or by playing on his phone in class. He is planning on dropping out of college, quitting his job at Walmart to another minimum wage job, and move out of his parents house to Turlock, CA. He ignores all advice I give him.

I‚Äôve had body issues for a very long time but this past summer I gained a lot of confidence in myself due to him and a few others. I only recently started liking him again because we grew closer and I actually got to know him. 

So I finally lost my virginity this month to a different coworker(19m) and he found out I hooked up with him and told me not to because I was going to get hurt.

I told him I‚Äôd be down to talk since he was all by himself at this point in the night. I met him outside my house at roughly 3am and I walked him home since I was concerned about how drunk he was. We talked and he held my hand almost the entire way home. Then he hugged me and ranted about he cockblocked himself by getting drunk because I refused to do anything with a drunk person. I gave him a kiss goodnight and had to physically push him inside his house because he wanted to stay and make out with me.

He kissed my forehead and went inside finally. I walked home (only a block we live close by each other). He texted me and again ranted about how sober him was an idiot and I shouldn‚Äôt trust a thing he said because he was too nervous I wouldn‚Äôt like him and he likes me.

About 2-3 months ago I started flirting with some girl (24) at work. I knew she was in a bad relationship(4 or 5 years of it) and things started going in my favor fast(or so I tought) because se was more insistent that we see each other on smoking brakes very often and a lot of talks about doing more things together. 

It was a strange feeling but since I was single for a long time I said why not play her game. We talked a lot and 2 weeks ago coworkers organized a night out and she insisted I go with her, sit next to her, and after a few drinks and a lot of laughter we got out of the bar and asked her how serious is this thing we are having right now.She immediately kinda had a change in her face and said ""you have no change my boyfriend is gonna ask me to marry him this Christmas"".I was shocked since I am a shy guy and usually I am very carefull where I invest feelings in, and this was going smooth since the begining, or so I tought.

All in all we return to the party, I got drunk because what else to do after this and did not seem to be that much affected went back to my life as ussual and did not talk to her anymore or ask for explanations. 

3 days ago I started having strange dreams about this, waking up sad, self loathing...culminating with last night dreaming about me carring their rings at her and her boyfriend's wedding and woke up full of selfpitty and sweating like I came from the gym.

This mixed with the fact that these are both people who were originally more on the outside of things when we were in cliques when we were younger leaves them both feeling like they aren't wanted. They've even decided multiple times to leave early rather than even watch or join in anything.

We've tried asking them to pick games, or other activities in general, but neither of them really has any alternative suggestions much less ones that wouldn't split the group back into cliques. The only thing that they can seem to suggest is drinking, which some people are already doing and which isn't really a solution to anything.

As cousins we barely get to see each other with everyone so spread to opposite sides of the country so we really have to make the most of the few hours we get together. We're going on five years of this becoming a bigger and bigger issue and it only seems to get worse. 

What can we do that will keep everyone together and actively participating in something, but which won't inadvertently cause issues with those cousin's anxiety over their dyslexia?",25Dec2019,1

So what you think, how are you doing in your life right now? I want a specific answer and if you are not able to get it then just find it out anyway. And I will be grateful if you will get it. So for today, this is your self-development task. 

**‚Äú Last, but not least -- in fact, this is most important -- you need a happy ending. However, if you can create tragic situations and jerk a few tears before the happy ending, it will work much better. ‚Äù ¬†\~ ¬†Satyajit Ray,** [**The Bandits of Bomba**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15933709)**y**

Think about this, you start doing something, for example, you joined a group where everyone read daily. And like others, you start reading daily after joining that group. But after one month of your joining, you get to know that you are at the bottom of the group means you are the one who reads least in the group daily. The average reads per day of the following group are 15 but you read just 5 pages a day. So the thing is this you are at the last of the group but not the least. Why? You are behind the group but there are peoples who even don‚Äôt read a page every day. So be aware of this thing, you are certainly the last somewhere but not the least in this world of 7 billion+ population. You had at least try to get better in your life, You are far better than those who had even don‚Äôt try. ¬†

So the thing I want to clear out here is, **try new things in your life, fail early, ¬†learn fast and you will get better in your life soon**. Be grateful for everything you have in your life and do as much you can do and lastly try to give back to society much more than you have taken from it. Sometimes we just need to get into work rather than thinking once more about it.

So get into the work and get this into your mind that you can be the last somewhere but not least in this huge world.

Be nice to others and show how much you love them. Give them unconditional love. And at the last be grateful for everything you had achieved and you are gonna get in your life. Sometimes we need to express what is in our hearts rather than keeping it in our minds. So express everything you want to express before the end of 2019.

I can‚Äôt stand living with another person (I‚Äôm hearing impaired and anxiety prone, which is hard living with someone else). I‚Äôm just terrified of leaping into the world without a bachelors degree. I‚Äôm scared that when I finally discover what it is I want to do, not having a bachelors degree will hold me back.

285,"So I met this friend that I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while and I‚Äôve been having this sense that he might be autistic in some way because of his interesting personality traits.

1. He talks in a very loud, very low voice. And most of the time it sounds monotone. 

2. He will most of the time get way too excited and loud about something. For example, he basically yelled at the tv the other day out of nowhere which shot my ear drum for a second. 

3. He doesn‚Äôt understand social cues. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because he has social anxiety but half the time when he‚Äôs talking to my family he either interrupts them mid sentence, or talks wayyy too much. Or both. 

4. He doesn‚Äôt think things through all the time. For example, when I told him I could hang at this certain time, he came an hour and a half early. 

Those are the main things I‚Äôve noticed.

287,"Hey,

So, I was on a website where local people can meet up. I made it clear with a man that I didn't want to engage in anything with him, but he was still interested in hanging out. So, I suggested we meet somewhere public first for a while. He ordered me a Lyft after some 'credit card difficulties', to my surprise, and I arrived at a restaurant I'm familiar with. Somewhere I've gone with my mom often. I recognize the spot perfectly.

I go in, ask for the man who texted me, and he took me to the back room, where they had a bunch of beers. Keep in mind I am 18F, far under the legal drinking age and in a public venue at this point. He pulled out Indian rum and poured a glass for me. I kept thinking about how his brother didn't even blink once about this situation happening. I appear much younger than my age, as well, so I did ask about it.

Him and his brother are the only owners of this place, and they regularly do this. They invite younger girls back to drink and then fuck at their house. 

I just keep thinking about that. Is it worth it to give an anonymous tip? I worry girls younger than me, or more vulnerable than me, are being lured back here as well. This is a very popular spot in my city, somewhere my classmates have worked and ate.",25Dec2019,1
288,"Hello all,

I apologize if this is so long but I appreciate you reading it. Even though it is Christmas I am not in a happy mood. I have many underlying issues in my life that is bothering me the most especially tonight when I should be happy. For the past few months, I cannot find it in me to be happy. I am depressed all of the time and have major anxiety. Even though I appear happy on the outside, I am crying for help on the inside. I am one just to put on a face to the rest of the world to seem normal.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. This last year between us has been a rough one. She is not the same happy person I used to know. I haven‚Äôt opened up about it but she has abused me physically and emotionally quite a few times this year. I don‚Äôt know where all of her anger stems from, but it just appears out of nowhere and whenever I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive saying nothing is wrong with her and traps herself in the room. She‚Äôs about to graduate college and has a great job at the moment she loves and seems so happy but when she is around me, she flips a switch and gets mad at me. I have no idea when the last time we slept in the same bed was to be honest.

I also had a horrible injury 3 months ago at work that I am still trying to recover from but it leaves me with a disability that I have to work on everyday that does impact my life. Doctor says it might be another year before I fully heal or I might not so I am extremely depressed about that. The worst part is that it wasn‚Äôt my fault but it was a faulty piece of equipment that wasn‚Äôt fixed appropriately.  It does leave me in pain throughout the day so I am not mobile like I used to be.

To top all that off, my family has completely abandoned me because of some family issues on my dads side. My grandma is 85 and I love to spend time with her because she is someone that I look up to but my family is having disagreements with her side of the family so they said since I am talking to her, I can ‚Äúf**k off‚Äù and not talk to them again and they all blocked me. I also grew up in an abusive household so I have resentment towards my family that has never gone away and she was always there for me. 

With tonight being Christmas Eve, I am super unhappy as my girlfriend decided to get drunk tonight and being that I‚Äôm running a fever and in pain, I wouldn‚Äôt join her and she said that I am the most worthless broken piece of s**t she has ever known and wishes she had a normal boyfriend who didn‚Äôt have a crippling injury. I also cannot afford school since I have no more financial aid so I can‚Äôt even finish my college courses and that bothers me every day knowing my girlfriend is about to graduate and I‚Äôm not. I have absolutely no one to talk to because she has driven all my friends away and no family to talk to because my grandma is states away from me. I feel trapped and that I can‚Äôt get out. What should I do? I literally cannot stop crying. I am 24 btw. Thank you so much.

**TL;DR** I‚Äôm sorry this is so long but I am having life issues that are piling on me.",25Dec2019,1
290,"This is my first post. I'm not sure this goes here, but here goes.

My younger sibling (22) moved out of my parents' home earlier this year. Left with significant other (23) while no one was home. My parents, thinking they've done wrong and attempting to either make amends or to keep from burning a bridge, allowed them to take their car as well as pay for their car insurance, health insurance, and tuition. While my parents attempt to contact them now and again, minimal communication comes from my sibling's side. Sibling does not answer a majority of my parents' messages and refuses to speak on the phone. They've made it clear they want little to no further contact with my parents or friends they cut off after leaving. 

Recently, sibling has reached out to parents to ask for more money in order to transfer to a different university, also stating that it's probably expensive. My mother and I are against the idea, considering they want to move out and be an adult while still on my parents' tab. My father, however, still seems bent on the idea of paying for the transfer plus tuition, claiming that he would also do the same for me, which I wouldn't doubt. The one thing my parents always stressed to sibling and I was to get a degree. Today, he cried while he expressed to me that he was scared that he couldn't afford the transfer and tuition.

It's absolutely stressing me out that a person is able to cut off their immediate family but still have the audacity to ask for even more money while giving nothing in return. 'Tis the season, I guess.

I'm open to any and all advice from people who have been in this situation like the ones who moved out or their immediate family. I'm also open to any advice or opinions from outside perspectives. Much thanks in advance.",25Dec2019,1
292,"A little backstory but there's a TL;DR at the bottom.

This is the first Christmas without the family for myself(32F) and my two sons(10M, 8M). Their father(39M) and I were never married (mostly because we didn't want to deal with the legal issues involved) but we were married in all but legal document for over ten years. I always stayed home and took care of the kids and husband worked an office job we moved across the county for that he's very happy with. All seemed well.

About a week ago he went to visit family before Christmas for a few days. This seemed really strange to me because his family lives not too far away, maybe an hours drive but not far enough to stay for a few days. I was right to be suspicious because it seems like family meant girlfriend and visit meant not coming back. I had no idea this was happening, he was hiding it perfectly, I assume he only got sloppy now because he knew he was done with us.

This is bad enough, but in the emotional turmoil, I stupidly assumed he would never hurt his children. I should have changed the locks but I was stupid and I didn't do that and when we came home from the movies tonight (kids wanted to see the new star wars) all of his stuff was gone along with all the presents for the kids. There was so much there I can't hope to replace, I have maybe $150 to my name right now and there was a ps4 and some trading cards and game books for our older boy, lots of new clothes, a few switch games and some toys for our youngest, plus whatever was there for me and the stuff I got for husband. I knew it was husband because he still has his keys, there were no windows broken or anything, he didn't mess up the house, and he knew the date and time we were going to the movie because we bought the tickets the day they went on sale.

He admitted to it in our discord chat and said that he bought the stuff so it's all his, he needs the money to move, and the kids ""won't remember"" not having toys one year. I think that's ridiculous, the kids are more than old enough to remember being traumatized for Christmas. He even took their Christmas candy and stuff for their stockings, like he's going to go return candy to the store for moving money? He's not a stupid person by any means and neither am I, I know he took absolutely everything to ruin the holiday for us and hurt me by hurting the kids. I don't even know why, there was no indication of a relationship problem until this.

I told them I didn't know what had happened and I would try to fix everything (they saw there was nothing under the tree when we got home from the movie), but it's already christmas and they're going to wake up in a few hours with nothing and I don't know what else there is to do. The little one is still expecting santa to bring presents, and while I'm sure his brother has figured out santa is just a fun game, he's going to be devastated if I can't come up with something. His family never liked me (they're fundamentalist christians and I'm atheist and my children seem to be as well (long story but I've tried not to sway them either way, I prefer they think for themselves)) so I can't just take the kids to grandma and grandpa to stall. My parents are 2000+ miles away and living month to month on disability so that's a no go too.

They're not really spoiled kids, but they were both already aware of their ""big presents"" so it's going to be a real blow regardless. Older son has already been talking about his ps4 nonstop and watching people on youtube playing the games he wants and younger son wrote to santa and he's never been disappointed by santa before and he's a really young 8 year old, if you know what I mean? He's a lot less mature than my older boy was at his age.

Can anyone think of anything at all that might lessen what the kids are going to go through in the morning? I was thinking of telling them I talked to the police and we were robbed so they don't think it was their father but aside from that I'm not sure how to salvage this at all.",25Dec2019,1
294,I‚Äôm not good at gaging my emotions in times of high stress. Christmas time is usually an exciting time for me; it‚Äôs my favorite holiday and my birthday is only days after.

I love him a lot and I really appreciate the effort but I really don't want his money to go to waste. Frankly, I will look silly if I wear the necklace.

297,"My (31M) girlfriend (35F) has a weird relationship with her father(65M). They seem to share quite a strong father-daughter bond, but at times my girlfriend shows signs of suffering from some kind of father complex. She hardly grooms herself properly when she is with me. It does not matter too much because she is extremely good looking and has won several beauty pageants in the recent past. However, whenever her father dines with us, she dresses up quite exquisitely. Her father keeps calling her ""my beautiful princess"" instead of Bianca. At the dining table, she insists on placing herself between her father and me, even when her friends are present.

My gf's father rarely cooks at home; her mother does all the cooking. My gf often ridicules her father's aversion for cooking. Last month, her father declared that he has great culinary skills but never puts them to use because of his ""laziness"". Bianca, who is an excellent cook herself, challenged him to a cook off. They made a weird bet. The winner could ask the loser ""anything"" of his/her choice. I began to feel greatly uncomfortable.

Over the past month, they competed thrice I reckon. Each time dad came visiting, the daughter would take him to the kitchen and they would make one dish each, and ask me to judge. They gave me no clue as to who made what. I was in difficult position. I implored my gf to drop me a hint, but she looked straight at her father. She gave me no clue even when we were alone.

I had to judge the food based on the quality alone. Once, I declared my verdict, they would not even let me who ""won"". My gf replied that I would get to know the eventual winner at the end of this month. I went through great emotional strife each time I was called upon to judge.

Yesterday night, my gf wore a leopard skin when her parents came over to our place. She kept looking at her father and giggling in a strange manner. She also sat next to him at dinner. Her mother smiled occasionally too. Dad asked his daughter about her experience of ""losing"". My gf replied that she felt like a ""proud loser"". Later in the night, she confessed that I had judged her father's dish to be better each time, and she had lost fairly and squarely. I felt unhappy and wept so bitterly when she kept repeating how proud she was about losing to her father. She personally felt that her father's dishes were better too. She kept on insisting that she did not lose intentionally, but was beaten fair and square. She often loses to me at chess but I only get a congratulatory kiss. She never gloats over my success. Why is she so fixated to her father?

304,"Hi Reddit, 

I asked a question here a while back and found a helpful response, so here we go again....

First of all my situation. I know how insane this sounds but bare with me. So i went overseas on a 2 year working holiday and within like the first 2 months I got a girl pregnant, go me. I quickly fell into a negative space and couldn't enjoy myself at all without guilt, land a job, make friends or deal with the mistake i had made as i desperately don't want children and certainly not with this girl. With my finances quickly disappearing and mental state deteriorating I did the cowardly thing and changed my flight to return home.

The messed up part is that i'm basically ""hiding out"" in a small city on the other side of my country from my friends/family and haven't told a single person what has happened. It was easy for me to get work here without the stigma of a working holiday visa and i just needed some time to sort my shit out. This way I also figured I don't have to explain myself if i need to leave the country again which given the situation is highly likely. I thought i have 2 years before i have to explain myself - totally dumb thinking.

As you would expect i get the occasional email or msg from friends and family asking how my trip is going and it's absolutely crushing my soul. I try and respond with the bare minimum but its awful, I feel so deceitful. I'm also completely alone, I haven't spoken to a single person in about 10 months - the only guy i talk to is my boss who for obviously reasons i have to pretend to be a normal well rounded guy to.

Then comes the main issue. What am i supposed to do about this child? I feel so much shame about the whole thing. I didn't even like this girl, we hung a few times and i remember thinking the last time how annoying she was and couldn't wait for her to leave (mean i know).  She found out about two weeks after getting together and i literally begged her not to go through with it but she said she couldn't go through with termination.

I've agonised over this constantly but i can't seem to formulate a plan, even a basic one. I can't get over the fact that this is happening but i know that i have to accept it sooner or later. I never wanted kids and have broadcast this vocally to all my friends who are starting to go down that path. I'm not reliable and only scrap by as it is. 

I guess i'm jsut desperate, I need some advice on how to attack this or even what you would do in this situation. I'd also love to here from people who have had unwanted pregnanices, whatever your situation.

She is Japanese but lives in America and I am Australian.

(a) Move to America?  She has a double degree, flawless english and with the child being born there is eligible to live there. I however despite holding a decent job am not college educated so the only real option to live there would be marry this girl - something I desperately do not want.

(b) Move to Japan? basically same as option (a) though she would have the support of her friends and family. The plus of the japan thing is also that when it comes to a spouse visa it's a very straight forward and  cheap process.

(c) Her move to Aus? same again,but  it's very hard , time consuming and costly to immigrate here. The thought of my two worlds colliding is absolutely bone chilling to me. I'd rather live a life in exile then have to explain this.

(d) Not be involved. We used protection and detected this very early, she had the option to not have this child but has proceeded anyway. With it being casual, geographically difficult and no desire to father a child this option has until recently been the fall back.

This will also sounds stupid, but finding out it's a boy has added to the confusion. Because its a guy i feel this duty to be around, but on the other hand I never really got on with other guys or my dad and if i could pick would chose to raise a girl 100%. If it was a girl maybe i could do it? aghhhhh i have no idea.

This is a rambling mess of a post. I've just spend xmas in isolation and need some help from someone, anyone!",25Dec2019,1
305,"Sigh... So my wife and I have a 3 month old baby. My parents (in their 70s) have been rather eager to watch him. Partially because it's my mom's first full grandbaby and partially because my dad did such a piss-poor job of being a father that he basically missed out on being a grandfather to his first bunch of grandkids while they were babies. 

The bulk of their baby-watching thus far has been just a few hours here and there while I'm at work and my wife needs a break from him. At some point, it's going to be much more regular (3-4x a week, 7a.m.-4p.m.ish) when she goes back to work full-time in February.  

My wife dropped the baby off recently and when she picked him up my parents told her, rather explicitly, that they left him on the couch for a while to cry after suspecting that he was just doing it to ""manipulate"" them. We let them know before that we had already spoken to his doctor/our pediatrician and agreed that we aren't really into letting him cry/self-soothe/whatever you want to call it at this age because even if he's crying just because he needs to be held.... he's a baby, hold him. Apparently my mom even specifically said something about not listening to what our pediatrician said... 

In my mind it doesn't matter WTF the rule we set is, it's a rule that we set and they need to fucking follow it if they want to watch the baby/be a part of his life. Even if it's some dumb rule like he doesn't get to eat Cheerios on the second Tuesday of the month. They don't get a vote in the rules, so whether they agree with them or not doesn't matter. We have a few rules that we were worried about going in like spending quality time together in lieu of spending money on birthday or Christmas presents (to avoid my dad trying to buy his love like he's done with his other grandkids), no TV for at least two years, no sugary food or drinks, etc etc. but definitely didn't see this one being a problem. 

We spent a little bit of time with them on Friday, but they basically weren't in the room together at all while we were over there and there wasn't a good time for me to say anything. Now I feel like I should have and that not saying anything then was a big mistake. We're going over there tomorrow (Christmas) for dinner and some chill time.

So do I bring it up? How? How harsh should I be? Any general advice from personal experience? I'm worried about the future if they're already breaking rules but they're the people I've been planning on having watch the baby... Thanks for any advice.

306,"So for context, my dad is a disabled veteran. He hasn‚Äôt worked since 2011.  My mom has been and is the bread winner for my entire life. He has had jobs but it‚Äôs been 22 years of her having a constant and consistent job with the irs. My mom has very psychotic bipolar and we‚Äôve always known that. A couple of months ago she moved away from us to live in Missouri and she pays for rent in both places. She pays about $1500 a month and I pay about $600 for my portion. Through all this my mom has been rocky with her mental health but she‚Äôs great. She has her flaws, but she is so much happier living on her own, and she‚Äôs doing her best. 
Through out the years my dad has been addicted to pain killers. For about 3 years my mom gave him $2400 monthly to pay for all the bills and every single month it‚Äôs been behind and he spends money on stuff only for himself or keeps ‚Äúpocket money‚Äù so he can buy pills when he‚Äôs out of pills for the month or weed or whatever else he wants. A couple Christmases ago mom gave him about $500 for Christmas gifts and he spent all the money on stuff for him instead of what she told him to.  So when she left I agreed to take over the bills and to make all the household decisions including, groceries, phone bill, and payment dates. 

Occasionally from age 3 to now, I have seen and heard IMO horrendous shit that I don‚Äôt know how to describe other than just saying what happened. So here‚Äôs some highlights. When I was in 6th grade he asked me why I was so fat and asked why I didn‚Äôt want to be prettier like all the other girls in my grade. When I was 8 I said he was dead to me and he sat me down in his room, made me grab a kitchen knife and wrapped his hand around mine and put it up to his neck and asked me if this is really what I wanted and when I said  it wasn‚Äôt he pulled out his gun, loaded it infront of me and put it up to his temple and asked again. When I was 16 I asked to go to the doctor because I told him I was really depressed and having horrible panic attacks and he told me since I was never raped/molested by him, that I had no excuse to and that I was lying for attention. When I got back from the hospital for trying to commit suicide he told me if I really wanted to kill myself I would‚Äôve tried harder.  When I moved back in with my parents after being tboned and losing my house and my job I was getting a ride to work and he decided to casually mention that ‚Äúi really don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre grandpa ever cheated on your grandma because if she‚Äôs anything like your mom she has multiple orgasms and I wouldn‚Äôt trade that for anything.‚Äù 

So the reason I‚Äôm asking for advice is because I feel obligated to stay here, but I‚Äôm having a fucking hard time saving money and I really want to move out of state, I don‚Äôt know how to do that with spending much more than I agreed on when this whole situation came about my mom leaving. My brother is a college student and he lives here too. So it‚Äôs something where I don‚Äôt want to set him up for failure bc he steals money from the joint account that‚Äôs shared between my brother and my dad. I‚Äôve considered a second job, but I still don‚Äôt have a car so that‚Äôs kind of difficult (not impossible, but not exactly easy.) we don‚Äôt qualify for food stamps. And some months I have to over draw my account to get food. He refuses to get a job because in his words he‚Äôs too disabled to work because he takes narcotics for his pain, was denied for social security because when he did work he didn‚Äôt work enough to qualify for disability. And it‚Äôs all around a shit situation.  On top of all of this he STILL tells me I need to grow up and stop mooching off of them and learn how to be an adult, but won‚Äôt let me do my own laundry. In the same breath he likes to tell me that I blame all of my problems on him but that he wants to have a better relationship with me. So can someone please put a name to what he‚Äôs doing or like tell me what I can do to at least save up some money to get by so I can leave?",25Dec2019,1

309,"I moved to America for work recently and I was supposed to submit a picture of my official SIN paper so that I can open a specific bank account so that my employer can give me my 2019 Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions to that account. Basically, they are giving me $300 for health-related costs, which they can only deposit in the year 2019 since the contributions are for 2019. Me, being a procrastinating idiot, forgot to do this before I came home for the holidays. So now I have a situation and I need advice. Do I:

a) Drive down with my dad  (3 hour drive both ways) to find the SIN paper in my apartment, take a picture of it, submit it in time for the company to be able to process it before the end of 2019, drive back another 3 hours to enjoy the remnants of my vacation, and get my $300 company contribution for my HSA  (net gain of approximately $200 given that I will pay for gas &amp; dinner) and not have to deal with having to reconcile my taxes with a W-2c.

b) Don't drive down and instead enjoy my Christmas (although my family really doesn't celebrate it, but nevertheless not driving 6 hours is definitely preferable) and just take my losses and budget more aggressively the next month(s) so that I can make up for the lost $200 (also by my calculations, I earn $33 per hour spent driving and I don't know whether that's worth it). The bigger concern here is, if I don't open this account by Dec 31st my company will give me a W-2c to reconcile my taxes and I don't know how complicated/serious that is since I've never done American taxes before. Is it worth it to drive down just so that I don't have to deal with the W-2c?

c) One of my friends is driving down tomorrow and I could give him the keys to my apartment and have him snap a picture of the SSN paper. From what I know I think he's a good guy and would probably be willing to help me out, but at the same time I haven't known him for very long (I've known him for a few months) and I'm not sure if trusting something as sensitive as my SSN to someone else is a bad idea. This is definitely the most convenient option for me though... Unless he commits identity theft 20 years down the line when I'm least expecting it, but I don't know if I'm being too paranoid for imagining something this extreme.

312,"Back in November, my mom and I were invited to a wedding by my moms close friend. Even though we had no relations to the bride or groom genetically so we decided to go to show our face. The wedding reception was held at this park, it was night time but it was still very pretty. During the reception, my moms friend had introduced my mom and I to her grandson.. let's call him Austin. Austin and I were making small talk from across the table we were sitting at. We talked about school, sport, mutual friends, etc. After about ten minutes of this, I felt spontaneous and asked him to walk with me around the park because nothing in particular was happening at the reception. Everyone was just eating and talking, the usual where anyone is from. Throughout our walk in the park, we talked about a lot, ran through some sprinklers, got to know each other, joked around. Turns out that by the time we came back to the actual reception, the wedding was about to end. Time went by fast with him and I felt really good. He got my number and we've been talking. A week or so after Austin and I meeting, I decide to tell my mom about him. In summary, she replied that she didn't think it was a very good idea because if we do end up being together and end up breaking up, it might ruin her relationship with his grandma, her close friend. I obviously try to convince her that it'll be okay if we end up being together and we can make it work out. She says something like ""I've lived longer than you have, I know how this'll work out."" We get into an argument on the way home about it and I end up sulking in my room. Ten minutes later, she says ""It's my relationship to deal with."" I still have no idea what this means so if anyone can help my understand, that'd be great. We end up saying sorry but I'm still set on making her understand that it'll be okay that we get together. I understand what she means when she says that she doesn't want her relationship with her friend to be ruined but I won't go down without a fight. Austin and I made plans to go see Christmas lights so of course I ask my mom if I can go with him. All she says is ""I thought you guys were just friends."" We end up talking about honesty and I tell her truthfully, ""We're just friends right now but if anything happens, I promise I'll let you know"" My mom counters back with ""There shouldn't be anything happening, I'm telling you that my relationship with his grandma is important to me."" She eventually tells me that I can go with him.

I found out 2 years ago that he died in 2016, when I was 15 years old. This blindsided me and I struggled to process the grief properly because it‚Äôs especially difficult to grieve for someone you have never even met and don‚Äôt really know. All that I know of him I researched online or heard from my mother, who rarely ever discusses him. I know he was a radio host, music lover, and greatly admired by his community. Over 1000 people attended his funeral.

I was hit by an incredible wave of grief this Christmas Eve and have been awake for hours crying and missing him like crazy. I have never regretted anything in my life more than the fact that I never reached out to him while he was still alive and now it‚Äôs too late. So, I figured I might as well do my best to get to know the person he was.

I haven't spoken to my Mother in 8 months due to the massive amounts of stress I've been under and some intense events. To list some things off that happened this past year, I was attacked 13 times this year by people trying to murder me with various weapons while I was on the job (I worked as an unarmed security guard in downtown Portland, OR), I was sexually assaulted and sexually harassed 3 days out of the week during that time by a co-worker (I reported the individual to the police after my company failed to protect me and others from the individual), and I completely cut off my father's side due to an abusive history with them. I also need to tell her about a family friend molesting me at a young age and the extent of my father's abuse.

I basically haven't been able to speak with her during this time due to all of these things and she doesn't know about any of this jazz. My girlfriend insists that I tell her today since I have been holding onto this and more for far too long. We used to be so close and I would tell her everything but I find this incredibly difficult and I'm not sure how to go about it.

A lot of them specifically talk down on themselves and complain and post it to their close friends story and I understand it‚Äôs a human thing to feel self conscious and frustrated, but it‚Äôs really really negative and I don‚Äôt want to see it. And I feel rude and unsupportive of their personal issues if I were to just outright unfollow them after so many years but we never talk and I don‚Äôt want them on my page because when I reach out to talk about stuff, I feel like it‚Äôs a very surface level convo and I feel like I can‚Äôt offer much of myself to help them.

I really do like social media and I like my friends as people but I want it to be a stress free place for myself. I also like seeing them grow and hoping they will find inner peace, but it‚Äôs been a while and they‚Äôre still taking in the same depressing stuff from years ago and not trying to change.

I know there‚Äôs a mute button for the reason of not seeming rude but honestly I don‚Äôt want to use it.. I just want to clean my life and that includes the fear that I‚Äôm rude on social media lol. I just can‚Äôt help but think about how I could be that reason somebody has a shitty day, cuz after so many years I decide to go ghost, and I don‚Äôt want them feeling bad for my decision to better myself.

The only grandmother I had left passed away late July, and I became so sad that I ended up dropping out from a class and getting my first C on my transcript. I also learned that my nephew‚Äôs father was another man (not my sister‚Äôs ex-husband), that my dad became depressed because of that (my sister is just a huge disappointment), that some ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were talking shit about me, and that my best girl-friend is somewhat a hypocrite.

323,"This is jarring because I‚Äôve never posted something serious before this, but I really need help.
I‚Äôm a sixteen year old girl, and I genuinely cannot stand being around my mother. It‚Äôs not me being an edgy teenager, I‚Äôm a straight arrow in school and am very quiet and rarely cause trouble. I‚Äôve never raised my voice at her. I feel anxious any time I‚Äôm alone with her and my favorite days of the week are the ones where she works so I don‚Äôt have to spend time with her. She‚Äôs nosy and feels like she constantly has to know what I‚Äôm doing, even so far that she screams and bangs on my door if I lock it, because she doesn‚Äôt trust me with anything. 
She does that thing some parents do, making me feel guilty by saying ‚ÄúI give you a home and food and pay for everything, and this is how you repay me‚Äù, making me feel awful even though I didn‚Äôt choose to be born. Whenever she‚Äôs angry about something, she takes it out on me. Her constantly being controlling and degrading me has left me totally unable to stand up for myself. I‚Äôm prone to breaking into tears whenever someone raises their voice at me or pressures me to do something, and she feels no sympathy for when I break down  when she screams at me, usually telling me I don‚Äôt deserve to be upset. I feel like I‚Äôm not allowed to have emotions when she‚Äôs around. I cry whenever I even try to tell friends about what she does in person. I can only vent online, and even then I can‚Äôt help but be in tears as I type; there‚Äôs no way I could possibly tell her about this without becoming a complete mess and unable to speak.
She constantly says horrible things to me, here‚Äôs ones I can remember off the top of my head: whiny little bitch, selfish asshole, dumbass, other common swears, though I think ‚Äòasshole‚Äô is the most common. Just yesterday she said ‚Äúwhat the fuck is wrong with you‚Äù because she found out sometimes I eat food in the bathroom instead of the kitchen, because it feels safer in there. I‚Äôm in an art program at school and I love it, and she‚Äôs told me ‚Äòyour art isn‚Äôt even that good‚Äô when she threatens to take me out of it for having bad grades.
I love my dad. He‚Äôs so understanding and agrees with me when I tell him I feel she‚Äôs being unfair. I get my anxiety and depression from his side of the family and my mom is neuroptypical so he gets me better than anyone and is always there for me to vent. But she‚Äôs controlling to him too, and he‚Äôs afraid of standing up to her.
She‚Äôs rarely physically abusive, but it happens, and when it does it‚Äôs REALLY bad. The last time was a few months ago. I forgot exactly what made her angry, but after screaming at me for a while she literally lunged at me and started hitting me. When I tried to push her away, literally  having a panic attack at this point, she started saying ‚ÄúFIGHT BACK. FIGHT BACK.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what that meant still, but she didn‚Äôt stop until I ran away from her. I told her I was considering telling me the police, and she straight up told me they wouldn‚Äôt believe me since there were no bruises. It‚Äôs terrifying being alone with her because I never know when it might happen alone.
The thing that makes all of this worse is it happens completely behind closed doors, and she has loads of friends who think everything is perfect between us. From an outside perspective, everything is fine and I‚Äôm just ‚Äòshy‚Äô when she‚Äôs around.
My parents both didn‚Äôt go to college and my mom dropped out of high school, so she doesn‚Äôt know how to raise me so that I get good grades, but she always blames me for having bad grades in certain classes because I‚Äôm a gifted student and therefore supposed to do great no matter what. 
Once I tried telling a therapist(I‚Äôve gone through a few over the years) and she was furious and denied everything. Now she insists on being in the room with me during every session, and convinced my current therapist that our relationship is getting better even though it isn‚Äôt.  
She threatens that if I tell someone about what she does to me, I‚Äôll be taken away from her. I don‚Äôt want that, I love my pets and my dad and my house and I don‚Äôt want to leave that behind. But I feel like if I weather the abuse I‚Äôm going to snap and end up hurting her. Nothing is getting better. Our relationship isn‚Äôt healing, it‚Äôs worsening. She doesn‚Äôt understand she‚Äôs damaging me, probably because I expressed my love for her when I was little because I didn‚Äôt understand that how she treated me wasn‚Äôt normal, and I thought you HAD to love your parents. I‚Äôm forced to be quiet about my feelings, so I cant tell her without her blowing up. She can‚Äôt take criticism. Deep down I guess it‚Äôs not entirely her fault, she had a mom who abandoned her so she never had a good mother figure to learn from. But that doesn‚Äôt excuse it. My dad agrees with me, but he‚Äôs too afraid of her to intervene.
I‚Äôm not exaggerating this because I want pity or anything, I‚Äôm being totally honest. I have absolutely no idea where to begin fixing this. If anyone can provide any kind of help, please, I need it.",25Dec2019,1
324,"Hello there! 

So my sister and her boyfriend had been dating about 3 years. They broke up for a bit last year because my sister wasn‚Äôt happy, but they got back together. Due to that the fact they were more unhappier when they are not together. I wish they never got back together. I know breakups are hard, but their relationship is really bad.

My sister‚Äôs boyfriend moved in to my siste and I‚Äôs parents house, around after they broke up and their relationship got worse(?) but I feel like I didn‚Äôt witness fight everyday so I wouldn‚Äôt have known their relationships were bad. But before her boyfriend moved in, anytime my sister, her boyfriend and I hang out, they always fight. 

It is annoying me. I have been trying stopping them from bickering, especially front of me.  It is not considerate or healthy for them to fight front of me. It is okay a couple of times, but it is everyday. I am still young and growing, and I feel like it is ruining my perception of relationships and my own growth. Instead of doing what I enjoy and spending quality time with my loved ones, they ruin it and make me super frustrated.

I find it is okay to argue, as long as you acknowledge your differences with your partner, and do your best to understand each other. They do not try to understand each other, they want to be right and protect their pride, not protect their relationship with each other, and me. 

Now it is getting really bad, my sister is pressuring her boyfriend to get married too early. My sister is still in school, and they are not ready to settle down. Their relationship is toxic and ruining my love for my sister and her boyfriend. I tend to forgive people, but they do not learn their lesson. They continue fighting and making me feel uncomfortable and not having enjoying the times I have with them.

I cannot communicate how I feel because they will not understand how I feel. They will reject my feelings. I got angry at them before, but they just got pissed off at me for being annoyed at their constant bickering. But I got to say it was my bad for not telling them maturely how I felt, and instead acting passive aggressive. 

What should I do to cope with this frustration? 

Thank you!",25Dec2019,1
325,"It's the night before Christmas and the bottom of the tree is absolutely filled with gifts. I can't even count how many gifts we must have bought for people this year. My fiance has a bit of a christmas obsession and she goes balls to the wall buying decorations, baking literally hundreds of cookies (shes probably near 500 cookies for the holiday season) and buying gifts for everyone she knows. 


I've been working an average of 50 hours a week to make sure we aren't just living paycheck to paycheck. I'm struggling to give us a safety net and save for retirement. We dont have an adequate emergency fund by a longshot. When I see all the copious amounts of gifts under the tree it feels so wasteful. Not only is there tons of plastic but there's just so much under the tree that we don't really need at all. It represents a huge time commitment, shopping for gifts and trying to decide the perfect gift for every person in the family. Her daughter will have received over 25 gifts by the time christmas is over. 


I dont know how much we spent but it's easily in the thousands. When I look at all those gifts it feels absolutely insane and nonsensical that we put ourselves through this every year. I was considering talking with my fiance and having us announce next year that we will not be giving gifts next year. I was thinking that we could do one gift per person just for my fiance, her daughter and me and leave it at that. No buying gifts for every person we know. Christmas should be more about the time we spend with each other, not a consumerist orgy of purchasing and wasting. I dont know how likely it will that my fiance will be on board, but I want to at least propose it. 


Before I do, what do you guys think about no gift Christmas? Am I being a scrooge for suggesting it? Does it have logic to it or am I just crazy? I just hate how wasteful the whole thing feels to me and dont want to have to be part of it anymore.",25Dec2019,1

329,"  I am 17 (boy) and, one night, last summer, i found a website that allows people toanonymously exchange nudes with random people around the world. Kinda of a dirty omegle (I deeply regret this night). The first person that I've matched sent me nudes and a photo of his face. So, i figured thats the purpose of the website, a photo of my face and and a nude or two. So thats what I did to the next random people that i have matched with (maybe 3,4,5). It was the most stupid and idiotic thing I've ever done.
  All the nudes show is, at MAX, my belly button and, well, my genitals.
  What causes my anxiety is the fact that next year im hoping i can get into medschool, but what if my nudes get leaked when in attending university? Can i get in serious problems like getting kicked out? Can a photo of my genitals destroy my future career? Is it even possible that my nudes can get leaked?
  These 6 months since the incident have been hell to me, so I guess I could use some help...",25Dec2019,1

The place was a Hell-hole and I landed the exact same job elsewhere on the last day I worked at the aforementioned workplace. I never collected my last paycheck from them because my mentality at the time told me that I was so disgusted with them that I didn't want their money - plus, it was less than 10 hours so it wasn't hurting me much.

332,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm a [22F] and I‚Äôve been with my [22M] boyfriend for two years. I just want to start off by saying I love my boyfriend a lot, but things haven‚Äôt been going well for us these last two months. When I first met him, he told me that his dad had congestive heart failure and was always in &amp; out of the hospital. 

Last month, his dad got really sick and I went with him to the hospital every single day just so I could support him. I could tell that it was really taking a toll on him. On Thanksgiving, he completely lashed out on me. Called me 30 times, sent me over 50 messages telling me that I was a shitty girlfriend, I‚Äôm trash, and saying that he wanted to break up with me. He even came to my house to try to confront me, but my sister told him to calm down. At first he didn‚Äôt take accountability for what happened, but he eventually apologized to me. 

His dad passed away on Saturday and I‚Äôve just been trying to be as supportive as I can. I understand how he feels because my dad died a couple of years ago too. It‚Äôs even more depressing for him because he doesn‚Äôt have a mother or father now. There have been a couple of times when he‚Äôs lashed out on me in the past and I‚Äôm just scared that it‚Äôs going to get even worse in the future. I have a lot of sympathy for him, but I‚Äôm not a punching bag. My mom said if it ever becomes too much for me, I don‚Äôt have to stay with him. Would that be wrong of me if I ever decided to end it while he‚Äôs still grieving? Again, I know he‚Äôs going through so much but sometimes I think that he‚Äôs not in the right mind to be in a relationship right now.",25Dec2019,1

335,"Okaaaaaaaaay, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll regret this tomorrow, but here it goes...So my sister was in an abusive relationship that ended with restraining orders and you know the deal‚Äîanyways, after the infamous ending incident she came to live with me in the state I reside (for safety purposes I won‚Äôt share our location currently or previously). This was three years ago this upcoming summer. Her and her child (soon to be five) moved in with myself and my daughter (I‚Äôm a widow). 

The first year she was extremely verbally abusive and physically abusive on a few occasions. She leaves unexpectedly without sharing where she goes or who she‚Äôs with or what she‚Äôs up to. Often, when she is home she‚Äôs sleeping or silently laying down on her phone. Other times she is absolutely manically nasty‚Äîswearing and short tempered with all of us‚Äîincluding her son. At first, I thought she was grieving and traumatized. Now it‚Äôs been a few years and my parents have moved states to join us. 

Often I wake up with her child and she walks in the door and says she was merely running to the nearest gas station (for cigarettes or gas?) and doesn‚Äôt realize we‚Äôve been up for hours. Other times‚Äîshe leaves mid day and doesn‚Äôt return until after dinner. Whenever asked about where she‚Äôs been or what she‚Äôs up to she goes into a full-on psychotic rant. It escalates to saying she‚Äôll just go to a shelter with her child? Or she states she will find some other living situation and then manically grabs her kid (I honestly want to leave their gender absent from this in the off chance that she finds it or someone else links it back to us) in the car and doesn‚Äôt come back until everyone‚Äôs asleep. So at best she‚Äôs aimlessly driving with them in the car late into their sleep schedule. 

She never spends quality time with them‚Äîso their speech is lagged and they‚Äôve been categorized in the county school system as qualifying for an IEP (and currently receive speech therapy. I was working with them and reading etc. but if she came home and we were working she would become erratic and scary and emphasize to them that I‚Äôm not their parent and essentially punish them for asking for help from any adult that isn‚Äôt her‚Äîin fact, the most recent time this happened, immediately following she left for two hours (not long but) during which the child wouldn‚Äôt allow myself or my parents into their room and said we couldn‚Äôt help them. The child needed help cleaning themself in the bathroom following a bowel movement. The child was so distressed about asking/receiving aid that they stayed with their mess until the mom arrived home. 

Anyways recently my parents asked that I reconcile their books (their bank accounts etc.) and I found that the trust that they put her in charge of she was siphoning out of everyday until about $150,000 over a period of eight months was gone. In this time she also managed to sync her overdrafts to my daughter‚Äôs savings account (of her dad‚Äôs life insurance of 30,000) which my mother is tied to. Which‚Äîby the way‚Äîwas still overdrafting despite the consistent transfers she was sending herself. In addition to this, she also was begging my mother for money claiming she needed it for school and credit card debt. She doesn‚Äôt pay rent, she doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîshe was going to beauty school until recently. 

Oh and I almost forgot during this time she also sold her land rover for 11,000 blew through that, and was given my mother‚Äôs Jeep to use payment free‚Äîbut while they were on vacation chose to use the brand new land rover my parents had bought and totaled it. Oh and in doing so I found in the totaled car loads of gift cards‚Äîlike VISA gift cards from Home Depot, Walgreens‚Äîfurther investigation lead to times she used my mother‚Äôs card for ‚Äúgroceries,‚Äù that truly ended up being $9.14, $23 in change and then very clearly 100 back in cash.

They‚Äôve since gotten her a new Toyota Rav-4 lease as co-signers, and pay the payments and insurance‚Äîshe racked up enough driving tickets in this time (of having the new car‚ÄîMay 2019‚Äîthat my parents insurance company sent them a letter stating they would no longer hold their idk ‚Äúadditional coverage‚Äù policy not auto‚Äîumbrella? fuck guys I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called, haha fuck anyways, it was a 2 million dollar policy they‚Äôve been paying into for quite some time but because we‚Äôre now all under the same household and her tickets and driving record in general they‚Äôre revoking coverage. 

Her child is amazing, hilarious, kind, considerate‚Äîhe‚Äôs four and she‚Äôs legit yelled at him so much for not needing or asking for our help that he makes his own bed (like to a point it looks like a grownup did it) and she forces him to take a shower and not need help like you can hear him crying (when she‚Äôs home and decides he needs to be self sufficient‚Äîat 4‚Äîand no longer take baths or need aid?) I guess my ultimate question is what do you think she‚Äôs doing?‚Äîall this time, with all this money (by the way we have a family business that long story short our IT guys stole from so my dad and I and one AH-mazing employee we‚Äôve kept, the only one, have been struggling the last two years to keep alive so she‚Äôs spent/wasted essentially VITAL funds)? 

Often in the middle of the night she‚Äôs gone. They‚Äôll come into my room and ask if he can sleep with me or just say, ‚Äúmy mum is gone,‚Äù or I wake up and then her child does with me and she‚Äôll walk in, or she just leaves mid day/night‚Äî week/weekend no details to anyone and doesn‚Äôt return until evening. Sometimes she returns for 20 mins to an hour before leaving again for several hours. 

Is she on drugs? What drugs make you miserable when you wake up but virtually comatose otherwise? Is it just some manic reaction to trauma and she‚Äôs been enabled by my folks and myself? Or is she just manically blowing money on credit cards and bullshit?

At this point not only could she have hired class act tutors for her child‚Äîor paid off multiple credit cards but she could have started a fucking small business. She has nothing to show fo these massive sums of money‚Äîand in addition‚Äîconsistently BEGS for cash from my folks or at one point was begging AS WELL AS swindling from their trust AND running into the house grabbing his old toys cleaning them (with Clorox wipes) while manically discussing their trails of single parenthood? I legit don‚Äôt understand. Where could the money be going? Am I losing my mind? She has NO EXPENSES outside of the occasional class (Beauty school or community college). Oh I forgot to mention I can‚Äôt afford to but my parents pay for her child‚Äôs education as well? So it‚Äôs not like daycare or pre-K is breaking the bank. I just??? What‚Äôs going on? What do you guys think? What do we do? 

***I also ask that you recognize while cutting someone off seems appropriate in most occasions‚Äîand calling them out as well, every time this has happened I feel she endangers my niece/nephew. And I feel the only consistency and safety they receive in through us. She knows this (that I‚Äîand my parents I‚Äôm sure‚Äîcare SO very much for her child that she uses this against all of us‚Äîlike a bargaining tool by threatening etc. instead of considering what‚Äôs best for the child). 

Anyone have any ideas? Where does one go from here? Am I overstepping?",25Dec2019,1

338,"We have dated for 3 years, and now we're married for almost 4 years. We live in Europe, I am from the Middle East.

‚Äê----------BACKSTORY

The job market of the country we are in is very tough and there is a lot of discrimination going around. Needless to say I had a hard time adapting to here and I always wanted to go back to my country, with or without him. 

---------(JOB RANT)

I am a university grad with a degree in translation studies, but the only job I could find was cleaning at the beginning, then I got tennis arm on my both arms due to working and got dismissed. 

Then I found a retail job, at which even going to the bathroom was an issue, and I was told to ""put on diapers"" more than once. My boss overworked me (10 hours Mo-Sa WITHOUT any breaks) until I had to be hospitalized due to severe depression. After that her other worker came back and she also found someone else and had me work only 5 hours x 3 times a week. I opposed, wanted to work more hours, and got fired. 

‚Äê-------(END OF JOB RANT)

I also have Bipolar Disorder Type II, social anxiety with panic attacks, and the job situation took a toll on me.I used to always tell my husband that we should go away from this country, that I am very unhappy here without a job and I have suicidal tendencies. 

After another discussion, in which I told him I'd leave this country, asked him if he was coming, he said no, he changed a lot. He distanced himself and practically left me to myself for 1 year. During this time my family came for 1 week to HELP us move apartments, and this became a major issue, because he didn't want my family to come ""in that stressful time"". 

Also during this time, I wanted him ""back in my life"" as in being a couple again. He didn't want it. I said I want to divorce if he continues to push me away, and he said let's divorce. I spent that night crying, and when he woke up for work I begged him not to go through with the divorce. He agreed.

-------------END OF BACKSTORY

During this time he went to his parents', left me for many evenings alone, and came home to sleep. In these days he explained to them that I am sick, mentally ill, and very clinging. 

After convincing him to seek help (which wasn't easy) and he got on meds, he can now see clearly that he shouldn't have disclosed my health situation to third parties (his parents, brother and sister in law), that I am not clinging, but affectionate and that it is normal for im to hug me every once in a while. 

So whenever I come to meet them, my mother in law tells me to ""calm down"", when I'm out of breath from walking. When we mentioned our plans to have a baby, my sister in law told me to ""wait a little"", that ""we're not ready yet"", that ""it's really hard and I'm not capable yet"".

We talked and decided that we are going to tell his family that we're past this and that we don't want to hear anything about this issue anymore. I was running late from work and he went ahead and talked to them WITHOUT me, which of course made it looked like I sent him.

Now all I do is go to family gatherings, say hi, sit down, eat and say and bye. I don't feel like doing anything mainly because everyone knows ""I'm mentally ill."" It is embarrasing. Everyone notices, everyone asks me what the matter is, to which I keep saying ""nothing"". I don't want to talk more about it, because it's been wrongly addressed twice already. 

Now I don't trust my husband and I can't forgive him. How can I do that and be past it? 

If you made it this far, thank you very much.",25Dec2019,1
339,"Long story short, I casually dated a guy in my class over a year ago and agreed to help take his virginity and hung out a few times.


Every seemed to be going ok but he became a bit unpredictable (one day saying I'm the only one he gets on with and enjoys talking to in class then being rude the next day), treated me pretty poorly and disrespected me during sex and then wanted a 'break' around exams and deleted me off everything so I cut him out and started to sit away and ignore him in class.


I contacted him later just to apologise and try and be civil as we did get on platonically but he was cold and said he wasn't interested in anything nor me. Which hurt me a bit but I moved on.


I thought that was the end of it but five monthsater he started to stalk my instagram stories nearly everyday on a couple of accounts for about six months until I just gave up and stopped using the app.


I had some peace until August this year when his best friend reached out on FB and asked how I'd been, I didn't know his intention so I just ignored it and this was followed by another message then several memes ending last month.


Another guy we sat with also messaged me and essentially told me the guy had doxxed me and shown various guys in my class compromising videos and images he'd taken without my permission. But then he apologised and stated that it was all a lie.


I also got another suspicious message on here with someone asking to swap numbers and meet up because they lived near my suburb and named it, thing is, I've never stated my location on any of my accounts so they would have to know me...they even went to the effort of fabricating a character over the last six months which I give them points for effort but I'm not a dumb or oblivious person, I'm very suspicious.



The thing is, I don't know why it's all happening now over a year later when I couldn't care less about any of it and have moved on and a totally different person than I was as I've been working to improve myself and in a much better place socially now I have a job and friends. 


I don't know if the guy has brought me up but I only knew these guys for about 5 months at the start of last year and I thought they would have all forgotten me like I have them and moved on with their lives. I did share a class with the guy last semester but I had my back to him and didn't look at him and treated him like he was just someone in the class.


I don't know why they'd have any reason to care about me like I wouldn't consider myself pretty or remarkable, I'm friendly and popular with nearly everyone at work and a very social person and try to get to know a lot of people but I wouldn't call myself a standout. I've also had a low profile on social media not using anything but FB messenger and Whatsapp until I got through a rough patch and felt better so its not like anyone is exposed to or reminded of me as I've been non existent online.


I don't know why its happening, maybe because I don't care anymore but why would anyone think of me now?


Also how do I make it stop? Do I contact the guy directly (he hasn't blocked me) and tell him to keep his friends in check and talk to them or would that be a bad idea? Idk, I'm over it.",25Dec2019,1

341,"I (26M) am a teacher in Spain in a private school and I don't know if I should study to become a teacher in a public school

I am writing this because I have a really big decision to make regarding my professional career, and I thought that maybe people from other places in the world could give me some perspective. I am a teacher in a private school in Spain, but I‚Äôm not sure if I should study to become a public teacher (where I‚Äôll have a position for life), or rather stay in a private school where I could be fired anytime.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know how the educational system work here I‚Äôll sum it up a bit: 

You have to pass a really difficult exam (where you are basically tested on how much information you are able to retain and then write non-stop for four hours about a topic related to your area). In order to sit this exam and do well it is normal to spend at least more than a year studying full-time. 

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to pass the three parts that the exam consists of, and you also have prior experience and therefore have enough points to compete against other teachers, then you will become a full-time secondary teacher forever. With this job there comes also a really good pay (2000 euros a month, which is a lot for the economic situation here). -However, this pay is the same in a private school, or at least similar-.

The point is that I am not sure if I want to be a teacher forever, I hate how the system works here in Spain, where people are rewarded for not being ambitious and spending the rest of their lives doing the same. 

It is just that it is so much effort I have to put into studying the exam. It is also common for people who prepare for this test to quit their jobs and study full-time, as it is really difficult to memorize so many topics.

What would you do? Keep being a teacher in a private school where your job is not secured, or study to become a public teacher and then have a job for life?",25Dec2019,1

I live in Australia, and cases like that don't happen to often, nor is it easy to accomplish with our differently designed roofs. It isn't an attic, it's just a space between the ceiling in roof, as it's not meant to hold items or people. 

After a bit of it, my family started joking about it. I was fine with the jokes, and we even gave him a name. I won't tell you the name, because my family uses Reddit, and I'm a bit worried that they'll find this, as I haven't told them that I'll post it. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago we saw it slightly askew. We weren't too worried about it until today. We went out for Christmas, and came back at around 7:30 pm. My father had come home about an hour prior due to an upset stomach. 

My brother noticed the hatch (in the garage) that led to the rafters was open. Not just slightly askew, but like they had hurried when closing it. My father was fuming, absolutely livid that someone would have the audacity to enter our house. When explaining it could possibly be a possum or the wind, he decided to take a look himself.

There is a hole in our roof. To enter our house, you'd simply have to move a few panels and hop in. No possum droppings, and it was impossible for the wind to move it. 

My father hypothesised a dry run or police planting a bug. We're still not entirely sure, and everyone's really worried.

346,"Met a guy at a work induction, we got on instantly really well and had good banter and our conversations flowed really well. I dropped him home and we laughed all the way and he messaged me and we started talking but I stopped replying as I had exams/work training. He didn't message me and qe didn't reconnect until we started working together again.


From the moment he started flirting with me, looking at me, coming into my personal space and complimenting me when I put on a disposable apron. We also went back to teasing/being playfully mean to eachother.


However, the past two weeks it has gotten more intense/obvious and I have been trying to ignore him be wary as one of my managers hates me and always waits for me to slip up so she can be a bitch to me and picks on me so I've been being careful while she's on shift.


I'm not too sure about him though as he seems very confident and is a very smooth talker with his flirting always having the right thing to say which makes me wary he might be a player and be leading me on even though I haven't seen him flirt with any other girls in the workplace.


For example, I was cleaning something and he came over and said, ""spectacular, beautiful, incredible, amazing...I could be talking about your cleaning or I could be talking about something else..."" I just rolled my eyes and laughed at him. I also said I was thirsty and he grabbed a drink and implied I could have some out of his mouth, another guy that likes me was working with me and looked a bit surprised and offered to blow on my hands as I'd been in the freezer.
He also comes up and talks to me a lot and brushes up against me (which isn't obvious as we work in a busy, close environment) and when I joked that he was flirting with a guy he remarked, ""why are you jealous?"" To which I got him by saying no, why would I be? And he looked resigned and simply replied ""no reason"".


He was upset the other day so I asked if he was ok and told him to take a break and took over his station. He messaged me after to day that it was really sweet and if I ever needed a shoulder to cry on that he's there.


We have great chemistry and get on great, it's just I don't know, his confidence and expert flirting and knowing what to say makes me really wary that he's a player and after one thing but I don't want to miss an opportunity. He's a very outgoing and social person normally but idk.
I also don't want to fall for someone's charming ways and be burnt.

This uprooted MANY issues. 1, it's too unisex and even though I've been on Testosterone injections for 4, going on 5 months, people still get confused. Sometimes I still hear the ""so....what ARE you?"" question cause I'm not far along enough on my transition to look 100% male. If I introduce myself to someone new as Charlie, I'm horrified of that causing even more confusion and unwanted questions.

There's also the obvious problem of if I change it, that's basically me saying ""hey I know I've been going by THIS name for more than a year now, and you are all super used to it, but I want you to call me something else now!"" Maybe it's just me naturally being a people pleaser, but the last thing I want to do is be annoying or an inconvenience. That's why no one even knew about this until last week when it slipped out with some close friends. They are all giving me mixed advice.

Some say ""who cares about what other's think? If you want to be called Charlie, then be called Charlie!"" Others say ""maybe just try to forget about the name as a whole"" and some say ""just go by Simon with everyone you know, but introduce yourself to new people as Charlie.""

Some other info is I started realizing I liked the name because of some accounts I help run. On Instagram, I and some others share accounts and post LGBT content, weather it be news, memes, art, ect. On the bio, we put down our names and pronouns so the followers know who the admins are. I'm in 3 of these accounts and go by Charlie on all 3. One friend knows this and she says that that's why I ""think I like it"" because I just got used to it. Problem is, I'm not new to going by a fake name. I go by Simon on my personal account but go by fake names on any others due to me being anxious about someone finding my personal account. I went by Aaron, Jack, and Lew on a few others back then, and never even questioned if I liked them enough for me to go by them. That's why this name is oddly different, because Charlie is the only fake name I'm actually now considering going by. But now I'm not sure what to do because even though I do want to go by it, I'm terrified of telling anyone, especially my family because they wont like the news and probably won't call me Charlie if i DID tell them. What should I do?

PS if you need any extra info, I'll be glad to share. thank you in advance and happy holidays :)",25Dec2019,1
353,"I‚Äôm not taking any judgement this time. Please keep that shit away from me.  My partner won‚Äôt stop driving while fucked up. He has an alcohol and ketamine problem. I try to set rules in place to protect him and myself and our 4 month old baby but he breaks every one of them. He will be too fucked up to drive (I won‚Äôt realize it until we are on the roads driving) and will REFUSE to pull over despite me screaming at him and begging him to stop the car. He will be swerving in two lanes and almost hitting objects WHILE OUR BABY IS IN THE CAR.  He will be on ketamine at the house and is a danger to our son. He‚Äôs hurt him once. He was wayyy to lit and was standing above the baby who was on a mattress on the floor. His dumbass 270lb body comes crashing down on our infant son (he fell on him). The baby screamed and cried but was okay. That‚Äôs when I banned ketamine from the house. I told him if he ever brings it into our house I will call the police. I told him if he wants to do it he has to find a place outside of our home. Tonight he was at his parents house and I stayed home because I was tired. He comes home LIT and I start going off on him. Clearly he was in no condition to be driving home ! He couldn‚Äôt even stand up straight ! I tell him he easily could have killed someone tonight and taken them away from their family. That‚Äôs when he pulls out the ketamine he bought (going against my rules) and tells me he was going to hide it from me and lie to me about it but he‚Äôs choosing to tell me about it instead.  I try to drill in his brain the fact that his actions could have caused a death but he doesn‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúI came straight home‚Äù ‚ÄúI was being careful.‚Äù I do not know how to drive, always lived in cities and never needed to.

I can‚Äôt take me and the baby to my family‚Äôs house there is no space or resources for us. I don‚Äôt make much money on my own. I do love him and don‚Äôt even want to break up with him, wouldn‚Äôt have any options or places to go if I did. I need to protect my child. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

354,Quick backstory he gave me his old iPhone in August so I think he thinks that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful but he didn‚Äôt say this is your Christmas present he asked me if I wanted it and I obviously said yes thank you. Even a small thoughtful gift would be nice to unwrap I just had to watch everyone else especially him and his wife open a number of gifts and I got both of them something thoughtful and pricey. It just hurts I went through a lot of effort and always get the short straw. For the past couple of years I feel he hasn‚Äôt put effort in. I know his wife stays away because she doesn‚Äôt care so I don‚Äôt care but he is my brother I expected more.,25Dec2019,1

362,"This entire thing is about Christmas. I don't have anything against Christmas.  . . I'm sure I would love Christmas if it was just my parents and siblings (who also share the same view as me). So I better just start from the beginning, my mum's grandpa had worked up companies from nothing and became very wealthy because of this. He had a wife and a few kids (idk how many) but sadly he and his wife passed away, which left my grandma and her sisters a fortune. Grandma and her sisters would always want to show off their money to each other during Christmas (yes it is all relevant I promise), so each and every family member would have to get a gift for everyone. Even my mum from a young age would have to get everyone a gift without any financial support from her own parents just to show how rich they were (yes even before she had a job and when she was a broke university student). To further explain: everyone gave individual presents, someone would have about 5 gifts given individually from the one part of the family. Since then grandma and grandpa have made some really bad descisions and are now riddled with debt, unfortunately grandpa is also dead now. We also no longer do Christmas with the other side of the family (around when my aunt's and mum had kids)
So ... anyway back to the main point. This tradition has half carried over and everyone is expected to give presents even though my parents have pushed and pushed and pushed for just a couple presents from the entire family, but they are made to feel like they are being rude. This whole tradition has made our Christmas all about presents when it should be about family and having fun. Because of all this I have started to dislike Christmas because it is only about presents and that's all anyone thinks about. But I do sometimes feel like I'm being really ungrateful because some people dont get to celebrate Christmas but I feel like the way our family does Christmas isn't really Christmas at all.
I just need some advice on how I might be able to alter things and I want to know if I really am being ungreatful or it's in my head. 
The only way I see out of it is when I create my own family I'll be able invite my siblings and parents to have Christmas with us.",25Dec2019,1

365,"(Sorry if there is any grammar mistake, my english is not that good) I work part time in a restaurant and one day this lady walked in, she caught my attention instantly with her charisma. She sat down and i went to take her order and we talked for a bit. We became friends and she started coming to my workplace more frequently, we became closer and closer and i find myself thinking about her when im off work and i would hope everyday that she'll come to restaurant that i work at.

She's coming to my workplace very often nowadays and we got to talk alot, i found out that she is a single mother with two children, one is 9yo and one is 14yo. Despite that, her calmness and steadiness and the way she presents herself is nothing like i've ever seen before, so i started having feelings for her and im not sure what to do about it.

Due to her coming to my workplace often, she has also met a few of my bosses who owns the restaurant, and even my bosses cant help falling for her, it is obvious that my bosses are into her as well. The thing that's been bugging me is that she pays next to zero attention to everyone in the restaurant including my bosses but when she talks to me, she gives me her full attention and she would keep asking me questions and talk to me whenever she has the chance to. Funny thing is when my bosses are conversing with her, she would be on her phone and not pay that much attention to them but when i talk to her ? She silences her phone and puts her phone away.

I have never seen anyone who has been able to keep a conversation going with her for more than 15 minutes and when i talk with her ? We could go on for at least an hour. I might be overthinking but i think she likes me as well ? But im just not sure if we share mutual feelings, i have romantic feelings for her but she could just like me as a friend to talk to, but i certainly hope thats not the case.

What do i do guys ? Im lost and sad because i know im too young for her, theres an 18 years gap between our age. I am yet to be financially stable but she already has her life together. But people say age is just a number and i too believe that, but if i want to get her, how should i do it, or should i just give up ? I dont want to be humiliated if she rejects me and think im just fooling around because of my age.

I am just overall lost and sad and wondering what i should do.",25Dec2019,1

370,"17F. Since I was little I would get super stressed out. Before the first day of every school year in elementary I would get sick because of how stressed I was due to being so nervous, and this was all throughout grade 2-7. 

In highschool it only got worse, if my parents would yell at me or even little things like having a bad skin day or something I would freak out. I would lock myself in the bathroom and cry and punch my legs but never hard. 

I never saw any of this as a problem when growing up. But now looking back I think I‚Äôve always faced extreme stress. Now being in university, I had a final exam coming up and I had the worst fever imaginable. I could barely get out of bed and I had a final in 2 days with no time to study because of how sick I was. I had a panic attack before my parents calmed me down and told me in uni I am able to reschedule a final due to illness which I ended up doing. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack before and it scares me, what if this happens again?

A sort by feature telling you which politicians stay true to their word based off of their voting history.

A calendar of when local political events are happening with time, date, officials in the running, matters being voted on. This calendar can be sorted from community leaders all the way to the presidency and everything in between.

Links to unbiased and factual information on the problems we feel strongly about and politicians that can help.

Red flags on politicians that vote against what we believe in, not just their words.

A map of locations to cast votes from the lowest to highest offices of our governments.

Reminders to tell us when things are about to go down and to read up on the topic and candidates prior to.

A ‚ÄúGood job! You cast 17 votes this year that helped make the following changes in legislation!‚Äù so we feel good about ourselves.

Hello everyone.

I (F18) have this problem where I can't decide what to do as a hobby, and it's (hopefully) not as dumb as it sounds.

I'll see someone playing the piano or violin, and I have this urge to learn it. Or pottery. Or photography. Or even learning a new language. I think it would *look* pretty to do all of those, but actually putting the effort to achieve that is hard.

I don't seem to be able to to continue with a thing till the end. For example, if I'm cooking or baking, I'll feel like whatever I'm doing is pointless and stop midway. And it is annoying as hell.

393,"Since i was a little kid i was problematic for my parents since i had a lot of energy but at the same time i was shy as hell, always complaining that kids hate me, and i would run from the kindergarten all the time and parents would find me in the other side of the town for some reason. I school i had a terrible time with teacher and peers since everyone could learn on the go and i was always having problems memorizing stuff and having problems with logic and such. It got to a point in 8th grade that i was just going to school to watch a person writing something on the wall without really understanding any of it. So i dropped out of school and I've tried to postpone this problem all my left but it got to a point where I'm starting to forget things a lot faster now,forgetting appointments, having really low self esteem and such. Because i had trouble understanding logic in school and basic stuff i dropped out of school, parents didn't give 2 cents about my future so I'm at this point in my life that I'm 32 years old with a crappy factory job, no money saved on the side, no wife, no kids, no house no thing and my future is looking pretty grim. I was seriously thinking in the past few days to just end my life to end this pain that i\`m constantly not good enough, people treat you like crap, you cant find a proper job or anything.

394,"I want to start this off by saying that I do love my parents, but I cant act like they haven't hurt me or my siblings. When I was really my mother would yell at me for the weight I was gaining and how she hates getting clothes for me. I remember one time she slapped me on my hip for it. She's the reason I have such bad body image to this day. 

She's also bad for making me feel guilty for having emotions and always has to win the ""pity game"". Every time I would try to talk about my mental health or the bullying I would go through at school all I would hear is ""Well I went through *insert different thing here* so suck it up"". My dad sides with her. He tells me my mom's anxiety is worse just because she smokes. As if that's an indicator of bad anxiety. I've shown signs of having an anxiety disorder since I was a baby from the stories I've been told, I couldn't go into new houses and would panic over things like getting new shoes and throwing up, but no one ever thought to actually take me to a doctor. They figured I could ""handle it"". Plot twist, it never got better.

I got bullied a lot when I was young and would sometimes play sick so I didn't have to go. Because of this, instead of trying to find out why I was doing it, they decided that I just wanted to be lazy and not go. I later told them what was going on and that I won't do it again, but they still didn't trust me. They made me feel guilty and would make me doubt I was even sick. Because of this I would constantly go to school sick and just feeling miserable.

Things got worse in high school. The bullying got worse and led to a sexual assault from one of my bullies. I won't get too into that it was a bad time. Not to mention I had another guy try to finger me during a movie so I couldn't say anything without interrupting everything, and we had a significant death in the family. The bullies made fun of him too. I hated myself and still do. 

I tried to tell my parents what was going on several times but I didn't know how to say it. I was ashamed to admit what happened directly. I tried to explain that my anxiety was worse in hopes to use that as a segway to explain what happened to only hear ""no it isn't"" or ""get over it"" or even ""your mother/I have things worse"". I felt like I couldn't tell them things so I just sat there and let my mental health deteriorate. What else was I supposed to do? I was too scared to talk to the counselor because I was afraid she would take their side, most of the teachers did, so I didn't tell anyone what was going on. 

Things just spiralled from there. I tried to kill myself at one point, but didn't go through with it because I couldn't leave my youngest brother, lets call him Cas. Cas is constantly bullied as well and gets the least attention at home. I couldn't leave him",25Dec2019,1

His family isn‚Äôt doing the best financially (living in a motel after losing apartment) and I can understand the struggle, HOWEVER if he can afford to buy 4 $1 fountain drinks a week and multiple 2 liters of soda then he can afford a stick of deodorant.

I stayed over at his house once (never doing that again) and his whole family smelled like shit. None of them ever shower even though they have running water. I have seen how that household functions and there is plenty of time for him to shower in the morning and at night. 

I feel conflicted as to if I should really sit down with him and speak heart to heart. I have been close friends with this dude for almost 6 years and my I can‚Äôt take the smell anymore. My own mother has bought shampoo, body wash and deodorant for him in the past and I doubt he ever used it.

404,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm intimidating. I cry at movies, pat every dog I see and have good manners. But recently my friends have been making a point to me to not be myself when involved in drama with a certain person, because I apparently get ‚Äúscary‚Äù or whatever. Mind you I rarely get involved in drama and when I do it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm standing up for myself or someone else bc someone was being a bitch. So, I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it at first. I asked every person I felt comfortable around if they thought I was scary or intimidating and they all replied yes or most of the time. I‚Äôm distraught. These people are my friends, I can‚Äôt even imagine what people who aren‚Äôt my friends think of me. 

I can kinda see it when you first meet me, I only say things if I have to, only talk to my friends, don‚Äôt laugh at jokes, get good grades in school, and as literally so many people have said I have ‚Äúsad eyes‚Äù. So yeah I kinda look like an antisocial emo. (I‚Äôm not)

My friends have said that once they got to know me I‚Äôm literally so sweet but they were also intimidated by me? I don‚Äôt mean any of this in a ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm so edgy on the outside but sweet on the inside don‚Äôt fuck with me‚Äù kinda way. I‚Äôm just saying what I‚Äôve observed. 

The thing with not laughing at jokes- I get the jokes and I think they‚Äôre funny, but if it isn‚Äôt my friend saying them I *cannot* laugh. I want to. But I can‚Äôt. I just sit there awkwardly, looking like I didn‚Äôt get it.

I also have a scary stare? I don‚Äôt mean to do it. It‚Äôs just my face. But my friends have started *crying* because they thought i was and at them when I was just doing my work? 

I‚Äôm worried, to say the least. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve always been like this and people are just starting to point it out now, or I‚Äôve listened to too much mcr and it‚Äôs affecting me. It would make sense that I don‚Äôt make friends all that well and people don‚Äôt normally talk to me- and people in my grade will talk to *anyone* if they‚Äôre bored. 

So yeah, idk bros and hoes. I mean, ever since I was a little kid I always thought I was okay, just another person but not *that* person, you know? The one who only talks to their friends unless making a sarcastic remark, rarely goes out with their friends and just looks like a mess. 

Maybe I give off the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Better than you‚Äù vibe. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better than anyone else- and I mean my life is nowhere near perfect. Lots of fights between and with my parents, anxiety, parents don‚Äôt care if I break the law and would probably laugh it off but I have to live up to my sisters perfect grades and is in every club and committee, but I also had to mature faster than everyone else in my grade because my sister just didn‚Äôt want to do shit with me anymore and she didn‚Äôt act like an older sister so *I* felt responsible and my dad always made fun of me and now all I can do is disappoint him. He didn‚Äôt even speak to me on my birthday this year. But you know, we‚Äôre sorta well off and my parents are still together so people think I‚Äôm just a bitch.

At first we gave him some food outside and it has escalated to him coming into our home via the cat doors and he intimidates our cats in their own home. We spoke to the owner and gave him a bag of cat food that we use for our cats so the cat can eat quality food and associate it with his home.

It went well for a while but now he is back. He is sneaking into our house, intimidating our cats in their own home, eating their food. He is a lovely cat and such a sweetheart, it breaks our heart that we can't keep him. We don't have enough financial aid to support 3 cats (we have 2 of our own). 

Our next plan is to kidnap him and take him to a lovely shelter (we don't live in the USA and this shelter does not put animals down if they don't get adopted)

She gave me the same gift as last year: a pack of chapstick, foot cream, and fluffy socks. (Although, fluffy socks are always a win. But foot cream? It even sounds sad). And then goes on to tell me all she got for her boyfriend and it was some really sweet stuff man :(.

My mother likes to randomly send me multiple paragraphs through text telling me how shitty I am and then telling me to not bother replying because she won‚Äôt read it. Some examples are: telling me my fathers death was my fault (he had a stroke last year caused by high blood pressure), saying that I‚Äôll be a horrible mother one day and my child will hate me same as I do her. 

My solution was to block her number so I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with her constant bashing and just focus on my mental health. Knowing I won‚Äôt receive calls or texts from her has been extremely liberating and has made me a happier person. A couple of months ago my sister got an MRI and they found something wrong, apparently my mother texted me to let me know but since I have her blocked I never received it. I decided to unblock her since my sister doesn‚Äôt have the best communication skills and she won‚Äôt tell me anything. We‚Äôve had a few conversations about my sister, they haven‚Äôt been civil but we haven‚Äôt been ripping each other apart either. On Christmas Eve she sent me a message, starting with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt reply.

And like always, don‚Äôt reply because I won‚Äôt read it. 

I am extremely fed up with her at this point, it has been so many years of her constant bullshit and I really thought the solution was to block her. I want to reply and tell her to go look for psychological help because she‚Äôs fucking insane and to fuck off but everyone is telling me to ignore her because that will just upset her more. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. If I block her again then I‚Äôm the asshole because if anything happens to my sister I won‚Äôt know. If I don‚Äôt block her then I have to keep on putting up with her abuse.",25Dec2019,1
414,"I have this normal gang of friends I hang out with from college. We have this very big passive-aggressive relationship.
Like eventhough I'm part of the boys,it's like I'm down in the line of hierarchy. Sure they have care for me and they're a great set of friends but it's like their interest in me is low.
For example we have this thing where if one of the boys' bday is the next day, the rest of the gang, lines up, takes out the cars and shows up that friend's place at 10 in the night and then we usually go for a long drive and cut cakes and return back.
Even during exams when a friend of mine had his birthday, the rest of the gang got his favourite cake and just cut it outside of his cake.
So um cut to today where I just came back from a 10 day internship from another city. They day before my departure I had asked them in our WhatsApp group to come pick me up. Three of them responded affirmatively. But when I asked them like today morning ( I reached today), they were like nah man can't do it types. They had genuine reasons or so I think.
I tried calling each and everyone but no one responded. I called my closest friend in the group but he didn't respond saying he was out somewhere and told he will call at 6pm (which still hasn't) after I nudged his gf and leaving couple of texts. And then guess what? He was out with one other guy from the group (whom I usually don't call but he is somewhat top of that ""hierarchy"") and a mutual friend of ours. I mean I am sitting here doing nothing in the house, and there they were eating somewhere when two of them knew I reached home. I sound like a bitch I understand that. Eventho I get pissed at them right now, when they eventually come to meet me , I calm myself down saying ,""It's okay, it's okay"".
Till now everyone's either busy or not responding my calls.

I work properly while I'm at the office and am moderately interested in my work (am not very passionate about it). I tend to get double minded about things and get stuck sometimes but I try to do my office work properly as the office is paying me for it. While researching for projects, I make a mental note of going back and reading more about ML concepts (which I could not due to shortage of time at office) and strengthening my CS (Computer Science) fundamentals. But when I get home, I do nothing to improve myself intellectually. I binge watch Netflix shows or YouTube videos, eat, take a shower, talk to people and go to sleep. I think that's mostly because I set out to do something with the attitude that it can't be done and escape from it. But I work properly at office because I have an incentive. Even if I do sit to do something at home, I don't give my 100% to it thinking that I will not understand it or it's too difficult. I have a list of activities that I want to do e.g., learning a language, reading Manga, working on personal projects etc. but I don't even do them.

From all this, I have deduced that I work (or do anything) only when it is absolutely necessary to work (do it). But this can prove bad for me in the long run.

I'm not a very religious person, but during these episodes I go into like some sort of manic state where I believe all sorts of things and I'll start praying like crazy. Recently the episodes have gotten a lot worse. 

Just last night I had an episode that probably only lasted 5 minutes, but it felt like at least 20 to me. I feel this really intense pressure on my legs, my arms, and my chest. It will feel like my blankets are being pulled off of me as well. The level of paranoia I'm in at these times makes my memory really foggy and I can't distinguish what I'm actually feeling with reality. From what I remember it really did feel like my blankets were being pulled and I could have sworn I heard some sort of growling, but I'm not actually sure. At one point I looked directly up and was able to say ""Stop it!"", but I can't remember if that was just in my head or if I actually said it. I had looked directly into the eyes of some sort of blurry person that looked like a foggy reflection of myself. (Not sure how to explain this correctly). It kinda looked like a person was there but they were see-through? Idk. But I was, once again, convinced it was the devil and I started praying in my head. But nothing stops this feeling until I force myself to wake up. Like when it stops briefly it will just reoccur a few minutes later until I actually sit up and turn a light on.

How do I stop this? I'm getting very tired of this feeling of paranoia and craziness. I feel ridiculous even writing this right now, being completely awake and aware of reality. But when I get into these episodes it feels like reality is so so far away and it feels like I'm being dragged to Hell. I just want this to stop!",25Dec2019,1

434,"I wasn't successful posting in dedicated hair subs bc this is a throwaway but long story short my hair is firetruck red and thanks to an unexpected last-minute choice, in 11 hours I am seeing family that would publicly and aggressively crucify me and my spouse for this.  
 I need it to be faded or redyed or whatever to a more natural color asap and the only thing open in town today is a Walgreens. My hair is naturally brown, i was born ginger, and it was bleached before it was dyed so even fading it out if possible would help it look more natural, I think.

438,"My entire life, I have been a prime target for bullying. It‚Äôs never been so bad that I was ever physically abused, but I have always had a ‚Äúcome pick on me, it‚Äôs going to be funny‚Äù face.

As a kid, adults did this to me all the time in ‚Äúplayful‚Äù ways, whatever that meant. On one instance in elementary school, my family was going on a cruise to the Bahamas, and my aunt ‚Äúplayfully‚Äù convinced me they had gotten tickets for everyone but me. I believed her, and she kept trolling me about it, until that evening.

As an adult (I‚Äôm 21 now), someone told me they had seen a ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù poster of me for some crime I didn‚Äôt even understand, and that the police were coming for me. I believed that too. That person kept this going for like 20 minutes before finally saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kidding.‚Äù

Part of this is that I am sensitive in not appreciating these jokes, so they always get a reaction out of me. Part of it is that I am gullible. Maybe people just don‚Äôt realize I don‚Äôt appreciate this stuff. I think I just send a nonverbal signal that I am the right person to make fun of, since I will give a ‚Äúfunny‚Äù response.

442,"My best friend and I found ourselves in a romantic relationship last year into this past summer, and honestly it was one of the most amazing times in my life. I sincerely have never felt such genuine love and compassion for a person, like we fit together so, so well and I know we'd be good together long term.

But I know my family will turn their backs on me if they ever found out I was in love with another woman. And I'm pretty sure her family would do the same, maybe even worse. Both our families are very religious, and while she was forced out of the closet our senior year of high school, I have been in the closet my entire life when it comes to my family. I'm 20 now and they still don't have a clue. 

Anyways, she and I realized that our feelings for each other would eventually ruin what we had prior to dating if we weren't together, so we stepped back. And now here I am several months later missing what we had so much. I honestly don't know what to do. I love being around her and talking to her, but I want to be more and I want to go back to what we had. It seems like she has forced herself to move on, but I'm not completely sure.

I've just been getting angry at myself, I feel like such a coward for letting my own family make me feel like I have no choice in this. I don't know what to do. Should I just try to push past this and move on for both our sakes?",25Dec2019,1

It hurts so much to know that the pain is mostly one sided. I always thought it would be equal if we were to break up. I feel robbed. I feel robbed of my time, my love, my aspirations. It just hurts so much. And he doesn‚Äôt seem to care. His care just seems like altruism. Like a very detached, ‚ÄúI care about you and don‚Äôt want you to be sad‚Äù.

444,"Hi folks,

So I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I think it does fall under the cause, at least, of social anxiety.

So I have a kind of difficult mom. Let's just say that (I think) she means well but wouldn't look out of place at all in a lot of the threads in [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/).

Basically, when I was growing up she would listen in (eavesdrop) on my phone calls and then make criticisms after I was done speaking. IDK, things like ""stop saying 'um' that much, it sounds bad.""

Surprise surprise many years later I am now unable to comfortably have phone calls while loved ones are nearby.

E.g., if my wife is at home and a business call comes in, I will go up on the roof to have it, because I get paranoid that she is listening in ‚Äî even though I know that she isn't and is supportive / doesn't care. This goes way beyond reason ‚Äî the awkwardness is now hard-wired into my brain. (Worth pointing out that other than this I do not have phone anxiety and can quite comfortably have phone calls when I am at home alone!)

The question of course is how to get past this as I am in business for myself and this is becoming a major inconvenience the more clients I land.

If anybody can identify and has found some strategy to improve upon this please LMK!

Sometimes she'll comment on something I post saying she wants to get together and I'll usually brush it off but this morning she messaged me and asked when we'd get together. I barely have time for my real friends so I don't really want to set aside anything for her.

448,"Hi, reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom have been mentally unstable since her brother died last february of a terrible illness that deteriorated his body and mind, she took care of him for 5 years to the point of becoming an obsession and that was rough for her mental health. On top of that, she loathes the place where she lives, because it has become a guetto in recent years (drug dealers at every corner and building block, prostitution, unsafe at certain hours, fights between gangs, etc), so not the best place to rest or grieve.

Although i was there there for her those 5 years, that wasn't enough. After his death I tried to recommend her a psychologist, i feel like she just needed some expert to talk to, but she despises them because she doesn't want to take meds (taking pills because of some mental issue runs on her family and she doesn't want to be like them). I also tried to look for a better place for her to live in, but our options are very limited budgetwise (we will have to sell her house and that's not easy having into account the neighbourhood), but no matter what house I look for she doesn't like any of them (""two rooms it's too small"", ""the kitchen is worse than mine"", ""it's a third floor"", ""the colour of the walls it's terrible"", ""i don't like those windows"") no matter how much i try to explain how she has to settle for what we can pay even if it's not as nice as her current house, she just ignores me and we even had more than one fight over the topic. This has been our life over the past year, and yesterday was just the tip of the iceberg and what broke me: She didn't want to celebrate Christmas. She was never a fan of that and always said she didn't like to cook for everyone and how it was loud and a mess, so i didn't pay attention to it, but this morning I heard her crying and she doesn't want to talk about it. This past week I also heard her crying when she didn't win the lottery (i assume she wanted to buy a house with that).

&amp;#x200B;

She just doesn't talk to me, I know she's not in her best state and that she needs help. On one hand, if she wants to move, she can't keep hoping for a lucky win at a lottery, that just won't do and on the other hand, she just can't shut herself from the rest of the family. I feel like she's been crying more times that i'm unaware of and i don't know what to do or how to deal with this or what she needs. Do I confront her? Do I let her settle things on her own? Do we continue to have fights over her excessive demands about the new possible house? What do I do?",25Dec2019,1

So there is a girl to be more specific my friends sister who I fancy.

To give some background on her, we went to school together, we worked together. We get so close when she is not in a relationship. When she was in a relationship we didn't really talk at all.

To give background on me, I'm considered the leader of my group of friends, active runner. I'm not the greatest looking guy but feel I'm average. People love my sense of humour supposedly but I suffer with confidence issues.

Back to the girl, since she broke up with boyfriend me and her have gotten close again. Freinds commented on the sexual tension between us at party's etc, we are all of the opinion that it needs time.

Most recent party I had to beg her to come out as things was going on with her and I didn't want her to be sat at home angry. She was delighted to go out in the end. Same party another dude who fancies her wouldn't leave her alone. She confided with me she does not want to be around him, I made it my priority to get her home safe which thankfully I did. She was glad of this, told me of how much she trusts me and right now she is not interested in any relationship as wants to work on herself.

I honestly really like this girl and would be happy to wait. I feel it might be worth it giving it a shot but I don't want to ruin our friendship if something goes wrong (also it could ruin it with her brother)

Even though others can see I fancy her, I don't think she sees it. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna move this relationship on. I know I need patience with her as her last relationship just ended. I just don't want to miss my shot it someone better comes along.

Sorry about the long post, felt I needed to get it off my chest as I never felt this way about a girl.

Yesterday the chat was all well, when we bid goodbye he even said he loved me as an older sister and that made me really happy as I've always looked at him as a younger bro but didn't know if he was comfortable enough with me for me to say that.


Anyway he blocked me for some reasons and won't even reply to my dms on Instagram as well so I'm just wondering if I've done something wrong??

My first week at school I always kept my headphones on moving from lecture to lecture. I did this because I have bad social anxiety and being new at school I didn't want to talk to anyone or hear what anyone said about me. I just wanted to be invisible. I understand it's pretty odd to see someone have headphones on all the time but it's the only thing that helps my social anxiety.

Now whenever I even ask the teacher a doubt someone will shout DJ under their breath and everyone will start laughing. This really doesn't help my social anxiety. I was bullied for 3 years as a kid and that was way worse than this but whenever someone calls me DJ or makes fun of me I just get flashbacks from the past (a group of boys who bullied me would beat me with cricket bats) and that's something I'd rather not think about. I also play football as a sport and I can't escape the nickname. It sucks all the fun out of the game and knowing everyone here thinks I'm ridiculous worsens my social anxiety.

469,"The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from student grants, as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival. 

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, sweet and beautiful. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there‚Äôs at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would  be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I kiss her on the cheek, or well I might just tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

So how do I convince my parent's that it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket? Remember that I will make sure I have enough money for two tickets. With money I get from my student grants and my internship, and the fact that the festival isn't until this summer, I will have more than enough money if I save up. (I get about 200$ a month in total from both student grants and my internship)

TL;DR I really want to go to a music festival with my cousin. I haven't asked her yet, but if she says yes I want to pay for her ticket. My parents told me though I can't pay for anyone else. How do I convince them it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket?",25Dec2019,1

Like i couldn't go into public being proud of who i was, he always drank for the silliest reasons and quarreled with my mom late nights.

My sister is extremely smart and successful yet she's not rewarded for anything. She has to cope up with all his bullshit and still does good academically. After high school i made up my mind to go far away from his bullshit by going to college. My brother is a mess. He takes advantage of this situation for his advantage. My mom couldn't separate because she doesn't have any skills ( that's what she said) she decided to have me after 5 years of finding out my dad is an alcohol abuse. I was tired so i left for college i still got dreams of the fights and shitty stuff he did ( physical and mental abuse telling he'll go commit suicide but not doing anything) my grades dropped significantly. I don't blame him it's my fault i lost interest in studying. My sister is still studying. Dad is still drinking. Brother is still unemployed and taking advantage because my dad doesn't own up to his shit. My mom still quarrels. I don't know what I'll do after college.

Very paranoid if you ask me, but so far i've just gave it to him whenever I flew on a vacation.

To make clear, he never actually used that phone number to call my friends and look after me, but that's because I realy am available and make sure to give them updates daily.
With that, it's absolutely possible that I won't have wi-fi for a few hours and he will get super paranoid and call my friends. He can have zero logic some times.

So I got everyone lavish gifts and stuff because why not I got this great job and I was in the giving mood. Spent almost $3000.

Another example is overanalyzing every reaction of people according to what I say, if they react good and become friendly and warm, I feel awesome, if its the opposite, I feel anxious and horrible, it's hard to make me confident again for a while after that.

I feel anxious lately when people are looking at me in the street, like stress inside of me, even though I didn't feel it until a few months ago, I feel exhausted walking outside and I don't know how to act around strangers, I'm pretty much very self-conscious and too much aware of the surrounding.

It‚Äôs Christmas today and even though it‚Äôs supposed to be a fun and joyous time , I hate it and I feel really guilty.

It‚Äôs just my mom and I this Christmas and she went out of her way to make it special for me. She packed a picnic basket and planned on having a nice lunch at the park but unfortunately it rained so her plans fell short. We went to the beach (we sat in the car) and had lunch there but it was fine. I really appreciated it but for some reason, it wasn‚Äôt enough. 

A few years ago, my dad passed away. He was married to a different woman and had a son with her. When he died, they moved away to a different country and I haven‚Äôt seen them since. (I tried contacting her over the years but she would never reply). He (my dad) had lots of brothers and sisters (about 13) and they are all fond of me, but they never really make an effort to be a part of my life . (I can‚Äôt blame them, they have their own families to deal with).This time of the year really sucks since I see a lot of people happy with their families and I longed for that. I absolutely loved Christmas growing up since I love being surrounded by friends and family; it just hasn‚Äôt felt the same since. 

When we were sitting in the car, my mom was talking about Christmas with her family when she was growing up (they were lots of children and had really traditional parents) and I felt really jealous. I‚Äôm the only child (from my mom) so I always felt a bit lonely , having lost the chance of getting to know my brother. I started tearing up at that thought and she noticed and got upset. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin her day and I tried to feign happiness but I couldn‚Äôt. I was miserable.  
After a while, she started suggesting things to do next year (to take my mind off of what I was sad about). She told me that she planned to take us both in a trip to London next Christmas (we‚Äôre in SA) and I guess I reacted badly. (I had a weary expression on my face and she took it in the wrong way). I tried to explain that i was cautious, seeing as we weren‚Äôt in the best financial position and one of her goals for next year was to finish her bond. A trip overseas would be nice.... but it was an unnecessary expense. That made her livid. She was really upset and started packing up to go home. Apparently ‚Äúnothing she did could make me happy and she was fed up with my temperamental nature‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm in my room now and I can hear her crying in her own. I feel horrible. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt appreciate everything that she‚Äôs done for me, I do. I know that I‚Äôm lucky to still have her around and to even a meal. As we were driving home, there were so many people begging and I knew that they probably had it worse.

She had discovered that I had pursued one of her friends for nudes which after thought really hurt me. I hated seeing her sad and it just brought great sorrow to me. She was upset at me but she still maintained communication. we rekindled our love and continued the relationship.

a few days ago with finals and her being in a lot of programs causing me to not see her for a bit of time, I felt really pushed away by it. added to the fact that my parents seldom are nice, I did feel very lonely. I told her about it and she apologized for it, and I accepted of course, but the hole was still there.

A girl had pursued me in this time as well, and we had exchanged conversation after a bit. Nothing was sent, no sex was had, but the sexts were there, and that was it. She found out the hard way and broke up with me the next day. I felt so sick to my stomach I wanted to cry, but we had a concert performance that night, and since I volunteer at my graduating high school for the music program, they wanted me in the performance. during the time, I felt really scared to show my face or my emotions, so I hid it behind silence and a small smile which is NOT like my normal, outgoing personality(not to flaunt, just want to explain as best I can.). The next day I got piss drunk and cried. I really could not take it at all. I was in such a low point in my life.

I apologized and apologized, she had blocked me on most forms of social media so someone suggested I write her a letter explaining my feelings and why I did what I did. she unblocked me from an account to speak with me and all I could do was explain myself and say sorry through it all. I really missed speaking with her, especially since I was cut off like that. She had said ""we were done"" and I really couldn't take that. It was very hard to stomach that feeling, everything I worked damn hard to do and all because I got lonely and finally snapped after a bit. 

I understand she has feelings of course, and that she may also be crying or sad, and that hurts me even more; I was her go to when she needed uplifting or to be happier in sad times. When I cause her sad times and I can't help her, it only makes me feel even worse.

Should I ask for her to return it and get me a new one? Should I keep it and just deal with a really bad computer? I feel like just a spoiled brat but she told me she would get it for me and she didn‚Äôt get it(Most likely because she saw the wrong thing or because someone told her it was the same thing)

506,"The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from student grants, as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival. 

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there‚Äôs at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would  be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

So how do I convince my parent's that it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket? Remember that I will make sure I have enough money for two tickets. With money I get from my student grants and my internship, and the fact that the festival isn't until this summer, I will have more than enough money if I save up. (I get about 200$ a month in total from both student grants and my internship)

TL;DR I really want to go to a music festival with my cousin. I haven't asked her yet, but if she says yes I want to pay for her ticket. My parents told me though I can't pay for anyone else. How do I convince them it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket?",25Dec2019,1
507,"So I am at his for christmas as we are ldr, but this has been an ungoing uncomfortable situation. Basically his cousins partner has asked my bf multiple times if he swings both ways, gotten noticeably jealous that he plays more stuff with me rather than the both of them. Bfs little brother has autism and went over to give them gifts and they grilled him and asked him why bf hasnt been speaking to them basically putting him on the spot. after christmas meal, cousins partner went behind bfs back and asked his mother if he was happy with me. As they are trans it seems touchy and his family are unsure how to approach this hut are definitely supportive toward bf that its uncomfortable as they have also been watching games hes been playing on steam. 


example, he downloaded black desert online yesterday and played for 5 mins and his cousin brought it up at dinner. Again that is also an on giving thing. Cousins partner got angry that me and bf played dont starve together... without them despite they havent reached out to ask us to play anything.

517,"A while ago, I was talking to this dude for like a month and we hit it off in the beginning. However, if you can‚Äôt tell, they didn‚Äôt end well and here‚Äôs why...

For starters, he was a lil younger than me (I‚Äôm 21, he‚Äôs 19), which I believe was the first red flag. But it was only a two year difference and I didn‚Äôt want to turn him down because of that. I had to make a Home Depot run (where he works) , which is where I met him, and he asked for my number and that was how we initially met. We both worked a lot, he was a full time employee and I had two jobs at the time. Because of this, it took us a while to have our first date, but leading up to it we managed to text everyday for about a week. Now the first date got a little messy to say the least. For some reason he drank a For Loco before arriving to my apt (I had no idea) and due to me allowing him to drink my wine, through out the night, without my knowledge, he became drunker. His state of drunkenness was revealed when it was time for us to get down and dirty with it, but he failed to perform if you know what I mean üåæ.  I was a little shook but I didn‚Äôt want to make too much of a big deal out of it because I knew he was embarrassed, so I was able to overlook his poor decision making in this instance (red flag #2). The next two days he was getting lazy with his texts and I found my self being the first to reach out, and when I did, he was very bland with his responses. I eventually surprised FaceTimed him, and I know some guys hate this, but i didn‚Äôt care because he was acting shady and I wanted to know what was up. He answered and he assured me everything was fine and even invited me to go with him and his friends to this lil local music festival near our university. Fast forward to through all the in betweenness, I end up going with my girlfriends and he didn‚Äôt, though he said he was, and I felt like he stood me up. The next day I got him to come over because he still had an item of mine from our first date, and I got him to talk to me. We talked and i basically asked him why his energy had made a shift. He claimed it was because he didn‚Äôt think I liked him like that because I was joking on him and called him dumb (which was a JOKE) for coming to my place semi drunk. Which made no sense cause I was texting him and checking up on him the day after that. Anyway we made up and we started up again. Our second date we went to get sushi and it was fun, I briefly met his roommates. We tried to have sex again and the dude still could not keep it up. At this point it was a lil frustrating for us both. We started having a conversation about it and we went for a walk and he revealed to me that he lied about why he really started acting differently after the first date, and It was because he was too embarrassed after not being able to perform the first time around. Anyways, I stuck around his house a lil longer with us just talking and jamming to some music and then I went home. We continued to text and talk and at one point we stayed up til 5am FaceTiming. He came over a few times after that, with still no sex. But honestly it was nice not getting intimate on that level cause it left more room for me to truly get to know him without the distraction of sex. However, things took an immediate decline when he invited me over to sleepover one night. Before I came over, we were good. I FaceTimed him and we were both in good moods. He was explaining how he just bought the new COD game and I suggested we smoke together. I wanted him to come over, but he was urging that I come over instead. However I wasn‚Äôt trying to watch him play video games all night cause that‚Äôs boring as hell. But he specifically said, and this is important, ‚Äúif we continue to FaceTime, I am going to play video games, but if you come over I will not.‚Äù That was enough to make me pack a bag, shave, and leave my house in the middle of the night to see this dude. I arrive, we get high, and the energy starts to slowly deplete. Then he has the nerve to say, ‚Äúalright I want to play video games now,‚Äù ü§°ü§°. Being the people pleaser I am, I let him. Meanwhile I‚Äôm having the worst time and am bored out of my mind. We‚Äôre barely talking cause he‚Äôs so focused on the game. I go to his room finally, and happily he follows, BUT THEN, he pulls out his laptop and we start watching a boring ass show called The Good Place (if you love that show, I hope all offense is taken). He eventually falls asleep, I‚Äôm still up and so underwhelmed. So I leave his room, and call my friend in the kitchen and ask her if I should just leave, and she encourages me to do so. So I did. I left because I honestly had no reason to stay. I didn‚Äôt leave a note or a message in hopes he would reach out to me first. And guess what, he didn‚Äôtü§°. So I reach out asking if he was cool, he says ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm cool, are you I woke up and you were gone.‚Äù At that point, I thought it would be best to talk to him in person because  I was so unsatisfied with the way things were going. We didn‚Äôt speak for two days, and I finally asked him to come to my place after he got off of work, cause I needed to talk to home, and possibly end whatever we had going depending on his answers. He comes over, and to my not so surprising surprise, he ended up being the one to end it first saying verbatim, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm wasting your time, and I don‚Äôt have the energy anymore,‚Äù ha! I couldn‚Äôt have agreed more. But what pisses me off about this whole discourse is he barely gave me a chance to express my side and all the things I felt like he was doing wrong, because the butthole parked his bike right outside my apt with no lock on it with the intentions of trying not to stay long. So he kept rushing me. And saying things like ‚Äúsorry bro I gotta get my bike‚Äù ‚Äúyo my bikes going to get stolen I gotta go‚Äù. And when I finally let the dickhead go out of frustration, he tries to dap me up. Of course I rejected him, and then he left. I blocked him off all social media and deleted his number and I haven‚Äôt talked to him since.

So I tell this story, because I‚Äôm the type of person who needs closure when things turn left and unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get any. I like to know all the things I did wrong and for me to tell you your wrongs so I can walk away from the situation with answers, maybe a lil wounded, but having a clear mindset. But instead I got vague childish answers and wasted times. So I would like to know, what‚Äôs your opinions on all the things that went wrong. Your honesty is what I would truly value and sorry if this was such a long read.",25Dec2019,1

522,"Context: I own an Akita Inu who‚Äôs large even for the breed. He‚Äôs extremely playful and goofy around family, however extremely aggressive towards any strangers whatsoever. He‚Äôs put guests in hospital before. The dog is a volatile beast of a guard dog I‚Äôm extremely attached to ever since he proved most loyal to me in the household. 

Last week my father and I were playing with him. He play-bites a lot, tugging us by the arms/wrists with considerable force (If I engage too much I‚Äôll often leave play sessions with bleeding hands/arms.), and leaps up to literally shove us with his paws, which I usually counter-act by propping my forearm up for him to rest on. This time unfortunately he must‚Äôve leant awkwardly because he yelped and suddenly couldn‚Äôt stand on his paw. 

I freaked - He‚Äôs a big dog who never whimpers or ceases to play, even if it becomes ‚Äòrough‚Äô. Immediately my father and I start to comfort him, however he curls into my fathers arms and stares at me, clearly apprehensive. I try to soothe him by kissing his forehead‚Äî A big mistake because he bit my face in anger (silly me, I know). 

I left him to it, rather upset my dog would attack me. Eventually I return, however whenever I get near he would move under a table, staring at me in what seemed to (?) resemble shame/apprehension. Eventually he came forth, allowing me to pet him. I took him for a walk and gave him a treat immediately, hoping we‚Äôd reconciled. 

Still, two days later I try to pet him while leaving the house and he bites my hand in a non-playful manner, however not hard. Seemed like another get-back, or a warning from his look. He‚Äôs been giving me the same look since. My father says he‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll reprimand him, though I feel it‚Äôs fear instead. 

Dog experts, what do? I‚Äôm scared of the dog becoming aggressive towards me because it‚Äôll break my heart and mean he‚Äôd have to be replaced or put down if it ever came to seriously wounding me.",25Dec2019,1
523,"I am stupid. I am lazy. I have poor social skills. I am unlikable. I don't fit in anywhere, not even with nerds, gamers or outcasts. I am a virgin who has never had a girlfriend or any cool ""coming of age"" experiences. I have 2 friends and I haven't made a friend since I was 18. I have no job. I have no education. I have no hobbies. I'm not good at a single thing. 

I've been completely numb and depersonalized these past 6 months (worse than ever), in part because I'm fully realizing the life I have created for myself. I've never been really happy since I was 17, since then I've been socially withdrawn, depressed and had daily thoughts of suicide but I figured that was pretty normal for an adolescent. However recently I've been strongly considering suicide (Making plans and working on the note) because the pain (and shame) is just too much.

Theres only one problem: I love my mom and don't want to break her heart. She's been through so much (we lost 4 close family members this year to fentanyl, another to drunk driving, and her dad to lung cancer. Needless to say Christmas family dinner was pretty sparse this year) So I've decided I will drag on, no matter how much pain I am in, as long as my mom is alive I will not do it. I have no other reason to live (never really have).

Is there anything I can do in the mean time until my mom passes? I am not smart enough to get educated, what is a good job for people who are lazy and uneducated and not good with people? Should I just move in with my mom and just take care of her instead? Also is it possible to get a girlfriend when you have nothing to offer? Okay I already know the answer to that, but it would be nice to experience that before I die. Is it possible to start from scratch and fix some of my problems? That would be nice but I'm skeptical, for instance I kinda feel like if you don't have a social life by the time you're like 20, it's impossible to get one.

524,"*LONG POST WARNING*

I was recently on a trip to see my girlfriend for a few days. On the plane home, a woman sat next to me and was very loud and intrusive. In the matter of a few minutes I heard about how she had a very tight vagina, about how she was wild when she was my age (22) and how she is still really wild (mid 40‚Äôs). She told me about how she loves to have sex. I was not being playful or flirty though I was engaging in discussion. Because she was being so in my face, I was pretty monotone. I‚Äôm very committed to my girlfriend, I‚Äôve never cheated on her and would never cheat on her, and I plan to marry her. 

She was on a vacation and to be nice I asked if she had any pics from her vacation and she started to unreservedly show me all of her pictures (in a bikini and a bra). She had a button accidentally undone on her shirt and she looked down and saw it and buttoned it up and I joked that I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about it. And then she unbuttoned that and the button above and told me she was still wearing a swimsuit as she proceeded to show me her bikini. I‚Äôm not going to lie I was very turned on but I did not want to engage with her at all, I just wanted out of the situation but was also aroused. Which made me feel terrible. 

She showed me her tattoo as well that was basically on her lower belly and pelvic area. I do admit I was asking some questions that would make her want to show me more etc. Questions like ‚Äúis your swimsuit still wet, what material is it‚Äù. When she showed me all of it she was feeling the material and I genuinely can‚Äôt remember If I asked to feel the material or if she asked me to, and I did feel the material of her swimsuit and basically feel her boobs. She was super loud about getting wild and stuff and I took my hand away. She asked if I wanted to fuck In the bathroom and I told her no. At this point I had already told her a little bit about my girlfriend. I wanted to avoid her after that because I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen. I put in my headphones and got on my phone. I had also already discreetly texted my girlfriend telling her to pray for me because I was sitting next to a crazy girl. 

This woman then grabbed my hand and placed it inside her swimsuit directly on her bare boob and nipple. She said ‚Äúyou can feel here‚Äù and I said no I can‚Äôt do that and removed my hand and scooted completely away from her. I was in a middle seat and got as far as I could. I felt sick to my stomach. I fell asleep for about 45 min. When I woke up our legs were touching and she was fingering herself under her purse while watching a movie. I was really turned on and not thinking straight because I had just woken up and I sort of rubbed her leg with my leg. I didn‚Äôt do anything with my hands. She had unbuttoned even more and basically taken her boobs (in her bikini out) and she told me she was really hot. She put her hand on my leg and felt my erection outside my pants. She asked if I wanted to touch her and I told her no because I have a girlfriend. She said we should fuck I‚Äôm the bathroom again and told me my girlfriend would never find out. 

Eventually she took her hand off and asked if I wanted her to keep touching me and I told her no, and I scooted away again and avoided her for the rest of the flight. She got up and told me she needed to go to the bathroom to get herself off. 

These are some of the other things I remember her saying to me (which I didn‚Äôt respond to or said no to): 

-Let‚Äôs just go in the bathroom it will take 2 seconds

-I just wanna fuck you so bad

-Will you let me out I gotta go get myself off in the bathroom

-Let‚Äôs just get naked

-Want to fuck in the bathroom, what you don‚Äôt have a condom? 

-Your girlfriend would never know, she wouldn‚Äôt even believe you she would think you‚Äôre crazy

-Thank God for sluts, they ruin the world (in response to me saying I couldn‚Äôt have sex with her bc I had a girlfriend) 

-Can you touch me

-You should‚Äôve brought a condom, you need to start carrying those around

-‚ÄúWe could be doing that‚Äù in reference to a movie sex scene on her tv 

I called my girlfriend as soon as I got off the plane and told her what happened. I was holding in tears and she could tell. I couldn‚Äôt give her complete details as I was still in the airport. My mom was picking me up and I immediately lost it when I got in the car, sobbing. Since then I‚Äôve told my girlfriend more, the only thing she doesn‚Äôt know is that this woman felt my erection. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I feel like I cheated but also I felt like I was harassed and violated. I didn‚Äôt ask for this situation, want it, etc. I told this lady no, I ignored her at points, etc. 

My question from all this is: what do I do? My girlfriend feels like I cheated and is hurt too. I know there are things I could‚Äôve done better and differently and could‚Äôve been more firm with this woman. I just need advice",25Dec2019,1

526,"Hey guys. 24 yo male here. Have been studying law since 19 with working part-time to finance it.  The last 5 years of my life were ... let's just say not hype. They were pretty bad. I just couldn't bring myself to get stuff done. I am at a pretty dark place right now. I have had bad mental health since 14 and never really took any responsibility for it until this day. I am just suffering in silence. and I would be okay with that. But the place in life I brought myself into is just breaking my heart.

I enrolled into law enforcement last month so I at least got a job (which potentially goes along with my hopefully finished degree). It's not a bad job at all. But I am not passionate about it. 

I don't even know why I sticked with law so long. It never got me excited. It's just what was decided and I went along with it...

I am passionate about medicine and I am certain I would be able to clear the entrance examination. I would be 25 then. It would take me 6 year to become a physician in my country. I would enter the workforce by age 31. 

Studying is free in my country but living costs would be around 700$ a month. I have around 10k in my bank account and could probably get a student loan big enough (around 35k-ish) to get me to the finishing line. I would also probably work in summers,  or whenever there's free time. 

I have a great relationship with my family but it's kinda superficial. I told them about my issues and problems  but stopped with it long ago because the were annoyed/overwhelmed with it. I also don't want to take any money or financial support from them. 

But I am not sure. I am really afraid. I only know things can't stay like this and that I don't want to live a life I am never going to be happy with. 

But would I even find a work place if I had never worked full-time until 31? I have kinda busted teeth, which will need some repairing soon. (which is also a source of mental anguish) and I have had an accident which kinda permanently damaged my cervical spine - which I am afraid will get me kicked out of law enforcement anyway if I am not able to tough it out... 

&amp;#x200B;

It just don't know what I should do guys. Staying with the same major for too long, endlessly sitting at home looking at the ceiling, untreated, put me into living hell. Am I just no good at life?

I desperately need some golden advice here. Please share your opinions, even if you don't think it's good or fitting or whatever. I just want as many opinions as possible. What should I do?",25Dec2019,1

530,"Thanks giving and christmas people are eating copious amounts of food with animal products in it and its whatever but as a vegan I have to make my own food for obvious reasons.

Because of that me and my boyfriend's veganism is always something I'm confronted about. And like its all people can talk about. And it's always never positive either its always people giving us crap about it.

I don't like talking about my veganism and I always try to change the subject but people always go back to it. And eating is even more awkward its always people starring at me and my bf and asking what we eat and when we tell them they say ""yuck"" which is really disrespectful and because he's a Buddhist vietnamese and that food is his culture.

People for some reason take out diets as a personal attack on them even though its not something we shove in their face and we don't like taking about it. And i understand if people are curious about it and want to know but its another thing to be rude and intrusive about it.


""I didn't make you food sorry i know you're vegan and all""
Yes I already told you in advance ahead of time
""Yea sorry you're vegan and i didn't make you any food guess you and you're boyfriend are gonna have to split this grape""
We made ourselves food. We told you this already. Can we stop talking about it.
""Sorry its just that i could never go vegan""
Okay cool. Let's change the subject.

Its annoying and I hate talking about it.

Or we get interrogated about it

""So why are you guys even vegan anyways""
(We've been vegan for a literal decade and keep having to repeat why)
""Oh really so you cant just have a little chicken?""

Is there a way we can stop people from talking about it. Both friends and family keep ignoring the boundaries we set and every year food is an extremely stressful topic that we don't want to talk about we just want to be treated lile normal people. And we keep telling everyone that but they ignore it.

Its rude and uncomfortable and i just want it to end... And its taking everything in my willpower not to be an ""angry militant vegan"" and tell them to fuck off...",25Dec2019,1
531,"I wanted to leave some advice for everyone out there. Through the trials and tribulations of life... I have learned a VERY important fact that has helped me conquer everything. Everything from death in the family, letting go of anger from the past, anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. 

I have learned that you can‚Äôt always control what happens to you in life. BUT... you can ALWAYS control how you REACT to what happens to you in life. And this is what determines the FINAL outcome of any and all situations. 

You are in more control than you think.

If something seemingly bad happens... and all you do is allow it to eat away at you... while not even attempting to do anything positive... it‚Äôs no wonder you feel so bad... and it‚Äôs no wonder why nothing improves!

When life gets hard... you need to push back harder. I won‚Äôt tell you that it will be easy. But I will tell you that if you are able to find any way possible to react with a positive response ... you will get positive results.

My entire life has been a battle. From my father struggling with addiction, leading to us losing everything. We lost our house, our vehicles, everything. Having to move from sunny south Florida to the miserable cold of the north. I slept on the floor. I went without food. My grandfather who played the role of my father when my father was on drugs died. My mother died a year after that. 

I fought constantly with anxiety, depression, and PTSD for years. I struggled with depersonalization and derealization. Life felt like it wasn‚Äôt real. It felt like I was living in a dream. Like I was out of my body.

It took me digging REALLY deep... to the root of all of my mental struggles. I had to go back to the beginning, and re-live all of these situations over and over in my head, and figure them all out... in order to conquer all of it, and get rid of all of my mental struggles.

I can say that I finally feel in control. I finally feel happy. I finally feel like a mature individual. A strong individual. 

You can do this. It all starts within yourself. You‚Äôre already ahead of the game if you‚Äôre reading this. I believe in you. Do it. Now.",25Dec2019,1

Hy there,

About 2-3 months ago I started flirting with some girl (24) at work. I knew she was in a bad relationship(4 or 5 years of it) and things started going in my favor fast(or so I tought) because se was more insistent that we see each other on smoking brakes very often and a lot of talks about doing more things together.

It was a strange feeling but since I was single for a long time I said why not play her game. We talked a lot and 2 weeks ago coworkers organized a night out and she insisted I go with her, sit next to her, and after a few drinks and a lot of laughter we got out of the bar and asked her how serious is this thing we are having right now.She immediately kinda had a change in her face and said ""you have no change my boyfriend is gonna ask me to marry him this Christmas"".I was shocked since I am a shy guy and usually I am very carefull where I invest feelings in, and this was going smooth since the begining, or so I tought.

All in all we return to the party, I got drunk because what else to do after this and did not seem to be that much affected went back to my life as ussual and did not talk to her anymore or ask for explanations.

3 days ago I started having strange dreams about this, waking up sad, self loathing...culminating with last night dreaming about me carring their rings at her and her boyfriend's wedding and woke up full of selfpitty and sweating like I came from the gym.

I don't know if it's because I'm alone for holliday season or why...but I feel like I'm going crazy and have no ideea what to do next or how to manage the situation.

Any advice will be appreciated.

Thank you for reading this and sorry for bad english, it's not my native language...just made this account on reddit hoping to find some advice here.",25Dec2019,1
537,"I screwed up big time. 

I wasted my 20's working a normal job smoking pot and taking a couple tiny trips.

I turned 30 and realized I was wasting my life. 

I decided if I worked hard and became a teacher I could redeem myself. I could help kids and travel on my months off.

I jumped in blindly and worked so hard. Full time job full time student. I won't be done until I am 34.

I am 33 and on my last year.

I see now I will make no money

will have mountains of stress and won't really get to travel. 

I screwed up my 30's as well as my 20's 

What should I do.

I was going to take 2020 to get my degree lose weight and than spend the rest of my time teaching and traveling. Now I see that was a dumb pipe dream.

I don't have student loan debt or any other kind of debt but I also live with my dad. My mom died thinking I was going to be something because I went back to school. 

she taught I'd get a girlfriend and everything but what if I just wasted 4 years and thousands of dollars on a career I could get fired from if I sneeze the wrong way?

I won't ever hurt myself but I have wasted my life even when I tired not to waste it.

My A.A is in education. 

The future I was trying to avoid was one where I had never seen the world had a lousy job and no life so all I did was work and watch T.V It's already starting and I feel 50 at 32. 

I have gone to some music fests and I went to Europe but what if that was my peak? 

I also have a terribly annoying personalty that has driven everyone away. 

I wanted to work and than be able to go fishing to travel two months out of the year and go to places like Denver or Las Vegas on my short breaks. Is any of this possible in my situation?

543,"This is going to be a fairly long story Just so you know. And if there are any misspellings im sorry, english is not my first language.

This will also be very complicated, but I'll try my best to explain:

Me: me

Jack: my crush

Luke: my crushed friend

I go to a fairly small school in Northern Europe. We basicly know every single person at school, I am at last year of high school right now. And instead of saying seniors and freshmen we say 8a,b,c or 9a, b, c or 10a,b,c. 8 being the first year of high school and 10 being the last. So I go to class 10c and my crush goes to class 10b, so I never see him in any classes since our school doesn't have mixed classes. For the two first years I didn't talk to him that much, but I was best friends whit one of his friends. His (fake) name is Luke. Luke and I texted almost everyday on messenger. We always went to a (under 18+) club togheter, he wanted to talk to his friends but I was awkward and all his friends was guys too. So I would text him to meet me somewhere around and he would come alone. He was the only person who would listen to me at that time. I almost never talked to others as a child, so I have problems keeping up a convo if it's not the right person. So that's why I always wanted to talk a lot.

In 9th grade I started to like Luke a lot. We both texted kinda flirty ish but neither made a move. Me of course (whit the low af self esteem.) was afraid that he didn't like me. And I didn't want to ruin our friendship. So in 10th grade I got a boyfriend so I could get my mind off him and didn't tell Luke about it. It started out good but then he stopped responding (both my then bf and BFF.). And I got really sad. He then after some time said that he actually liked me, but stopped responding bc he found out I had a bf by reading the texts off my girls bffs phone. I said that I liked him too and that my bf was just to get my mind of him. He was shocked but we didn't argue, still ignored me tho. 

We then all went on a school trip whit every class in 10th grade. We where all sorted into huts (girls and boys divided.)  and my girl BFF was in the same class as Luke. And Luke and all his friends was sorted into the same hut. Emma was good friends whit one of Luke's friends and wanted to go visit. So we stood there in their hut, her talking to her guy friends while me just sitting and looking at the screen (they smuggled in pc's and ps4 to play whit.) I wanted to ask If I could play but I was to scared to ask bc Luke was there. From that I lost feelings from him.

On that school trip we where on a 9 hour hike over a mountain called Besseggen. On our way down to the huts. (the road down to the huts went directly down from the mountain. The road was about a 2 hour hike down.) I heard running behind me. There was Jake. We were about 50 meters from the huts but he stopped to talk to me. It just clicked and I instantly got a crush. And Jake asked something like ""so what are you going to do? I guess you be over at Luke's hut or something?"" I think he thought I liked Luke or something so I said no, that instead I would be at girl bffs hut or mine. Luke said he would be at his and explained where his was. And we went out separate ways.

Now I didn't speak to him until the school sports event. (about two months after, where all students chooses a different sport and each student represent their own class. Each class whit students who got high scores would win a plauqe. Now one of the deals was that everyone had to run in like a race. It was just one round around the school but it had ugly tarrain. I ran and after I was exhausted. I laid down on the grass and Jake came to me and said he was really surprised I ran so quick. Then we talked but then he left cus his lapse came up next. When he was done we talked some more then we were done so we stopped talking. (again)

Now it was the last school ball for us, since it's our last year here. (we have a Christmas ball where every grade is there.) I wear a beautiful dress and I'm super ready. Right off the bat I see Jake. He is dancing really good.( I am a dancer and Noone of the guys likes or can dance so I really wanted to dance whit him.) he was in the corner of my eye the whole night. I started to feel sad bc he danced whit a lot of girls that night. I even overheard one of my friends saying she kinda liked him, but didn't want to. Her friends said he was really gay and I even started to get sad. (back story: the girl who said that is really manipulative. She once talked behind my back cus my girl BFF hear her and texted me while I was sick. At the mountain hike she said sorry and I let her in. The only ones who knew about my crush was girl BFF and another friend. They may have said it to her, and she may be the manipulative bitch she once was. So it could be she made them all say that?)
 Trough the night it didn't seem that he wanted to dance whit me. I tried to dance in front of him in the line dance. I danced as hard as him, but he just didn't see me. At the end of the night is danced on the floor (room almost empty) and he came up to me and asked to dance. People started leaving and we were the two only people in the room, dancing to sweet Caroline. We then noticed that everyone had left and we talked on the way out. I was really happy. Now I still can't stop thinking about him. Idk if it was a coincidence that he choose to dance whit me at the end when everyone was gone or not. He doesn't have Facebook, snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or anything. (and I hope he doesn't have reditt bc that would be awkward if he read this.) and I can't get the hold of his number. It's a half year left of this school year. We are going to collage (kinda). And I don't think I will se him at all. Is it a chance that he likes me? And if I so choose to ask him, will we even get the time to become something? Plz help :(",25Dec2019,1

I recently started playing a really awesome board game with my friends that we love.

The game board is about 2.5 feet x 2.5 feet and as a gift for my friend I want to take the game board and blow up the image to be two or even three times that large so we can throw the game board across two folding tables and completely immerse ourselves into the game!

(Imagine the game is almost like risk, so it would feel really cool to be looking down on an entire world map like an old fashioned military war table.) 

The best idea I have would be to take a picture of the board and take it to one of those machines they have at a store that lets you reprint an image larger but wouldn‚Äôt that distort the image?

549,"So, I've got a friend, we've been very close for around ten years- we speak candidly and honestly about all sorts and have what I consider to be one of the most sincere and authentic relationships I've had.
She's on a level, very bright and I care for her deeply. 
I've known her through the birth of her two children, she's known me through the death of my parents and the loss of a very important relationship. 
Over the last 2 or so years, our contact has decreased, and it's usually due to her neglecting to get back to me (even when she initiates contact)
I initially attributed this to her busyness (2 kids, husband etc), however, began to feel that I was being pulled away from. 
I'm not interested in pulling people close if they're not inclined to be... It's just the thing is, she often pops back into my life with kind messages and occasional plans to meet (these plans are becoming increasingly seldom). 
I remember a comment she made to me some years ago about how some relationships fade as we age and her implication was that she prefers to just let's things naturally wane rather than manage the issue directly and express herself to the other person- I've a feeling this is happening to me... It's difficult to tell though, because she keeps on expressing deep care, and I know we share an understanding. 
I'm not really inclined to put her on the spot and ask for an explanation; she's already expressed that's not the way she'd do things. However, I'm also not inclined to be living in a no man's land. 
In response, I have an inclination to be forthright about it and make a plan for myself, creating a boundary and avoiding regular contact or speedy replies like she does, also by being pithy with my replies; creating my own distance. This attitude is only coming about because it hurts me to not know where I am with her, and I feel to a great degree that the writing is on the wall here; I feel pulled around by her changeability. 
My take is that if there's an issue in a long standing friendship, it's far better to express the problem and manage it than progressively detach, however, I recognise that may not be the desired approach of all. 
I'm wondering, what do you think I should do in this situation? I value my friends deeply, and it's unpleasant to feel that I'm being ghosted, however, it appears that's what's going on. 
Do I:
A: Take decisive action for myself and ignore her periodically when she messages and create distance despite these years of closeness
B: Ask her what's going on and risk her feeling uncomfortable, possibly denying the situation and potentially creating a more estranged dynamic
C: Carry on as before and just accept that we're not as close as before whilst being periodically ghosted and then picked up again?

Many thanks and merry Christmas",25Dec2019,1

It turns out that Cambodia, like some other countries, denies access to their country if a person's passport will expire in less than 6 months, and his passport expired in a bit more than 5 and a half months. However, the weird thing is that we were able to access 3 other countries with the same rule without a problem (in the past 4 days), and *the Cambodian embassy itself granted my brother a visa for this trip* even after they reviewed his passport and other information. However, the airline people didn't budge and we ended up all missing the flight because we weren't going to leave my brother alone in Thailand *and* go have a vacation without him. We did not get any of our money back for the flights nor any for the hotel in Cambodia *nor* any for the hotel we had to last-minute book to stay in Thailand.

565,"Hey Redditianer, 25M living in Germany, did a Bachelors Degree in Economics. I am moving to California in March. I am going to study Q&amp;A Testing in San Jose - and i am panicking about the rent and all day life.

Anybody knows how to find a good flat or maybe a payable apartment? What about Student Jobs? Is Craigslist really the way to go?

I am going to arrive in NYC at first and want to do a roadtrip to california and I wanted to know what must-sees are on the way. Nature, Architecture, History, Parks, 'cool-stuff-to-look-at-and-say-""woah""'. Any suggestions?
Do you guys think it would be wiser to rent a car for that way and buy one in California for Alldayneeds or buy one in New York State and do the roadtrip with it? I assume the prices for used cars is lower in the west.

566,"So let‚Äôs starts this off. I am not a materialistic person. I don‚Äôt like name brand or expensive gifts. I don‚Äôt want something expensive unless I absolutely need it or else I‚Äôll feel bad about the waste of money. This is where my conflict begins.

So my parents bought me a **very** expensive laptop for christmas. I had talked about wanting one for school months ago. It‚Äôs a very thoughtful gift and I would have been ecstatic about it months ago. Obviously I‚Äôm touched by the gesture and how long they remembered me saying that; I just don‚Äôt need it anymore. We moved and I go to a school that doesn‚Äôt need laptops. I already have a phone and a ps4. I already have too many electronics as it is and have everything I need. Everything I could do with the laptop, I could do on my phone. I feel horrible about not liking the very expensive gift though because they put time, thought, and a fuck ton of money into it.

I‚Äôve got an extremely rocky relationship with my parents so this was a big deal for us. They won‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt need the gift. I know it will create a huge arguement about me being ungrateful that they spent that much money and ruin our family christmas. They bought my brother and sister a bunch of little gifts for Christmas and bought me the laptop. They would feel bad if the one thing they bought me was returned. I don‚Äôt even mind returning them the money for it, to pay for the new house‚Äôs expenses. I‚Äôm not big on Christmas and gifts anyways but I know they are. I just don‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings.

 Would I be an asshole if I asked them to return it or told them I didn‚Äôt need it? It‚Äôs a very tough situation. On one hand, I could ask them to return the laptop and give them the money back or I could keep it and never use it. They will be upset by both options and won‚Äôt be happy either way. I know this is not a very big deal and I‚Äôm very privillaged to even receive something at all. I just don‚Äôt want them to waste their money or make them upset.

569,"So basically 3-4 weeks ago my dog got allergic reaction, his whole body and mostly head area was very swollen. He was breathing heavily non stop and he was scratching himself nonstop to the point he couldn't relax at all, it was scary.

&amp;#x200B;

He got medicine for that, but that only stopped it temporarily and caused side effects such as drinking more water ( a lot ) and then peeing more outside. After that he got allergy or what ever again and now he got brand new allergic dry food without any medicine, it's been like 2 weeks now and he has no allergic reactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

But he only eats dry food now.. my dog seems like he has less energy and we have tough time feeding it to him. He doesn't enjoy it at all. I tried to tell my mom and dad that to fkin give up apple, carrot or something he has been eating since he was a puppy but now they lie to me that '' doctor said only dry food ''.

&amp;#x200B;

His dry food period ends in 2-3 weeks and then he gets into blood tests ( i have no idea why those doctors couldn't do this sooner ), but 2-3 weeks of more suffering.. wtf?

Got a soft topic for you, I hope you guys have some own experience and can give me some advice :) 
So I am 24 years old, and since more then 10 years I wasted my free time playing MMORPG's or watching videos/series, when I wasn't out with friends/family. As I got older and a lot in my life changed (finished college, moved to a foreign country, first serious relationship) I realized I have to find a hobby I can spend my time usefully with. Being a lot infront of a monitor is not what I want to dedicate a big part in my free time for.
I am interested in quite some stuff. I love being creative (sometimes I think I don't get the ideas to be so though), music (had guitar lessons for 10 years, over the years I forgot completely how to play) sports (wear glasses, so most of the sports is more difficult to do...) and languages. I am looking for something that forces me to go outside, meet groups of people and so on. I am a social person and I enjoy being with people. Even though I am an more introverted and shy guy.
I live in Barcelona so there is a huge choice of options for me to experience, I just need some advice and a kick in the butt ;)

I used to be abused by my mum but mainly mentally. A bit physically. 

Over the course of time my mum was diagnosed with borderline personality traits. She came to terms with it a has changed, for the most part. But I still find it hard to forgive here. 

My parents are very loving. But I dont in anyway feel very attached to them. My mum expects me to be more loving but I have a small flat n I basically spend as little time with them as possible. I'm  A bit assburgic n that makes me quite philosophical which can leave me spinning when I think about all of this. I know I dont appreciate them as much as I could. Maybe i will grow into that. I feel like I might have a lot of hatred in me n I also have suffered through suicidal stages. 

I realized I can talk to my dad about problems hes having wiv mum because of how I feel so detached. For instance we have had a couple long conversation about him wanting to leave her n the he cant have sex n he doesn't feel attracted to mum n he tried to sleep wiv a prostitute. 

Anyway. I've just bin spitting shite out wiv no point on this. Plus I'm blind so its extra hard to type (pause for sympathy). 

I just want to know if feeling completely detached is normal. Whether the fact that I was neglected as a child makes me content being alone now. N maybe a bit of validation would be nice. We all need to give each that sometime. Anyways

584,"A little backstory, I met this guy a while back and we became good friends. It started a little rocky since I kept pushing him away because of his resemblance to my toxic ex (is always concerned about other people abandoning them or constantly needing attention 24/7 kinda person) I decided to let the guy into my life so we could be friends, and I loved every moment of it. He was sweet, caring, and every time we called (he lives in a different country btw) I always had a blast, like no moment was it not fun for me. He started saying ""I luv you"" but as a friend way not in the means of ""I love you"" in a relationship way, he said it was to make me feel like somebody actually cares, so I didn't mind much about it. So this was going on... for a couple of months or so.

  
Then... I developed feelings for him, and he developed some for me too. He started saying  ""I love you"" and sweet things such as ""I can't imagine what my life would be without you in it right now"" or ""I REALLY do love you"". Of course, that made me fall for him more, and I started getting used to it, reciprocating the same feeling back. It was a lovesick puppy moment, but we never formally stated that we were in a ""relationship"" and this has been going on for a couple of months. He said he didn't want the title unless I'd be there in the same country as him, so he said that I was someone he wishes to be in a relationship with. I was pretty satisfied with that because the chances of me living near him were also large. 

But with every attraction of the opposite gender, there would be a sexual aspect that comes to play. Gradually, the calls to just talk and hangout became smaller, and it kept getting filled with calls that are just to satisfy our sexual needs. Usually short during the day and sometimes at night, and in between, we don't talk much as we used to in the beginning. His texts started to become a bit dry(?) like, we're running out of things to say kinda jazz. (but that's in my opinion) I guess to defend his side is that he's busy with a part-time job that he has every Saturday, I guess that's why I might be thinking too much? I was told by many that this is normal, how your texts gradually become less as people get comfortable and it isn't much of a need to constantly text. A little verification, I did talk to him about it, I told him that I was scared that this would turn out just like how my ex was towards me, how the conversations only come to life if something sexual is involved. His reply was that we have both been busy with our day to day things, to the free time he had to chat is gone by both of us playing games with his friends and the other time is to satisfy both of our needs. I guess he makes sense? but I just have a weird gut feeling that I'm terrified about. I'm just scared that the reason why he spent so much time trying to get close to me was just to have me satisfy his desires or something along the lines. Like he says nothing has changed between us, but I get a slight feeling that something bad might've turned out to be.

586,"Merry Christmas, everyone!

On this day of what is supposed to be rest and relaxation, I have instead been filled with anxiety about my financial future. I'm currently 25 years old and I'm working as a freelance web developer and a food courier. I make about \~$22k USD per year, but I save about 10k per year which I invest. This is possible because I still live at home with my parents with no plans to move out. My parents are immigrants and they don't speak English well so I grew up translating for them. They still need me help to survive on a daily basis, which is why our current living arrangement works for us. I'm also gay and I have no plans to have a family in the future. I hope this context will help you understand my situation.

My goal is to become financially independent, which basically means that I can quit my job and pursue any jobs or side gigs (or live in a ""tiny house"" or anything else) as long as I can pay the bills. With my current track, I will become financially independent when I reach $250k in savings, which means that I will have to work 25 more years as a freelancer.

On the other hand, if I go back to a ""regular"" job, I will have the potential to earn &gt;$80k per year, which means that I can save about $50k per year and reach financial independence in about 5 years. 

You're probably thinking, *DUH*, I should probably go back to a regular job. The thing is, I have extreme social anxiety from years of being bullied for being gay. This is what made me quit my regular job a couple of years ago to become a freelancer. The social anxiety issue got so bad that I tried to commit suicide when I was 18 and got institutionalized in a mental facility for about 14 days. This experience really left a scar on me and now I appreciate life for all of its moments because I know I will only live to see it once. However, now that I am older, I feel like I should challenge myself and participate in society again so that I can reach my goal faster. If I go back to a regular job, I plan to see a therapist the entire 5 years while working, so I know that I will have support to make sure I don't attempt suicide again.

I know it's hard to understand from your perspective, but I really need advice on what to do. Should I go back to a regular job so I can reach my goal of financial independence?",25Dec2019,1

596,"Hi there, I hope everyone is having a Merry Christmas. I'm definitely not and I'm hoping to find some encouragement/advice here. 

Basically my parents are upper middle class, we are not rich but my parents definitely have plenty of money to throw around. They are humble and don't really have an expensive car or house but when it comes to gifts they spend a lot. When I was a kid I loved this obviously, but as I grew older I have became less materialistic. I don't like it when my parents buy me expensive gifts anymore, it makes me feel guilty as I already have plenty of things, and many of my friends are less well off. I'm just not a materialistic person.

I was actually very excited for Christmas this year (I'm usually not) because I had extra money to spend on small gifts for my loved ones. I wrapped them up really pretty and just wanted to enjoy watching my parents open them.

What happened yesterday basically killed all of my enthusiasm for Christmas. My mom announced to me, one day before Christmas, that she spent a bunch of money on me anyways despite me asking her not to. This really upset me, and I feel like all of the excitement I had for Christmas was just sucked out of me, for two reasons:

1: She could have just respected my request
2: If she truly wanted me to have all this stuff she could have just not said anything, given me the gifts and I most likely wouldn't have even noticed

This morning when we were opening presents I tried very hard to remain grateful and act like I was excited but I just wasn't. Like I said, it feels like I had all of the excitement for Christmas sucked out of me. My parents noticed and said ""you look like you don't want to be here"". I said I was just tired and still waking up but in reality I was just sad that I got my parents a bunch of small presents, while they spent a bunch of money on me. For context, I am 21 and only living with my parents because of my financial situation and plan on moving out soon. There is absolutely no reason for them to buy me a bunch of stuff like I'm a kid. I love my parents and I know they only want the best for me, but this situation just makes me depressed.

Is there anyone else with upper middle class families that is having similar issues this Christmas?

TL;DR: I'm depressed because my mom spent a bunch of money on me for Christmas when I asked her not to. I'm not a materialistic person, I have friends that are living in poverty and struggling to make ends meet and it makes me feel guilty, and I respectfully asked her not to do this but she did anyways.

597,"I have a recurring issue in my family during family gatherings, that has gone on for years.

It is so bad, that it‚Äôs gotten to the point that we‚Äôll notice she‚Äôs been filming a private conversation. Needless to say, it makes most of us very uncomfortable, and even more frustrated that she won‚Äôt stop no matter how many times and years we have asked her to.l stop. One of my cousins (her daughter), has tried to make a rule that there is no filming allowing during certain times in her own home when there are gatherings. The issue is that my aunt‚Äôs son (her brother) loves any opportunity to undermine his sister, or a woman (he is very misogynistic), so whenever she tries to reinforce this rule, he loves to chime in and make the tension worse. For example, this last time he said ‚Äúpeople enjoy different things, stop trying to tell her what to do‚Äù. My mom pointed out that they can feel free to take pictures of each other then if it makes them happy, but leave other people out of it. One of the worst parts to me, is that there are young children around, and they are actively watching my aunt have people ask her to stop unwelcome behavior, and have her disregard it and continue it despite making people uncomfortable. They are also watching the women in the family be particularly disregarded. The only time either of them have remotely listened is when a man chimes in (which my male cousin then responds to as being pussy whipped). Anyway, we‚Äôre about to have a large family gathering in a cabin, and my anxiety about this is through the roof, so I figured I‚Äôd humbly ask if anyone has any advice or ideas on how to handle this situation.

600,"I'm a 20 yr old female and I fell into a really desolate depression just as I was starting back up community college in August.Within a month, I suddenly became hopelessly depressed and stopped going to school and I couldn't even get out of bed as I was so weak.I was basically in a depressive burn-out as I had relocated back to my old city on negative circumstances and jumped from job to job.It wasn't even my choice to go to college at the time.

I slept alot and binge ate alot until I spent nearly most of school refund money.I would go anxiety shopping - buying things to make myself feel better.I would walk around in a daze like a zombie.I would jump from job to job - quitting whenever my depression would worsen.

Weeks ago I decided on the military to gain some discipline and legit education.The issue is that I feel like I'm not mentally...more so spiritually healthy enough for the military.I'm still dealing with my depression that still leaves me weak, tired and now I don't eat as much.

I'm getting though this though and I will - but I was wondering if there were any possible alternatives to the military/college for me?

A program/place where I can gain discipline, at the same time peace and some type of education/cultivation?

603,"Hi - will try to keep this concise and short. 

I am a grad. still working in retail. My department manager is a couple years younger than me and started after me - she formed links with one particular manager and she helped her get this role. 

I was extremely happy for her - can‚Äôt say she worked hard but she worked smart i.e. cosying up to the right people etc. I get along with her. I recently got a new job and they wanted me to start the 5th December but I declined and asked to forward this to January as my shop is a little short on staff and ngl - I am one of the best there. I work hard, fast and quickly - I know this and take pride in this.

So, Christmas Eve (it‚Äôs crazy busy) and I am doing multiple stations i.e. refunds, food orders, serving cigarettes and lottery. I received a phone call mid serving from my manager, this is the conversation: 

Me: Hello! 

Manager: Yes, hello, where is the money?

Me: Huh? (baffled, like what?) I have sent it - one second, let me see if it‚Äôs stuck in the air (the shoot). Yes, no it‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ 

Her: No, well the pod is here but the money isn‚Äôt.

Me: Uh, what - getting frantic now, starting to panic - I have sent it..

Her: Well, check under your till, see what‚Äôs there..

She seemed really annoyed and impatient on the phone - very rude and abrupt. So, then I PANIC. I start to get mad anxious - I have a queue of people staring me down, I am going red.. hearts beating.

Keep in mind I had a long queue whilst this is happening.. also, I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks that were triggered from a relatives death, so I do take beta blockers and sleeping pills to help me relax. 

I call her phone, she doesn‚Äôt pick up. I did a tannoy (loud speaker thing) for her to contact me - she didn‚Äôt. 15 mins later, I saw the colleague that went with her to sort the cash, she said the manager misplaced it. I was fuming. I went upstairs to calm myself down. I saw her when she was leaving and said she gave me a panic attack - no apology, no nothing‚Ä¶ ‚Äòoh and me, haha‚Äô.

I want to complain and put this forward. My boss, however likes her, and he wants to promote me to management soon too.. so I don‚Äôt want to complain too much and appear a btch basically. But this situation really destroyed me inside - that sheer terror in those 15 mins and not even a sorry?

What do I do?",25Dec2019,1

I do however need lighter jackets, I spend a lot of time outside and in situations where that kind of wear is more appropriate. I only have two of these jackets both of which are getting quite wore and one of which doesn't fit right. I was laid off recently and replacing pieces like this are a bit of a luxury for me.

I really don't want to hurt her feelings, but she spent a decent chunk of change on these items and I think it would be better if it went towards something I would be more apt to wear. Since these are items I wear everyday for a good portion of the year I think it would be more ideal to have something that suits me rather than something I wear because I received them as a gift, which seems like an immature solution.

618,"Two years ago I (21F) met a really awesome guy (24M) in college. He was two years older than me and at the time was gearing up to graduate. We started what we thought was a casual FWB situation, but it quickly turned more serious after getting to know each other through non-sexual dates and a shared hobby. We split amicably when he graduated and he moved out of state. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I was in the thick of an eating/exercise disorder and weighed 110 lbs (I'm  5'6). Some said I looked model-ish, others said I looked scary underweight. Regardless, he seemed very attracted to me. I've since recovered by developing a healthy relationship with food. I'm no longer extremely insecure about my weight, and am at a healthy 135lbs. My friends and family say I look markedly different and significantly healthier.

The thing is, he's only ever seen me at my lowest weight. I'm suddenly incredibly anxious about reconnecting with him. I feel like the image he has of me in his mind won't match the present package.

622,"Hi, 19F here. There's this guy I've been friends with since last year, before I moved out in August for universitt, and honestly I felt a deep connection between us. I'll give you some background so you'll understand:

when we met we actually really liked each other and we were heading towards a path that was more-than-friendship like, but as I knew I was going to move out and go live in a place that's 7 hours away, I decided not to go through with it and asked him to stay friends, as long as he was cool with it, and he said he was.
So the friendship we created was going more than great, in fact it's amazing and I've rarely felt this comfortable with anyone else in the past.

In the last few weeks though, things have changed: talking to this guy started getting really really difficult as, in some way, he had to choose the topic we had to talk about, and everytime we do talk about something that concerns me or my interests, he cuts the conversation short and ghosts me or changes the subject. On top of that, keep in mind that I ended the ""relationship"" thing because I was moving out, not because my feelings were dying, in fact I can say they are still there.

This week I came back for the holidays and decided to surprise him, so I went to his high school (he is a year younger than me) with a gift, and he was obviously happy to see me, we hugged and had a nice time overall. Yet, I felt some kind of detachement from his part, not that there was anything forceful in his behavior, but it seemed like he cared more about spending time with the people he sees everyday than me, and now we are trying to arrange something to see each other again before I leave, but he doesn't make much effort at all. He is putting it all on me like ""you get a lift, you get here, you come to my town""(he lives 15 min away from my hometown), and doesn't want to make an effort to come here himself as I don't drive, but he does. Plus now even when we are together, we always do things related to him or his interests, and not that I don't enjoy it, it's just that I don't feel like I get to share anything while I take whatever he gives me.

So to sum up: he has gotten pretty self-centered, doesn't seem to care about our friendship, plus I still really like him and it's really tiring. 
How do I talk to him? Should I even do it? Are these good reasons or am I just an idiot?",25Dec2019,1

627,"I‚Äôve never made a post before, much less on here, so I hope you can bear with me. But I think I do need some guidance. I‚Äôm sorry for the length, but it‚Äôs been approximately a year since these things happened but they sting like they‚Äôre completely fresh.

I met a guy in early 2018 and we were friends right off the bat. We understood each other‚Äôs humor, riffed off each other‚Äôs ideas, and talked every single day and it was amazing because I‚Äôd never gotten along with someone so fast. He lived on the other side of the world from me so we‚Äôd be talking til one of us would see the sunrise where we were and the process would repeat day by day. Eventually, I began to catch feelings and he did, too, to the point that every time he‚Äôd drink he‚Äôd slip and say ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù 

We overcame the awkward in-between and were more open about our feelings after one night where we explicitly laid it all out that we had serious romantic feelings for each other. And everything was good. We shared every sunrise we could and he really helped me out with my mental health because I‚Äôd been struggling for years. I told him everything and we‚Äôd talk the entire day every day.

Fast forward to the latter part of the year where he got busier. I understood, I just missed him because by then it was routine to talk all the time. It was small at first‚Äîhe‚Äôd stop saying good morning and good night, he‚Äôd be more snide or sarcastic with remarks, that kinda stuff‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt mind. But absent hours turned into days and then even weeks. And amidst it all, I was worried and grew very anxious. It turned into me saying something and him not acknowledging it if he had the time for me or just silence. He was busy and he was dealing with some stuff at home. So I tried to support him through it all, I knew it was hard on him.

He said eventually that we‚Äôd call or something on my birthday and that was the most I‚Äôd gotten from him in maybe weeks so I said okay and I was excited. My birthday is in mid-November. When it rolled around, he gave me a half-hearted greeting and then after a few days of silence, said he wanted to end it. He told me he didn‚Äôt love me anymore and that he hadn‚Äôt for a while now but it wasn‚Äôt important enough to him to bring up earlier on. He said it was the distance. But in my surprise and in my hurt at how abrupt it was and how cold and unfeeling it came off, I thought it was my fault. I tried to talk to him but he got impatient and stopped speaking to me. And it broke my heart. He would only want to talk now and then and he wouldn‚Äôt address maybe 90% of my points. And it felt like I was talking to a brick wall. He would say one thing then mean the other then when I‚Äôd ask him about it he‚Äôd apologize for doing it and just say he was selfish. He would say he cared about me and wanted to be friends but then mass block me on social media. He said he missed me. And then he would get angry if I said I missed him too or that I still loved him. I got all turned around, confused, and questioned my own sanity because it‚Äôd be one thing but then it would be something else and I lost my footing because I thought maybe I was too stupid to understand. 

Finally, on Christmas Eve of 2018, he spoke to me. After weeks of silence and staying up all night waiting for him, refusing to come in to work because I was crying, and relying on my friends. And I thought we‚Äôd ironed it all out. But before the night ended, he ended up asking for sexual favors/photos because he‚Äôd deleted them all after he wanted to end it and he said he missed them (this was how he prefaced the apology, actually, by saying sorry about deleting those photos). And I said yes, because I still wanted to make him happy. This happened for a bit after the split and I felt a little weird but I still wanted some sliver of anything we had, if he could still desire me even just in that way then it would be okay. 

He then told me he was seeing someone. While still asking me for photos. And I think I came unglued. I thought I just wasn‚Äôt enough, not pretty enough, not good enough, and especially not close enough. I was too far and when he was having trouble at home, he told me he wished I was there to help him through it, something he never told me while he was going through it. And I thought all the more it was my fault. I went back to self-harming. I barely slept. I cried every single day. He got angry with me for being sad on social media and blocked the last of it and it hurt so much, I felt like I‚Äôd lost him in every way imaginable.

He‚Äôd said repeatedly he wanted to be friends, wanted to go back to how it was before where we talked every day. But I knew I couldn‚Äôt do it. He‚Äôd changed and I had, too. And so I said I‚Äôd take some time away, something I should‚Äôve done months prior. In that time, I became suicidal, anxious, and depressed. I‚Äôd always been that way, but when that happened, it magnified to a point where I was completely unstable. I drank a lot. I self-harmed. I barely slept. I had irresponsible sex just to FEEL something and sometimes, during sex, I‚Äôd just dissociate and cry after. And all the men looked like him. And all those men would leave me after and I‚Äôd be completely alone again. 

I lost my closest friends because of the emotional burden. And I don‚Äôt blame them, but they just disappeared without warning and told me to leave them alone. So I isolated even more. I wish I‚Äôd listened to them earlier when they were saying how much they hated him for what he did to me. Maybe I would‚Äôve kept them. My family also noticed how bad I was feeling even though I never described what happened. My boss got what was going on right away and was nice enough to give me a bit of time off.

I went to see a therapist. I didn‚Äôt have the money to before but I was desperate at the time and took a big chunk out of my bank account for the session and the medication. And I felt my skin crawl and I bawled and screamed in her office for 2 hours during our first session. I showed her how much I hurt myself. I told her how bad it felt, how I thought it was my fault. And then she had to calmly explain to me that it‚Äôd been abuse. That I was being gaslit and taken advantage of at my most vulnerable moment for his sexual gratification. And that it had affected every part of my life. She had me tested for STDs and had my liver checked, too. And told me I was very lucky to be clean and still physically healthy. She dispensed psych meds and officially diagnosed me after years of not knowing what was wrong. She said it was Bipolar I. And what he did only ignited what was already a gas trail in my life. She was kind enough to give me a discount. 

I didn‚Äôt talk to him until the next time I was in the place I‚Äôd been the first time we talked. When we first spoke, I was traveling at the time and I loved that city but when I came back all I thought of was him. The city had been the same but it looked and felt different, because all I could think of was ‚Äúthis was the ice cream stall where I told him about this‚Äù or ‚Äúthis was the street he first sent me a photo.‚Äù The last thing in our message box was a long message from me saying I cared about him with all my heart, that I prayed for him every day (I still do), and that there would never be a day where I would regret loving him like I did. I told him I was back in that city where we first started talking and he said that he hoped I‚Äôd have fun. I was visiting the art museum at the time and when I got the message, I cried for an hour on a bench outside the museum.

I practiced restraint and didn‚Äôt talk to him again until maybe a month or two later when I was trying to date again but it turned out terribly (guy I was dating was a supreme asshole). Let‚Äôs call him A. He and I talked a bit about A and how I could move forward. It felt so clinical. Not like how we were when we were friends at all. I got uncomfortable and thanked him for his time. After A, I saw someone else right away because I was too anxious to feel alone and that was on me, but the new guy I saw was my friend before and it just slowly became romantic when he said he had feelings for me he never got over. Let‚Äôs call him B. B and I saw each other for a bit right after A but he lied about so many things and I couldn‚Äôt take it. I went to my ex and asked him for advice again. Then we started to talk. He said he really missed me. But understood why I hadn‚Äôt been talking to him. I said I thought he hated me after everything that happened. We talked again for a bit and it felt like old times, laughing, sending each other jokes. 

The fun messages stopped abruptly. I ran into some trouble with another guy I knew. I don‚Äôt want to narrate this part because it was so recent and it makes me sick. In short, I was raped. I told my ex about it. And he dismissed it. It broke my heart. We stopped talking.

Earlier today I greeted him a Merry Christmas when it was Christmas at his time. And we talked for a bit. And I had that feeling like I was bursting to tell him everything, that I still love him, that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever stop. And I know it was wrong of me to date while still in love with my ex, I acknowledge that, but I‚Äôd thought it might help me finally move on. I wanted to tell him about all the men who only wanted sex and then left me in bed alone. I wanted to tell him how I wake up from dreams where he‚Äôs here with me or I‚Äôm there with him and the distance is not a problem anymore and we can be in love without any hiccup. I wanted to tell him I kept everything, all the doodles I made of us together when we‚Äôd just be on the phone or every book he recommended or every small thing that turned significant because of him. But I didn‚Äôt. Because I‚Äôve been scared for a whole year that he‚Äôs had one foot out the door and if I say anything more, he‚Äôll leave me completely and sever the last thing that connects us. And I feel like it‚Äôd destroy me.

I have people who keep trying to remind me that I am more than what he did to me but most days it doesn‚Äôt feel like that, especially now. I used to love the holiday season, I used to keep a calendar count for me and my friends for how long it was til Christmas. I love giving gifts. I adored Christmas time and the love it brought. But last Christmas and this Christmas has been a nightmare. And it feels like I‚Äôm reliving it all again now. I don‚Äôt know what to do because every detail from last year is still so clear to me now. I remember exactly when he asked to break it off, I remember exactly when we finally talked, I remember exactly when he told me he was seeing someone. And it breaks my heart just like it did the first time. I don‚Äôt know what to do, my next therapy session isn‚Äôt until after the holidays. I haven‚Äôt had the strength to take my medication. I‚Äôve been tempted to self-harm but I‚Äôve been avoiding sharp objects and trying to write and watch videos to keep distracted instead. Please help me. I feel like I‚Äôve lost everyone else who would have been able to.",25Dec2019,1

He said he would help us get our own apartment and that he loves me but he also feels bad that he made everyone feel uncomfortable.

I almost have no senses at all, for instance, when I see a ugly scene on the news in a gathering, I feign irritation and disgust although I really feel nothing inside.

Had a girlfriend once, for 4 years, and never really gave her true love, in fact, I was quite cold towards here and I still don't know why she took 4 years to realize that I was a cold hearted creature that cannot give what he doesn't have, Love.

651,"Hello everyone! and first and foremost  Happy holidays. i wish you all the best and a fantastic new year.  so my father and i have always been distant. since childhood.  he use to be a druggy and alcoholic and was in prison for most of his life.  and i had to deal with that growing up.  at one point he was out long enough and i lived with him. dealing with tons of abuse. being thrown threw walls ect ect. growing up because of this man. i dealt with a lot of things. anxiety abandonment issues as he would try to break it off and leave me behind. even went as far as getting in  a relationship with a woman with the same name as my mother. and a kid (at that time) who looked very much like to to start again. he won't accept my younger siblings as his own. but for them they don't care as they didnt spent any time with him growing up, my mother made sure of that.  however i wasn't so lucky. and well growing up i wanted to spend time with my father. so badly wanted to be a daddys boy.  but i was never enough i was never able to please him. until my teen years where i finally stood up and fought back. because of my dad i  didnt learn to ride a bike until i was 10 because he  tried teaching me once pushed me and i fell. then decided to call me useless and worthless and there is no hope for me.  i wasn't able to tie my shoes till i was 13 because i was so afraid of messing up or  not doing it to his standards. my dad had to have everything one little way. no mistakes no nothing. i remember being inside a taco johns growing up. he told me to tie my shoes. so i get down on one knee. and began to try.  after a few seconds i start to get upset because i know whats about to happen my dad looks at me calls me a failure and begins to beat me in front of tons of people. now im not talking about a spanking im talking closed fist and all.  a man at one point tried to intervene and my dad  managed to scare him off. then drag me by the hair across the ground and beat me all the way out side. into the car. where i didnt get to eat the rest of the night and was locked in a closet.  most of my childhood if i didnt do something correctly i was locked in a basement or a closet.   he would beat me for pretty much anything had a sega that we got from a store and it came with a foot ball game.  so i decided of course as a child awesome i cant wait to play with this new thing.  well pick the chiefs. that happens to be my fathers favorite team. i begin to lose. because im a 6 year old kid i really don't know what im doing but he was so angry that i was losing at a video game.  he said if your not gonna do it right then don't do it at all. and beat me. the only thing i was able to cope with was my dog.  so i ran to my room and held my dog hoping it wouldn't fallow me but  of course he did. then  beat then basement for a few days.  my dad often made me get up 4 in the morning  when i was 8 and hall cinderblocks up and down a dirt hill. for the fun of it.  (that i can say now im not so mad about because as ive gotten older it helped me realize that all you gotta do is power through) eventually i decide to go live with my mom so i only saw him on weekends.  by this point im around 11 and i haven't hit a growth spirt yet. so i had baby fat. but that made my dad so mad that every morning  he called me fat spit on me and said ill never become anything and made me walk around the block for 5 miles all the while he sat in a chair  in the lawn and watched me. i cried my entire way around.  from there on out. every time id come over he talked down on me. for everything. still not a thing making him happy. still not a second so i could breathe. often times he would tell me ""if you ever want to get back at me dont you wait till im a old man and can't defend myself""   funny huh? seeing as a man who  beat a child could say that.  but eventually that went from  weekends to every other weekend every other weekend went to   a weekened every few months to none for years. as those years go on i start highschool.  and about half way through my mother gets sick with cancer.  so i decide to drop out of school to take care of her and my siblings because it was more important to me to give her. the best possible chance/best time she has left. never once complaining. or taking a second for myself.  about a year later my mother passes away. leaving me as a 17 year old kid about to be 18.  taking care of 2 13 year old kids.  i sold almost everything i had went looking for as many jobs as i could get to make sure i could provide for my family. i never learned how to drive and still to this day i cant  being in my 20s. them alot of other bad shit happened with that scenario but thats not what im here for. eventually i hear from my aunt that my father is in town. at her house. and here i was  18  at this time mad pissed that my father went to see my aunt and not me his son after my mother died.  so i get a ride out there wanting to open the door and yell at him and hit him. ask him why he didnt get a hold of me and why hes here. instead i opened that door cried and hugged him. was the first time in my life i had a hug from my father. and i cried and cried. prior to that i  never had a second to myself to cry about my mom.  i never stopped for a second thinking about my siblings. everything i did and still do are for these kids. now here in a few months they are going to be 18.   but even that hug didnt last. he ended up blaming me for not telling him my mom was ill saying we could of called when he had changed numbers so no one knew his numbers my aunt paid money to get his information. my mother and us have always been poor.  likd never knew if we would have food or a house poor. my mom prior to cancer was on disability. she had just about everything wrong with her you could imagine that wasn't going to kill her.  she took 15 pills 2 times a day. was in constant pain couldnt even hug her becasue she hurt so bad but she never stopped doing the best for us. picking up odd jobs trying to make it work  baby sitting kids that she  loved he had all the baby sitting kids pictues on the wall. always got them christmas and birthdays.  thats the kinda woman she was. no matter how many times i tried to tell my dad i couldnt of contacted him. he didnt care.  my aunt is very sucessfull. she had tons of money. could afford anythign she wanted.  so this was easy for her.  fast foward i start seeing my dad more as he said he wanted to help.  of course that didnt happen and everytime he saw me he insulted me over and over not ever able to have a conversation all of it was shit talking and down talking to me no matter what i said or tried to talk about. to the point where i told him if you want to have a relationship with me then you need to star talking to me like a person not trash its not that hard to do. so then again we stop talking for a few more years. till a few months ago where we met up and for the first time for 3 different visits talking to me man to man.  as equals  asking about my siblings this that and the other.  to  just 3 months ago trying to  say im a failure because i dont have a education and  trying to turn my little brother against me. telling him im a failure that hes proud of him because hes about to graduate unlike me this that and whatever my little brother of course telling him hes a prick. no today as of dec 25 2019. my dad and i text here and there.  and well i really want a relationship with him.  i really dont want to be an oprhan.  after my mother ive been really fucked up trying my best to do what i can.  gained a lot of weight over the past 2 years because of this depression. and i really want to get into the navy.  so im trying to get motivated to lose it. and trying my past to find a place to study my GED. but i guess what im asking is what do i do? do i try yet again to salvage this relationship.  what do i need to do. to  make it bearable or to make it worth it.  like after everything all the years of abuse i still love my father no matter what he did to me. look past all my trauma and scars  and still want something.  so please to whoever is reading this  throw some advice my way.  thank you very much! and have a fantastic day",25Dec2019,1

656,"Merry Christmas guys! I had a wonderful Christmas with my family and my aunt who is staying with us. Until I tried to take my medicine and I noticed I was 16 pills short.

I know addiction clouds judgement and makes people act in ways they aren‚Äôt proud of. There‚Äôs nothing my aunt could do that would make me love her any less. I‚Äôve known about her struggle with addiction for awhile now but I haven‚Äôt seen it firsthand (at least not that I was aware of) until now. I was told to hide my medicine when she first arrived and it broke my heart. She‚Äôs the most incredible, hilarious, supportive person ever and it kills me to know she‚Äôs going through this again.

I recently lost health insurance. I‚Äôm 18 and a dependent under my dads policy, who is struggling financially right now. I‚Äôm on two medications for ADD, one that (without insurance) costs $365. The other medication is a similar, significantly lower dose that I take when my other medication wears off, or in this case, when I have to go without it. It‚Äôs much cheaper so it‚Äôs easier to afford. But due to an incident a month or so ago where I was away for college and running out of pills long before I should‚Äôve (suspecting my roommates friends might‚Äôve taken them), I found out that in order to get my medication before the date, I‚Äôd have to file a police report. For legal background, I live in North Carolina. Also, I take 2-3 in the mornings because 1 pill doesn‚Äôt do anything for me (I ran it by my doctor, don‚Äôt worry!) So I should‚Äôve had 28 when I opened it because I had taken two the day before.

Anyway, I had my bottle in my bag for most of the time I had it (left it on my bedside table for a few hours) and I took it out to take some and noticed I was wayyyyy short. 16 pills short to be exact. I got a 30 ct. refill yesterday and today I had 12. I called my mother who was aware of the problem and she ran it by my aunt who said she hadn‚Äôt taken them. When I got home from my dad‚Äôs with my sisters, I went to take a shower and my aunt just so happened to find 3 sitting on the counter. I never take it into the bathroom and I never ever take them out of the bottle.

I love her all the much in the world. She‚Äôs one of my favorite people. But I‚Äôm just crying right now because I have no health insurance until the first of the year at the earliest, probably later. I can‚Äôt function without my medication. I can‚Äôt get a refill on this medication until a month, and I can‚Äôt get my daily medication refilled until I have insurance back because we can‚Äôt afford it. Really not the Christmas I had imagined. I have no idea what to do, say, and I especially have no idea how to act around her because she‚Äôll be here until the end of the week. I don‚Äôt want to act like this didn‚Äôt hurt me.

658,"I don't know how to make this short so here goes.

 We've been friends for almost 2 yrs since college. She's 21y/o, I'm 23y/o. I first knew abt her bf when  he got her pregnant by accident. She told me he was her ""first"" and that he's 27 y/o and that he's her brother friend. They've been dating for a almost a year at the time when he got her pregnant. The guy's family wanted them to Marry Asap bcoz of their religion and beliefs. My friend didn't want to but even her parents are angry at her and are in favor of the idea of marriage. She changed her religion into his religion.

The guy left to work abroad which left my friend stressed because of how her and his family is pressuring her. He promised her at first that he would take full responsibility. But later encouraged her to get abortion because he still has dreams he wants to achieve.

She didn't do it tho. But she lost the child because of depression and too much stress. She then had to take medications for panic attacks. But even tho the child is gone their families are still forcing them to get Married because the guy's parents blame her for ""ruining his image to their church by getting pregnant"".

They still stayed in a long distance relationship until he cheated on her. But he begged her to be together again saying that it was a mistake and she gave in pretty quick. I told her numerous times to cut all ties with him, she would agree at first but then later, she would say they're back together and are happy again.

Until he cheated on her again. This time his reason was that ""he is a man"" and that ""HE can cheat but SHE should not because she is a woman"". I was so mad and tried my best to convince her to never get back with him again.

She promised me she wont. And that she'll focus on her health and well being now. 

But a few days ago I found out that he got back from oversees and that they immediately got married. I confronted my friend about it and she said he begged her for forgiveness and that he wants to start a family with her. And that he'll be a better man for her. She said she realized just then that they are deeply inlove and that she also wants a family with him.

I was shook! They had a civil wedding and that next year they will hold a proper wedding in a church. And my friend, w/o asking me first, submitted my name as her Maid of Honor.

I am happy that my friend is happy. But i think she made a rash decision of getting married this early especially since she's still in college and she doesn't have a career yet. I don't like the guy for every pain that he caused her but I can't really say if he really isn't a changed man now. But everything happened in a span of only 1 year. 

I want to be supportive of my friend but deep inside I feel like I'll be lying if I say that I am happy for the both of them. Because I do not approve of their Marriage and I personally dislike him. Infact I dislike both their families.

Am I a selfish person for that? Am I a bad friend if I decline to be her Maid of Honor? I want to be there for her but I feel as if I've failed her. It made me so sad and mad everytime she comes to me crying. I feel terrible. Should I just do it and pretend I'm happy and write a speech about how happy I am for them? Should I lie? Sorry for my bad English.",25Dec2019,1

I have never been a popular kid, I have been bullied in most of my school years for various reasons, varying from my looks to my very troubled first couple years in live. I have only had 1 gf up until now. that lasted to months 1 day back when I was 16 and was not very serious at all. I have a lot of female friends so I have asked them what I can do differently, and their answers very a lot. some say I am too nice and become 'like a bro' real fast, and others blame my non existing self respect/ self love for it. I am the only one in my direct family who doesn't have a relationship ( except for my grandmothers, because both grandpa's are dead) and it is stressing me out a lot. I really hate almost everything about me and I think getting a relationship can help me a lot, but I really don't know how I can do that.

before I forget to mention it, I really struggle with my sexuality and if I am trans or not. I guess that if I manage to get a lovely gf, that then in can be a man for her, like it is supposed to be.

This cousin is non binary, and has a history of other issues like Tourettes. 

This cousin is 18, and also lives with other relatives, my dad's brother, this cousin isn't at risk of abuse, and I don't suspect abuse while they were a minor. 

They are having some rocky relations, not even speaking, with their parents. They have a sister, but given that it seems like the non speaking is only about gender identity and she is not appearing to have that issue, I don't think she is at risk.

It makes me feel really bad right now, I want my cousin to feel better and to have parents who love this cousin, my own parents are divorced and it really hurts to have parents who don't like each other in the context of love but still accept each other for who they are and who love all of their three children, but I can't imagine how this cousin is feeling.

Now james was a little introverted and was a mummy's boy so he didn't act like an average 5 year old since he was sheltered a lot and often acted younger than he was. But he was so kind and adorable and he said I was pretty and picked a flower for me. It was so cute. Moving forward, it was bedtime for james but he said that he always slept in the same bed as his mum or older sister because he has a lot of nightmares so I told him that he could sleep in his mums bed with me. We got tucked in and once he fell asleep I got ready and Put my earphones in with music on as it tends to help me sleep and then drifted off as well. I didnt know how much time passed but I slowly was waking up and was struggling to get back to sleep. I was really uncomfortable and I thought the bed was really scratchy and bumpy and it was like needles scratching my back. I kept rolling back and forth but the scratching wasn't stopping but it did keep getting slowly weaker and lighter so I decided to relax again and finally let my full weight onto the bed and after that I thought I heard a muffled cry of pain which made me wake up again(side note I was barely conscious and super tired). I was wondering what the noise was but ignored it because I was super tired and could barley feel the scratching anymore. I woke up in the morning stretched and laid there for a while just listing to music for about an hour. I sat up for a second but laid down againüòÇ. I could barley sleep last night so was very tired and since the bed didn‚Äôt feel scratchy anymore I decided to go back to sleep again and slept for about 4 more hours. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain he was in with me crushing his chest and small body and him underneath my weightüòÖ. I woke up and rolled over to say good morning to James but he wasn‚Äôt there. I got up and looked at the bed to find him crushed and unconscious with dry blood On his nose and fingers. I called an ambulance and as we were going to the hospital it hit me. I had rolled on top of him and crushed him in whilst I was asleep and he was trying to get me off of him and I couldn‚Äôt hear him due to the music. I could have killed him and was so lucky that kids are so resilient. The next day when I spoke to him his mum and his sister he looked horrified and me they all shouted at me and told me to leave.

679," 

Long story short - I accidentally dropped my phone into the toilet, it didn't fully submerge, only the top half of the phone, and it was there for only like a second, because I took it out as fast as I could. Now, because of that, I thought to myself 'hey the water didn't get in, so that's why my phone is still working!' (I KNOW, stupid!)

I kept using it as if nothing ever happened. After 3 hours of using it, green lines appeared on the screen and the phone went dead. I tried turning it on, charging it (because I have an Iphone, the battery is not as good as it should be and whenever I'm out in the cold, the phone shuts down) and nothing worked ...

Then I read some posts about water damage and how you, under any circumstances, SHOULD NOT touch the phone, because it will create short circuits which will cause the phone to die and nothing, but nothing will repair it.

The phone has been put in rice, it's been there for 15 hours, and I'm asking you guys if you have any experience with this and how it went ... I spent the whole day crying because of it, I loved my phone ...",25Dec2019,1
680,"The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from student grants, as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival. 

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there‚Äôs at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would  be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

So how do I convince my parent's that it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket? Remember that I will make sure I have enough money for two tickets. With money I get from my student grants and my internship, and the fact that the festival isn't until this summer, I will have more than enough money if I save up. (I get about 200$ a month in total from both student grants and my internship)

TL;DR I really want to go to a music festival with my cousin. I haven't asked her yet, but if she says yes I want to pay for her ticket. My parents told me though I can't pay for anyone else. How do I convince them it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket?",25Dec2019,1

I usually text people first finding out how they are doing and as a very outgoing person , I tend to set things up so that we can meet up .

This might come out as more of a vent, so please excuse me for that. 

My stepdad always tends to be a cog in our family's happiness. Either he always has something else to do that overturns our plans, gaslights my mom when she points it out and they end up in big arguments that usually end up with my mom in tears. There's no physical abuse thank God, but it's mainly just verbal feuds that I get tired of hearing. 

Don't get the wrong idea, he isn't some sort of deadbeat. He's been doing incredibly well for himself pursuing a career as a lawyer. He is a great father to me 20M and my 8 year old brother. He's taught me so much about how to fix things up in the house, helped me buy my first car, and is a stellar source of relationship advice. 

It's just that he and my mom clash so much it's incredibly grating everytime they go out. And as you can imagine, the same happened on both Christmas eve and Christmas day. As I'm typing this my mom is on the verge of tears simply for trying to convince him to go out and see her family. He just simply doesn't want to go. 

I by no means want to see them split up, since I already went through that with my biological father and it was a shitty experience. I don't want to see that happen to my brother. I've never intervened in their arguments before because of fear that I'd only make matters worse. He's against the idea of getting a marriage counselor when my mom is full on supportive of it. 

I know he's a great guy, he's way better than my actual dad who actually cheated on my mom after I was born. I love him and he's a great dad to us. I just wish he was a better husband to my mother. Any advice could mean so much to me, this has been an issue for a while now, it's only that it's really bringing me down now since it's literally happening on what is supposed to be the happiest day of the year. 

Merry Christmas to all of you, and my best wishes go out to you all.",25Dec2019,1

696,"A little context, I'm a quadriplegiac (I can't move any of my limbs so I'm full time in a wheelchair) and I have a group of careworkers that I've hired to help with everyday things such as getting in and out of bed, showering etc.

So about 8 months ago I had an old acquaintance of mine who also is a quad contact me about a girl he worked with named Audrey that might be interested in working with me. The first 2 times that we arranged to meet fell through but the 3rd time was a charm and Audrey and my old acquaintance came by my house (I live in my parents basement in a separate suite because I can't live fully independent because of my needs) for a job interview.

Audrey and I clicked right away and I was taken aback by the way her eyes glowed when she looked at me when we conversed and her bubbly personality. Towards the end of the interview when it was just the two of us small talking she mentioned that she had just broken up with her boyfriend and that she'd been hitting the gym more often.

I hired Audrey and we went out for a beer and immediately she began talking about her exes, asked me about my crushes (I was too shy to talk about it), played with her hair and grabbed my knee when we we're laughing together.

There were a few other things that stood out to me as possible flirting so I'll list them:

-We very quickly became close friends and we text each other almost everyday and she's big on sending smile emoji's after saying that she'll see me soon.

-I've introduced her to my friends and she wants me to meet her roommates and girlfriends.

-She always wears sort of racy outfits when she's was working with me, like short dresses/skirts (sometimes sitting without her legs uncrossed and slightly open in her pencil skirt), short shorts, and low cut tops during the summer and yoga pants and skinny jeans in the winter. She made a comment one time about her yoga pants, saying that she was ""showing off my ass"" and then laughing.

-She showed me pictures of her in her nice designer one-piece bating suit and also told me about her ""tiny"" Canada day bikini that she got.

-Before going on vacation she asked me if I was going to miss her (I said yes) and later texted that she was going to miss me.

-I've had her and her parents by my house (when she wasn't working) and I've been invited out for drinks with them where I met her sister and roommate. Her parents also invited me out to dinner to a quite expensive restaurant (I was busy so I couldn't).

-When she went home to her hometown for Thanksgiving she sent me a picture of her bedroom and pictures of her at the club and sent me hearts when I thanked her.

-She posted multiple pictures of us on her Instagram and posted one picture of me with hearts. Also took a picture of me and said that I have a nice jaw-line and how she bets I probably look good in every picture I'm in.

-She always wants to go for drinks and when we do she always sits right across from me so she can ""see you better"".

-She tells me about all the guys that ask her out and talk to her at the gym and the dates she goes on.

-She probably spent over $100 on me this Christmas

-She wears perfume just about every shift.

I think she's an amazing person and I told her she's the smartest and kindest person I've ever met. She's a very physically, athletic attractive girl (I told her she's exotic looking which made her smile) and I've developed feelings for her emotionally and sexually but I don't want to say anything and risk the closet friendship I've ever had unless I'm sure she feels the same way.

Does she have feelings for me as well and if so how should I tell her? If the feeling is mutual I won't have her work for me anymore as it would be a conflict of interest.

TL;DR: A careworker/friend that works for me that I have feelings for has been flirty with me and I want to make sure it's mutual but I don't want to say anything because I don't want to risk the closet friendship I've ever had unless I'm sure she feels the same way.",25Dec2019,1
698,"So I was baby sitting my best friends little brother James (5) for her. I'm a chubby girl around 210-220lbs and I'm 27. I have experience with looking after kids since I work in a preschool. Now james was a little introverted and was a mummy's boy so he didn't act like an average 5 year old since he was sheltered a lot and often acted younger than he was. But he was so kind and adorable and he said I was pretty and picked a flower for me. It was so cute. Moving forward, it was bedtime for james but he said that he always slept in the same bed as his mum or older sister because he has a lot of nightmares so I told him that he could sleep in his mums bed with me. We got tucked in and once he fell asleep I got ready and Put my earphones in with music on as it tends to help me sleep and then drifted off as well. I didnt know how much time passed but I slowly was waking up and was struggling to get back to sleep. I was really uncomfortable and I thought the bed was really scratchy and bumpy and it was like needles scratching my back. I kept rolling back and forth but the scratching wasn't stopping but it did keep getting slowly weaker and lighter so I decided to relax again and finally let my full weight onto the bed and after that I thought I heard a muffled cry of pain which made me wake up again(side note I was barely conscious and super tired). I was wondering what the noise was but ignored it because I was super tired and could barley feel the scratching anymore. I woke up in the morning stretched and laid there for a while just listing to music for about an hour. I sat up for a second but laid down againüòÇ. I could barley sleep last night so was very tired and since the bed didn‚Äôt feel scratchy anymore I decided to go back to sleep again and slept for about 4 more hours. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain he was in with me crushing his chest and small body and him underneath my weightüòÖ. I woke up and rolled over to say good morning to James but he wasn‚Äôt there. I got up and looked at the bed to find him crushed and unconscious with dry blood On his nose and fingers. I called an ambulance and as we were going to the hospital it hit me. I had rolled on top of him and crushed him in whilst I was asleep and he was trying to get me off of him and I couldn‚Äôt hear him due to the music. I could have killed him and was so lucky that kids are so resilient. The next day when I spoke to him his mum and his sister he looked horrified and me they all shouted at me and told me to leave. I was lucky to just get away with that and that they didn‚Äôt press charges. They won‚Äôt speak to me anymore.

699,"This might turn into a rant about dating apps but whatever lol. Anyways, I met a guy on hinge and we went out a couple times (there‚Äôs another post about it on my profile).

He still looks at my story on Instagram and I have his phone number. I was contemplating sending him a ‚Äúmerry Christmas‚Äù message but I mostly just want to know why he unmatched me.

God, this is why I said I would never use a dating app. I really liked this guy and I want to feel the exhilaration of falling in love with someone.

Im really scared of getting it done at claires, Im already not good with needles but the idea of piercing gun freaks me out even more since it cant be cleaned as throughly and I've heard horror stories. She also got the package with the rapid healing treatment which looking at the ingredients appears to be just watered down bleach. 

Im really grateful that she's finnally letting me get my ears pierced but looking at the money she's spent for what im getting im honestly just upset because I didnt have any say in it and I cant just turn it down, I told her I was scared about getting it done at claires a bit after recieving the gift but she seemed upset that I even questioned her choice and told me it would be fine.

My friends are also making it hard to stop, since many of them coach and/or train, and want me to keep doing it with them.

727,"This entire thing is about Christmas. I don't have anything against Christmas.  . . I'm sure I would love Christmas if it was just my parents and siblings (who also share the same view as me). So I better just start from the beginning, my mum's grandpa had worked up companies from nothing and became very wealthy because of this. He had a wife and a few kids (idk how many) but sadly he and his wife passed away, which left my grandma and her sisters a fortune. Grandma and her sisters would always want to show off their money to each other during Christmas (yes it is all relevant I promise), so each and every family member would have to get a gift for everyone. Even my mum from a young age would have to get everyone a gift without any financial support from her own parents just to show how rich they were (yes even before she had a job and when she was a broke university student). To further explain: everyone gave individual presents, someone would have about 5 gifts given individually from the one part of the family. Since then grandma and grandpa have made some really bad descisions and are now riddled with debt, unfortunately grandpa is also dead now. We also no longer do Christmas with the other side of the family (around when my aunt's and mum had kids)
So ... anyway back to the main point. This tradition has half carried over and everyone is expected to give presents even though my parents have pushed and pushed and pushed for just a couple presents from the entire family, but they are made to feel like they are being rude. This whole tradition has made our Christmas all about presents when it should be about family and having fun. Because of all this I have started to dislike Christmas because it is only about presents and that's all anyone thinks about. But I do sometimes feel like I'm being really ungrateful because some people dont get to celebrate Christmas but I feel like the way our family does Christmas isn't really Christmas at all.
I just need some advice on how I might be able to alter things and I want to know if I really am being ungreatful or it's in my head. 
The only way I see out of it is when I create my own family I'll be able invite my siblings and parents to have Christmas with us.

733,"Recently I (15F) feel like I'm just a really annoying person to be around for a lot of people. I'm not sure why, but recently some of my friends have been distancing themselves from me e.g I keep seeing my friend group hanging out without me on social media increasingly more over the past couple months, the rare occasion when I do post something indicating that I'm feeling down, I just get ignored, whereas when they do the same thing I immediately reply to make sure they're okay. I dont know what I'm doing wrong.

Additionally, I'm close friends with quite a few guys, who all have a girlfriend/are being crushed on by my other friends. I would never ever date them, because I'm not straight, but I feel like my friends keep getting annoyed at me for being close with them nonetheless?

He comes upstairs and tells me hes depressed and feels like killing himself and says he has the means to do so. But today because my mum was home (she works nights so she normally isnt here) it reached a boiling point and they started arguing. I know he is a good man and I want to help him as he has never hit or said anything rude to me or my mum and constantly tells us that he loves us but still continues this destructive behaviour.

735,"**TLDR:  I'm terrified of dating and sex because I have almost no experience. and the one I have probably doesn't count anymore. I also don't feel like it's possible for me to meet somoene ""naturally"". I would love some advice but dating advice is dominated by incels and pseudo-experts doing more harm than good.**

Apologies if it's not the place, I don't really know of any community I'd ask. I also apologise for yet another ""I want a GF"" post, I know some subreddits are full of those. I hope this one is a bit more productive.

I'm not a virgin, I had a girlfriend and I had sex before. I'm not gonna pretend I don't wish for some fun sex, but it's not one of those posts crying about lack of sex and losing virginity. Maybe I'll just give you short story of my life while trying to keep my personal details secret.

I never had ""luck"" with girls so my first and only girlfriend happened during late highschool and early university. The relationship sucked and so did our both mental states apparently so it fell apart in a rather long and messy proccess. After that I tried some PUA stuff and it just didn't work for me. It turned out I had a lot of issues with myself, I was in therapy for quite some time. I didn't know any better and I still don't, but I think that period of my life was largely a huge mistake. A few years later and one more therapy later and I'm disgusted by those times.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I went on some dates, very few but still. I mostly got rejected, ignored, sometimes laughed at and sometimes treated like an arsehole which I've definitely deserved at times. Thanks to ""great"" PUA advice I ruined those few dates by either being too judgemental about looks, being an absolute dummy, pushing for sex, or just trying something I thought was going to give me ""results"" (I'm sorry for this vocabulary). Long story short - I fucked up every chance I had or my mental state fucked my life up which ended up in my dating and sex lives being non-existent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm largely leftist now (like really leftist, not just non-conservative) but I still cannot into relationships, or dating, or sex in a healthy way. Sadly I don't think there's any community for people like me that wouldn't smell of incels and views incompatible with mine. It's been so long since I had anything to do with dating that I'm afraid of even trying. I mean, many if not most underage girls have way more experience than I do, so trying dating and everything that comes with it with adult women that are probably finishing or have finished college is... scary. My social life has never been great nor is it now, so I don't really get to go to parties or meet girls naturally. Workplaces I'll work in have been highly male-dominated too.",25Dec2019,1
736,"I'm leaving my current job for another one in January. I'm on good terms with everyone, I'm friendly to everyone but I'm not close to anyone like a real friend. Except for one person, we were really close and friends outside of workplace. We had a falling out and stopped talking a month ago. I was the giving friend in the relationship, and that's OK. I like supporting my friends. But the first time I was the one needing support, he wasn't there for me. I told him about it, he said he wasn't my girlfriend, like what the hell? Was I your girlfriend when I was your shoulder to cry on when you were going through your long break up? I just stopped talking to him after that. He didn't take that well either, and has been kinda mean to me. But I get it, he's hurt. I forgive him and don't hold a grudge against him. 

So, I want to leave on good terms with that person, but I don't know how to go about it. I know we won't be best friends again, but at least I want us to have face to talk to each other if we ever meet again in the future.

I have been close to two of my cousins since¬†I was a child (18-year-old now), and I have asked for help on homework, and my older cousin gladly helped me out, and I was always thankful for that. But throughout the years, I began to see that she would begin to embarrass me about my school work or tell me I do stupid things in front¬†of other people, and she would get really bad at the littlest things. Then two years ago, if I got her mad, she would constantly bring up how she did so much for me because¬†I hung out with her and her sister, and she would pay for my food too. She would always try to prove me wrong and say bad words are talk bad about my parent's in front of me or to me if they pissed her off. We all do the same sport, and I remember just asking a question about something random, and she started raising her voice and telling me how dumb it was, not even saying sorry. I began to realize all this began to get worse up to this day and I told her younger sister how she is mentally abusing me at this point because I would have breakdowns randomly last month. I know she is going through depression, but I don't see it as an excuse. She would be judgmental about everything, even with what I wanted to wear. I was beginning to get scared of her, too, and her opinions. After I told her little sister, she went and told my older cousin¬†(she older sister) and she texted my brother saying I did so mine for your sister, why is she saying messed up shit, she needs to get it together, I've¬†done more than anyone else has for her, etc... Later she texted me ""go fuck yourself, and for the record, you are my bitch, remember that"" and both her sister and her unfollowed me on snap chat and Instagram and I blocked both their numbers and blocked them from my snap chat and Instagram because¬†I realized I don't need these negative people¬†starting off my new year 2020.¬†This happened two days ago, and I was wondering if I did the right thing, all my friends think I did, and I didn't share this with any of my cousins because I don't want to start drama.",25Dec2019,1

742,"I use amino a lot, and recently joined the My Hero Academia Amino. As my favorite character is Kirishima, I created a group chat of other people whose accounts are based off Kirishima. All of the people on the group, including me,are around 13, and all of us live in America except for one, nicknamed Eiji by the rest of the group. We discovered a couple days after creating the chatroom that Eiji is extremely depressed, and we've gotten hints of issues with self-harm and eating disorders. Her mother is mentally unstable and not allowed to live with her, and her dad is cruel and aggressive. She lives in Brazil, and has been mercilessly bullied at school for being a lesbian. I've had to talk her out of suicide twice already, and if she hadn't met us she would probably be dead. We have never met in real life, and we've only known each other for around 3 weeks. She is highly self-deprecating and apologizes for everything. She hates it when people ""worry about her."" All of the other members of the chatroom have various other issues. Our presence appears to have helped Eiji, and she is a lot more stable, so I think things will be okay, but I would still like some advice.  How do I deal with this situation?

745,"The price for two tickets by the way, is 260 dollars (so around 130 dollars for one ticket). This festival however isn't happening until this summer, and I've been thinking of using money I get from student grants, as well as my internship (I go to school three days a week and am at my internship two days a week). I've also been thinking of using my birthday money, as it's very close to the date of the day I'm going to the festival. 

The reason why I want to pay for my cousin is because she is such a special person. She's incredibly ambitious, and sweet. It's like she's my best friend even though I'm not her best friend. But I want to pay for her because I feel like she's probably going to think of me more highly then. And we've never bought each other gifts, we just get money from our aunts when it's our birthdays. I haven't asked her yet, although she went to this festival last summer, so I know there‚Äôs at least a bit of a chance she'll go. Although I have several friends, none of them would want to go to the festival, because of one of these reasons:

1.They're not interested (maybe don't care for music that much or they don't like big crowds).

2.They're too poor for the ticket.

3.They would rather spend money on something else.

I feel like I would  be in a really surrealistic dream to go to this festival with my cousin. I imagine that when/if Pearl Jam play ""Black"", I tell her ""holy shit this is the greatest day of my life"".

So how do I convince my parent's that it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket? Remember that I will make sure I have enough money for two tickets. With money I get from my student grants and my internship, and the fact that the festival isn't until this summer, I will have more than enough money if I save up. (I get about 200$ a month in total from both student grants and my internship)

TL;DR I really want to go to a music festival with my cousin. I haven't asked her yet, but if she says yes I want to pay for her ticket. My parents told me though I can't pay for anyone else. How do I convince them it's OK for me to pay for someone else's ticket?",25Dec2019,1

So as a preface to this, we have been dating for almost 2 years and she's never cheated on me ever before. It's been a great time ever since I met her and she has brought me all kinds of wonderful moments in our lives. 

So then how did it happen? Well, it was actually earlier today...

I was sitting at my house with my brothers and enjoying some good holiday time with them when I get a text from her. She asked me, like she had many times before if I was home. I of course said yes. 

Now this was normal bc this would lead to some different types of conversations than what we have day to day, if you are catching my drift. But this was quite the opposite...

She started texting out this giant paragraph about how she was talking to some really nice people on Discord, and they got her on a BDSM server that she had been wanting to get on. What she forgot to do was block her DMs on this account... So, of course, some horny asshole gets a hold of my sub girlfriend...

Later he tells her to get into a VC with him and what ends up happening is that he forces her to show him her boobs... Now this would be something that most people could get out of, but as of the past few days she had been sexually frustrated and, well here we are. 

She immediately logged off and deleted the account after they hung up on the call because she had realised what she had done... She immediately told me all of it and was sobbing... 

After she was done with the paragraph, I just said ""I need some time to think"". What I didn't tell her was how mad I was.

Not even 2 hours prior we were talking about how much we loved each other and how much we cared about each other... And then she broke all of my trust... 

I've promised her I'm giving her another shot, but that she will have to take a LONG time to earn my trust... And she was going to come over tomorrow and I wanted to tell her to not and let me think but since my parents rarely see her at all they were really looking forward to seeing her again... I just don't know what to do... 

Do I forgive? Do I punish her? I just really am awestruck with what to do right now...",25Dec2019,1

This was the first time i saw and and me being the anxious depressed scared rek i am did not feel safe. I voiced my concerns to my mom (who i love and adore) but she says this is normal. I highly doubt that.

TL:DR she is against drugs and moralises too much, and blackmailed me to tell my parents (who are 100% against drugs) or she'd do it herself.

Earlier today, I found out that she snooped in my Reddit account and looked through my posts, read more about my personal stuff and other secrets that no one knows about. She then confronted me about it and explicitly threatened me to do it or ""she'd do it herself"", thinking that she was helping my 'addiction problem'. This sent me into a panic attack, and my parents got involved in the argument trying to understand what was going on. My sister didn't say anything about my secret and the argument focused on how she had no respect for my privacy, something which my mom had my back for. As it continued, she got pissed at me because she felt entitled to expose me for trying out the drug and lunged at me, to which my mom stopped the conflict, and after talking with my dad and me, they decided to talk to her. 

They have just finished, and my mom told me that she will keep my privacy intact and tell them nothing. My parents know nothing of my experience, but I am still very panicky about the whole situation. 

My sister very much believes that she's not in the wrong for blackmailing me and I'm afraid that in a few months she will threaten me to do it again or actually tell my parents about it.

Sorry for formatting I‚Äôm on mobile.

My dad has always been... how shall I say. Lazy. I love him dearly but he‚Äôs been doing things that have been causing me stress and I‚Äôve started to see him as not even a dad anymore. I guess to give good advice I may as well give a lot of context.

Ever since I was a kid he‚Äôs been drinking at least a beer everyday, waking up at 2pm at the earliest I believe, he even smoked when most of us have asthma (which he said he‚Äôd quit), and kept getting fired from his jobs causing us to have to move out of our house and live with his parents for about 6 months. During those months my parents divorced and I took it as any kid would, I was sad, but I have over come it. When my mom, my sister, and I moved into the house we are now, my dad stayed with his parents, then moved in with a girlfriend. Me and my sister would go over every other weekend but we always hated it. He played music til 1 in the morning, we rarely ate together, and the place was filthy (not like hoarders but almost there). After awhile my dad broke up with his girlfriend and moved back with his parents. My grandparents were ex-cat-breeders and had many cats with them, and my dad was asked to at least feed them and scoop their litter boxes. He didn‚Äôt. And he was smoking in the house as well... he then moved in with my aunt (amazing woman by the way) and cousins (there are two) and he hasn‚Äôt been getting any better. I had thought he had stopped smoking and would be at least getting a job but it wasn‚Äôt to be. Awhile ago I was with my cousin and my dad was there. As I left to see a production my other cousin was in, I hugged him and he smelled like smoke. I had a mental breakdown in the lobby of the place the performance was in. My cousin comforted me until my mom got there to help me. 

That‚Äôs when a realized I didn‚Äôt see him as a dad anymore. He wasn‚Äôt a dependable figure to help me with things. He was just a broke middle aged man who only worked on his passion projects. A few days or so later I had finals and I got a text from him out of the blue saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. No context. I started crying and feeling guilty all over again. I asked mom if he was okay and if she told him how I felt. She said she didn‚Äôt tell him much but only ‚Äúthe girls are fragile and feel upset with your situation‚Äù. Yup. He sent more texts asking if what she said was true but my sister said to not talk to us during finals. Now it‚Äôs Christmas and I feel guilty for feeling like the man who helped create me is not a reliable figure to look to.

so for some backstory I'm 14 and living in New York and as this would say my living space is well small . In our apartment there is two bedrooms , one bathroom , a living space and a kitchen. My  sister and I have lived two different lives for me I was pretty quiet and shy as a kid and I didn't have alot of friends since I didnt socially interact with people since I didnt know how too , I struggled alot because of my AHDH and ADD , but none the less I did well in school minus math ( look at my first reddit post to see how BAD I was and still am )  . 

 I had littlest pet shops which are a kinda like polly pockets bobble head toys and I was obsessed none the less until I reached middle school which I grew out of it and began to write &amp; act . But when I was in the fifth grade I got this [this LPS airplane ](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/16020746956399528448?q=lps+airplane&amp;client=ms-android-tmus-us-revc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=617&amp;tbs=vw:g,ss:44&amp;prmd=svin&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQ8sw22FJh1Is-uVVLHYFiLrEVXwA:1577315305937&amp;prds=epd:15353527550872066038,paur:ClkAsKraX2juv2KsGjP2hfwNthjxKKpTY0MIQK0BrjtQNtM5LIG1nOJL_C0Rn2AjQ-BxFWVu7GT9Iot1ixEN_zZujKeux3Le1PLZjxmhLTqhVGhGhz-KSODJ-BIZAFPVH73yevft7RcgS44T6bPk1G6TnoHIjA,cdl:1,prmr:1,cs:1) and I loved it but in that year I was doing horrible in math and one night while I was in the shower my parents took all of the toys and that airplane and put them in some random ass area and I didn't see it until  the summer which was completely destroyed and most of the pieces where missing or bent in a way where I couldn'tuse them .

my sister on the other hand is seven and is in the nicest way stupid she doesn't know how to read as good as shes supposed too and my parents are doing nothing to help they instead give her more toys , let her play all day when she's supposed to be reading , making messes and not cleaning it up . Now when I was seven I  couldn't even play until six and then at six thirty I had to go to sleep  now my sister is staying up till ten playing when I have to sleep since I started freshman year of high school and get home at four pm .

762,"I have this very stupid quality that makes it so whenever I hear or see something noteworthy happen, I try to intervene. It‚Äôs anywhere from stopping 2 homeless people fighting, to confronting some random guy loudly because I saw him take a picture of a girl dancing under her skirt. I even one time was very drunk, saw a girl chasing and yelling at a guy, and then started chasing him without having ANY idea of what the scenario was. My instincts just make me do it. I ended up keeping up with the guy, bumped him into a traffic cone, and then following him until he stopped running saying ‚ÄúI just want to know why you‚Äôre running.‚Äù The police came and saw he was bloody, and checked my hands to see if I had blood on them (thank god I didn‚Äôt because I could have been arrested right then and there).

763,"Hi all. I have an interview tomorrow and just wanted some advice on how to professionally phrase my response to the dreaded ‚Äúwhat is your greatest weakness‚Äù question if it‚Äôs asked. Also some input on the questions I have for the interviewer if you all don‚Äôt mind. 

Weakness:

So I know I want my answer to be one that is self aware, and how I am proactive in working on turning this weakness into a strength. I just can‚Äôt find the proper words. Basically, my weakness is I have trouble separating feelings from business. I‚Äôm very empathetic. If somebody is angry, or upset, while I maintain professionalism, it‚Äôs hard for me not to take words and actions to heart. Having a heavy customer service background, I always try to channel that empathy into the situation and both focus on the human behind the issue, and imagine myself in their shoes, so that it helps alleviate the offense I may take from their words/actions. 

I don‚Äôt want to totally word it like it‚Äôs a humble brag, as this really is a weakness of mine I‚Äôve always had despite always working in customer service roles. How can I better phrase the way I am proactive about this so I can do my job better?


Questions:

These are questions I‚Äôm asking because I genuinely want to know, but I want to be sure they‚Äôre professional, you know?

1. What does a typical day look like for someone in this role?

2. Can you describe what the work culture is like here? (This is the most important to me, as this is the main reason I want to leave my toxic job)

3. Can you elaborate more on the part of the job description that says I should ‚Äúbe able to deal with emergencies effectively‚Äù? (Some insight: this is a receptionist/administrative assistant position at a collision center. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what kind of emergencies there would be at a collision center/body shop)

Are any of these unprofessional, and/or should I rephrase these in any way?


Thanks so much in advance!!",25Dec2019,1
764,"I‚Äôve been in a relationship for over 2 years, and it‚Äôs going... meh. I thought I was going to marry him, but we‚Äôve had some problems and I lost interest and attraction.

Here's a description of me(to get a picture):
I'm 15 now and I'm a male. 5'8 and 157.2lbs. I'm not very strong but I can help. I'm lightskin mix between Mexican and white. My hair is darkbrown but visibly brown it's also curly but straight(if that makes sense) and blocks my eyes. I have it cut on the sides and the back to have it stylish. My eyes are also dark brown. My face is clean of acne except in my upper left corner of my hairline (two small bumps). My foot size(I'm also concerned about) is 11/5.

More about me: I have hobbies(?). Which one is landscaping, I work mainly two jobs and bales are $3.40-$4.15 each and make $200-$600 a job and pay 1-2/4 of it back. I like to sketch a draw and started making it public to my art teacher. I like to wear long sleeve shirts of all brands but usually merched by music artists named guardin, sewerperson, convolk and sadeyes. Hoodies are my main though. I like to wear slim joggers and only air force 1's. 

Here's where the problem comes in. Now I have been diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD, early bipolar depression, and mild dementia. And that's been ruining my self image and I don't think I'm normal. I'm pretty sure I'm being deceived by the few friends I have. They tell me I look great but my family says different. They don't like the way I dress or how I have my hair, they think I'm emo. I feel bad about myself and been pushing to try and change the way I think but my family holds me back. Now because of that I ruin a lot of potential relationships with some girls I care for deeply. I usually ruin our friendship aswell because I don't say the right things. It hurts me the deepest. I don't want to be alone but I feel a lot better when I am. At school I am teased because I have very feminine lips, I guess it's because I do lick them a lot and there are sort of kinda big and pink. I feel like I'm seen as a diva. So I just want to know how to deal with this. I'm turned away and friends just take it as a joke.",25Dec2019,1

I told her I don't like it but she's like, ""SO WHAT???!!!"" or ""THIS IS MY HOUSE I DO WHAT I WANT!!!"" even though she doesn't even pay the bills. My dad does and she treats him like shit too. My dad is pretty nice and he treats us very well. But he works so hard as a truck driver so he's barely home. But when he is, Mom doesn't tell as much. I tried telling him how I feel but he says I just have to get used to it because she'll never change not even for him since she has a mindset of ""I'm always right."" My sister has become that person for mom to ""vent"" to. She just yells at her most of the time making herself the victim. She has 2 grandsons that she favorites over us. She calls them her ""kings"" and gives them whatever they want when they want when I asked what Kassidy and I were to her, she told me to shut up. I've gotten much bigger since I lived here last so she's scared of me but really, I should be scared of her and her lies. So she's used that to continuously say I'm ""threatening"" her and that's she'll call the cops on me for threatening to hurt her even though I just want to talk. I've never laid a hand against her except that one time I threw an HDMI cable at her and she made a big deal about it. My sister hates it too but she's too scared to leave. She's 2 years younger then me and we are very close. It's gotten so bad my sister has become desensitized to it. The reason why she won't leave is because we have 4 cats and she's scared that if we leave, mom will throw them away. Mom is constantly threatening to send me back to welfare and I hate that. I asked my sister if I went back to welfare, would she come with me, but she said no because of the cats. I hate the state we're living in and I can never talk to mom about how she treats us but it always comes back to ""She's threatening me!"" And ""She's scaring me! What if she hits me?!""

I got a new rather expensive smartphone for Christmas, and as I was unpacking it I noticed two tiny but visible scratches on the touchscreen.  also the folia on the back had some bubbles on it. the warranty seal on the box seemingly hasn't been tampered with but there were 2 seals on top of each other so I can't tell if the first one had been broken already.
all in all i just had the feeling it has at least been opened before and that makes me kind of worried there could be anything wrong with it. 
I bought it through Amazon so returning it shouldn't be too much of a big deal. and I just saw that today the phone costs about 100 $ less than what the gifter  originally pages if I buy it on Amazon again. I just feel really bad about returning it because the two scratches are teeny tiny and nothing that bothers me personally. it's more that it bothers me that it's seemingly not ""new"" if I payed for a new one. as I am planing on keeping this phone for several years I want a good quality, perfect condition phone to begin with, but also I feel stupid for returning it over what seems to be cosmetic flaws that would eventually get there anyways within the next week's. so is it morally (and legaly) okay to return it?

She believes that girl A claimed this because ""girl A doesn't want me to be associated with you guys, of course she would say that"". Do you think either of us have a point, or are both girl B and I totally overreacting?",25Dec2019,1
