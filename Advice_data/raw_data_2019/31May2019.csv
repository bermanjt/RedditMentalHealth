4,"I’m only 16 and I hate the French program at high school, because it gives you less electives and you can’t spend time with friends in English program.

The only foreseeable benefit is a bilingual diploma, but I want to know how useful it actually is. I don’t plan on being a politician, and I don’t live in Quebec. I can still speak English and French well but I want to know if these 2 more years are actually worth it compared to the same marks in English only",31May2019,1
5,"This may sound like a doozy but im at a crossroads. I joined the military at 18, got out at 19 when i ran into a lot of trouble with high command in confronting them about bullying the autistic civilians. basically made my life a living hell and no one to go to as this was right in front of the captains glass office.  
I'm trying to get back into the armed service, I was young then, and have done quite a bit of growing since then, but the problem is its hard to join up in the same branch as im already rated with them and an E-1 rank.   
I could possibly get in to the same branch, slimish chance but possible in practice, or would it be easier to join an entirely new branch?

7,"So... I’m in a situation that has me feeling incredibly useless right now. I feel like I honestly might cry writing this but here’s what I got.

This situation, this wonderful little situation I got myself into. A while back I say about 3 or 4 months ago a good friend of mine gotten broken up with, and I understood him I was going through the same thing at the time... well he moves back to his home town in Florida and one day I really needed a cigarette and I had spent all my money fixing my truck and all of a sudden his ex (who also was a friend of mine) asked me to come smoke a cigarette with her and this was fine with me all it was literally was me going to smoke anyways some weeks pass of us just sitting in my truck outside her house just smoking and I kept promising myself don’t fucking catch feelings, don’t fucking catch feelings.... so in the next week or so my bud came back up from Florida to watch graduation for the local highschool and at this point I caught what I promised I wasn’t going to catch, reason being when I would sit there with her we’d just listen to music and sing and it was calm... I haven’t had calm in my life ever since my ex who I dated for 5 years ended it with me... but that’s besides the point... I’ve just never been so calm with a female for months... well I’m at six flags with my best friend his gf, this girl I’m on about, and her ex, and they sleep together, they sit together all that, and I’m slowly ripping myself apart on the inside racking my brain on how she does it, how does one minute when he’s not around she forgets about him, but when he’s around it’s like I’m not, and she even told me she’s in a state of confusing between him and I and I understand that but damn you know it’s killing me, and now they’re talking about working it out, even after he’s cheated on her, argues with her every moment he gets, or like recently he was trying to “talk to her” and was getting to close to her and she got up and walked out, he chased her so she ran in the bathroom and locked the door (I was on the way to pick her up to take her home) and the moment I walked in the house he had gotten the door open but he stopped when I walked in... either way enough of the stories because I’m typing too much and no one will want to read this, 

I’m really just crying out for help",31May2019,0
8,"Within the last week in our neighborhood, there's been a lot of break-ins and I believe two car thefts. It's generally a good neighborhood, but our neighbors on both of us have been broken in to. It's freaking me out. My parents said we'll probably buy some sort of camera, but I was wondering if anyone has any other words of advice. The neighbors to the left of us caught a group of three men on camera, but they don't know who they are. According to my friend, one of them has been caught, but I don't know how accurate that is. Also, what are the chances that they hit the two houses on either side of us and then us? Should I be worried?",31May2019,1
9," I am an 22 year old Asian American male who has mostly been cultured in typical Asian things. I've hung out with mostly Asians all my life who shared similar interests to me. I am a stereotypical Asian that enjoys videos games, anime, asian food, and tennis. I can crack jokes and meme about things related to these topics, but I've quickly realized that these interests don't align with a majority of people around my age group, especially those that aren't of my ethnicity. Along with that, I lack experience to really delve into topics that they're interested in. People my age have moved on and are more talking about traveling, clubs, different drinks at bars, new movies at the theaters, shows like Game of Thrones, etc. Sure I have some interest in these, but I lack the experience/knowledge to really be able to delve into conversation about such topics. For example, I've only traveled to Vancouver and a few states in the US, I didn't know what Marvel really was until Infinity Wars, and I haven't watched any of the popular shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Friends, The Office. Nor have I tried many foods that aren't Asian or know much about the big sports like basketball and football. I feel like I just have nothing to talk about with anyone anymore. Going into graduate school and being with a diverse group of people of various ethnicity and ages is where I truly realized how different I am from everyone else. I made some small talk but never gotten into anything deeper to really call my classmates more than just ""acquaintances"" because we didn't share common interests. I only have a few friends and those are the people from undergrad/high school that have the interests that I have and they are mostly now far away from where I live. Even they have these ""older adult"" interests and when they talk about them I stay silent since I can't relate. How do I interact with people if I don't have anything I can talk about or contribute to a conversation? In school, we are being paired up as ""buddies"" with students from the next upcoming class and are going to have lunch and grab light drinks to meet them and I am freaking out that it's going to be awkward and I'm going to bore them. Any help would be appreciated!",31May2019,1
10,"I'm in the process of moving back with my parents. It's been a bit of a back and forth thing for a bit. A little back story:
I'm 22 [F] and I've been dating a 42 y/o [M] for a little over a year now. I met him online, and we hit it off. We exchanged numbers, met up once in the town we live in, and I ghosted him because I was nervous he would want to date me and I wasn't ready yet.
So fast forward a few months, we start talking again and he wants to take me on a trip. My parents have no idea who I'm talking to, and they're 49 &amp; 54, so kinda close to his age. I initially lied and said I was dating a 32 y/o to make them less upset and I figured it would be awhile before he met them and I could tell them the truth.
Well my mom is freaking out and telling my family I'm with an older man and she's worried about me, but I wish she would have just kept it to herself or to my father. 
I lie again and tell them I'm going to Santa Cruz with my coworkers and that I'll be back in 3 days. They accept it at face value and dont ask more questions bc I had my coworkers on board with the whole thing. So I leave for a few days, have a great trip, and go home.
Now we're getting serious-ish.. he wants me to spend his weekends off with him, meaning he wanted me to let go of one of my days of work. He said he would compensate me for it since he was asking me to do it and I didn't have to so I accepted because it made the work week easier on me.
My parents are furious. Saying I'm ruining my schedule and it's going to fuck me up bc they'll take more time away from me and I just told them that I was an adult and I am allowed to do as I please. I continue to see him, as by this point I've fallen in love with him, but I still haven't told them he's 42.
This is where it gets intense.
I go to work one day to close my job, and I'm about 2 hours in, when I notice my car is being driven away. I'm freaking out and my manager asks me if I need to call the cops. I tell him no I just need to call my mom. There's a message on my phone saying ""text me when you get off I'll pick you up"" so I call her in the bathroom of my job and I'm crying hysterically, asking her ""why did you take my car? What did I do to you?"" And she says ""well I'm not gonna let you manipulate me like he manipulates you!"" And hangs up. 
I call my boyfriend who was at work at the time and I tell him I dont want to go home. He sends me money for a cab to get to his place bc I didnt have much money and tells me we'll get my stuff in the morning.
We go over there the following morning and I bring boxes in and start boxing up my stuff. I get about 6 boxes (what fit in his car) of what I super needed and then I get out of the house. My mom is crying. My dad is mad. For some reason my brother who moved out spent the night so he was there too. And I was just so angry at all of them.
We stayed in a hotel for a month while we looked for a house and when we finally got it, we moved right in.
It's an amazing 4 bedroom 2.5 bathroom house and I love it. My parents didnt know where we lived for privacy purposes for awhile. Then I needed some help and I called on my mom (mistake) and she  came over. Sometimes if I went over to their house and it was super I would let her take me back home bc the Ubers were expensive, but I should have never.
My boyfriend and I ended up having some issues and I moved back out pretty suddenly. My parents were glad to have me back and I was allowed to use the car I put a downpayment on again. It was fine for a couple of weeks until I texted my ex about getting the last box I left in the bathroom and him telling me to come by and get it. I thought it was just going to be on the porch but he was outside with it in hand. I had to force back the tears from missing him even though I had been trying to move on and he got me to hug him, he led me inside, and we talked until we fell asleep. I woke up to calls from my mother asking where I was, panicked. I told her I was with a girlfriend in the next town over and I'd be home in 30 minutes. I left the box in the back of my car and went home.
The next day I asked if I could spend the night so we could get dinner and maybe talk things out, maybe work it out and be better than friends or whatever. 
I go over there and we watch a movie before we head off to dinner. He opens the garage door and my mom is there. I am freaking out. He didn't know she knew where he lived so naturally he was kinda mad at me. She wants to talk to me and I just tell her shes being embarrassing and she has no idea what shes doing here or what's going on. She asserts that she knows what's happening and shes disappointed in me. She takes my car keys again and leaves.
The next morning I get a call from my dad asking when I would be home. I told him I would be home in a couple of hours. End call. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
10 minutes later I get a call from my mother, saying ""you made a choice, you're moving back in with him and were taking your stuff to you. We'll put your boxes on the lawn"" and hangs up. I'm fucking stunned. She apparently hates this guy and thinks he treats me not well so why did she make me move back in with him?
Well now it's been a month that I've been back and I was allowed to use my car for a few days a couple weeks ago to see my ailing grandpa but then we had to get something fixed on it so I didn't have it again for 5 days. I go to see my parents and notice that the car is back and they haven't told me I can use it. So I just leave it alone. 
Later that night I get into an argument with my mother about something she did that ended up fucking up my night and my stuff I needed there was at my brother's apartment. I leave about 20 minutes after the fight and she calls me an hour later, in tears, saying ""well since you got upset with me over your stuff being at your brothers house I went to go get it and I got in an accident [in your car] and so now we're gonna fix it and sell it""  car is totaled.
So now I have no car.
My boyfriend and I are having problems again but I feel wary going back to my parents. It's just so much mental abuse. Now I dont have a car and they want me to get a job. It makes no sense. She shouldn't have been driving, and I still dont understand how it's my fault.
Do I go back? Should I just stay here and have him help me find a job and a car myself? I dont even like my parents right now. I resent them.",31May2019,1
12,"I (28) have always had the fantasy to try a swingers club. It's not really to do a lot of weird stuff with a lot of people. Firstly I think it would spice up our sexlife (we've been together for about 4 years), and secondly I just really enjoy sex and think it would be fun to do it in a place where you can be totally open with other people also just enjoying themselves.
I know I'm more ""active"" and have a higher ""drive"" than my bf, but I think he would also have fun there.
But before now I have never tried to bring up the idea, it always seemed a bit to ""extrem"".
Tonight I finally tried bringing it up, but he just laughed and thought I was making a joke, because of course I must know he would never do such a thing (his words) and that kind of made me stop talking about it.

Now I'm afraid that if I'm bringing it up again, I'm going to say something wrong and make him feel like he's not enough or good enough for me (he is a bit insecure about not being enough for me in general and can be jaloux at times) and that is really not it! I just find the idea really sexy and would love for us to try it out together.

How do I talk to him about this, without making him feel insecure? Or should I maybe just drop it and accept that this is a fantasy and nothing more?

14,"Hey Reddit, I am a gamer. Love to play them! However, at times I feel guilty playing them--that I need to be doing something more productive. I think of a good friend of mine who is into building stuff. He sends me pictures all the time of instruments he has made or a bike powered by laptop batteries! I have another friend who writes stories and builds universes. Both enjoy their activities and have something to show for it at the end of the day. For video games, however, you have a save file.

16,"I started contact with this person on kik in about 7th grade in a groupchat. I am lost on memory on how our contact kept going, but it's not that important.  Freshman year of high school came along and they added me on SnapChat. This isn't a story where I'm the completely innocent victim here but hear me out please. I was very stupid at that time and posted my nude pictures on social media (I'm a male btw, and so is the stalker.) The person then asked if I would give them nude pictures in exchange for visa gift cards. I stupidly obliged and turned a nice profit. I kept contact with this person and kept making deals until I realized they made a fake account acting like a girl and catfishing people from my school (and my friend's 7th grade little brother.) I then cut off all contact and realized how sick and twisted this individual really is. For some background I'm a teenager and so is the stalker. We both live in the same state but about 4 hours apart. Then the stalker proceeded to send my nude pictures to my mother, father, and brother on facebook, acting like a concerned parent saying that ""My daughter received these photos from your son blah blah blah."" Thank god my brother let me know first and then several awkward conversations pursued.  What really got to me though was when they sent an anonymous email to my school playing the same act as a concerned (anonymous) parent, saying that I was sending nude pictures to students at the school. At this point I stopped all my stupid behavior of posting my nudes so I knew exactly what had happened. It ended up almost getting me and my girlfriend in extreme trouble with the school, and no offer to help with my situation (even though I don't think there is much to be done.) He then made a fake snapchat impersonating me and wreaking havoc on my character by messaging many people from my school and almost getting me in an actually dangerous situation.

&amp;#x200B;

After this ordeal I did my own online snooping and have now found his High school, his address, his name, instagram account, his mother's name, his mother's phone number,and his friend's instagram and phone number (Even though she might be in on it.)

My question is, what can I do? it doesn't seem like something that it would be possible to go to the police about based on the sending nude pics, vigilante justice maybe, but any advice on handling this situation is welcome, thank you so much.

18,"This isn't exactly asking for advice, but it most definitely belongs here. This is something that seriously bothers me and has for a really long time because it's so bloody transparent. An example of someone ""roleplaying"" on Reddit is if say, someone posted on /r/advice that their 16 year old daughter got pregnant from a 30 something year old man but in reality OP is just a 15 year old boy trying to get reactions out of people. And the worst part? They do, they get thousands upon thousands of comments and usually make it to the front page. And every single poster in the thread will take OP super seriously and get extremely pissed at anyone who suggests the post isn't real. It's really obvious which posts on Reddit are real and aren't real (Or at least which ones aren't insultingly fake and stupid). 

Also I know a lot about this because when I was a kid I used to spend hours with my friends creating fake drama posts on forums (Reddit wasn't really a thing when I was a kid) getting thousands of supportive responses to a scenario that was not real or relatable at all. 

Just know if you reply to a serious post on advice, there is a 90% chance it's either not real or it's heavily exaggerated by some stupid kid, if a post seems like it was created just to incite controversy or argumentative discussion (Taboo subjects being brought up mixed with scenarios in OP's post that are just unbelievable) then it's probably fake as hell. The fact that a lot of these subreddits promote ""giving OP the benefit of the doubt"" is absurdly annoying too.",31May2019,0
19,So back story so im 18 and I work/used to work at a gym I like the job my co’s are nice my boss is nice but I couldn’t get 40 hours so I told my boss I can cover for peeps on weekend for summer occasionally (cuz I wanna go back in fall I’m going to community college) and I gonna work at my dads shop in the summer. I don’t dislike the job with my Dad but I like the gym way better. I’m taking an online class that starts in a few weeks to get my college career going. So my parents want me to cut my hours a bit.

21,"Technically I have already committed to a grad school in the US. It's a top 40(I think? Not sure on ranking but it's an excellent school) school and an excellent choice for the program. I'd be all but guaranteed a job when I graduate. The program is more in the STEM end of things. 

I have less than 24 hours to change my mind (maybe longer, but I'm putting it at noon tomorrow personally). I was also accepted into a great master's program in Europe. This is something in the humanities. I would need a PhD and I'm ok with that because I'd rather be a professor in this field, but I'm scared of not getting a job. I've also always wanted to study abroad and/or live abroad and never done it. Furthermore, I only have US citizenship.

How do I choose between something that's a good career choice and I'm not sure if I'd like (but I'm confident I can do) and something I love and I'm not sure if I'd succeed in, solely because the field has so few opportunities?",31May2019,1
22,"Some background: Originally I was friends with this girl up until around last month since last mid-June. We would text nearly everyday up until February. It slowed down after but we still dm’d and texted each other. We had already hung out about 4-5 times from when we had started being friends in June. Anyways, I got into some argument with her last month and she forced me to meet her in person to admit my feelings for her (that I like her more than a friend). So I did and it’s mutual. We started making more of an effort to see each other after school even if it’s for just 10 mins. We’ve also upped the flirting over text and social media a bit (We haven’t explicitly said we’re dating or anything yet to each other but the feelings for each other are definitely there) Anyways, on Saturday we went to a big park to hang out and we ended up making out in forested area for the first time. The rest of the hangout ended up going well and that was that. So yesterday I told her to meet me in person so we could speak in person about something and we ended up getting into a discussion and her telling me how she “doesn’t want me to get the wrong idea” and she “doesn’t want any labels” and she’s “scared of commitment” and I said yea i agree we’re not bf and gf yet but in the future i may want that. I don’t know if she was on the same page with the second part but despite that, she did say that doesn’t mean she’d be going to go around talking to other guys (which I believe because she’s not that type) So I just told her to be honest with me and to just tell me if that was it and if we should stop now if she doesn’t foresee a future as I do and she was just like “i dont really know” 

I don’t know what to do about her or what to tell her at this point. I wanna give her time to think about it but she’s the type to completely forget about you and not text you for days on end so idk if i should text her something but let me tell you she’s SO. DAMN. DIFFICULT. to get answers from or get a point across to her over text. I really do like this girl though, she’s so perfect for me and she’s so worth it and I don’t want to be quick to throw everything away of months of getting to know her but at the same time I hate waiting so long for someone. It makes me feel like they dont care and i care so much more.

After that she was like ohhh your the guy that asked that one question. After that it was a decent convo.

That happened last week. So I thought she was kinda cool and I was going to make an effort to try to get to know them better. 

Now this week Tuesday we sat kinda far so that’s that. Thursday I decided sit around her area to see if wanted to interact to talk or whatever.

Anyways I’ve noticed that at the end of class she just sits in her chair unlike everyone that just trying to get the fuck out of the lecture hall.

The university I want to attend offers a guaranteed entrance scholarship of $8000 if your average is between 90-94% which is what I am supposed to be getting. However, what I didn’t know is that if you take a gap year you don’t qualify for the scholarship. I haven’t applied to the university yet so my only option to still receive the money is to go back to high school for a full year. I despise my high school and I’ve been miserable ever since going there, so graduating is the one thing I’ve been looking forward to and there’s nothing I want less than to ever go back there. The problem is I’m broke and have zero savings so I NEED the money, especially since I won’t get to keep a significant portion of my OSAP money (what the government gives me for school). I don’t know what to do. Should I go back to high school even though it makes me absolutely miserable or should I skip out on the scholarship despite needing the money?

33,"I am getting married! I'm thrilled to say I'm engaged to my fiance, and we are very much in love. Then why am I posting to reddit, you ask? well, to be completely blunt about it.....I do not give a shit about the wedding. 

I am excited to be married, and I understand the importance of the event. It's a traditional ceremony and I will be happy to have it, but there are so many aspects of it that I think are stupid and wasteful, especially as a young couple with goals of buying a house and having kids one day. 

I can fully admit that the main stressor here for me is money. We are getting some money from her dad, but it's not a substantial amount and certainly wont cover the entire cost of the wedding. For this reason, I think it would be entirely foolish for us to go into debt for the wedding. I also think spending money on flowers, colored decorations, and other aesthetic elements is a waste and doesnt add anything to the wedding. My ideal wedding is a gathering of the people I love watching us get married and celebrating with us, so I dont see the point in all of that.

I talked with my dad about this and he told me that basically I need to get over it and realize the wedding really isnt for me, it's for her. She has been dreaming of this since she was young, and I need to compromise (doesnt feel like much of a compromise) and give her the wedding she deserves. I guess if I were to boil it down, I would rather she doesnt have the best wedding in the world, but has the chance to retire with confidence when we're older from the good financial decisions we've made. I can definitely admit to being frugal, but I guess I just dont see why that's a bad thing. 

Im looking for some advice, hopefully from others who may have shared my point of view and found ways to accept the situation and still enjoy it. My ultimate goal here is to be happy on my wedding day and not regret anything. 

Tl;DR: getting married, feel like a lot of aspects of the wedding are a waste of money. Fiance wants nice wedding, disagrees. seeking compromise.",31May2019,1
34,"So my friend got a sugar daddy she met on this website that’s specifically for finding that. She told me she needs her bills paid and I’m not gonna lie, I thought it was gross she was willing to go that far but I wasn’t gonna tell her that. I just told her to be careful. She used her friends pics on the website and is using a text free app to text him and basically playing it ‘safe’. But not too safe cause she straight up gave him her bank account and he supposingly put 3k to pay her credit card with a check deposit. She said she changed her info right away after that. Won’t the bank ask where that money came from? I know it takes 10 days to officially clear so I’ll see if it worked. Then he asked her today and THEY BARELY TALKED 2 DAYS AGO, (I guess he lives in New York and is working in Canada right now?) if she can go to Walmart and pay with her credit card gift cards so he can give them to his co workers as gifts. And he would pay them back. If he’s a millionaire why can’t he buy them ? The thing is if he’s a ‘millionaire’ (and I’m not saying none shop there) why would he buy those? And aren’t there Walmart’s in Canada? Idk... does this sound too good to be true? She said she’s trying to get 3k more out of him and then is gonna block him, and I told her karma is real. What does this sound like?",31May2019,2
35,"I (17f) recently found out that a guy from my school (17m) is interested in me. I really want to get to know him better, because while that initial attraction is there for me too I just don’t know him too well. Problem is: we’re too shy and awkward to talk much to each other. We share a few classes and quite a few mutual friends. Last week we went to a concert with said mutual friends and we wound up being able to talk one-on-one a little then, but the conversation soon died down as we were both pretty nervous. Any advice on how I should start a conversation and keep it going? (Side note: we both are terrible texters and so texting/Snapchat/dms are sorta out of the question.)",31May2019,1
36,"So some context. I live alone with my one year old cat in a small house that I'm renting that has exactly two doors: the front door and the bathroom door. I also work third shift and so I have to sleep during the day, usually somewhere between 8 am and 7 pm, depending on when I fall asleep and when I want/need to wake up.

With this out of the way, I've been living alone with my cat for a couple weeks now. Before this, we lived with one of my grandparents. In that house, I had a door on my bedroom to keep her out when I needed to sleep and she had other animals/people to interact with. Now that we're alone, she will not leave me alone.

If this cat isn't tearing around the house or trying to dig her claws into me, she's pulling back my curtains to blind me or meowing loudly in my ears. It seems like no matter how much I play with her, whether it's thirty minutes or a couple hours, she's never tired. I've had to lock her in the bathroom a couple times but I feel horrendous after doing so, because this cat is like my child. However, her constantly forcing me awake while I'm trying to sleep is starting to affect my health and how well I work at my job.

Does anyone know how I could get her to leave me alone more?",31May2019,2
39,"We moved into a new house and my parents bought a grand piano for the living room. It was pretty expensive. 

It's been a few months and my parents are upset at the fact that the piano is sitting there like a furniture piece, and that when I'm at home I'm either in front of my computer or phone. I find it a bit ridiculous how my parents think I'm going to magically want to develop piano playing as a hobby just because they bought one. 

Neither of them know how to play so they can't teach me. 

The most I've done with the piano was taking a photo then uploading it onto my story after my dad assembled it. 

However, the problem is that I have never played the piano in my life nor expressed interest in doing so. It just seems way too hard to master at this point.  I'm a 20 year old whose taking math classes in hopes of getting into business school one day, which is my main focus right now.

Sure, if I really wanted to learn I could go on Youtube or use the internet. In general with enough determination anyone could learn anything online, but to prevent undetected mistakes that could turn into bad habits, it would be better to get an in-person tutor, however my parents find it too 'expensive and bothersome'.

Are they really wrong for constantly expressing disappointment in me when they basically put no effort in playing the piano themselves or getting a personal tutor or lessons for me?",31May2019,1

41,"Half the time I’m at the register and the other half I’m on the floor guest servicing customers. At least once a day I get overwhelmed with panic at work. This mostly happens when I’m on the register. I get triggered when the line gets more than 3 people, when a transaction goes wrong, when people are watching me color match foundation, people walking into the store when we’re already busy or (worst of all) when I’m ringing up a man.

Not very many men shop here considering we’re a cosmetic retail store. I don’t know what it is but i just get so spooked when I have to ring one up. This sounds so stupid but especially if hes attractive I start panicking. I start shaking (I know they notice), my breathing is short so I sound out of breath, my hearts pounding so bad you can see my name tag on my chest moving. I can get like this for anyone but it’s always like this for men. I don’t know why this is such a trigger for me. 

I don’t know if anyone can relate to that specifically but I just need help with the anxiety I get at work. The shaking is so obvious and it takes me awhile to calm down when I’m getting customers back to back. I want to be a fearless woman, be able to make better eye contact and communication skills.  I probably look like a wreck.

42,"As the title states, my ex won't stop trying to contact me. We broke up a little over a week ago after being in a long distance relationship for a little over a year. Right after we broke up, he tried to get me grounded and break the trust between me and my parents to ruin my relationship with them. Since then, I have blocked him on all platforms and social media because he won't stop trying to contact me. I blocked his number because he would obsessively call me constantly to try to talk to me. I made it clear that I don't want to hear from him. Even though I blocked his number, he still can leave voicemails. He sent me one today that just made my blood boil. He stated that I've really hurt him by ghosting him, tried to justify what he did by saying that since he's bipolar, he can't control anything he does and that I should have responded differently and taken responsibility. He expects me to apologize and come back, but I refuse to. I don't want to open any forms of communication out of fear of what he could do. Whenever we fought in the past, he'd say awful things to me, then try to justify them by saying that I know he doesn't mean anything he says when he's angry. In one of the voicemails, he told me that he overdosed, so I had my parents call his dad. Turns out he didn't do anything and was fine. If this doesn't show the lengths he's going to try and get me to talk to him, I don't know what does.

How can I get him to stop contacting me and get past this without opening communication? There's a little more context about our past relationship in my post history if more context is needed.",31May2019,1
43,"So I successfully changed careers :) it took 3 years, and was pretty rough. Everything seemed like it had been this teetering mess that caved at once-family, work, and my ex fiance. I’d chosen a job I didn’t exactly like to be close to a family I felt guilty about and finally decided I could make happy/didn’t want in my life anymore, and my ex (to be fair she had some real problems, and I shouldn’t of proposed. I knew she had problems and wouldn’t change, but we were in love. It happens) kind of went off the rails and we broke up. I was exhausted. I used to work with at risk youth, and loved them but was completely burned out.

I worked overtime at a blue collar job for 3 months, slept for (literally-about 36 of the 48 hours) 2 days, and decided I wasn’t ready to start fresh yet. I got a job as a bartender and partied for 6 months. Then I decided OK, oilfield as a field supervisor (job I left to be close to fam) or military (dreams as a kid). Roughnecked, and decided nope. Almost went active duty, found out about a unit I could try out for and join directly that operated WAY more than most AD units (imagine being a military pilot, who never flies-then tell him he can fly 10x as much is this unit. That’s this unit) so I moved cross country, went through all these struggles to join (was working temp jobs through an agency, lived in a bad neighborhood, had all my stuff stolen, truck stolen, and almost couldn’t pay rent/buy groceries for 3 months. I had no friends or family in the area and was committed to doing all this without help). Developed a sleeping disorder so bad I almost had to see a doc about it, which would have disqualified me from military service. I managed to up my ~2 hours of sleep I was getting to 4-5 hours through exercise, alcohol, and sleep aids, alternated different days.

Anyway I finally made it in the unit, and have 4 months until training. Summer here means much more plentiful work, and EASIER work. I have a normal 32 hour non-labor job, and after having enlisted I regained the ability to sleep.

Now, all I want to do is sleep, I feel lazy as fuck, and brain dead. I’ve put on this tough face for the unit (I am support personnel, but my role gets to fly some and the best/favorites fly/help a LOT so I want to be that go-to guy) and am pretty anxious about burnout. I felt pretty numb and hopeless sometimes in the past-now, things have slowed down, I’m healthier, kind of looking back like holy shit. I did all that, and made it?

What I’m saying is, I finally made it but am extremely burned out. I drag myself through my wonderful, easy job now, and plop down on the couch ASAP after work. I do the bare minimum physically (cals, runs, and one swim a week), don’t cook. I’m considering taking a full 4-6 weeks off before training, just to recover...although I’m not sure what I’d do with myself.

So, advisors of reddit. What would you do? Has anyone else recovered from burnout? Half of me is so happy I made it, and the other half almost hates the idea of doing ANYTHING . I want to change that.",31May2019,2
44," Any time I have a negative emotion, especially anxiety, I deal with it by avoidance. For example I don't like feeling insecure so instead of overcoming it I just hide in my house. I fell behind in my classes last semester due to my illness, and instead of telling anyone I just didn't show up to my exams and won't even open my school email.

I want to try change through CBT and make healthier choices. I think I'm capable because I'm relatively intelligent and self aware. I also took multiple university psych classes and did very well. I even wanted to major in it.

I am going to see a psychologist, but I'm on a waiting list and want to see what I can do on my own.

45,"I never thought I would be in in a situation like this. This was recent, a year ago. I invited a high school friend that I had a crush on to visit me in another state. He decided to come visit me. 

It was my intent to be sexual with him but halfway through the visit I decided I wasn’t interested due to the sexual incompatibility and I just had a bad gut feeling about him. I told him I wasn’t interested in a relationship with him (I’ll cherished the look of shock forever haha - we discussed being in one after seeing each other again) and internally had no intention of being intimate with him from that point on. But his trip wasn’t over. Also, forgot to note that he told me when he first arrived he had a condition that caused him to unknowingly have sex while he was asleep.

I woke up to him having sex with me. I didn’t fight it because of brain fog/sleep. Due to the suddenness of it, he tore me up down there and triggered a pretty severe case of lichen sclerosis that lasted about a year before I found treatment. 

I didn’t report him for so many reasons. But I later found out he has done this to others and most likely will continue. I am wondering if I would be believed if I spoke up now. Would you consider this rape?",31May2019,2

Due to my anxiety disorder, I (27F) feel like I haven’t had a chance to truly think about what I want to do with my life. My education, my job, everything has been decided based on my fear. I’ve withdrawn from classes that required group work or presentations, and I’ve settled for a part time job that pays me less than minimum wage, just so I wouldn’t have to interact with people. I’ve wasted hours waiting on public transportation that never came, and depended on my loved ones to chauffeur me places, all because I’m too scared to drive. My anxiety destroyed my long term relationship. I’m tired of running away from things, and I’m sick of disappointing people who believed in me.

51,"I know it's kinda bold to assume that my bf is depressed, but I have depression and anxiety and I feel like a lot of the symptoms he's showing and current events that have happened to him are pointing toward depression. I'm just going to list a few things that have happened that make me believe he's depressed:

1. He failed 3 of his university courses 
2. He cannot participate in university athletics next semester due to failing 3 courses
3. His parents are constantly getting onto him about things that he's doing. I think he's told his parents about failing and not being able to participate in athletics, however, they were getting onto him about money when all he was buying was food? To myself and several of my bf's friends, we see that his parents don't really care about him as much as his siblings. From what he's told us, they've always catered more to their needs and wants than his. A good example is that when they call him, all they talk about is how his siblings are doing, how their days went, or bitch about something he's doing; they never ask how he is or are proud of his accomplishments/bring up/acknowledge his accomplishments first.
4. He's been either sleeping in really late or not being able to sleep at all.
5. He's only been playing video games. He normally does that, but I feel like at this point he's been playing them a lot more because he feels it's the only thing he can really do (well).
6. He used to be super clean, but now he's leaving things everywhere and letting dishes pile up. He does the laundry, but he used to be nit-picky about the dishes, but they all of a sudden started getting built up. (I'll spare you the details, but they got super bad and dsjfalkasdf).
7. When I ask if anything is bothering him, he gets really defensive and will sometimes get angry at me for asking. I can usually tell when something is bothering him through facial expressions and body language, so it really upsets me that when I *know* something is bothering him, he gets mad at me for asking. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm really concerned and I don't know how to help him if he won't tell me what's wrong or how I can help. Is something wrong or am I overreacting? If something is wrong, what should I do? Any advice would help.

-

Tonight me and my father had spaghetti for dinner. My mother doesn’t like that, so she usually just makes herself something else. (She does it by choice I keep telling her that we can just eat something else but she refuses)

Anyways, we didn’t have anything in the house because  we didn’t go food shopping last weekend. I wanted to go to the store and get something but she said the bills came out early and we have -$100 in our bank. I offered to go and buy something because I get an allowance every month and have about $30 saved up. She went on a rant about how she is my mother and how she is supposed to care for me. During this whole thing, her blood sugar was getting so low that she was getting dizzy and shaking like crazy. 
I ended up having to threaten to walk there for my dad to get up and drive me.

I just got back and I’m making dinner now and I’m just preparing myself for the backlash and manipulation I’m about to hear. Every time this happens she goes on about her not being a good enough mother and her failing me and all this bullshit. It puts a lot of weight on me but I’m so used to it now it doesn’t hurt as much as it did when this all started.

I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. This is not the first time this has happened. The “I’m not a good enough mother” thing happens once a week and I end up having to sit with her for hours on end and built up her ego about how she is the best mother I could ever ask for and things like that.

Today, we found out she has an infection and I'm now panicking about mine.

 It's scabbing normally, and I've been putting on non-scented lotion and washing it. I'm still going to head to the doctor in the morning just to be on the safe side, but I want a general idea of what might be going on.

55,"So, I rock back and forth as part of my stimming. When I do, I am off in my own little world, spaced out, and not aware of my surroundings. Sometimes I rock a bit harsher than other times. I've broken two of my beds because of my rocking and its hard to stop. Going off into my own little world is one of the ways I unwind after a stressful day. Sometimes I can make myself laugh or smile just from doing that. But when I'm off in my own little world, I rock. Its involuntary and I cannot control it when I let myself go into this trance-like state. 

I felt so bad the last time I broke my bed. I had to sleep on a mattress for a little over a year because we really couldn't get a new bed. I deserved it, anyway. My mom has told me to try and take measures to stop but she understands it's difficult. It sucks. I would be a lot more frustrated and agitated If I wasnt able to have my little ""imagination"" sessions at the end of the day. 

Sleeping on that mattress caused me back problems and it got to the point where the springs were poking out of the mattress. Now my clothes have homes in em and I dont really have any pants that dont have at least one hole. It also meant I'd get get random scratches on my back and legs while I slept. Finally, we got an old bed that someone used to use that was in good condition. It's a memory foam bed, so even if I were to break the bed , if I only slept on the mattress, I would be fine because it doesn't have springs in it. I'm pretty sure I already cracked part of the bed frame and parf of the frame that's in the box spring layer underneath the mattress. Its not bad, theres just a small indentation instead if if being flat on the part underneath the mattress. But I still dont want to break the bed.

I've heard loud snaps a few times because I rocked so harshly onto the bed. I immediately get scared. I really want to stop, man, but I don't know how, without giving up my own little world where I can just relax for a bit. I'm sorry it's so long.

57,"Sort of a weird question maybe.

Uh, backstory; so I live with my cousin, who is 21 and she has lived here alone for a while, aside from like last 2.5 years, since I've been here. The situation is more or less she lives in her parents house, who are divorced; her mom lives in another town and her father is an over the road trucker. I'm related to her mother, my aunt on my father's side.

For a lot of years, I bounced around, couch surfed, that sort of thing. Did a lot of growing up (am now 25,m) in that time, found a work ethic, did a lot of self discovery, etc etc. During and before this, I had not had a relationship or much contact with this side of the family for over 7 years, extenuating circumstances. But when I needed a place to stay, my aunt had my back. I'm forever grateful for this.

My uncle was not on board, but he let me come in and stay anyways. It turned out to be a pretty good thing though, I found a steady, good paying job nearby, and I earn my keep. My cousin and I split utilities/house payment with each other and my uncle. This is of course no problem, I am happy to help out because I know the value of having a place to sleep that I can call mine.

The issues arise when, we are constantly behind in terms of payments on the house, certain utilities, etc, even though I *always* pay my share. And this had me concerned but things always hashed out in the end, so it was fine. 

My uncle has always been a bit bipolar. He constantly manipulates and guilt trips his daughter, his ex wife, and attempts to do so to me. He never keeps his word, and I know I can't trust him. But, I was happy to keep my mouth shut, because again, value of a bed.

Fast forward to three weeks ago, when I find out he has been lying to my aunt about me, saying I *never* pay my way. She was surprised to learn I had paid $1200 to him over the past 2.5 months. Saying he said I had paid almost nothing. He still doesn't know I know this. Beyond this, any money I send him, I have no idea where it goes. I frequently send enough money to cover Bill X, and then we are somehow behind. All this came to my attention recently.

Immediately, I made plans to move out. I have friends upstate who I can room with, and this weekend I fly up to hash some details out with them.

My question for you is, what is the best way to bow out of this situation gracefully? I know how to stand up for myself, but I don't want to be over dramatic and cause problems for my cousin. 

Or, am I entitled to feeling as angry about this as I feel, should I let him have it?

Dude 1: D1
Dude 2: D2
Me: Me

D2: WOAH THOSE ARE REALLY BAD WORDS YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THOSE THINGS! WHERE DID YOU LEARN THEM, XBOX LIVE GOLD?

I, as a joke, and knowing the meme of Xbox gamers using profane language against people's parents, say:

Me: What, did he call your parents faggot whores or something?

I legit wanted to know what he said, because he's the type of person to say something like that.

D2 then starts getting in my face and yells

D2: DUDE DON'T USE THAT WORD THAT'S FUCKED UP! I HAVE 2 MOMS THAT'S NOT COOL!!

Me: Ok dude, I'm really sorry, I didn't realize that, I won't say it again. 

D2 doesn't even get a chance to respond, because then D1 yells

D1: YOU MISSPOKE! YOU MEANS MOMS NOT PARENTS! HAHAHA

D2 starts chasing him then attacking him and beating him up on the ground.

The dean comes over and gets D2 to talk to him, and he brings D2 inside. He sends another teacher later on to grab D1. 

The Frisbee coach then gets to the field and asks for the story, and I tell him. The coach goes inside and stays there for a while, then comes back to get me, and bring me to talk with the dean.

Dean: So, what happened?

Me: (tells the story until the part where I say faggot whore)

Dean: one, we don't use homophobic language like that, and two, that's not what D1 said. He told me that you said mom instead of parents

Me: No, I said parents then he ""corrected"" me and said moms.

Dean: Ok, I'm gonna keep talking to them, and you'll probably be called to speak with me tomorrow during school about this. You can go home now.

*Dean leaves*

I go to the field where it happened, across the street from the school, and tell my friends what happened. I said to them that I didn't say anything to insult D2 and just said the word, then apologized. They all agreed with me and said if I needed to, I could call them to speak with the dean with me and vouch for me.

69,"Hello... so. this is my first real post so please bare with me and Sorry for the long post.....

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I'm 19(M) 

I've been struggling with loneliness for the majority of my life. I had maybe one or two people I could actually call friends at a time. I was initially doing well in school but was often bullied by others I would try to ignore it or laugh it off when I was in public but would often cry in the bathrooms during lunch breaks... no one knew this not even those I could call friends. This lasted several years things god bad and I fell into a deep depression and ended up having to repeat a year due to failing. Before long even those I was close to started to bully me through various means. 

Note I was the tallest and strongest out of all the kids in my class but was easily manipulated and tricked. 

(Appearances aren't everything) 

I grew up in a foreign country so I couldn't understand the language the other in my class were using leading to me being isolated and often mocked leading me into an ever greater depression. I would always try carrying a smile and laughing no matter what happened but would always secretly cry and hurt myself when no one was watching thinking I didn't deserve to be alive even attempting to kill myself with pills on 3 different occasions even though I was never caught. My mother suspected things weren't going well but I always made up some kind of excuse and laughed it of with her. Soon enough my grades dropped and ended up having to changing schools leading to me often questioning why I was even alive and why I bothered to even breath. 

This lead to me being more alone then ever. my grades dropped further and because of my weak nature many teacher started to despise me as well. one teacher in particular we'll call D was a particular hard ass and would often mock me in front of the class telling me I was worthless and the other kids to not be like me. The worst part is that I do very badly under pressure so when exams came around I would always spend countless hours studying only to have it blow up in my face. D thought I was vermin and made no attempt to hide his hatred and contempt for me as did several of my other teachers but none stuck out as much as him. I tried silting my wrists in a bath not long after but woke up to my father knocking on the door telling me dinner was ready the surprising part was that no one ever found out. 

I was extremely lucky to get into University and I wish I could say things got better. the truth was I was even more alone then ever. Truth be told I have never said more then a few hello's to a few flat mates when we ran into each other in the kitchen. Never letting of on my smile despite my loneliness and and ever growing hatred for myself. I try to eat healthy and do exercise but truth be told I barely have the energy to get up in the morning. 

\-------------------------

I hate myself for being the way I am and I truly want to fix my ways and find a purpose I can pursue to give my life meaning but nothing has worked even here I have noticed the scornful looks from teachers who make no effort to hide the fact that they don't like me even though the simple truth is that I'm truly scared. And often feel like a diseased lost puppy on the side of the road on a rainy day.........",31May2019,0
70,"Hello, i need advice (lol). I want to get a new laptop, i have a macbook pro from late ‘13 that i inherited from my father, and i feel like it may be time for a change, being my main issues with it storage room (250 gb) and the power it has. 

I’ve been searching for alternatives, budget is not a real problem but also don’t feel like spending 1.5k in what i feel like it is an underpowered machine. Given that, from my, and my family experiencie, Macbooks are really relaible and really hold up with the years, which for me also kinda justifies the price. 

My father says i will miss the Macbook because of this but i’m not entirely sure. My only experiencie with windows laptops are with my moms one, but she isn’t too tech savy and so they kinda suck after not too much time, getting reaally slow. 

My real doubt is, will i be able to maintain a fast computer throught the years with a windows, with the proper care, just like a Mac does? Or the OS really makes a big difference here??

72,"This is a throwaway because lots of people know my actual account and im ashamed. I am 18

one to go to college out of 7 other family members. I agreed because I am scared of one of

them, and always say yes to everything he wants me to do because I dont like conflict with him.

but the closer i get to college the more i realize that I really don't want to go. I am

autistic and have social anxieties, sensory issues, and other issues which make most of the

things my college offers kind of difficult to consider ( I end up crying or getting close to panic

attacks often because of lots of small things in my life and i hate myself for it) I'm only ""good""

at art but im scared of wasting tons of money on something that would probably barely pay.

They set me up for a drafting position (architect stuff) but I'm bad at math and averaged a D/F

in all 12 years of school.

I will admit that drafting doesnt require you to know the math ( at least I was told) but it's

something i really don't want to do. I dont want to feel miserable doing something thats just a chore to me because its so far from anything that I like. I know I know, I just mean that math or anything math related is the breaking point for me, that's all.

I got the courage earlier to step up to one of my relatives and tell him that I don't want to do

this because I cant see myself doing it for years while working towards something else like he

wants me to do and he told me to get that out of my head because I would probably never do

what I wanted and I needed to be realistic, and I get where he's coming from but I've already

been accepted into the college and Im really scared. Im typing this crying right

now and have been crying and stressing and getting headaches for days now.

73,"(Throwaway account because people i know have my main account) Now, this is just one of the most annoying things i go through every single day of my life. I'll start from the beginning

&amp;#x200B;

So, this has been happening more and more every single day and it seems to be getting more annoying every time. I have lived with my grandma since i was born. Now, in every single one of my drawers have her clothes in it, i have no privacy at all.  My grandpa died in early 2014, but since then my grandma has taken over the room he was sleeping in, and she has more than enough room to store all of her things in there with no problem at all. I don't know if its because it's because she is getting older and her mental state is getting worse, but she decides to go through all the little things i have which is only a laptop and my clothes and other accessories i have accumulated over the years. And sometimes she even steals my money that i try to hide from her. Recently she has stolen over $200 from me that i was saving up for a new computer. My parents are going through the same thing as me, but only worse. She has stolen my moms medication that KEEPS HER ALIVE and when my mom found out they got into a verbal argument and we left the house for a couple of days. She has also taken some of my clothes out of my closet which is unusual because i'm probably double her height. She is also starting to search deeper and deeper into mine and my parents things and we are afraid that she is going to either take more money or medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have asked her why she is doing this, and her excuse is always, ALWAYS the same thing. ""My things are in the rooms i have to get to them"". Which is TRUE but the things she has in them is mostly things she goes to sleep in, or bed sheets that she has. I'm not wanting to turn this into any type of revenge situation. I'm just drained and i feel like someday im just going to snap and start throwing all her things in my room away.",31May2019,1

82,"My girlfriend of 2 years made out with another man willingly about 2 days ago. She was at a party with her work friends for one of their birthdays. She got there around 4 and got real drunk, only to take a short nap around 7:30 and got woken up around 8. She was awoken by one of the birthday boys friend who she had told me was attractive and had awesome tattoos. She said they sat there and talked for awhile before he came in for a kiss and she let him, after telling him she had a boyfriend. She said that it wasn't just a peck and that they made out with tongue and she let him touch her all over and said she never touched him back but isn't she because she was drunk. He offered to take it somewhere private to do the thing and she declined.

The the jist of the story. The story she didn't tell me until now. Not after she came home and told me about the party and told me that some guy was trying to fuck her, which we laughed about after I asked her what he did. She lied and didn't want to tell me but broke today. She says she's regrets it and feels guilty but just didn't stop it at the time. Good thing she found the will to not consent to having sex with him..

I asked her why and she says she hasn't felt appreciated and that was the main driving force. She deserves to feel that way because I have been a shitty boyfriend when it comes to the bills and haven't been trying hard to get on top of my financial struggles. Shes supported me for a long time now and says if she didn't have to then she wouldn't have let it happen. Which I know is bullshit regardless.

The worst part about all of this is that she has good reasoning for feeling that way and I've been on the up and up for about a month now. I found 2 great new jobs and want to pay her back in full. She even agrees that I've been doing great but is concerned that it's not gunna last. I've struggled a lot the past 6 months and I've finally found myself in a great place. She and I had just moved in together at the beginning of May and it's honestly been a total blast. I fell even more in love with her and we've been happy. She agrees too. I have every intention to get myself together and be what I need to be in order to support her. I just don't know what to do with what I've come find out.

I want to be with her and she says she wants to be with me, but she doesn't know that even if I do get my shit together that what she's feeling towards me will change. She's afraid it won't but wants to. I feel trapped, I've got nowhere else to go even if I wanted to. I plan on continuing with my grind and show her but I don't want to be in limbo just for it not to work out.

I have gone through a lot of positive life changes in the past 6 months. I have lost almost 40 pounds and I'm in phenomenal shape.

97,"On two separate occasions I have been honked at when walking to my car (I know it's two times is probably not that big of a deal, but it's two too many times for me). I'm usually anxious when I'm out on my own so I tend to walk faster than most. I park near the back where people are less likely to park because I don't want to accidentally hit a car when backing out. And I also tend to stay off to the side, close to the rears of the parked cars, to avoid getting hit and stay out of the way. Yet the two instances detailed below have managed to happen and it scares me (my anxiety has literally flared up each time).

The first time was last November (I think). I was walking close to the rears of the parked cars in a lane that allows cars to travel in both directions. Yet this person decided to drive right up behind me in their huge truck and honk his horn. I kept walking and he proceeded to roll down his window and yell at me for ""walking in the middle of the road"" which I know I wasn't because I bumped into the parked car next to me when I jumped. The parking lot was full of parked cars, but not very busy with other drivers or pedestrians (it was an Election Day so everyone that was parked there were in line waiting to vote), so he could have gone through another lane or literally gone around me??? And he ended up angrily driving next to yell at me then zoomed passed me. I don't think he liked the look on my face because he braked abruptly and really quickly reversed up next to me and yelled at me to ""wipe off that stank face, bitch"" and drove away to find a parking spot. Like ALL THAT SPACE to drive passed me and reverse back and yet you couldn't have done that from the beginning?

The second time was today. I was walking to my car and, again, it allows cars to travel in both directions. I was walking close to the parked cars and a person drove up behind me AGAIN and honked at me and started driving next to me to yell at me for ""walking too damn slow hoe"" and to ""move \[my\] slow ass over hoe"" (I hope someone else sees how ironic it is to drive next to someone to yell at them for walking too slow and telling them to move over). They reached the stop sign at the end of the lane as I walked between the cars to get away from the situation and they waited until I was at my car to speed to the other EMPTY lane to park in a parking spot behind me to continue to say things like ""I wouldn't have honked if you weren't such a slow hoe"" and did not stop until I was in my car. I called my mom and they drove through some empty parking spots near me to angrily drive past me. They reached the stop sign again and left?????? Like, you literally drove passed me just fine, was the honking and name-calling really necessary???? I'm so confused. I would also like to mention that they commented on my ""hoe clothes"" that consisted of me wearing workout leggings and a cropped hoodie, which probable gave me a stank face of confusion. And I will admit that my confused face is probably as nasty looking as my normal face and that could have caused them to get more aggressive, but I still don't understand the initial anger and aggression that made them honk.

I would understand if I was walking in the middle of the road (which also frustrates me when I'm driving), but I was off to the side moving at a normal to brisk pace. I would also understand if there were cars coming from the other direction and I was blocking the way (like honk all you want then), but there were none in either scenario. I also read that you're supposed to walk facing the direction cars are coming so you can see them, but what should I do when they come from both directions? I have had occasions where there were cars coming from both directions, and there's not enough space to drive around pedestrians, and I've never had someone honk or get aggressive. In these cases I weave between the cars to give them space to drive more easily (as I do when it's a one-way-only lane). I could try to weave through the parked cars from now on, but there are times when the cars are parked too close together for me to weave and as the second person nicely pointed out my slow, hoe ass sadly won't fit through small gaps.

I feel like maybe I just didn't notice that I had migrated to the middle of the lane or something and I'm at fault. Or maybe I'm just being overdramatic and thinking about it too much. My dad said to ignore people like he does and that I need to stop being so scared since I'm an adult now (23-year-old female, sup). But both made me feel like I was about to get attacked and I would really like to avoid getting murdered in a parking lot. Thanks in advance for the advice!",31May2019,1
98,"Hi reddit,

I haven't posted much on reddit so please forgive me if there are any format issues. Also, this might be a long read so I thank you all in advance.

So I was contacted through the email by a company about a job i applied to on Indeed.ca
Now I have been job hunting for a while so I was like Ok, nice!

So as I am trying to go through the hiring process, I get an odd feeling that something is a little off. The company logo is very cheap looking, representative names are very awkward? (You know something is odd when you see one). Things like that.

Also, this company liked to do their stuff online and I didn't mind that because I have filled necessary documents and applications online for previous works. The application form involved me filling out my name, address, email, and phone number and signature.

Then I suddenly had the urge to research about the company, and did some research and found out that it might be fraudulant. Website seemed pretty legitimate, however I could not find any information on the company itself or any of the people that work for it.

I have discontinued the process of applying for this so-called ""opportunity"" and have documented all emails I received from them. I have not disclosed any banking information or very personal information like SIN numbers but I wanted to make sure that incase of security breach, I have my bank account restricted and credit cards blocked as of now.

I know I messed up big time, please help on what other things I can do to prevent anything bad from happening.

Thank you",31May2019,2
99,"hello!

so i’ve been in this friend group of four for around 2 years, i was never as close to the other three people are they were. neither was i like them as well, im really introverted where as they’re REALLY and i mean REALLY extroverted. so i tend to get excluded along the way. 

but here’s the catch, recently i’ve found some new friends that really make me feel secure, and wanted so i began to start hanging out with them more frequently than my old friend group.

BUT
here’s the thing, these other girls in my old friend group (the one with the extroverted girls) tend to make assumptions really easily. so i’m nervous if they’ll start to thing something bad about me since i’m not around them as much as before. so i’m afraid they’ll say stuff behind my back.. what should i do?

100,"I often give massages in my apartment and I think the leasing manager at my apartment is onto me. Someone dialed my code at the gate so I could buzz them in (my specific code gets used a lot because of my massage guests), and he said that as he was getting into the elevator, he saw the manager leave her office and start going up the stairs. He then said that when he reached my apartment door on the 4th floor, she walked past him not carrying anything and didn’t look at him. 

I’ve lived here 20 months and the Only time I’ve ever seen her on the 4th floor was twice when she was giving an apartment showing. There’s the apartments, the trash/recycling room, the elevators, the laundry room, and that’s it. I’ve seen maintenance up here sometimes repairing carpet stains, getting the trash/recycling bins, etc, but I literally can’t think of a reason why she would be up here by herself...coming up the stairs and passing my door at the Same Time that my client did. She saw him when he entered the lobby, and when he arrived at my door. As if she was confirming something. 

I almost think they’re trying to compile evidence against me so they can report me and evict me (the leasing manager and I have butted heads a couple times and I purposely avoid her).

101,"This is a throwaway, because I have followers on my main account and I'm not sure if it is people that know me. 

I'm nearing my first  year in this city. It's been an up-and-down experience for me. I'm doing okay in terms of making it month-to-month but I also went through a major breakup and at my age I wonder if being here at 26 is the right decision or not.

I feel that in many ways, I'd regret going back home after only a year, both due to the loss or opportunity and because of all of the stress/intensity that I went through to get here.

I also feel that I would feel underwhelmed and bored with the city I originally lived in or anywhere else really. I've met some cool people in my area that I see weekly, but they aren't as close as my friends and I were back home, so there is a bit of isolation (which is compounded by my recent breakup). That being said, I realize new relationships come with time, and I've noticed that I've felt more and more distant from my old friends back home as we talk less and less.

I guess I don't know what to do because:

1. I don't want my old friendships of 6+ years to deteriorate completely.
2. I don't want to give up opportunities in NYC just because I feel down at the moment. 
3. I don't want to also be here at 27-years-old realizing I should have gone back home a year ago. 
4. Leaving NYC after a single year would both be a financial blunder and make me feel like I 'failed' somewhat.",31May2019,1

Fast forward a bit and I found out today that I'm switching teams and thus switching floors. While we've never officially given each other our names, I do know what her name is due to each row having name tags and such.

When I was with her, I loved her of course but not as much as I’ve loved men in the past. I feel like I click better with men. When I was with her, we would always bicker at one another and that is kind of what caused us to breakup. I’ve only ever been with men in the past and its always ended on good terms with guys. Maybe I was just with the wrong girl? I’m attracted to women but I’m just confused as to why I feel more connected to men than women. 

Me and her never got to have sex either and that leaves me wondering if maybe I just want to have sex with women instead of carrying out a relationship, I’ve always fantasized having sex with a woman but never got to follow through.

112,"I have not realised until tonight that I am obsessing over my appearance.

I am 5'3'' and around 100something lbs. I am petite, 34A breast size ( I think ) and I think I am overall pretty. I never wore makeup in my life, never wore a bra, I am not the kind of person who spends hours to do her hair or choose her clothes...however I still constantly think about the way I look.

I don't actively do much to change my appearance. I am against using makeup and I am against using a bra just for the sake of hiding nipples or giving the illusion of bigger breasts, but I am constantly thinking 'are my boobs ok?' 'does my belly looks too bloated?' 'is my nose too big?' 'are my legs too skinny?' over and over again. Constantly.  Every day is a different obsession about something specific, my boobs are a constant though. I would constantly look in the mirror side by side how my breasts look. Does it look too flat? Or is it ok? It's every day. 

I work in a bar so I am constantly under hundreds of people eyes. If someone looks at me for a long period of time or in a particular way, I would think that they are making judgments over my body. It's not always negative, it can even be positive, I can even think 'that guy really finds me attractive' or 'that girl is jealous'...even though realistically speaking I am aware they might be looking for different reasons. Maybe they are not really making any judgment my body, maybe they are just looking at my clothes or I don't know, anything else. 

Point is, whether I think of my self very highly or very low, it's a torment because that's all I think about. It's annoying because I do have other things going on in my life and I don't think I am a shallow person but I can't stop thinking about my appearance. 

It's draining me because I am constantly worried I am not good looking enough or perfect... for who I am not sure. Probably just my self. It's extremely annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost OCD. The strangest thing about this it's that I don't consider my self ugly, but it's almost like I can't accept I am not perfect, or I see everything in my body as a flaw rather than seeing the whole picture.

I’m a young guy. During a trip with a couple colleagues and relatives, I happened to have an accident late evening and ejaculated forcefully into a toilet bowl.

Since this was during the night and I did not want to risk waking anyone up, I only flushed once and wiped the top of the bowl with some toilet paper.

However, ten minutes later, a female member of the group used the bathroom as well, specifically the toilet. I was almost asleep by then.

Is it possible that the semen and seminal fluids could have an effect on said person if it reached the genitals somehow? I know bathroom water can be slippery and get everywhere, so it is not unlikely the fluids could have made contact with said person’s body.

TL;DR: Can toilet water cause pregnancy?

My dad recently passed away and it was something that really connected my sister and I to our dad so we would be parting with something very sentimental.

Since my dad recently passed away we haven't had time to maintain the car especially since no one was driving it regularly and I'm the only one around fixing house/ car problems. There are quite a few things wrong with it and the car started smoking since my mom drove it last but I think it was because she put it in an incorrect gear and drove it on the highway. I don't know much about cars but the radiator has to be replaced, back brakes fully replaced, and parts of the front brakes, as well flush out the oil tank.

124,"I (20M) was recently asked to officiate a friend's (20F) wedding coming up in a few weeks. I was honestly surprised that they would ask me, but in the moment I wanted to be polite and agreed, so now I need to get to work on that.

The thing is, I don't feel very qualified to do so for a number of reasons. For one thing, I don't know them very personally: my friend and I are officers of our college LGBTQ+ organization, and we play D&amp;D on a weekly basis during the school year, but beyond that, we don't do a lot together. On top of that, I barely know her fiancé.

The second thing is, I know that I'm a second choice: I know that there was one friend before me who has agreed to officiate, but he's a trans man who hasn't been able to get his legal name and gender changed, and thus he didn't want to have his dead name on the certificate. I guess I don't even technically know if I'm the second choice; they could have asked any number of people before me. 

Finally, I have reservations about their marriage. When I first heard about the engagement, I asked my friend how long they'd been together, and she said 6 months. I was honestly a bit shocked--my mother has told me that she only dated my father for 6 months before they got married, and now she's stuck in an unhappy marriage--but I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't feel it was my place to say anything. Thinking back, they can't have been engaged for more than 6 months, meaning their relationship is now only a year old, and that just feels wild and rushed to me, especially since they're both still college students. 

So now that I'm in this situation, what does the internet think? Should I have declined to officiate their wedding? Should I have spoken up earlier? It would definitely destroy our relationship if I said anything now, right? Am I a bad friend for thinking this way? Any advice would be appreciated.",31May2019,1

128,"TL;DR at the end...

The other day, I was talking with my boyfriend. It came out that he hasn't fully opened up to me emotionally. We have been dating a year. He has been holding on to the notion that ""it's scientifically proven that those who are together 4+ years are less likely to get a divorce when they get married"".

Now, I'm not denying science. However, I have tried explaining that while that might be a general case, that isn't the end all be all for everyone. I also said that it's not like you hit about 4 years and then decide if you still live someone or not (only said it because that's how he makes his ""condition for marriage"" sound).

The biggest issue I guess is that he has now admitted to not being really open with me emotionally. Which makes it really hurt every time I say I love him, and he says it back (he will also usually say it back in a funny voice). It hadn't dawned on me until I got him to admit about not opening up with me fully. 

This wouldn't be an issue of I wasn't fully open with him either, but I am. I have told him many times where I stand, and how I feel. It hurts for him not to be the same way. 

So I am wondering how to either move past this or talk to him about how much it hurts?

If I need to add more information I will in the comments.

on top of these two jobs i also have an online summer class that i need to take which starts in july, plus i have a serious relationship where my boyfriend works opposite hours that i do. my two jobs together are giving me about 40-50 hours a week, and i work during the day every single day. my boyfriend works during the evening/early night.

 It was December 30th-31st 2017-2018 (My senior year in high school) when this happened. My friends and I had made a group chat to plan a hang out with each other over winter break. I hadn't seen them in a while due to me leaving to go to a public school in the area, so I was really excited. But things didn't work out too good due to us all working. I made a suggestion to hang out on new years eve! I thought it would have been really fun to bring in the new year with friend's I've known since kindergarten and 5th grade! I was quickly shot down in the group chat as everyone said they were busy on that night. I didn't think too much of it, I just went to work...however when I got home I checked my snapchat and all of them were hanging out without me. Everyone was dressed up and they had a formal dinner that they had all made together. They had this planned for a while obviously... When I texted them why they would lie to me and how this behavior was beyond rude. They lied and said it was a birthday party for one of them, when that person's birthday is in March. It being a birthday party was confirmed to be untrue when I texted another person in the group chat. I wouldn't have reacted the way I did of this wasn't already a common occurrence of them always doing things like this. It was like I had an epiphany, they always left me out on things, invited me to birthday parties late, and always talked about other ppl behind their backs. (Meaning they definitely talked about me) They weren't true friends. So I blocked them all on snapchat. I eventually unblocked them, but never friended them again. They follow me on Instagram. But I have not talked to them really since. 

So the advice I am asking for is, should go back and try to patch things up? Its been like a year and a half. We're all in college now and not everyone in the group chat was in on what was going on. I feel had because my one friend really cared about me but it would be awkward to patch things up with her but not her twin sister who was also my friend. 

Tl:dr- life long friends planned a party without me and lied to me when I asked to celebrate new years eve with them. I cut off connection and now am thinking of patching up with a few people.",31May2019,1
134,"So my girlfriend (who I’ve been dating for almost two years and plan on proposing to soon) started to smoke weed,  I don’t really like drugs and although we live in a state where it is legal I still don’t like the thought of it.  What should I do?  Do I break up with her because it violates my morales?   Should I just deal with it because I love her and always will?",31May2019,1
135,"It sounds harsh but Im tired of their harsh comments and their petty behavior and judgments. I overall dislike my older siblings, the way they act like they are high and mighty because they made thousands of money a week. I say this because my brother insulted me today, I just got a job from home caring for my dad and all I have to do is cook clean for him the pay is $10. My brother was saying how he earns a lot of money a week, and I just stared at my mom like “really..” and he began to insult me and say “ I atleast make more than you, $10 aint nothing to what I make” this hurted me deeply and got me angry because I know the home provider job is looked down upon but im just trying to get experience and I got the job offer right on the spot so I didn’t decline and plus I have a good relationship with my parents.

I got a job interview a week ago but its 3 hours away from home, they provide me a bedroom and pay good. I really want to go because I feel like at home is such a toxic environment.

What can I do in the mean while? Im tired of feeling so unhappy all the time and my siblings comments getting to me.",31May2019,1
136,"I’m 17f. In my first period class, I have this “friend” that’s a guy. Hes in the grade below me. He belittles me constantly. He teases me. He puts me down just because I’m a girl. For example, we were doing a project today. I got some supplies to help and he said “excuse me bitch what are you doing” and I told him what I was doing and he said “you don’t even know what you’re doing” and tried to make me stop because he didn’t want me messing the project up. At the end of class, he pushed me out of the way harshly.    Sometimes he hits me, like punches me in the thigh and side. He flings shit at my head. I didn’t do anything about it bc I just let it slide. But today I realized who he is and I hate it. What do I do other than tell my teacher? School ends next Friday and idk if it’s even worth it to tell anyone.",31May2019,1
137,"I've been unemployed/underemployed for quite a while. I recently found out I failed the bar for a third time and I don't even know why I'm having trouble. On top of that I haven't been able to find any meaningful work and I have no idea why. Employers never get back to me much less give a reason(aside from experience), which could help to at least improve.

Honestly getting to the point where I don't even know if I'm good at anything. I don't know I want to do law at this point if I'm this bad. Yet I can't really get anything else, but campaign jobs. I've worked a couple of high profile campaign jobs and I just don't want to do those hours anymore with that uncertainty, with such small advancement potential. Which just kind of makes me feel like a failure and not know what to do.

I've been to a couple of therapist after a friend suggested it, but I didn't really see a difference. Really a large part of the problem just feels like I don't have any purpose, direction, passion, or hope. Which leads to a decline in dating life, social life, etc. So any advice? take it again? try another state? sacrifice my first born for a decent job?",31May2019,1
138,"My parents divorced a couple years ago and and my younger bros and I live with my mom. We had been doing well up until about 2 years ago where she started dating this ex convict type who was in gangs, did drugs, and makes barely enough for himself (lived with a friend in a single room, doesn't own a car, loses jobs because doesn't know how to manage temper or watch mouth, always looking for sex, and demands food and dinner from her, and has kid with another woman). He was really physically abusive to her and he would always fight me whenever I would disregard him and not recognize his authority. Recently they broke up because he got really violent with her and she just cut it there, but now a month later they're going out again and she's doing it behind my bros and I backs and whenever she goes out with him she comes back really mad and yelling and super irritated to every little thing we do. I've tried talking to her and having a reasonable conversation on what to do and moving on but she just starts yelling and saying I don't know what she's going through or feels and that she deserves to do whatever she wants. What can I do to try to get her to see the damage he's causing to what's left of our family and that he's no good for her?",31May2019,2
139,"Honestly, I think I fell in love with my best friend. We met in 7th grade but didn’t start being friends until freshman year of high school. When we just started out being friends, we would flirt on and off with each other and spent all our time together. Being as it was freshman year and I have very little experience with dating, when my other friend confronted me about my crush, I made the mistake of saying, “She’s like a sister to me” because I was embarrassed. We stopped flirting and for a while I was okay with just being friends. It’s not until recently when we were talking about things that happened in the past, I admitted my crush on her during freshman year. She told me that she had also liked me as well and that I was oblivious to everything. Between that conversation and freshman year, we both have been in relationships that were not healthy for us. Because of this, I don’t know if I love her out of desperation for a healthy relationship or purely because she has done so much for me. She has recently broken up with her boyfriend and it was heartbreaking for me to listen to her cry. What’s even more heartbreaking is that she told me that she “never wants to date/love again.” What do I do in this situation?

TL;DR - I think I’m in love with my best friend but 1. I don’t know if it’s genuine 2. I don’t know if she still likes me and 3. She feels heartbroken at the moment. I suggest you read the above to understand my dilemma better.

Thank you for your time.",31May2019,1
140,"So it started over a year ago when my dad died tragically. It was extremely hard to deal with for my 3 brothers and I . Plus I had to manage my dad’s 8 small businesses he owned when I’m only 23 . Luckily I was his assistant before it all. Anyways we did grow closer to each other out of the depression we all felt. And so us boys had signed over everything my dad owned over to my mom cause we thought she’d take care of us. So now a year and half later, my mom moved away from our home town, my little brother now lives with my uncle whom my mom was paying to stay with him at her house. He’s in high school still. She now lives in a luxury apartment which a certain nfl star lives, meanwhile my other two brothers and I are struggling to make ends meet. My oldest brother is hundreds of thousands in debt from medical school but just graduated  and needs a little help till he gets on his feet.  I’m currently jobless cause I decided to move back home to take care of my little brother and work as an emt until I make enough to go back to school. She constantly complains about money but goes on vacation after vacation. She just went to a school reunion last week instead of watching my little bro’s state baseball championship and missed my brothers engagement. I don’t want to have mal feelings toward my mom and I feel guilty for having them but they’re there. She’s just absent from our lives most of the time. She’ll cater to her friends before us. 
So getting to the point, one of the businesses is still in my name and my older brother and I had discussed selling it to help us all out. It could possibly ruin my relationship with her and my older brother has basically no love for her anymore. I just don’t know what to do cause there won’t be anything left when she passes down her will when she continues to live the way she does but at the same time I don’t know if I want to ruin it over money with the only parent I have . Would appreciate some unbiased input on this",31May2019,1
141,"I've been a personal trainer for that past year at a local gym chain. I've very much enjoyed trying to better people and the friends i've made with both the staff and members that i've had the pleasure to train. But there is one thing that is making me question if I should stay or not and thats management. At this job we have monthly 1 on 1s to go over the months goals and so on and so forth. Today the General manger of the gym was also sitting in on my session. I was basically told that I was unapproachable to members (I have resting bitch face so cant just change my face) I then kinda said that the general manager has the same thing so I cant really be held accountable for the way I look, I've been told by clients that i'm a happy guy to be around but i'm not the type of person who likes to have the charater questioned without proper means.

142,"Okay so me(19F) and this guy(22M) we have been best friends for more than a year. We are from different backgrounds and we met at an institute accidentally. 

He is a great guy. He has had a great past, loved during his childhood, visited so many places, known so many people and he has been earning a huge amount of money at the age of 19 itself. He is very intelligent, and charismatic, pragmatic and what not. He has an immense love for his country and doesn't want to go abroad to study, when he has an immense potential (most of the third world countries' youth prefer going abroad). He has an undeniable dedication to work for the nation and wants to leave a mark. I feel he is a good person too when you look at the minor details of his deeds but if you look at the bigger picture he's no saint ofcourse. Like for example he's cheating on a long distance relationship, isn't ending things with the girl because he knows that's gonna hurt her a lot right now, but is pragmatic enough and knows that it's not going to work because the girl is in New York and he doesn't plan to leave the country, yet again, he has been waiting for the right moment to end it without accentuating the damage. Ive tried telling him the damage he's doing but he doesn't talk about it, so I stopped too. He talks about his goals and aspirations so passionately, talks about how he's been with just these two women, is so egoistic that he never himself started a conversation with a girl, yet women are drooling over him. He motivates me a lot to achieve what I wish to, we've been preparing for an exam together since we met. 

He's my best friend and honestly he has been with me during my worst. But I feel so small and inferior to someone like him. I've never done something so different, I'm not so passionate, I've still been crying for a breakup that happened 3 years back. I have goals, and I strive to achieve them but the passion he has in his tone, while he talks about the future, I think I'm not even close to having that kind of passion. I'm just an average girl, with conventional prince charming dreams, nothing too huge. 

To be honest I'm envious of the exposure he has gotten since his childhood, etc. It's also tiring to be with someone like him. He still has a relationship, and another girl whereas I'm still trying to move on. He's been to so many places and I have never left my state. He knows so many people and I have very few friends. It's exhausting, listening to his good life. I don't want to feel that way about my friend but I can't help it anymore. What should I do?",31May2019,2

144,"ok so im 14 y/o male, finna be in highschool. summer break just started. Ofc with my luck i only start to get real close to my friends at the tail end of the year. Most of my freinds are girls bc most guys ik are cucks. So i get particularly close to this one girl (girl A)and I confess to her last week of school. Girl A has never been in a relationship before cuz shes hella awkward. So girl A admits she has feelings for me too but that shes not sure if she’s ready for a relationship and i am.  Obviously i don’t wanna pressure her so we agree to wait till after summer and see how things go. Ok so this other girl (girl B) was helping me out with the situation. So me and girl A get closer and on the last day of school go on a sort of freind date. I have literal time of my life and kinda feel guilty for realizing that i may be developing feelings for girl B. Please understand that I’m not a man hoe and that I literally haven’t dated for years so this is my first time in forever to actually have legitimate feelings for anybody. Girl A keeps making situations very difficult with her extreme shyness and awkwardness and we haven’t even talked to each other face to face about it because she gets so uncomfortable. So u can see how girl B is already starting to seem better. So i get to know girl B better and it turns out we have alot in common and i start to realize that im falling more for girl B. Ofc girl B knows nothing of this and neither does girl A. I feel like absolute shit bag. At this point I’ve made promises to girl A that my feelings wont change over summer since we wont see each other (she’s gonna be with other family in another state) and she says that she cant make promises like that. Start to realize the hopelessness of me and girl A ever having something. So I decide to tell her that we should just stay freinds after all. She actually beats me to it and says just that. I would be shaken up by this but by this point i had already made my decision and it honestly didn’t affect me as much as it should’ve. I say to myself that now that summer has started and because of girl A havin happened so recently that i wont make a move on girl B. I proceed to do it anyway because not confessing was becoming physically painful. She admits that she likes me too but that this is just a terrible time. (Where have i heard that before) ofc shes right so i take it as a win and try to go on with my life until school starts back. Well anyways we plan on going to the movies when toy story 4 comes out and I wanna ask her out then. But lately shes been busy with personal stuff im assuming because she hasn’t said exactly what it is and im not gonna cross any lines (this sounds bad rn but given the context its the right move) obviously i trust her but its been almost a weekend of only texting like one small conversation a day. It should be noted that both girl A and B are the absolute apitamy of dry texters. So i feel hella freind zoned already but everytime i try to talk to her about it she just says thats shes been busy and its not intentional. I trust her honesty but it’s getting confusing. She recently posted on insta with a caption that she kinda likes some boy. We talk about it and its some e boy shes been texting from another state and she says nothings gonna happen between them. She also has this party she’s gonna go to pretty soon and knowing her she probably won’t come out with her virginity intact. Obviously its hers to give to whoever she wants but try to imagine how im feeling about this rn, not to make this all about me, thats why I haven’t talked about this to her but...idk. Shes not a hoe she just hoes around alot (ik how that sounds but trust me shes not a hoe) shes hella pretty and can do WAY better than me so I wouldn’t blame her its just that i feel so helpless and freind zoned that idek how to function anymore...advice?

146,"Met this girl in one of my college classes about a month ago, we've talked on and off since then. She wouldn't tell me her age at first, and when I told her mine, she went ""Ughh that means I'm older than you!"". That seems like interest to me, why else would she be bothered by an age difference. 

The whole time I've known her she's been very vague about her boyfriend, the only time she mentioned him was once a couple weeks ago, and I think it might've been an accident. She was telling me how she felt bad about always getting angry at this mysterious person, and wouldn't tell me who. When I kept pushing, she reluctantly said ""just a person...like my boyfriend"". She's never mentioned him again. 

Anyway, I gave her a hug when I saw her a week ago and ever since we've been hugging each time we run into each other/say bye. Yesterday I asked if she'd like to catch up outside of college and she instantly said yes. We then had a fairly long/tight hug goodbye. Surely she knows that it's a date, right? Not just catching up as friends?",31May2019,2
147,"This is a throwaway account for fairly obvious reasons. To preface this, because I dont want my inbox flooded with a million ""flee that predator 😥"" messages:

I am in a sexual relationships with a 42 year old man. I am 17 years old and a girl.

I was in a previously emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a man older than him previously. He helped me get out of that and has worked hard with me to improve my mental health. He's made it clear this is not a romantic relationship (as he should), but it's functionally identical to one. I love him, in a platonic or romantic sense I have no idea. Maybe it's that I confide in him so often. I also understand that the concept of a romantic relationship in this setting doesnt make any sense. It cant be public, and it cant go anywhere. Being mentally ill and a teenager, my thoughts and feelings can be kind of irrational. 

I talk to him all the time. I text him several times a day, call maybe 3-4 times a week, and rely on him emotionally. Time spent with him is all of my physical contact and he is the majority of my consistent emotional support. I'm extremely grateful for what hes done for me and I'm pretty damb sure 5 or 10 years later I still will be because hes nothing but respectful and understanding. I've experienced manipulation in several abusive scenarios and either hes extremely dedicated to some incredible long con or he is actually a caring person towards me.

The problem is I'm pretty codependent. I struggle to handle my mental health on my own and I need someone around to help me. He's there for me when I need it, but I'm beginning to want for something outside of that.

I'd just turned 15 the last time I'd dated someone my own age. I've had subtle romantic interests in my peers while in the abusive relationship with the other man, but I havent pursued anything in around 2 years. I want to. I have a crush on a boy in the grade above me. I'm not the most desirable, but I want to date in high school like so many others do. I want to be able to have that experience.

I just dont feel like I could give up my support system I have in him. I know he's going to be there regardless of whether or not we fuck, but it would feel dishonest to be pursuing relationship prospects while also being weirdly emotionally connected to someone else.

I'm just so confused. I'm torn over what to do. I dont know if I can handle throwing away an important part of my life. I need him right now, but I'm not emotionally satisfied. I want to be in a relationship but I dont want to have to build a new one. I don't want to give up the security I've come to need.",31May2019,1
148,"So my good friend has been seeing this guy for a few years now. They've been dating throughout her high school career, and a year since her graduation.

He's incredibly controlling of her. We actually haven't been able to talk for a couple years, because I was only able to talk to her while we went to school together. Just reconnected with her the other day and it turns out they're still together.

She seems really depressed, she's gained a bit of weight, and is having doubts about his loyalty.

It's pretty obvious to me that he's cheating and mentally abusing her, but what can I do to help her? I don't want to cross a line, but it hurts watching her go through this and only staying with him because of the amount of time they've spent together. I don't know how to help, and I worry for her a lot.

How do I go about this?",31May2019,1
149,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in my life I feel like I'm standing at a major crossing path, and I couldn't find anyone who'd give me proper criticism 

My community consists of the rich and wealthy, they're so wealthy they don't question or think of changing anything that seems fucked up... Sexism exists at its core, racism too, they're so obsessed they try to keep their bloodline clean, and they don't EVER bring up the issues in it, they deny it they ignore it 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an abusive alcoholic and addict father who stopped living with us when I was 6. He's an major manipulator, he slips through police and has connections.. He's the kind of a piece of shit scum bag that would spread false accusations and get ppl riled up on you to pressure you into doing shit even if they're false... Rape, drugs, fabrication of signatures and documents, taking advantage of minor's financial rights, mental physical abuse on weaker women particularity my mother... He enjoyed scaring the shit out of her... needless to say, although she's the brightest person i've known, her mentality degraded, she's so paranoid she isn't the same person anymore.. My siblings get over 30 miss calls if they're out not because she's worried, but because she's afraid of him talking shit to her about my siblings.. He's physically not even in the house; he only visits but her fear didn't go away...

&amp;#x200B;

He married my mother for money, she gave him an allowance, and education and shit tons of things, he had two step daughters and they are to this day his sole purpose.. Any money taken from us goes to them.. And they're aware of his doings and support it 

&amp;#x200B;

I understood these things from a very young age, as my mother would vent and I'd listen and see, so I tried my best to make my mother's life easier, I helped my siblings and her, I paid allowances, I paid bills, I got my siblings jobs and got them in well known universities, I looked after my mother's health (I probably talked to over 50 Drs on her behalf, I went to the hospital so much so I know every corner of it; it's like my own house..).. I even taught my siblings whenever they needed.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life from middle school to college revolved around the well being of my mother, and my siblings' future. Because I empathized and felt my mother had suffered enough from my father and her life early on, so living on our own with his minimal presence can be made an easier/happy place for her. I succeeded in that.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother had anger built up as long as I remember, it was let out on me. I was verbally degraded and insulted on an almost daily basis by my mother if she's mad, something like losing her phone or not finding her cards or wallet would set her off like crazy.. Few times she did hit but she regrets her actions and apologizes if it gets that far... Items were thrown and broken from plates to phones... For the first half of my years, the verbal abuse was only done to me in-front of everyone, I guessed because she trusted that I don't get hurt and I'm more mature so she let loose, my siblings got a mild taste from her only after a very long time, but for some reason she just didn't... My sister turned to have anger issues too... but my sister would lose control and hit things..

&amp;#x200B;

I in my 26 years, tried my best, I never once raised my hand on anyone because it's pointless, I rarely if ever get angry, because I reasoned everything can be solved with discussion and if that fails then as humans whose brains are the main advantage it is unfortunate.. I tried to be as fair as I could. Not once have I insulted or degraded anyone or my mother the same way done to me.. I just empathized and took things calmly... 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past weeks I began seeing everything in a different light. Because my attempts in this society that I can't change, and this family that is too broken to be fixed seem to have gone to vain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought if I did my best, then surely everyone will act reasonably and do their parts? But they got greedier and didn't want to do anything since I've been doing everything, and my mother was on my siblings' sides because they're her precious ones.. ""You're the oldest you should understand""...

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month a very trivial incident happened and my younger sister for the first time in my life, knocked my door, and raised her hand on me, something even my mother haven't done in years.. I was in shock, because I helped this person get a job a career a proper living circumstance... I haven't fought back, I just shouted things to get her to think and leave...How could I fight? My mother was there and I feel it's not my place to do so.. I imagined my mother would stop/scold her? No, she again asked me to understand.. The situation was never addressed

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a victim but she's manipulative in her own ways and so is my sister... Today another trivial matter occurred and it had nothing to do with my sister, again she throws things and assaults me... I just had to fight back, it was so bad I have bleeding scratches and bruises but she shut up and backed off eventually... I don't want to press charges, it'll complicate things and I know my sister is immature and this is so petty.. My mother again came to me to tell me she's willing to pay me money, she'll give me ""whatever I want""?... How fucked up can one be as to think that's something I'd want.... When I called her out on her act she almost laughed, and actually tried to guilt me into behaving the way I did.. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm debating on whether I should stop empathizing and just be selfish or not.. I need time off and I found an internship abroad, I can travel but logically I know it'll risk my mother's life, and if she's at risk I'll go back to living with my father which is a worst option.. This is because I can't trust my sister and she's irresponsible enough that my mother was afraid for her own life and was against me going.. What should I do in ur opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like if I look around everything turned to shit tbh, I'm seriously questioning my approach in life. I have no friends because there's not a single person that shared my thoughts in my community they're all brainwashed. You can guess I don't have a partner either, the only thing I can think of is actively look for a partner and move out.. The reason we're living together is because an unmarried woman living alone gets rumors going, and image is the most important thing in this community...so I may as well be forced into marriage

Any advice even if in private would be appreciated,

152,"Last week was a year since me and my gf broke up. A year and a half was our relationship, longest I've ever had (ik its not that long, still felt like I was with her forever). If you want some info on our relationship for background, go to my profile and click on the last post I put in this sub, the first half of it is a detailed description of the first year or so after I broke up with her and how I handled it. 

I've always had imaginary girlfriends throughout my life. Absolutely perfect in every way. I'd fantasize about them and how perfect it would be if they were real. Since I broke up with my gf I can't imagine anyone better than her.


But the thing is, I already went through all the post break up depression. I made a post in here earlier today about seeing her again after months and months of being completely over her. This thought process is more logical, I've sat and thought about it

I've kinda come to the realization that I genuinely don't want to love someone again. I'd give the world for her even if she didn't think of me in a living way ever again, and I'd feel good. I don't want to give that love to another. Maybe a child, but I don't want a wife or another SO

The way I figure it, I met my soul mate. She was beautiful and unique in all the world, and we belonged to  each other. But I met her too early in my life, and made emotionally immature mistakes that I shouldn't have, that every young man makes, that cost me the relationship.

And now I'm better, I have no plans of contacting her or disrupting her life, I already did that once and it lead to nothing but me being depressed I'd never be with her again and essentially putting myself in the friendzone. As much as her bubbly and sweet personality is intoxicating to me, the withdrawal is just too much. I hope she becomes happier than she ever thought she could, she had so many home problems, an assignment she had to do for English class one year about personal struggles brought everyone who read it to tears, she was abused her whole childhood. I hope she finds happiness, she marries and has tons of kids she loves. I hope for her happiness


So im contempt. Last time I ""got over"" her, I tried a no caring approach. That post break up depression hit me hard, but at the end of it I thought ""well, it's just another ex, you've got a long life ahead of you"". But half a year later, I still love her like the day I looked over at her and realized I'd be perfectly happy spending my old age with her by my side. The thought of being with another woman in a serious relationship disgust me. I don't have a problem either pursuing one night stands or short term relationships, but pledging my heart to another just doesn't seem possible or sane to me.

I'd rather focus on myself. I want to become very disciplined, I love Martial arts, but because of personal issues this last year (alot more than just the break up), I haven't been able to pursue them as much, but now I want to completely obsess over it. I've started running every other day and cutting my calories to lose weight, my goal by September is to be 180 and training for a 15k. I want to look attractive and be on a good path and have people look at me and say ""he looks like he has himself together"" that's what I care about. As far as I see it, I met my soul mate, and she was absolutely perfect for me. But shit happens, and people are flawd, especially when they're young boys like I was. So I had my shot, and it didn't work. I think I'm fine with being alone my life. The universe is random and devoid of meaning, so it makes sense that most people who met their soul mate wouldn't grow old with them


I just want know, is this a healthy mentality to be thinking like this? Am I putting myself in a bad corner, or is it healthy to be on the path I set for myself",31May2019,1

156,"Hi, i’m a 20 year old female if that’s relevant. Ever since i was 16 i have been using alchohol as a way to have fun. Seems normal for people who like to party but i do this when i go out with my friends. I’m the only one drinking and i do it because i have anxiety. I have had anxiety always, its more pronounced now that im older. It used to be just average anxiety with certain situations. I have grown to have alot to the point where i stay inside. I’m too afraid to do certin things out of fear, i don’t know if it has worsened because of my relationship or other things but lately i am miserable. When i was younger, i loved summer. Lately i can’t go out during summer, even though its the time to be outside. I find that when i go out with a friend i have to be drinking, if not i can’t loosen up or have fun. The drinking makes my anxiety go away, i don’t know how to describe the feeling when i drink but i’d rather be who i am when i am drunk then otherwise. I am so happy and carefree and I know i can’t do this to myself anymore because drinking has alot of negative effects. I know it’s not good. I don’t want to drink to have fun. I don’t think i’m completely boring when i’m sober i just don’t know how to express myself and open up. I don’t know what i’m really here for.

-early 30s.
-male
-recently moved from business consultant industry where I constantly had imposter syndrome (felt like a fraud, felt like I was going to get called out and ignorance exposed, never felt comfortable)
-moved to ""client side"" in a business analyst position. It is very cross functional and dynamic in the sense that am supposed to put together business cases to aid executives in making business investment decisions.
-performed really confidently in the interview and presented a mock case study with the usual suspects (cash flows, NPV etc). Anyway, I got the job.
-decent pay.
-been in new job less than 3 months.
-starting to get the old imposter feeling. Like I think they (colleagues/managers) think I have a lot more expert knowledge than I actually feel I have.
-fairly de motivated.
-starting to get black or white thinking
-studied to be an engineer, never landed a role in the field. Went straight into corporate and IT consultancy. I always wanted to be an engineer, but if I started in that field now I'd have to go back to beginner status and loose out on my current salary. ... Then again, I consistently feel like a beginner where I am anyway...
-have started gambling in a stupid attempt to win my ticket out of a job. This is really dumb because I'm an engineer by education and understand probabilities.
-in separate issue (maybe linked... I don't know) I feel like there's a rift between my girlfriend and I. And I can't get over the idea of ""what if there's someone better for me out there?"". She really loves me. But it's almost as though I cannot reciprocate as strongly because I'm wondering if we are the best match. To make matters more complicated, we live together so any separation is a big deal.

Questions are 
1. Job. Am I being a little b1tch and should just shut it and be happy about my position? After all a lot of people are really struggling financially and have real problems. Do I go for broke and search for engineer beginner positions? Maybe a different corporate role where I can maintain my salary level but feel more competent...

I was in a unprovoked altercation several years ago. He took it way too far and it got to the point that I legitimately thought I was going to die.

I remember begging him to stop and thinking that it didn't sound like my voice while I pleaded.

It caused me to lose my job. I couldn't handle being around people any more. It has impacted every relationship I've had since. Some people don't understand why I feel the way I do. Sometimes I don't myself.

170,"Hey all,

Look, I’ve been trying to put it off and deny it for years. But I don’t feel comfortable in my own body. It’s not expressing who I am on the inside. I’m trying to acknowledge that now. 

Inside I am not my birth gender. And I’m mad. I’m angry that I have to deny that in front of my family and the world. Of course it’s never been verbally stated that I wouldn’t be accepted if I came out, but it doesn’t need to be. My parents have given me plenty of signals about their views on the lgbtq front.

I’m going to to college soon and I can finally try to be myself. But how am I supposed to do that in front of my family? Is it even worth it? Right now it doesn’t feel worth it.

So, exactly. I can’t. I don’t know if I ever can. I will be screamed at. Disowned. Possibly threatened and hit. Why bother with that?

I’m fine with hiding from them. I’ve already done it for years. Might as well continue the charade.

But how do I tell my partner? My partner, who is quite straight? I have no idea how they would react. They said once that if we were the same gender we would be good friends but we wouldn’t be together. How would they take it if I came out with this? We’ve brought up long term plans for being together. And their parents are extremely homophobic and transphobic like mine. 

What should I even do? I don’t know how much longer I can lie to myself like this. But I don’t want to lose my partner.

All advice is appreciated. If anyone has had a common experience with this I’d love to hear about that too. Maybe it will help.

It was obvious he had interest in me but he started taking things very quickly and I didn’t feel comfortable with that. By fast I mean he was getting really lover dovey and we are nothing. Like nothing. I have been talking with friends about it and they all said I needed to say something before it escalated into something bigger. I listened to it and I wanted to do something but I felt like he wouldn’t like that, so I kept it for some time. By some time I don’t mean months, weeks, etc, I mean probably days. By this time our “relationship” was escalating too quickly and I didn’t like it so I distanced myself a little. I don’t really know if I am the weird one, but I can’t stand being with someone all the time. By that I mean like hanging all day with that person. It’s exhausting and maybe I just wanna go with my friends. I did that, and he thought I was mad at him or something. I told him I wasn’t and also said that I needed to talk to him. I told him that I am currently not interested in being in a relationship rn and that I prefer to be friends for now and get to know each other before becoming something bigger, you know. I also told him how I didn’t really like being touched all the time and that it made me uncomfortable. After telling him I felt SOOO relieved. The day after he stopped talking to me completely. I tried talking to him but he was so cold I backed away. He then later texted me that he feels like I have been lying to him all this time (???) and that I was just using him and that “he just can’t be just friends with me”. I got so pissed. I told him how I felt and now he is playing the victim card against me.

173,"I am currently 30 years old. I’ve had quite a rough go of life. At 22 years old I was diagnosed with cancer stage III Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Prior to my diagnosis I was in college and in spite of a rough start I was doing quite well. I started college immediately after my parents had gotten divorced and it was quite a rough time. So towards the beginning of college I don’t think I was ready mentally to handle the responsibilities. When I started to preform well I was diagnosed with cancer and was given three months to live. Somehow I survived and I’m currently in remission. After the treatment I was dating a woman and decided not to go back to college but instead to begin work as a paralegal even though my true passion lies in the English language and in writing in general.

I had just stopped taking some meds that fucked me up mentally that I was put on by my abusive mother. She just turned 13 and when she gets her she'll be on her period. I'm fucking socially awkward as is, plus there's a 5 year gap between us, and because of that aforementioned medication I'm not even mentally my age. I'm some mix of 20 year old and 7 year old.

Dynamic: his older brother is the golden child (his mom’s words, jokingly, not mine) who is the first born and married to a girl who is nothing like me. She is a business owner and her family is super close with my husbands family. Also her dad is a big time doctor, and her mom and his mom were friends. They went on family vacations together, etc. his older brother is a teacher for a private school. They are very “basic”, typical family, picture perfect (literally) and just had a baby. I am a girl with a tech degree, a broken home (I’ve had to learn how to defend for myself). I will be the first to admit that I’m pretty quiet and “closed off”. I’m more of a daydreamer and introvert. So is my husband. 

My husband is a bit of the black sheep in the family. He is not super conservative, we’re gamer nerds, and trying to get financially steady before we even think about having kids but it’s not really on the table right now. We’re both in the insurance business, and not “well off” but we definitely have wiggle room when it comes to finances in contrast to his brother and his wife. We have a rescue dog which is basically our kid, and are a bit adventurous. We plan on going on lots of trips and just want to enjoy ourselves. We both watched our parents struggle and stress, and we just want to have fun while we can.  We are definitely the “fun couple” but also the “joke”. 

The problem is, I’ve noticed since day one of dating my husband that his family has a tendency to sort of dote on and pay more attention to his brother and wife. This has something my husband has always noticed and complained about. Once or twice is no big deal, but this has gotten weird. I’ve even started to notice this. My husband LOVES his family and they’re good people. I love them too. It’s just lately we don’t even really want to be around them. I try to start a conversation and get ignored. We both try to chime in on things and we get talked over. Tonight, we sat in the living room and got so burnt out on getting tuned out, it was like we weren’t even in the room. I’m usually pretty level headed on this kind of stuff, and tell him it’s going to be okay- that it’s the new baby or (insert some fun life event of theirs) but I don’t have any excuses for them anymore. Tonight we just walked outside to play with our dog. We didn’t know how to even get a leg in on the conversation. I could seriously see him fighting back tears when watching our dog run around. I’m just worried about him and I’m worried this is going to get worse as time goes on. I have a good family, broken, but good. I have good extended family as well who is super fun loving and great, so I’m not worried that we’ll be totally isolated, but I just know how important my husbands family is to him.

188,My “friends” post pics and vids of them hanging out on Snapchat. None of them has interacted with me at school over text or away from school besides from a nod or half smile.

189,"For context, we’re both females and bi. My best friend texted me yesterday and she just randomly asked if I had a crush on anyone. I said no because I don’t &amp; I didn’t find the question that weird because we’re young high schoolers &amp; random questions like that are expected. She asked other questions like what my type was, and then she asked if I had ever liked her, which I kinda just brushed off cause I thought she was joking. She then confesses that she liked me before she started dating her boyfriend. She also says that she still likes me a bit but she has a boyfriend and she doesn’t want to ruin our relationship.

So at this point I’m not really sure what to say,, but she asks me again if I’ve ever liked her &amp; I say that I actually did when we first met. Which is true, when we first met I did like her a bit but it went away quickly because she’s my best friend now, &amp; it was never a crush. She doesn’t know what to say either &amp; the conversation ends with her saying that she misses me &amp; I say I miss her too.

The next morning, I keep thinking about it &amp; over analyzing the situation, as I do with most situations. Some questions I have are, why did she tell me this if she has a boyfriend? What would she even do if I liked her back? Would she break up with her boyfriend over this? I never even saw signs of her ever liking me. Is this a prank? I then conclude after overthinking things that she’s messing with me &amp; I start crying &amp; having anxiety that she lied and just wanted me to say that I liked her or something. 

The thing is, my best friend is super pretty, she has lots of friends, very likable &amp; friendly, she’s just a really nice person that people generally like and I’m just baffled she even calls me her best friend. Me on the other hand, I’m basically a loser. I’m revolting to look at, very insecure, fat, shy, weird, just generally unlikable. I know Im not the ugliest person in the world or anything but I’m probably the most insecure person in the world. She calls me pretty &amp; compliments my personality but I don’t really believe it because I’m extremely insecure &amp; I hate myself a lot. So this insecurity just leads me to think that she just was messing with me.

I keep thinking that she was at a sleepover or something &amp; she texted me with another friend as a prank and they were laughing at my gullible responses. Shes not the type of person to do that at all but I can’t help but imagine it... because there’s no way that someone (especially someone like her) could have a crush on me.

She seems like she loves me a lot but I still can’t help but think it was a prank because of how incredibly insecure I am about who I am. Do you think I’m overreacting or is this normal to worry about? I know I should talk to her about it but do you have any advice on how to approach it? We never really closed on anything it was just random when she said she liked me. ( I guess to make it less random, she told me after school on the last day of school.)",31May2019,1

194,"So I met this girl at the college I go to, seemed real nice. We were in the same class for a semester, but only ever spent time with each other outside of class until the end of the semester. She seemed like she really liked me in all honesty, even insisted to buy my lunch once. When we hung out I got no inclination whatsoever that she wasn't interested or even that she just wanted to be friends or something.

I managed to get her number (like two days before the semester ended) and I told her that I'd text her later that day. This is where the confusing part comes in because I literally have no idea what to make of it. When I texted her and didn't get a reply after a few hours, I realized the texts I sent hadn't been delivered for some reason. I didn't think much of it though, I thought that I'd just bring it up the next time I saw her, which I did. As I expected, she told me that she hadn't gotten any texts. When I tried texting her again to show her it wasn't going through, to my surprised this time it actually did and I saw her receive it as well. Thought it was really strange, but again didn't think anything of it and she told me to text her later again since this was actually the last day of the semester and we had no more classes together. You can probably guess what happened when I tried texting her again later that day, none of my messages were delivered. Now I'm really confused because literally just a couple hours ago it was working. I figured that its also possible her phone is dead or something and that's why they aren't being delivered. Next day, still not delivered. Tried texting her again, no delivery. Tried sending as sms, no reply. Tried sending her a text through Whatsapp, it says delivered but no reply. Tried calling her, phone took a few seconds then rang twice and straight to voicemail. What the hell????

&amp;#x200B;

Did she block my number or something? But she unblocked it before going to class and seeing me and then blocked it again after? It makes no sense, the last time I saw her she literally told me to text her wtf?? I'm not even sure that blocking someones number will stop their texts from being delivered.

This may be straightforward for some but for me it’s different I guess 


I was at a recent graduation party with a couple of friends. At the party was a couple that’s been together for two years. This couple got completely shit faced like beyond mad. And at that point it was obvious that these two people should not be together. Pushing and shoving , mean words, just over all in my opinion not really good for each other. 

fast forward two days and it comes out that she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend. C’est la vie it happens blah blah. Now here I am 4 days after the breakup and I revive a text message from a certain new single boy 

We’ve talked like that before but right before it got serious he got with her for two years. I tried to console her at the party that he cared about her and wanted what’s best but she was drunk and maybe she did pick something up idk

199,"I’ve been at my job for about 3 years, and I am so, so tired. I’m a groomer and I absolutely love the dogs, but the stress corporate puts on us is overwhelming. No matter how hard I work and how many policies/focuses I follow, it’s impossible to meet every goal. They’ve started offering coupons where half comes out of my commission. There’s too much to do and not enough time to do it all well, and overtime is not allowed. I’m so drained at the end of the day that I often just lay on the couch for an hour before I can do anything else. I feel justified in wanting to leave, but I feel terrible about leaving my coworkers.

I just moved states and started at a different location this week. Multiple coworkers have told me how thankful they are to have me because they’ve been extremely short staffed for months. Literally so short staffed they had to reduce the hours, which I’ve never heard of being approved before. 

After my second day I cried on the way home. My old location had all the same problems, but I worked with my best friend, and had the move to look forward to. Now it feels like there’s just a lot less to distract me from the parts that I don’t like. For me own health I just don’t think I can last much longer. I don’t see this job as a career, moving up would be less pay (because I’m on commission I make more than my manager) and even more stress.

Before they moved in we sorted out a time for my roommate and his girlfriend to come have a look so they could make up their minds if they wanted to move in with us. She had nothing nice to say about the house such as it was “dirty” and we had just moved in a week prior. She complained about the grass, the kitchen, how small their room is. She made up her mind and decided to not move in with our roommate and she lives elsewhere. 

She also has not had one conversation with my girlfriend who she’s met multiple times before. Keep in mind my girlfriends parents own this house. It is very awkward when my roommates girlfriend is over because she will not talk to my girlfriend. 

Roughly 8 weeks ago she quit her job to go away for another job for 6 weeks out of town. I don’t think she’s gotten her job back or got a new one and I’m worried that our roommate isn’t telling us she is slowly moving in. She comes over a lot, leaves the lights on and she’s eaten some of my food.

She then suggested that he could make a tinder account and see how it goes just so he could know that it's not easy to find someone. 

He waited about 5-6 months but couldn't find any matches. She seemed relieved about that, and seemed conflicted about having an open relationship. She didn't seem on board with it but said it was kinda okay and wanted to see how it goes, but nothing happened and I thought it was over.

On our group chat with two of them, her boyfriend accidently posted something he wanted to send to my best friend asking what worked for his tinder profile, and deleted it immediately but I saw it. It seems the tinder profile is still there and he's looking to date someone else too.

215,"Hello, I’m in desperate need for help, as I can’t go any longer. Me a 17M is best friends with a 17F, and we’ve been friends for roughly 6 months now. 
Anyway, around March she broke up with a guy and looked to me for comfort, and this is when I learned from one of her friends that she liked me a little. From here our friendship sky-rocketed and we have become very close. 
But at the same time in March, she liked another guy. At the time I didn’t think much of this since I only liked her as a friend and didn’t expect much to come from it, intact I thought she’d choose me.
In April, I ended up asking her to prom and we went and had a good time and this is when I really started to like her. So after prom I asked her friend if she still liked me, and shockingly it was a No. Instead she still liked the other guy and this news was really heartbreaking for me, especialIy since we just went to prom and started to like her. 
After crying a bit I got over it and wanted to stop talking to her. The problem is she wouldn’t let me go, she only continued to talk to me and lead me on. So throughout April into May I kept falling for her and kept my hopes high, thinking I could earn her love back. And not so surprisingly at the end of the school year, I asked her friend again and she was still into the other guy, and she said yes. Honestly I didn’t even care because I was expecting that so I shrugged it off and stopped talking to her again for my own sake.
Now this is when shit got real. About last week is when I found out she didn’t like me and I shrugged it off. But into this week she asked to hangout, and we ended up watching a movie when she surprisingly put her head on my shoulder. So I put my head on her head and we went on. The next day she asked me to go out to lunch, which obviously my desperate self did. We actually had a really good time and talked a lot. So the day after I invited her to my house to watch another movie and she gladly accepted. Right at the start she put her head onto my shoulder but moved down to my chest and that’s when I put my arm around her. She was comfortable with it and seemed like she really liked it. So we cuddled. Also to note, she initiated it both times. 
With these events my hope had never been higher, I thought that maybe I’ve finally won her over. She cuddled with me twice, went out to lunch with me and had never been that comfortable with me. So I told her friend of these events only to learn that she’s apparently done this with other guys and she thinks she’s leading me on and still likes this other dude. This happened yesterday and I was devastated. Low key I cried and went to bed. 
Today I tried again to not talk to her, to finally stop this nonsense and get her to stop leading me on. She ended up calling me and I answered in a pretty shit mood. She texted me asking if I was Ok and I said yea, I’m just a bit worried for SAT and ACT testing coming up, when in reality it’s because she’s only ruined me. 
Now I’m stuck here, I have no clue what to do. I value our friendship so fucking much and I’d hate to lose it, but at the same time I can’t stand her leading me on. What do I do? Honestly I don’t know what I can do, should I just ask if she likes me? If she’s leading me on? If she hates me? I can’t stop thinking about this and I need it to stop. Please help me...",31May2019,2

221,"Hi all, I apologize in advance for the long post-- I'll put a tldr at the end. 

As some background, I grew up living 5,000 miles away from my dad and never really had a super solid relationship with him. Since we live so far away, and travel is expensive, I don't get to see him a lot. He also doesn't really put in the effort to come to me, but I know that he really appreciates it when I come see him, even if he isn't the best at expressing it. So I haven't seen him in a couple of years and was able to take a few weeks off this summer to come and visit him. He lives on a very remote island, in a small town, with a whole lot of nothing surrounding it. The nearest major town is over an hour away by car with literally nothing in between except for 3 gas stations. Some other background is that my dad has struggled with drugs and alcohol in the past but has been very vocal lately about his lifestyle change and that he's cut out alcohol almost entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I planned to come out here and spend time with him, and I've been here a week now. My dad messaged me a week or so before I came out telling me that he got a car for me to drive--this was super thoughtful, but kind of unnecessary since I figured I'd be doing a lot with my dad anyway and didn't want him to spend the money. So, I get here, and the next day we plan to pick up my ""car"". A couple hours into the day, while my dad is running errands, he calls me to tell me that he has traded the ""car"" for a ""mercedes"". Okay, cool. We go to pick up the car, which I learn is an unregistered vehicle that is literally falling apart, has no power steering, no interior panels, no air, no anything. My dad decides it's a good idea to leave his truck with the guy we got this car from to do an oil change. Let's just say this guy has had my dad's truck for the entire time I've been here and has messed itup so badly that the truck needs to be towed an hour away to another town to be fixed. SO, what was going to be me having a car turned into my dad borrowing an unregistered vehicle that I don't feel comfortable driving and that he doesn't really want to take me anywhere in. I've been here a week and I have literally done absolutely nothing, and my dad really doesn't give a shit. He has made comments on multiple occasions that ""it is what it is"".

I'm trying not to be upset about this because I know on some level it's not his fault, but what's annoying me is that his girlfriend is coming to visit him three days after I leave and all he is talking about is how he needs to have the car fixed by the time she is here and how they're going to go zip-lining and do all of these great, fun things.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, and kind of the more pressing issue, is my dad's roommate. When I booked my trip, I was under the impression that my dad's roommate was no longer living with him. That's not the case. My dad's roommate is a serious alcoholic--I'm talking up at 8 am drinking a glass of vodka. He really doesn't respect personal space and is very clingy. I woke up a couple of days ago to 5 missed calls, 2 texts, and a facebook message from him that he sent while I was sleeping. Since I can't go anywhere, I am in the house with him a lot and I don't like it. My dad doesn't seem to care about his behavior or notice it as problematic. About 2 hours ago, and what prompted me to write this, my dad's roommate informed me that a woman is on a flight RIGHT NOW to come and stay with us and that he has to take the car to the airport to get her. He then proceeds to say what a crazy, wild woman she is and how she'll just sit around doing lines of coke. I am REALLY not okay with this. I dont know if he's even asked my dad if it's okay for her to come; he has definitely mentioned it in passing and my dad hasn't said anything, which leads me to believe that my dad doesn't care. I kind of wish he would have at least asked me if I was okay with her coming, or set some boundaries with the roommate. As it is I feel uncomfortable around him and just really cannot deal with this extra person on top of this.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, my dad's drinking has not stopped. Last night in particular, although it was in response to the loss of a pet, he downed a whole bottle of whiskey and said he didn't sleep at all. He is currently passed out on the couch while the roommate prepares to take the unregistered car to pick up his coke addict girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm here, with no car, with a dad who doesn't really seem to care, one (almost 2) sketchy roommates, and no idea what to do. I would rent a car, but because I'm under 25 it would cost over $900 for my next 2 weeks here. I looked at changing my ticket, but again it would cost about $700, which is more than I paid for the whole thing in the beginning. I'm also worried that if I leave early, it will strain my already weak relationship with my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that if I talk to him about any of this he'll just say ""is it what it is"" or say that since the roommate pays rent he can do what he wants. I have friends I could stay with here and there but again, would be stranded wherever I go without a car. I need advice with how to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I am stuck on a remote island with my dad, his drunk roommate, the drunk roommates druggie girlfriend, and no car. I don't know if I should pay almost $1000 to leave or if there is a way to handle this.",31May2019,1
223,"On Tuesday night my best friend and I got into an argument with our other two really close friends (lets call them Jade and Olivia). It was over something really stupid and for some reason Jade and Olivia wouldn't let it die down. They kept posting about it on their social media and whenever we asked why they haven't gotten over it they would ignore the question. We had made plans to hang out together in a shopping center on the last day of school (Thursday) but when we asked Jade she said she was busy. My best friend and I still decided to hang out alone, but when walking around WE SAW JADE hanging out with a different group of kids. I went up to her and confronted her about why she was lying and that she could have told my best friend and I  that she just didn't want to hang out. Jade was shocked and just walked away ignoring me. The kids Jade was hanging out with were kids she always talked shit about and my best friend and I have text messages with proof of her talking about how much she hated them and wanted to stop talking to them. Idk if I should tell the kids about what a liar she is or just let her be toxic to them, but I am down to only one close friend now and I'm so done with this school year.",31May2019,1
224,"Not sure if it counts as nsfw but just in case, I marked it as such. also, throwaway because inevitable judgement.

So after a dry spell from hell my horny side kinda started making decisions stupidly. Ive been following this account on SnapChat of a girl who sells nudes, videos, and hookups. Every day she posts freebies on her page, censoring a bit but it gets the job done. Theres an appeal to the idea of the snapchat porn being more interactive than free online porn that always had me interested 


Anyway, the point is, I give, and i buy a "" premium package"" that is supposed to be for a drop box with a ton of videos and nudes and a few other things. 

Right after I payed, she disappears. Her snapchat story is gone, i can no longer see it, but it says were still friends, so im not sure what the technical explanation for that is, idk if ive been blocked or what. 

Anyway- the advice i need is this. 

I found her information, which includes her twitter, her youtube, her facebook, which also includes her boyfriends facebook, family and friends, hell I even have her address, not that I would do anything with that, but I have it.

Im really heavily considering just popping a post or message on her personal profile just to let her know, I know who she really is, so either she sends me my money back, or gives me what I paid for, or, well. She can draw conclusions as to what might happen if she doesnt. (I have screenshotd and video recordings of her snap story, which have her face, tattoos, voice, etc. as well as all our messages being saved. 


Should I or should I not go through with it, why or why not, what other alternatives do I have.

Im not the type to blackmail. and i get that i kinda brought this one upon myself, but at the same time. Im being scammed, so i feel like shes also kinda asking for this. idk. help?",31May2019,1
225,"Just to give you a bit of context, I moved back in with my family five months ago and we have been arguing often.  I am working part time while looking for a full time job since January. My parents haven’t asked me to start paying rent yet. So I usually clean the house and sometimes cook for the fam during the weekdays. I do find it a bit frustrating because I don’t like cleaning and cooking. But I don’t pay rent so I try my best and some days I don’t do some chores which upset my parents. I think everyone should be responsible for their own mess. 

We got in to a fight tonight because I brought stuff from the past when my mom got mad at me and she was just yelling “fuck you loser” and throwing my shit around. My parents got mad because I ruined their night by bringing up stuff from the past and they basically told me to just stay quiet if they ever have something to say to me. They told me that I am not respectful and I am always blaming other people. These kind of arguments happen pretty often and I usually end up crying all night when we fight. They do not really communicate well. I do not think we have ever resolved arguments before. We just avoid each other for a few days and pretend like nothing happened. 

I have been thinking about moving out because I cannot keep arguing, being yelled at and crying. 
Should I move out?? Is it my fault? Maybe I am being disrespectful and being a whiny bitch and cannot see it. I know that I can be annoying at times and I do appreciate that they let me live rent free and they sacrificed a lot for me to go to school and stuff. What do I do? I am just so confused right now because I don’t have a career, not getting along with my family and do not really know what I want to do with my life.

He always respects my boundaries, but sometimes I feel like he doesn’t bother asking because I say that I don’t want to so often. He’s been super great and I really feel like we need to meet more in the middle with this because he’s super tolerant with me.

229," 

Let’s preface this that this is originally posted in [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/). I have finally hit the point where I need anonymous support/advice/help from the internet and here I am. Here is background on me

I am a 19M in the dc metro area. I graduated high school (May 2018) with 21 college credits (4.0) and a 3.85uw/4.5w G.P.A. I am studying to get into I.T. and Cyber Security. My senior year of high school I had an internship with the National Cancer Institute and Leidos. At the end of that internship I landed another one with Sony. It was only supposed to be for a summer(ft), but it went over the school year(pt) and am starting my second summer. At the end of this summer, I will be starting a co-op with an agency under the DOD. My clearance has been issued (had poly and psych) and that will last until I get my B.S. I am currently enrolled in a community college and will be transferring to a 4 year. In all, my college education will cost about 15k and I will graduate with around 5 years work experience.

I currently am winning when it comes down on the education and financial sides of my life but am severely losing when it comes to the social. I run a not-for-profit that runs bowling tournaments, help out in boy scouts(am eagle) and help with the community college cyber team. I like bowling, league of legends, pottery, woodworking, bladesmithing, dancing (ballroom) and cyber stuff. Non of these really gets me involved in casual social situations or where it really matters girls. I have been raised an independent person. I own my own car, pay for gas, do laundry, do dishes, cook, clean, heck I live on my own in Tysons corner for the summer right now. But alas I am alone. I have no friends to hang out with, no social life to introduce me to girls and I am very lonely. What can I do to find casual stabilizing friends? Friends that are accessible and allow me to vent or talk about normal stuff? What can I do to get a gf? I pretty much have it all at my age that I could have, car, gaming computer, sweet job, no worry for finances or education. But I have no friends to hang out with. I am lonely and ask you reddit for you support, help and advice.

P.S. Sorry for getting so real.",31May2019,1

231,"I really care about my brother. While our relationship has never been perfect there use to be a time where we would hang out. He ended up meeting a girl, getting engaged and living for one year away from the family (were both over 18)  then the next 2 years of their relationship living in the same apartment complex as me.

In those 2 years (3 months they both lived with me so they could save up rent). He never really engaged to hangout with me. When we lived together we never hung out once. And when he lived in the same apartment complex for 2 years he never came over to just say hi.

The only time would be is if he was getting fast food on rare occasions he’d invite me to go. And he’d do most the talking then just put on vines or Tiktoks.

When his fiancé went on a work trip for a month I went over after work everyday to help with their puppy. (Ontop of doing my own retail job). He always ignored me every time I went over and on a couple occasions would get annoyed that I interrupted his video game session. To help with the puppy he asked me to help with. Right after i got off work. And later into the evening. 

His relationship ended up failing and the wedding was called off. (She kept the dog) 

My father helped me while my brother was at work clear everything for his ex and his apartment that was his.

We had arranged the day we learned that he would stay with me. 

We did all of his laundry. Organized everything. And set up the extra bedroom in the apartment IN A DAY. After I had worked a 8 hour shift. I did it till midnight then slept.

It’s been two months since then and we’ve never hung out once. Our days off align perfectly. (We each have 3 days off in a row now). 

When he moved in I gave him space since he was grieving the relationship. Which he’s done. He’s dating a new girl. He goes out with his friends. He works hard at his job.

But I feel like he could care less about me. Like if I vanished from his life. He wouldn’t care and it wouldn’t matter. My family gets mad if I ask them about this or advice. Saying he’s always been focused on himself it’s nothing personal.

It feels personal though. 

And while I’m happy he’s in a relationship. The small hangout times when he’d get food on rare occasions is gone since he uses that time to talk with her. 

He also doesn’t help in the apartment (which I could care less about since I like cleaning anyway) all I’ve asked is him to keep his bedroom clean. And he can’t even do that. It smells so bad in there.

I’ll even help with laundry (because unlike me who works 8-9 hour shifts he works 12 hour shifts). And he doesn’t even say thanks.

How do you guys just accept a family members will always be there for you in a emergency but on day to day life. They could care less about you. 

Also he does spend time if my father and mother family are involved. Like it’s a holiday or planned event. But he never really asks them to hangout either.",31May2019,1

3 years ago I split up from my first love who still means the world to me. We dated for 2 years and everything went really well. The only reason we split up was because the pressure of keeping our relationship a secret (we wasn’t out as gay at the time) It caused us to argue and say nasty things to each other etc. 

Here is where i need your advice.. 

I’ve always missed him but recently I’ve REALLY been missing him to the point where I’m wanting to contact him asking hows life etc. We haven’t spoke in 3 years or neither seen each other. I’ve had thoughts in my head like how different it would be now that I’m out as gay (hopefully he’s out now too) and how different it would be since we’ve grown up from being 17/18 to now in our 20’s. I just feel like it would be SOO diffident now but for the better.

I was speaking to a student (let's call them A) about how their maths revision was going. A informed me that their maths teacher (B) had been hypnotising the class (possibly classes) to help them pass. A went back to class after a break and the other learners were ""sleeping"" on their desks. The lecturer informed A they were hypnotising the learners to help them pass their exams. A left in a state of WTF.

I find this EXTREMELY concerning. B is in a position of trust and is hypnotising vulnerable young adults. They'll be in the age range of 16 to 18. It almost seems laughable.

I have no idea what to do at this point. If I go to her line manager, or safeguarding or what. It's such a weird situation I don't know if it falls under a safeguarding issue. I don't know if I am overreacting, or if I'd just get laughed out the door. I have zero proof beyond what this student has told me.

Exercise - Kickboxing, Jogging, Weight Lifting / at-least 3 times a week

Socialising - Joined a social club, met with old friends regularly

Mindfulness - Practicing meditation daily for 15 minutes

Eating Good Food - I cook and prepare my own food and I am getting more than my 5 a day

Shrooms - Tripping on shrooms in Amsterdam (I was convinced the next day I woke up that I got over it but it slowly crept in a few days later)

Reading - Trying to understand what I went through, the emotions I am currently experiencing and what was going through that individuals head when he was being weird and aggressive. 

Therapist - Went to 10 sessions and didn’t make a difference, not spending that much money again. I feel like it’s PTSD but therapist says it’s not fit for that category, just that it’s in the spectrum.

243,"I’m currently living in an apartment with two of my closest friends. One of them was my best friend just months ago but it has become very apparent that neither of us are huge fans of each other at this point. Bottom line is after months of covering his 1/3 of the rent/bills he owes me nearly $900 and by the time our lease is up (in three months) I expect this to reach a little over $1k. I know he owes my other roommate at least $300+. The amount he’s owed me hasn’t amounted to much since last October (the last time he paid me - about $50). 

I know money is tight for him and I’m in no way cash-strapped, but he’s constantly a dick to me and I fear that when our lease ends I’ll lose contact with him, and with that a decent amount of money. He shouldn’t be as broke as he is, but he’s extremely irresponsible with his savings. While he complains about not having much and relies on his parents for rent, he goes to concerts, buys weed regularly, and always eats out. He quit one of his two jobs and with his hours recently slashed at his current job, he’s failed to follow through with his claim to apply for a second job. Bottom line is he’s irresponsible, but he’ll never see it that way. 

Do I chalk this up to a loss? I don’t need the money, but these were my hard-earned dollars. I’m afraid to bring anything up to him because of how he might retaliate. I don’t want to approach his parents because they’re nice people and I know they filed for bankruptcy a little over a year ago (but according to the roommate this doesn’t seem to affect his earnings at all).

245,"I don't know if this is the right place to post it, but I am desperate. So I am a 16 year old from california, and last year my dad cheated on my mom so bad.

Let me give a little background: I'm Muslim, my parents have been married for 25 years and counting, my dad has actually started this cheating thing since 2011, and he was planning on proposing to this woman and running away to live with her kids.

Around April 2018 (my birthday month), I came back home from school, and went up behind my dad, and he quickly closed out of a tab (he's done that many times before, and I should've noticed it earlier), and I tried not to think of it. Until my birthday came, he didn't say happy birthday at all, and I wanted to go out and eat dinner as a family, but he didn't come home until 12 am. I was so upset, but then instead of yelling, it then hit me that something was wrong.

Back then I used my dad's old computer, and I didn't erase his account but changed the name because I didn't want to delete any of his files (he believed I made a new account). I checked the browser that he used, internet explorer, and I immediately saw a website for this Muslim dating website. I clicked on it and went to my dad's profile, the proceeded to his messages and saw many women he was chatting with and my first instinct was to take pictures of all of that, and I needed answers, so I texted the one person on earth I could ask advice on, my brother.

He saw the pictures and texted back saying he would explain everything and that he was so sorry I found out that way and that he found out in 2014. After texting him, it all made since. Those nights were my dad talked on the phone with someone and I assumed it was his family. Why he was late and sometimes slept in another room. My parents have a rocky relationship so no one asked questions (my mom, brother, and me).

A week after I sifted through evidence and kept pictures and receipts, I noticed the same women popping up. And as I dug deeper into their messages on Facebook, I learned the woman was out of the country and both planned extensively on marriage. The Islamic law about marriage varies, some families choose it, and some don't, and my family is extremely against it. This women said that he can marry her, it doesn't matter, or that his wife (my mom) doesn't have a say.

At this point I felt utterly disgusted, what broke my heart was when he said he couldn't wait to love and care for her children (she was divorced with a few kids), and it hurt because he never loved us the way he promised he would to her. What was even more disgusting is that they discussed her period and when they could make a baby.

After a week and a half (basically 10 days since I had figured out), I couldn't hold it in. I had to tell my mom, I just couldn't lie to her. My brother said not to, but I obviously couldn't. So i told her, at first she didn't believe me, but than she overheard him one night and went completely ballistic.

The past few months were and still are pretty hard, but basically let me jump right in.

My dad has been acting strange again, like going into a separate room, he's been active on the old Facebook account that he used to talk to that girl (though he promised he would never touch it) and he's been so distant and cruel to us again. But this time he knows how to be sneaky, so I can't catch him, what do I do to find out?

TL;DR- Dad cheated on mom with girl he wanted to marry last year, now I have this gut feeling he's doing it again, how can I find out if he's being extra sneaky.",31May2019,2

She has told me countless stories of how he would abuse her, such as physically and verbally assaulting her. But to add rape onto that already extensive list just sickens me. I’m heart broken that my mom has held onto this secret for so long, and I’m disgusted that my uncle has faced no consequences for his actions. And I have so much inner turmoil over what to do. This disgusting human filth has been at every Christmas dinner, every visit with my grandmother, even to some of my high school sporting events.

She lets him sleep over with us whenever we visit, and I can’t even begin to understand the rationale behind that. I hate this sick man with every fiber of my being and I don’t know how I can continue to talk to my grandmother knowing she did nothing to help my mom. I’ve seen my uncle once since finding out, and I nearly attacked him out of pure rage at the sight of him. How do I continue? What do I do? Do I confront him?

Okay so I work at a place that has multiple companies in one building.
I see this woman everyday in passing and we usually had a one or two word exchange and that’s it. Nothing more.
I started to notice that she looks in my direction longer in passing and smiling like she was begging me to speak to her and I wasn’t getting the hint. 

So today I asked her what her name after the usual hi/hello... bye/bye we do in passing.

And she responded by saying: “you’re usually so quiet when you pass by why do you want to know my name”

Me: I see you everyday we always say hi to each other so I wanted to know your name.

Her: (she tells me her name)

Me: (I tell her my name)

... and the conversation kinda awkwardly turns into another okay bye. If I could turn back time I would’ve said “nice to meet you” or something 🤦🏽‍♂️

But anyways how do I progress this further to find out more about her, talk to her more, become her friend, maybe more if she likes me in that way?

I have a girlfriend who’s last semester starts in the fall.  We’ve been together 3 years.  She’s the one.  She works a bit to pay rent at her uni.

I bought a place last year.  It has an extra room I rent out to a friend.  It’s a hefty mortgage for one man.

I’ll be 30 next April.  

I want to quit my job.  I want to join a band, spend more time with my SO, friends and family and smoke some legal weed.  I want to get healthy again.  Workout again.  Maybe take online classes.  Join a beer league.  I want a social life beyond airport bars and sales dinners.

I know if I stay at this job I’ll be set up; it pays well with amazing benefits, I’m  well respected, and constantly challenged.  There’s tons of room for upward mobility.  I just feel that I’m missing out on life.  I gave up the last four years to this company, I was 25 when I started.  

I’d like to add that I am not a college graduate and this job is about as good as I can ever hope for in terms of salary, benefits and retirement fund.  My friends who are graduates don’t even get a deal this good (but they dont have to travel 300 days a year)

253,"THIS IS VERY LONG** Ages are vague because I've posted before and the situation had a Similar age gap 

Backstory:
Told my FWB I've known for YEARS I was in love with him. And it feels like a sickness. I never meant to fall for him it just hit me like a train.and looking back, this guy dogged me out. He NEVER asked about me or my life. But I knew everything about his, if he were mad or sad hed vent to me. But hed always remind me he doesnt care about others. And he still to this day brags about being a sociopath. He prides himself on all the women hes hurt and I know this because hes told me a ton of stories. Saying the women were crazy after him ect. We were so close and he would always give me hope that one day we would be together. Hed CONSTANTLY drunk text me saying he had feelings for me and call me everyday, only to go cold and mention other women right in front if me. When I told him he got MAD, but I feel like he knew. It was my first time getting drunk and he steered the convo towards us and asked if I loved him and it all poured out.
He then got pissed at me. He was almost OFFENDED and said this was a mood killer. He looked me in my face and said he didnt feel the same. Times before this he would constantly mention his type of girl and i honestly never felt enough. So as much as it hurt, after that night I decided to chose me.

Now:
I've come to terms that I was manipulated and he treated me like shit. He calls everyday but i don't answer, barely reply to his text and I've made a lot of new friends. The vibe I get from him is bitter? Hes obviously mad me, any time I chose to reply he jumps at the chance to leave me on read which use to HURT but now I just laugh. We are supposed to be going to a show and I asked him what time and he made jokes AROUND the question, and its obvious that he doesnt want to go but hes so immature he cant outright say it. This guy is 30 years old. 

So my question is, why is he so mad at me when HE dogged me out and I'm chosing to distance myself after hes said he doesnt want me?

TL;DR : Guy who dogged me out, lied and lead me on is now mad because I'm moving on and instead of canceling plans directly he acts like a child. 
Why is he mad?",31May2019,1

256,"   I am currently 17, I just graduated highschool a few weeks ago and in a way conflicted about my sister. She is my half sister and found out about her when I was a freshman and that she was from my dad's first marriage. My family isn't good so during the divorce, I was a baby and she decided to stay with her mom. We flew to meet her a year ago, she said she always wanted to reach out to me but I wasn't allowed to have social media so I snuck it.
  But we exchanged phone numbers to text each other. She always said how she wishes, she could've been there for me, or she told me how she had to pretty much beg my dad for money back when she was struggling. She is 31 right now, months in advance I asked her if she could come to my graduation, if she'll be able to make it. She said she would, then last minute ditched, she said she has work, when the week earlier she goes to a different state to be with her bf, who dumps her and leaves her stranded then she had to fly back to her home.
   So lately whenever she tries to reach out, and text me I've been cold or I dont respond. She could've visited before, she could've been there before, if she knew what I had to go through by myself I just dont understand why she couldn't help.

They seem really shitty with me and when I called in, they are now calling me back later on today to talk.

I really like this job, don't wanna lose it. I know being off this amount at any time at a work place is bad but Jesus I have explained to them in a little detail about family problems etc but I feel like I have to go there and break down in front of the office to prove I'm not lying about this???

262,"I've been having a hard time finding a job recently as I'll be moving into Long Beach, CA and needing to pay most of my rent. The rent is going to be about $700 + utilities a month even with two roommates. I just got a call saying that an offer from a retail store we'll call (Job A) is coming tomorrow in my email followed by a phone call. However, I'm scheduled for an interview for (Job B) this Saturday. Today is Thursday.

Job A will secure me a position right away as I would start immediately and could start making money to pay rent. However this job is 8 miles away from my apartment and my car is getting really old. On top of this, it is in a county where minimum wage is $12/hr.

Job B is still up in the air. If I interview on Saturday and am able to land that position it will only be 2 miles away and is in an area where minimum wage is set to go up to $14.25/hr by July 1st. This will not only save me time but save me plenty of money that would otherwise go to gas etc.

My question is, can I ask Job A to wait and ask Job B to possibly move my interview to tomorrow (Friday) and explain I have another offer? What's the normal thing to do in this situation? This isn't any fancy job or career it's just a simple retail job so I'm not sure the best way to approach this.

263,"It’s not a big thing, but here it goes:
I’m a doctor at a large-ish hospital here in the area.  I mainly do clinical research rn, so i have most of my interaction with the nursing staff. We’re all pretty good with each other, so we sit together during coffee breaks regularly.
If you ever been on the workforce side of a hospital, you know the amount of gossip that’s happening. And while in the past i was all over the juicy details, i’ve learned the hard way that knowing things is more often a problem than not.
Like who’s hooked up with whom at the christmas party, who just bought a very expensive and very ugly car, who went on a business trip just to get away from his wife (who’s also working here), not even really bad stuff, just the usual shit chat.
I was on the receiving end of talking behind my back, some stuff collegues do in their private life changed my view on them and made it harder to work with them, sometimes you get caught talking about someone. It’s not worth it, and it’s kinda a shitty thing to do.

So my problem is, i rely heavily on a good relationship to the nurses and the other doctors. Both can make each others life miserable if you cut them. 
So for the past few years i have made a point to keep myself out of that stuff.
But if i don’t engage in that (especially with the nurses), they start feeling i think i’m above them  or see myself as better. Just now i tried to explain that i don’t want nothing to do with what happened between those two doctors, because nothing good can come from that knowledge, and i got really weird looks.
I’m gunning for a more permanent job at the same department and i need as many people on my side as possible.

Do you guys have any good phrases or explanations so i can excuse myself from any such topics that don’t come off as arrogant?

264,"Hi,

I (19/m) have been in my current relationship for a year. I love my girlfriend (23/f) as much as the day I met her, and overall things have been going quite well. She is a very positive part of my life, and is always encouraging me to try new things, better myself and does things like cook for me and give me massages after work. We even plan on going on a trip together back to her country and I will be visiting her family (she is an international student). Unfortunately, I’d say I’m the biggest red flag in the relationship, although I hate to admit it. I have been battling an ongoing pornography addiction for around 4 years now, but it’s never gotten this serious up until now. When I met my girlfriend, I was very satisfied with her, and very attracted to her as well. Despite this, as time went on and my issue continued, I found myself glaring at other women on the street, and at some stages even comparing her to them (terrible, I know). I still often find myself doing this, and also having a strong lust for girls with borderline fake bodies.

This has also started to impact our sex life. I recently cannot get hard at all, not with her, or even from porn anymore. I had a huge binge last Saturday and felt completely shit. I feel so depressed after viewing porn and it makes me feel very lethargic, sometimes I barely even have the energy to get up. This is even now affecting my sleep, as I’m often seeing naked women I don’t even know in my dreams, often with incredible bodies, like what you would see in porn. I recently worked up the courage to admit this to my girlfriend, and she was very understanding. She says she wants to do what she can to help me, but I still find it hard to discuss it with her.

Even though I’m fully aware that this is affecting my personal life very severely, I just cannot stop. I even get urges at work and go into the bathrooms to look at porn while at work. I will start seeing a psychologist about this very soon, but I would very much appreciate any advice anyone has for me to deal with this. I am already aware of the NoFap sub-reddit but I don’t like the culture there.

Thanks,

* I do not live with my parents, I work full-time and rent (my partner and I are not living together, however).

It’s almost a thrill, like I’m on some kind of wacky tv show. Part of me likes to believe that I create the coincidences in my mind; such as, I’m always looking for what I want subconsciously, therefore my perception of events are altered to fit my ideal view. However, some things accruing feel like they are completely out of my control, but somehow these events (especially people I run into) turn out to be more deeply rooted in my past than I expect.

271,"Until recently, I spent years as a virtual shut-in. I have social phobia, which I had been dealing with mainly through avoidance.

Last year I began trying to break out of it. I started getting regular exercise and treating myself through CBT. I improved my diet and hygiene. I started retraining for a new career. 

But as I try to treat the social phobia through exposure, I am finding only reinforcement of my fears. People are scrutinizing and gossiping about me. I have observed this happening. Everyone treats me like I am stupid, so they will talk about me in my presence without naming me or saying anything too specific. Of course, that means I am unable to call anyone out for it. It feels like actually being in a nightmare whenever this happens.

I can only guess that I am being accused of something, but nobody has told me what. It could be something I did, or something I’m being falsely accused of. I have no criminal record, and I haven’t done anything that I think would justify it.

All I can say with certainty is that people are talking, I’m aware of it because of how I am treated, and it hurts to not be able to make friends or defend myself.

I try to minimize the effect that this sort of ostracism has on me, but at some point i have to accept that I am human, I have feelings, and it’s rational to feel awful. CBT won’t change that.

So here is the short of it, I recently got a girlfriend, we are 2 months together, due to some family issues she lost her appartment and her savings, which really sucks for her.

She is 24 and I am 27. She is spending every waking moment with me and I love it. We had some fights here and there because we see each other so much, which is quite obvious, however we always come out stronger.

I am still living at home, I work full time and do an evening school to get my bachelors degree. Its kind of easy now, however my parents are getting annoyed that she is spending every night at my parents place.

I have a steady income of €1900 a month as a manager, she works part time at a bar with an income of €1100 a month. I'm paying off my car for €450 a month including taxes, gas and insurance, as well as €200 a month for school.

Do you guys think it would be a good idea to move in together, as we found a beautiful appartment for €850 a month, which is doable but will be quite expensive until I finish my school next year and get promoted.

A while back i was watching tv and suddenly it switched to Bluetooth and some music started playing and the person turned the volume up all the way. I switched it back to tv and then 30 seconds later they did it again so i turned it off for a bit. I thought it was my brother but i looked and i was the only person home.

If i go knock on the neighbors door and ask about it I’m sure the kid isn’t gonna own up to it and then the parent is gonna think I’m an asshole and making shit up, also there’s kids in almost every house in the culdesac so it could be any of them and i feel like if i go ask around I’m gonna make the whole neighborhood hate me for “making shit up about their kids”.

278,"Hello, yesterday I talked with my crush for the first time. I wrote her 2 days ago a note which said that I like her and that I hope we could talk and with my phone number behind it. So yesterday she sent me a funny video of her dancing, and I asked her after a few hours if we could talk and then she said that we never talked and that I'm ""crossing the line"". So I told her ""That's why I want to talk with you"" and that ""I think it will be less embarrassing for both of us"" and after 4 hours she says that she thinks I exaggerated with some things and that she doesn't think that it will work between us so I just sent her ""Okay, thanks for telling me"" even though we didn't even talk yet and she barely knows anything about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I liked her and got interested in her for like two weeks, and I also saw that she likes me too. We both smiled and laughed whenever we looked at each other out of embarrassment and.. I don't know how to describe it it's like I'm just sure of it.

280,I am so done with my life. My mother made me go to another country to study and I hate it so much. I am introvert so I have zero friends and no family in this country. I have anxiety and depression. I am due to graduate university this year and I don’t know what I am going to do with my life. It’s hard to get employed because I have to study full time and employers are reluctant to hire me cuz of my student visa which limit my working hours. I have to hear my mother constantly asking me to get a job. I would be working and having a good salary if I stayed in country. I would be surrendered by friends and family. I hate her so much sometimes for forcing to study in another country. She constantly tells me how she hates her job and like to rant about all her probs with me and I feel like she has someone to spill her guts to but I don’t have that. I haven’t even tell her I hate university so much. I don’t my probs to friends and family and I feel like everything is bottling up inside me. I always smile when I talk to fam and just dont want to bother them. I have become such a sad person and I hate it. sometimes I just want to end things but then I get reminded of all the money my parents spent on me  and that is the only thing keeping alive. I dont have the will to live anymore. All I gotta. say is life’s stage and i gotta act my part.,31May2019,1

I had very weird experiences with lifts specifically which cause me to not use them (I also got dreams about them). I twice had sleep paralysis which I have never had before.

282,"Hey Reddit. So my mom just passed away, I was fired from my job, my dad and siblings won't speak to me, I'm broke, in crazy debt, I'm being evicted and to be honest, if it wasn't for my cats I would not be alive right now. I'd say that's a decent TL:DR.

Full spectrum, things began to snowball back in September of '18. I was living with my GF of almost 3 years down in TX. I'm a fine dining server and she's a corporate trainer for a restaurant. At the time, things were a bit rocky between us so she decided to go open a new store which is about a 3 week trip. The time away was much needed and long overdue, even if my birthday was only five days after she left. Just before she got back I had learned of my dad's(66y) colon cancer diagnosis and my mom(63y) being admitted to a nursing home. When I told my GF this, while sitting across the living room, she apologized awkwardly followed by a long pause. Then said ""I know it's bad timing but I need to move out. I can't do this anymore.""

November, a week or so later I fly up to PA with my older brother and his GF to see my ailing mom. It was very difficult to see my mom who, when I had last seen her a couple years back was 5'6"" 140 lbs, was now 5'3"" 89 lbs, and her entire right side paralyzed. I flew back and things were just sad and awkward between my GF and I. The next day I find out my mom had signed a DNR that morning. 

December, the GF moved out after what felt like an anti rape class demonstration with some added strangling for emotional impact. I get diagnosed with 4 more kidney stones (#144-148). I was clean and pack exGF stuff. Some charges pressed and dropped. Some suicide attempted pitifully. Dad acts like a Dad for some time. Then Christmas.

Fast forward to April of '19..
Apr13 - Mom falls into coma
Apr15 - Given less than a week
Apr16 - Mom given 48 hrs
           - I get fired for not showing up to work
Apr17 - Dad and brother, who live 5min and 30min from me, fly up to be there with her. They claim to have called from the airport but either way said fuuuuuuck that to knocking on my door and ya know, actually trying. 
Apr18 - My mom passes at 4:20pm of pancreatic cancer.

I haven't spoken to my dad or my brother since. I didn't get another job until May 6 and didn't start making money until May 17. I have been struggling through the depression just trying to keep from falling apart but it's so fucking hard.....I feel so alone. I'm 1+ month behind on rent, getting evicted, vehicle needs looots of maintenance and since the registration is out, it will be towed as of June 1. I have three cats, all rescues, and if it wasn't for waking up everyday to those three sweet furballs asleep on top or all around me in bed I don't think I'd be get able to out of bed. They are the only things that seem to warm my heart anymore. I could never leave them but I don't know how much longer I'm going to last. I don't know what to do or where to start...",31May2019,1

287,"This is a long story so prepare for a read.

I’m 16 years old. My mom divorced my dad when I was very young, due to him being a drug addict with severe mental health problems. My mom remarried to my stepdad when I was 7.  Me and my stepdad didn’t get along at first, but we were able to have a decent relationship for a few years. I was bullied at school at first, but I made some great friends, who helped get the jerks to leave me alone. I got really close with my friends, had plenty of hobbies (Creative writing, acting and martial arts) and was happy for a few years. 

However, the past few years of been absolute hell for me. we moved to another city, I was devestated because my friends were probably the only good thing in my life. This led me to become emotionally unstable, my pre-existing anger problems get worse and I began suffering from severe depression. I would cry myself to sleep each night and get up every morning with no energy, just wanting to lie down and die. I quit my hobbies and became a shadow of my former self. I used to be a very confident person, now my self esteem has taken a nose dive, I feel like I have failed myself and my friends. I hated my self, I tried to commit suicide, not because of sadness, but because I was so enraged with my self that I thought I deserved to die. At my new school I got bullied often, because I had become very introverted. This led me to get into plenty of physical fights at school. I became more angry and got into more verbal fights with my parents. However, at this point, I began making some new friends.

My relationship with my parents, especially my stepdad hit an all time low.  He abused me emotionally and verbally at every chance he got. Both my parents got mad at the smallest things I do, only to use them as excuses to berate me. My stepdad said that I am horrible person, that the older I get the more he hates me, that I have no friends, that I am a loser who will end up on the street doing drugs like my real dad (Have never touched an illegal drug in my life) Eventually I lost it, told my stepdad that he was being ridiculous and he had turned me into a horrible person. This led to my stepdad attacking me, punching me in the chest so hard, breathing hurt for over a month.

What made it even worse was that I then had a really bad pneumonia attack, nearly died. I was put in a coma so the doctors could regulate my breathing. That rattled me, scared my shitless. My stepdad kept throwing it in my face that he saved my life by driving me to the hospital when ever I had an argument with him. His verbal/emotional abuse is worse than ever, while he hasn't hit me in a long time, he gets so angry I am scared he will do it again. I was scared of him, I couldnt fight back, as he is a massive guy with training, whereas I was short, skinny and 15. 

At that point, I just broke. I just completely stopped giving a shit about anyone or anything. I became very violent and cruel, I would use manipulation and violence (Bad stuff: Full beatdowns, strangling, eye gouging) to get what I wanted at school. I hated myself and everything around me, so I took it out on everyone who messed with me. I was a horrible person for about a year. Until I got a suicide message from one of my friends in the middle of the night, this snapped me out of my messed up mental state, and I managed to talk him out of it. I felt immense regret for all the horrible things I’d done and said to people. I made a promise to myself to be a better person. For the most part, it was working. I made a lot of great friends, and I was able to heal my relationship with my mother, but my relationship with my stepdad is still getting there. 

So some guy I’d pissed off during my asshole stage decided to punch me in the back of the head. I fell and broke my arm. What’s worse is that I also had a nerve injury in my leg because of some stupid jump I’d tried to do a few weeks back, so I was pretty much cripple for two months. I couldn’t even take a shower unassisted. This made me feel hopeless and angry. On top of that, this guy spent those two months bragging to the whole school about how he’d kicked empty ass. When my arm healed I ended up fighting this kid again. 

When the time came to fight I froze. I couldn’t bring myself to attack. I defended for a while, dodging his punches but then he kicked me in the balls. He threw me around like a rag doll, punched the crap out of me and tried to gouge one of my eyes. At that point I lost it. I headbutted him in the nose and proceeded to punch the crap out of him. However I then froze again, as I realised that I was just doing the same shit I’d promised myself I’d stop. He took advantage of this and got a free shot on me. The fight then got broken up, before he could give me another beating. 

This guy left the school soon after. I put it all behind me and went on with my life and had a pretty good tenth year of school. However despite having improved my relationship with my parents and having plenty of great friends, my confidence is still pretty low. I had moments were I panicked and froze like I did in the fight, these moments happened often in social situations, and once in the middle of a production for my theatre class. What is happening to me? I used to be so confident, why do I keep freezing up? I suspect that I used my anger to cover up my lack of confidence after what happened with my parents. What is wrong with me, how do I fix myself?",31May2019,1

290,"For context, I play a fps game called Standoff2. There is a very active competitive scene.

My clan is So2 has a Whatsapp group, which we were required to join for news and scrimmages against other clans. So my father saw this while looking through my phone and he immediately made me leave the group and banned me from playing with ‘strangers’ who can ‘steal your identity, money and rob you’. 

Naturally being very rebellious I didn’t care and joined it back straight away, and put a Touch ID lock on it. Then my father saw this too, and he ordered me to remove it or he would sell my phone ( I really don’t know if he’s serious because this happened to my sister)

I don’t want my father to look an rummage through my phone and I think he is intruding my privacy a little too much, but the other side of me says to be a good boy and remove it.

About a year ago, my landlord put the house up for sale.  Well a couple of months ago, he accepted an offer. We've been pretty much kept in the dark about everything that was going on, and didn't know how long it would be before the new owners moved in.  About a month ago, my landlord gave our contact information to the new owners, and said they'd be contacting us soon. We didn't hear a thing. Monday night I come home from work and my landlord says ""oh by the way, I'm out Wednesday"".  So Wednesday morning he's gone, but said he left the internet and cable on for the rest of the day. I don't know what happened, but it was shut off since he left.  On my lease (which is month to month), everything is included.  I pay a set rate, and I get all utilities, plus internet and premium cable.  So my internet and cable has been off for 2 days now, and it's really frustrating.  (I'm tired of watching old DVDs).  But that's not even the issue, the new owners won't answer any calls or texts. We've been trying to get ahold of them since Monday, and nothing. They haven't even stopped by the house since the landlord left.  Rent is usually due on the first, so I'm not sure what's going to happen (can't even talk to them about what they're expecting for rent).

I feel like I’m always ruining everything and doing things wrong. I do my best every day and it never feels like I’m enough, even as a child. I’m the oldest and second mom. Basically raised my siblings only to be set aside when I am the one in need.
I’m about to move states and start a new life with my partner. this is supposed to be a really big step for me. I have no support from family and no friends. (one friend states away) I know that my OCD personality won’t let me just give up. But all I can think about is how I’m going to fail and disappoint everyone even more. I just want to feed back into my ED and stay there.  I’m struggling. I don’t like living. I’m just going to have to suck it up but all I want to do is start starving myself again.. I miss having friends but I’m scared to be vulnerable again after so much betrayal and hurt from people I thought were my friends. Last time I moved everything I owned got stolen or sold off because my car got impounded. All I own is a few outfits and some makeup. 

Only found out a few days ago that my family hates me because of tattoos etc. I’ve always been the black sheep but was under the impression they loved me anyways. none of them want me in the family anymore. I want to give up so badly. But I can’t. I’m afraid of the future and I don’t want to face it. 

My relationship is all I have and I know he will just leave me too.. we’re already fighting over small shit. Like yesterday I need help from him and he won’t support me because of the way I asked. I’ve been having panic attacks and “freak outs” regularly and I can’t control my emotions. But me acting “extra” or snapping like “can’t you tell I can’t handle myself right now?!” Is all the attitude he needs to justify not helping me at all. “Why would I support you if you just snapped at me?”  Where I apologized and he still wouldn’t help my panic attack because his feelings were hurt.

301,"So, our apartment building is under construction for a few months. There were building scaffolding on all sides od the building but now they are only on one side, where most of the apartments have their bedroom windows.

The construction workers leave at 5 pm, and that's when finally me and my bf can crack open the window to get some fresh air in. So the window is not fully open,just a little bit because its right above our bed. Its really hot rn because summer is coming and we always wake up covered in sweat because the air gets really hot really fast over the night.

And few weeks ago some creep ( or more of them) started walking around the building scaffolding! 
The first encounter was in the middle od the night when we heard someone walking, Like a few steps at a time (around 4 am) so i just blamed it on the wind and went to sleep. Mistake.
Few days later the same shit again and I close the window. 
Happenes again, but now around 8 pm, I walk out of the shower in a towel in the bedroom to get dressed. My bf was at his computer working. So I open my closet and start yelling when I glance at the window and see a guy staring at me trough the small open crack! Bf slammed the window in his face while I ran out. Then he opened the window and saw some old guy trying to get away!
Then it was quiet for two weeks.
Last night Im pretty sure someone was watching us sleep because we fell asleep with the tv on and i got up to turn it off and  bf said he heard steps as soon as I got up.

What are we suppose to do?
Im pretty sure Im going to stay up tonight waiting. To at least get a pic of the creppy idiot!

306,"Hey guys, 

So long story short me and my girlfriend have been living in an apartment for about a year and for some reason, only during the summer, the AC will stop producing cold air ONLY at night. During the day the AC is perfect we could put it down to 65 and it will stay there nicely (we don’t set it to freezing all the time just an example that it works during daytime)

This pretty much happens every night now and I checked it last night and it was 82 DEGREES. It’s severely effecting us and I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions for what is wrong.

We have gone to the property managers of our complex multiple times and they have switched out the filter, thermostat, etc. I’m going to talk to them again today since we are paying for the AC to work but we have honestly no idea what to do and we are dying in our sleep from heat.

Should we go talk to the corporate office that owns the complex? Does anyone else have this problem or know why this is happening?",31May2019,1
307,"I manage a small eatery in a busy city that requires attention to detail and being mindful/aware of our surroundings as our customers are somewhat needy people who demand attention. 

I have one server who has been with us almost one year. She is quite lazy. She often has other servers do her work or she's too busy chatting up front with our counter person or in the back on her phone. The counter person and her are close. 

I've expressed to the owners her performance and behavior at work for the last few months and nothing seems to happen. Because this has been going on too long, it's more difficult to confront her and things have gotten worse.

I chatted with the owner yesterday about how she slacks off. He's well aware of her performance, I just think he doesn't like confrontation. The owner said ""Either I will talk with her or you can sit down and talk with her.""

I sent an email a little bit ago saying that I'd like to take the initiative and speak with her. 

How do I approach her? Her and I have hung out in the past and I stopped because I didn't want her to get too comfortable and cross any boundaries at work. I feel alot of anxiety and I don't want my emotions to get in the way, but this has been going on for a long time and my anger has been festering. 

If nothing comes of this and she doesn't take the initiative to work better, I'll have to quit because I can't stand picking up her slack anymore.

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

316,"So i have been with this girl for the last year, and im considering breaking up with her alot..


The main reason im breaking up with her makes me feel like an asshole though. I want to date other girls.

So normally you would just break up, but since this is my first serious relationship since i got older (i’ve had girlfriends but its different when you are older) so im relativly inexperienced.

The problem lies in when i’ve tried she started crying and calling med “the one” and mentioning all the good times we had together.

Its not that i dont like her, i just dont love her like i did, and i really feel like i need to move on. But its hard...

We’ve made plans to travel this summer, go to parties together and festivals.. and all of this has to be thrown away just as summer i coming because i want to do something else this summer..

Now it must be said that emotionally i am conflicted between staying for the sake of the relationship and see where it takes me, or be the guy who broke her heart for the first time.

-----------------------

Got a bit of a situation, with a long story. Looking for advice on how to handle an upcoming meeting with the CTO of my (fairly) new company.

In mid/late last year I met with the CTO of a large medical engineering company. I was working in academia at the time and my contract was coming to an end. The CTO was visiting and one of my managers helped me out and set up a meeting. The meeting went very well, the CTO was keen to get me in his company, and he was going to put me in touch with numerous people in the organisation to get it sorted.

Despite how well the meeting with the CTO went, the hiring process was very slow. The impression I got (although can't confirm) is that the CTO was very keen in me, but after delegating the hiring down to various teams which weren't hiring and didn't necessarily need me, their enthusiasm wasn't as great. I had a bit of communication with the CTO over this process, but I was mostly talking to recruitment people and other individuals.

I was eventually offered a job which sounded pretty good, although wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I mostly accepted it as a means to get into this company, as it's a world leader. I've now been in that position for a few months. After I accepted the position I sent a message to the CTO to thank them for their enthusiasm and tell them I accepted the position, but he never got back to me and I chalked it up to being busy and not needing to respond. Fast forward three months and I get a message from his secretary saying he wants to meet to see how I'm getting on. I was a bit surprised because I didn't hear back from him before and wasn't certain he remembered me or even knew I was there.

I'm not super happy in my position. I feel the position is a bit below my experience and I'm not using any of my skills which would certainly benefit the company. I find myself with a LOT of free time which makes for very boring days. The team is small with only about 5 of us (including me), and two of them are on paternal leave. I am being trained directly by my boss because the guy that would be training me is on leave, and I am doing the work of the guy on leave which isn't a great structure. That said, I am very appreciative of what I've been offered! My boss has been very supportive, despite my feeling that I am a bit of a burden to him (as he's the one training me with the two individuals on paternal leave) and that he may not have needed/wanted me in his team. To add to the complication, I now live/work in a non-English speaking country, and I don't currently speak the language. This company has thrown a lot of nice benefits at me, including relocation costs and language classes to get me up to speed. Everyone at work speaks great to good-enough English, but I feel very bad not being able to communicate in their language and this has led to me not socialising much at all.

Here's my situation: I have already mentioned to my boss and his next-in-command at a recent progress meeting that I'd like to work on the things I'm more skilled in. They said that there could be opportunities in the future, but it was definitely a brushed-off response and my job responsibilities aren't in line with what I want to do. I want to bring up the same concerns to the CTO and see what he says, but I do NOT want this to seem like I am going over my boss or make it seem like I am going over anyone's head.

How do I handle this situation? I kind of want to be moved into an area where I can actually use my skills, but at the same time I don't want to disadvantage my current boss nor cause issues within the organisation.",31May2019,2

321,"5 years ago when I was 17 or just turned 18, I met  a french boy on tinder. We hit it off so I added him on Snapchat and then he found me on Facebook although I never accepted his friend request.  After around 2 weeks of chatting, he became very possessive and demanding, he got pissed off at me when I didnt reply right away and would accuse me of being with a lad (even if I was, not his problem) and he started demanding nudes. Naturally I blocked him right away and that was the end of it. 

Around a year later I received a snapchat friend request from a French name that I didnt recognize, I didnt think much of it but I accepted it anyway. Never thought it would be Him. I got a message right away and it was him asking if I remembered him and what 'we had' (we had nothing).  I didn't respond and I just blocked him. Since then, I've been getting random adds on FB and snapchat from different French names, it's been 5 YEARS! Usually the FB profiles have 0 friends and no profile pic or a clear catfish pic. Obviously I just block them right away. I have no proof that it's him at all but it cant be a coincidence at this stage. 


I dont believe I'm in any immediate danger but I'm kinda scared of him at this stage. Its been bloody 5 years! He doesn't know where I live but he knows the town and its not that big.

Fast forward 2 years to the summer of my second year in the program, I’ve racked up about 75,000 miles on my Cruze as I’ve been Ubering on the side to eat, because my program is too time consuming for a part time job. 

I’m driving home from studying the other day and my check engine light comes on, I take it into the nearest dealership and they keep it over night.

331,"So here some background info: 

On May 10th my cat got out, running towards a wooded area behind my apt complex (that is against a bunch of backyards to the next street over) and I haven't been able to find her since. We have called all of the rescues, made flyers (cant hang them though on poles because of local code; however, we have put them in mailboxes and hung them in every doorway of each building of my apt complex and in some local businesses), searched up and down where she was last seen, put food out, put litter out, set up traps (caught a raccoon - that was lovely), called for her, asked neighbors to keep a look out, offered a reward, posted on every Facebook group, paid for  ADs, made sure he microchip info was updated, and have done everything I could possibly think of. Still no sign of her since May 11th (my mother saw her and couldn't catch her). 

Now here is my story: 

On May 11th I went knocking on some doors and a woman in the neighborhood behind my complex noted I should speak to a woman two doors down. This person stated that this woman feeds strays in the area and she might have seen her. When knocking on this womans door (the one who feeds the cats) there was no answer (though there was a car in the driveway), so we left her a flyer pleading for her to contact us. Over 24 hours went by and we decided to try knocking again (maybe she didnt see our flyer). We went up to the door and again no answer (however, there was a car in the driveway). We start walking away and look at the side of her house (I should note it was slightly raining and you can see the house from the sidewalk) and we see about 6 cats on her porch. Now we had been out searching so we happened to have a bucket of cat treats, so my boyfriend starts shaking it. Immediately the 6 cats all look at us and a woman comes out from a side door on her porch. She asked us if we were the ones who left the note and we told her we were. The exchange I found to be strange. She refused to come near us and everytime I asked her (which was multiple - I had a weird feeling about her) if she had seen my cat she looked away towards the backyard. She asked if my cat was microchipped (she is) and noted it was strange she was coming to me when called. She also mentioned years ago she worked for an organization that caught cats and neutered them for release and that her 6 tabby cats were from the same colony (believable - they all look simular). She said if she saw her she would catch her (exact phrase). So we walked away and I looked at my boyfriend and said ""I didnt get a good feeling about her. I think she has my cat."" 

So we left it alone and proceeded to hand out flyers. As noted previously I can not hang flyers in my township (some BS local code) so we decided to put flyers in every persons mailbox on that street (neighborhood behind my complex where she ran off). Later that day I recieved a phone call from one of the people on the street and she told me she did not find my cat but I should talk to the woman who feeds the cats in the area (different neighbor). I told her I already had and she saod that she had not seen her in which this person's response was ""well she says that"". Thought it was strange; however, not specifically alarming. I told this person that the woman's cats were all from the same colony (she told me) and this person's responce was ""I'm not sure about that"". She also kinda vibed that this woman was strange and her kids call her 'the crazy cat woman'.  

I didn't proceed with anything; however, I had my suspicions. I didn't get a good feeling about her and neither did two people who I had talked to in the neighborhood. My cat (who is a fluffy mostly white cat with some black) had not been spotted at all. My step dad offered to maybe try and talk with her. The woman is older and he thought maybe she didnt trust me because I'm younger (28). He went to her door and knocked, no answer (again, car in driveway). My step dad is a bit aggressively so he walked around the house and saw lights on and suspected she was home. Now after about 15 min of no one answering we left and my step father said ""why dont we call the local police department and see what our options are"". To me this sounded reasonable. I thought they would give us some advice. So we called the dept. and they sent out an officer to speak with us. He said he would try and knock on her door and see if she would talk with him. 

Now I didnt go with the officer or my step dad so this is just hear say, but I was told when the officer went to the house he tried knocking on the door and she refused to answer. Furthermore, she yelled at the police officer from her window telling him she was not opening the door. The best the officer said he could do was push the issue to code enforcement (another local law - you can only have a total of 3 animals in one residence at a time) and see what happens. The officer said by her behavior he suspects she had the cat. 

So coming to the end of my story (and finally my question), I have yet to hear anything from the local police or code enforcement. There have been no sightings of my cat and I highly suspect she has her in her home. She always keeps her blinds closed and I believe she very rarely leaves her home. I can not prove anything. 

Is there anything I can do to (legally) to see if she is keeping my cat in her home? 

I apoligize for the long winded post I wanted to provide backup information for clarity if there are any questions I will try my best to answer.

332,"TL;DR at bottom

\------

Hey all- I've been having a pretty frustrating experience with my last place of employment and was hoping for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I worked for 2.5 years for an online media outlet covering business issues. It was fine- I did what I was supposed to and had a fine relationship with everyone who worked there. The holidays were on the horizon and I was debating moving home or searching for more work where I was (a plane ride away from family at that point). The more I thought about it, the more I realized it would be such a hassle to keep flying back (say if I got an interview back in my hometown), so I put in my 2 weeks' notice and prepare to move back home. I tied up loose ends at my work and said thanks for the experience and all of that and I make the move.

&amp;#x200B;

My family was hosting for the holidays so it was a blur of moving and then having family come to town a few days later. Normally I get paid every 15 days or so, so I was expecting the final paycheck December 30 or so. They said they would send it via mail with my unused vacations hours too. I figure it was the holidays and I would get it the next pay period.

&amp;#x200B;

January 15 comes around and I get an e-mail from the secretary confirming my new address to send my W-2 form. I reply asking if I would receive my paycheck too. She said it would just be the W-2 but she included the HR person in the email chain asking when I would get my check. HR person said that the CEO had overnighted my check but would ask the CEO to cut a new check and send it back out.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first red flag for me because I had forwarded my mail and received Christmas cards at my new house but no overnighted paycheck. I think that's weird. If he did overnight it then it would be with my other 4-5 pieces of mail surely? And if not, then they would see that the check wasn't cashed in and could just cut another check and send it right?

&amp;#x200B;

I follow up a week or two later with an e-mail to the secretary, CEO, and HR person and give them my current address again and ask for a status update.

&amp;#x200B;

No one responds. I follow up again a week later and say no one has gotten back to me, can I get an update? HR person says they were experiencing some ""cash flow issues"" and they might have to take the money out of another account but they would get back to me as soon as the CEO responds to her. I ended up calling the CEO's number and got the voicemail- I left a voicemail asking for my paycheck. No response.

&amp;#x200B;

Another week or two goes by and I send a more firm email (with help from my family members). I quote the revised code of (state I was living in) and say that employees are entitled to final wages within 2 weeks of the last pay period regardless if they quit or are fired, etc. I say this is the last time I will be asking for my check and give my address again. The CEO responds and says ""I thought this was handled. I will send over the tracking number and get that over to you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Another week or 2 goes by and no response. At this point I am pretty frustrated. I was a loyal employee of 2.5 years and never had any issues with the CEO. So what gives? Clearly, they think they can keep ignoring me or putting me off because I am now on the opposite coast and will assume I will give up and keep my money or something. They know I probably won't fly back out there to represent myself in court over maybe $800 or so. It's a shitty situation for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Department of Labor Route**

&amp;#x200B;

I give it some time and try another route: I reach out to the State Department of Labor and describe what happens. They recommend that I file an employee complaint against my employer for lost wages. They say they cannot help me recover any unused vacation hours (I had 2 days' worth) unfortunately, as it is out of their jurisdiction. That's a little crappy to hear but I say whatever...if the employer is ignoring me then this may be the only way I get my money.

&amp;#x200B;

I have difficulties getting this form sent however... the online form never sends and stayed on the spinning circle for 45+ minutes. I tried filling it out twice and sending on my computer and then once on my mom's computer. None go through.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask them if I can fill it out the form by hand and e-mail the form- they can't do that. They say I can send it via snail mail or fax it. I go to Fed Ex and fax the papers. It cost $17 to send the 9 pages cross country. I'm annoyed it was that expensive but am glad it was sent. I get a confirmation sheet saying it was sent successfully and wait for a response.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later I follow back up to make sure they received it. D.O.L. says they have no record of my form. So great, something happened and I threw the $17 down the drain for nothing :)

&amp;#x200B;

I fill out the form and send it snail mail and they finally get it. I had attached screenshots of the email exchanges, as well as my bank statement showing I hadn't been paid since Dec 14 when I worked until December 21. They said it will take up to 2 months to investigate (ugh). They call me back and verify what I wrote and then said they will contact my employer. This past week I receive the letter they sent to the employer saying I am asking for X amount and to pay it by the first week of June.

&amp;#x200B;

**Leverage**

&amp;#x200B;

The other day my old boss/manager (not the CEO) contacts me to say that they are still being charged for a program subscription that I canceled a few months' back. I was a little confused when I was moving and knew the other employee used those programs so didn't close it right away. I wasn't aware that he had his own account, etc. Regardless, I closed it out in March or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I say I'll look into it for her, but after talking to my family they say no, screw them. If they want information on that you should use this as leverage to get your check. I wasn't sure if she was aware

&amp;#x200B;

So I send an e-mail saying I have no problem checking into that, but only after I receive my final paycheck with my unused vacation hours. I said I had no problem with her and understand she doesn't do the payroll, however if the company wants me to check into this they can do so after I receive the wages I was owed.

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't replied and this was maybe 5 days ago.

**What now?**

I am assuming the D.O.L. will have better luck getting my wages, so I guess I have to wait this out. The part that kills me is I might lose $150-$200 from my vacation hours that I would otherwise be entitled to.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if I could take it to court and win because it should be clear cut from an evidence perspective. They never had money leave their account for me and I never had money entering my account. Should be easy enough to prove. They owe me, they need to pay me...done deal. If I were to take this route I think that would mean I would have my attorney costs reimbursed for winning the case but I'm not sure if that is a rumor or a typical thing or what. I don't want to fly cross country for these bastards but it is an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wondered what would happen if I played hardball and re-ran the subscription (I verified it is not running now) with their credit card and say ""Want to stop paying? Then pay me my damn money"" but I'm sure that's illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

Another part of me wants to comment on their social media posts saying I haven't been paid and they don't pay their employees' final wages etc, beware to try and hurt their image. I would probably be blocked but I am considering it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another route would be to annoyingly email them daily asking for an update. Or to reply on his ""I'll send the confirmation number"" and say ""Damn it takes a long time to get that tracking number huh?""

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, I didn't need that money because I had some saved up and didn't need it for a deposit or whatever because I moved in with family, so I can be thankful for that. But it's definitely frustrating and I hope I can get my money. The other annoying thing is the employer will suffer no penalty should they write me the check by June 6. So they can just break state law/statute by not paying someone for 2 weeks and wait until they keep asking for it and pay them 6 months past the due date? That seems pretty broken from a system perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice on this or would suggest anything to try I would greatly appreciate it.

**TL;DR:** Employers never paid my last paycheck and I have followed up 8 or so times now. I was due the money at the end of December/Early January. It is now almost June and I still don't have my money. The state department is investigating but they can't help me obtain my $150-200 worth of unused vacation time. I am considering what my next step should be (on top of waiting for the department to investigate for me).",31May2019,1
333,"So, i recently graduated. My parents are VERY strict. They decided to “give me my wings” and let me start staying with my boyfriend in the town i used to live in and get a job there. Today is my last day at my current job in the town i live in with my parents. I’m pretty sure i’m moving out soon and my brother is getting my room. Anyways, I just stayed with my boyfriend for the first time sunday-thursday. His mom welcomes me, feeds me, and just makes me feel more glad to be there. my parents sent me guilt tripping messages the whole time i was gone. and when i came back home last night to be closer to work this morning, i didn’t even talk to them until 10pm (bedtime because i work at 5am) and if i hadn’t gone out of my way to talk to them, i doubt they’d speak a word to me. and my step mother seemed aggravated i had even thought about going back to my boyfriends tonight. what the hell do i do?",31May2019,1

Even my therapist has said that meds are definitely a valid option for me, but my parents are super against the idea of me going on anxiety meds.

336,"I have three main friends here, A, L, and S.

A is autistic, so I'm a lot more lenient with him. He burps and swears in public loudly and will loudly talk about sex and gross things in public places and often speaks a lot louder than necessary. But again, autistic, so I'm not really holding it against him.

L is only mildly bad. They are going through a bit of a rough patch so I'm a big lenient. They are constantly on their phone, even when hanging out with us. We were playing CAH and they were on their phone so much we had to remind them it was their turn to play/judge. They also constantly need other people to pay for them (their mom got laid off, so I understand). I guess they might not understand what's a reasonable request? They asked me to make them a pot of coffee, a whole pot, at like 11 PM.

S is the reason I made this post, and I honestly can't think of a reason as to why She is like this. She has ADD/ADHD, but that's it. She has no awareness of her surroundings. She'll stop in the middle of the walkway/hallway to tie her shoes or something (people bump into her and I have to pull her away), she loudly swears in public places with children around (She yelled ""FUCK"" at a local minigolf place), and she doesn't seem to know when she could hurt someone's feelings. 

After a school event, she asked if she could come to my place to hang out and I said yes. L called us and asked if we could all hang out. S told her she was going to my house, which really put me in an awkward situation. We were planning on playing a two player game, so I said ""I'm not sure what we would do..."". S just straight up said ""It won't work, you can't come."" I had to frantically save face and suggest we could go to town and have lunch, all of us, so L wouldn't be hurt (going through a bad time, mom got laid off, friend died, etc). After lunch, S asked if we were still doing the game, but I said no since I was tired. 

She acts like a child constantly, even though we are 18 now. I get being silly and stuff, but sometimes it gets out of hand. She draws on tablecloths (she's not a good artist) and does the sticking chopsticks in her mouth as walrus tusks in public a lot. She constantly needs to be driven around, despite having a car of her own and her parents owning two. Whenever I drive her, she's on her phone and says nothing to me. I used the GPS to go to her address but it went to the wrong town. She said nothing they entire trip, no mention of ""hey this is kinda a weird route"", didn't say a single word to me until I said ""ok we're here"" and she just promptly said ""this isn't my house."" Again, not a word to me when we drove back. She also never pays for gas money. 

I feel like all my friends together in public is a disaster. They loudly swear around children (Fuck, dick, etc) and don't seem to notice that they are disturbing everyone. We all went to a tiny restaurant (it had literally like 5-6 tables) and they again were really loud and swore. I got tons of dirty looks from the other customers trying to enjoy their meal and had to apologize to the waitress tons of times. 

They have picked up and used things from someone's yard, too. I didn't know, but the lady had to ask us to give it back when we were done (the lady was nice about it though).

It's gotten to the point where hanging out with them in public is exhausting. I feel like an asshole for constantly feeling like I have to mother them but I can't just ignore how disruptive we are. Sometimes I just want to avoid being with them because it's so draining. 

I'm going off to college this year and I just kinda want to drop them (except A, he's mostly good).",31May2019,7

340,"I’ll try to keep this short. I have a group of friends who I go out with at weekends and stuff but I don’t even think they like me. I’ve known them all for 10+ years and we’ve grown up together. We are all ~20 years old. Basically, they all have this superiority complex because they started work and picked a trade after leaving school whereas I’ve continued my education and got into a top university. They constantly look down on me and seem resentful for some reason. They don’t want me to succeed even though I’d be happy to see them succeed. It’s like they all join together to create some massive confirmation bias and they’re just feeding off each other’s bullshit. I’m sick of it to be honest but I only hang around with them because I have no other friends - by this I mean I have other friends on my course and stuff but I don’t talk to them outside university unless it’s about the course over messages.

341,"I tell people about this and they give me answers that make me feel like I’m in the wrong here.

I’ve worked a security company for over two and a half years. Been through a lot of bad contracts. 

The field supervisor comes up to my current contract now and then. He is not allowed beyond business purpose technically. He comes up for coffee and to flirt sometimes, mostly talks about work with me but stays and talks.

Our office is crumbling with disorganization. 

We have two field supervisors. We used to have four until now. The big bosses won’t allow them to hire any more aids or field supervisors.

The third one recently quit because he couldn’t handle the office. The other two field sups are left, the one that comes up to see me and one that can’t handle the position or seem to keep up. 

This field sup has started coming up and asking me to do extra office work. Without extra pay or hours, off the record, and I won’t be credited.

They keep telling me they want me as a supervisor but won’t give me opportunity. They said I would make an amazing field supervisor but no longer offer the position. Essentially they want me to pick up their slack without compensation or recognition and I declined, telling them I would not, unless it was worth it to me. 

I might “learn things” and be seen as more valuable. But I feel like if I haven’t proven myself by now then they’re only looking for free help and to not actually give me any benefit. I feel like I barely get paid enough and I ask for overtime to make bills. 

To get an aid or another field supervisor they would have to petition the big bosses who don’t care and that’s a big task.

If they see the office in disarray they might open another field sup position. If I help on the side I’m not getting any compensation or recognition for helping office work and the bosses might think two field supervisors is enough.

345,"Dear reddit, 

I’m a confused 18yo boy (at this moment lol). Im working at this restaurant for 2 months now. I’m a chill dude that doesn’t worry too much, I’m just going with the flow. (I’m meditating for half a year now, that’s prob why). I’m extroverted but I’m a good listener. I’m pretty much 70% of the time excited and cheer people up with random jokes. That’s my specialty, my thoughts. I see random connections and talk about those.
I adjust easily to the people I work with, if they are serious I won’t bother them with my thoughts, obviously. I’m an agreeable dude.

Since day 1 I got coupled with this 16yo girl with adhd. I enjoy the adhd, she has high energy and is happy. I like her, just as I like anyone. We get asked when we go on a date and both know we won’t go. She is a good friend of me now, since we were on the same side since day 1.

There is this other girl which is 19yo, she is chill. She does, opposite of everyone else, accept my random, funny thoughts and humor. She even likes those! She is a good listener too. After work, when we drink something I can have good conversations with her. I like deeper conversations. (I hate those “How are you? I’m fine, you? Yeah me too” conversations.) 

I find her attractive too, but she has a boyfriend and I know, Ishould move on. She is kind and chill to everybody, I shouldn’t feel special, I know. 

But man, she is just so cool, totaly my type like really fun to hang out with. But I don’t know what to do, if I keep getting closer with her I will probably get in trouble some day. I really like her and wish there was somebody like her. Chill and fun.

348,"Sorry, I’m on mobile at the moment.

Context: my life has been a rollercoaster for the past year. My father left us for another woman and moved away to Puerto Rico, leaving us stranded in Central Texas. He was our only income so we had to sell items in our house to keep up with grocery demand and also saving up to move. This is generalized a bit but you get the gist.

We planned on moving to my sister’s home, which lives in Missouri. We had a *lot* of animals living with us. Four dogs and for cats. Missouri law states we could only have 3 pets,  So sadly, we had to give up the cats. 

We found a home for my mom’s favorite cat. She was happy to know they were a family we knew and they would show a lot of love to him. And they did. This cat was absolutely the most loving. A mane coon that essentially acted like a dog most of the time. He used to sit on mom’s shoulders and purr so much he’d start salivating like a dog. He was so playful and loved to cuddle.

A month or so passes by and we’ve moved to Missouri. It’s been a really stressful move, we had to fit four dogs in the truck and we had no car so it was just, a lot. A few weeks pass and I receive a message from the new owners saying that the cat had a “urinary blockage condition” and ultimately had to be put to sleep. I’m personally devastated but I don’t know how to break the news to mom.

Her blood pressure has been going up, she instinctually starts to panic if I even have the smallest news, I’m afraid of breaking her mental status even more. She’s a huge animal lover and hated parting with the cats so much she had go stay with the dogs.

357,"Hey Reddit, sorry for the long post.

I never used to have social anxiety or depression. I actually never really understood how people even could have those problems. 

I am in college and had a lot of fun for the first two years. In my first year my friends and I started smoking weed, just once or week or so when we’re just chilling or watching a movie or something. But as the semesters went on I realized I had to study a lot to pass the tests.

In my country there are different tiers of high school and college. The “lower” the tier the more practical stuff you get. Like welding or electrics. You go to the tier that works with your academic abilities. During high school I did the second highest tier; which is all theoretical. It’s kinda weird but needed for the story.

I never had to study in high school. I could just follow the classes and get a 7/10 on tests which was good enough. My point is I never had to study. I never learned the will power to sit down and stay focused on studying for an hour or two.
So when I began to fail classes in college I started to get seriously depressed. I can’t stop college. I don’t want to disappoint my parents, but I also can’t seem to pass. So I started smoking 2 grams of weed everyday to numb my emotions and be okay with not studying today. “I’ll do it tomorrow” I always said. 

I can’t study when I’m stoned. So naturally I failed everything. I also started gaining weight, and now I’m at the point that I don’t fit most of my clothes and the shirts I do fit, show my fat belly and man boobs. So I always wear a hat and a jacket no matter how hot the weather. I started to lock myself in my room. I resent having to go outside to get groceries and stuff. When I hear random people laugh in public, I always think they’re laughing at me. I noticed today that I can’t even look strangers in the eye anymore. Thinking about it, I haven’t looked any stranger in the eyes for months. I always look at something else.

The only comfort I feel is from weed or shitty junk food. I know I’m destroying my life. My saving are completely gone and my throat hurts all the time from all my smoking. I feel like I’m stuck. And I’m deeply ashamed of what I have become. I’m afraid to tell my friends or family. Even though my parents are the nicest people ever. My siblings both have advanced degrees and I can’t even get through college. I can’t tell them about what’s going on. I’d rather lie than admit that their kid is a fucking loser addict.
My best friends are like brothers to me, but their both muscular and very comfortable in public. They pick up girls all the time and they’re doing great at college. How can I confide in them? Their life’s are awesome and I don’t think they’d understand. Besides I don’t want to admit to them that I’m actually pathetic.

I have thought about killing myself. I can’t kill myself outright because my parents will be devastated. Especially if they think they could have done something. I don’t want that they’re tormented with that thought all their lives. I thought about maybe stage an accident at a train crossing or provoke a group of aggressive drunk people going out. But I don’t want to hurt the people around me. A friend from college lost his friend when she got hit by a train when the crossing lights failed. It really messed him up and I don’t want to hurt the people around me like that.

I’m just stuck in a spiral. I can’t stop smoking, cause it stops me from feeling even shittier but if I keep going I’ll never break out. I am totally ashamed of what I am and can’t talk to my friends or family about it. I can’t kill myself and I don’t want to keep going. Therapy is expensive so I’d have to ask my parents to fund it, which would mean I’d have to explain whats going on.

358,"I feel like this post is a little melodramatic but I really feel like I have a dilemma. I’ve lived a really nice life that I’m so grateful for but have also struggled w ADHD and anxiety for a while. A rough breakup a few months ago has left me with a barrage of anxious and just really sad thoughts that I feel like should be gone by now. Initially, I decided to channel these thoughts into my art but am starting to realize it may be dredging up these bad thoughts because I’m wallowing in the negative emotion. I have progressed a lot as an artist in these past months but I’m wondering what the cost is. To what extent is feeling this pain conducive to healing and an art career? Is it possible it’s holding me back from getting over my breakup and encouraging my anxiety/hyperactivity? I feel more cynical and I just don’t love my outlook on the world right now. Not saying I’m a visionary like Rothko, or suffering to the extent that he did, but is pain just a part of the artist’s condition? I feel like so many of the greats struggled w mental health, maybe that’s just the weight of  living through WWI and II though. Idk I guess I would just like to know if anyone has grappled with a similar dilemma. How do I transition from using art to wallow to using it as a tool for healing?

362,"I have this one friend who is talkative and he’s really friendly to any people. But he looks really stressed lately and today he told me that he doesn’t want to school tomorrow. 

From what I’ve heard, my friend had a fight with a ex friend of his, who is one of the popular kids, and this guy is talking shit about my friend. My classmates understand that my friend isn’t a bad guy but they still want to hang out with the popular kid so I guess it’s very awkward for my friend to be in school.

It’s really painful to see my friend being depressed so I want him to recover soon. I thought of recommending him to the school counselor, since it helped me when I had a trouble, but I thought it might be rude to recommending someone to a school counselor. 

Should I still recommend him going to the school counselor? Are there anything else I could do?",31May2019,1
363,"So first time home owner, have new neighbors that moved in about a year ago. They got 2 little dogs and love to let them out in their backyard to do their business. There is no fence between our properties, so the dogs have started to migrate into our yard when they are let out. I have bird feeder that is frequented by squirrels, which are the bane of his dogs. They come back to the owners when continually called.  I have asked the owner to please keep his dogs in his yard, since the chasing has resulted in a ""run"" ( torn up grass in my yard). He obliged and said he would stop his dogs. Instead he has taken to sneakily choosing when to let his dogs out. So I bought a wildlife camera and have been catching his dogs in the act.

My town has a 24/7 leash lawn for pets, with a serviceable fine of $100 per offense.

So recently my school board (the Davenport Community School District) has decided to change from a 4 block scheduling day to a traditional 7 period day like the middle schools to save money.

We get more homework and less time in class I already spend most my time doing math homework and I don’t think me or my peers would be able to write a paper do math homework and other homework all at the same time. So a group of students at my school created a petition to change it back to a block schedule.

I believe that I go above and beyond with my studying and reading comprehension skills. However, I have a professor this semester that is just complete asshole. We had our first reading quiz and he only gave us 30 minutes to answer 10 questions. These questions had to be in paragraph form. Obviously I was taking my time and trying to go back and check my grammar and overall comprehension of my answers. I ran out of time and didn’t answer five of the questions, so I failed. I asked him if we could have a little bit more time but he essentially told me that he didn’t want people looking in the book for the answers. He basically put it in a way that made me look like I was cheating.

Moving forward, we had an essay assignment that I worked VERY hard on. I spent two hours writing a two page paper only to be berated with comments about how wrong my opinion was. He gave me a C-! I have NEVER received a C- in my entire academic life.

I work an extremely high stress job, my girlfriend started a similar position recently, she also had been in another state for almost two weeks before this all went down so I havent really seen my girlfriend in well over a month despite the fact we live together. 

Now the real problem- her father is in our cities  hospital with complications from cancer treatment, and they live in another city.. Her mother has been living with is for nearly three weeks in our apartments  spare bedroom (she is largely a great guest, cleans up after herself quiet, clean, etc), but now my girlfriends sister and her boyfriend are coming to visit her father and will be sleeping on the couch for the weekend.  My girlfriend nor I were consulted about this, which wouldn't be a huge deal if it werent for the fact we were trying to have a weekend for ourselves.  I'm becoming a bit frustrated, but can't tell if I'm being a whiney bitch and need to STFU or if this is actually a bit inconsiderate?  Any neutral party want to tell me if I'm overreacting or if this is actually sorta not cool?

376,"At 25, I'm the youngest person in my department by about 20 years. I was hired out of school because of networking, the stars aligned, and it just so happened that they needed someone at a junior level because the organization is very flat in structure. I have realized that a disadvantage of this position is that I have no peers, and therefore no one at my level to bounce ideas off of, or to talk things over with before asking someone very, very senior. If I royally screw something up or even make a tiny mistake, it's in full view of my supervisor (who would be four levels above me, if the department was full of people).

 

Unfortunately, I've been dwelling on this a lot and have essentially started psyching myself out of every assignment, no matter how basic. My supervisor and another member have commented that there is typically a delay with the work I produce, it's done ""on the buzzer"" of the deadline, and that they would prefer for me to ask questions and to involve them more in certain things if I had issues or roadblocks. I have had to balance that against being periodically told, in response to some questions, that I need to do more of the work myself before bringing it to them. I was told during my performance review that all of the senior members of the department (so, everyone but me and the admin staff) sit together and discuss my evaluation en masse, which of course makes it even worse.

 

So the end result, and what I'm trying to change, is that I put off submitting assignments beyond the time they're due, and I don't like asking questions. I also obsess over certain things for way too long, churning through the same research trails, and printing out gobs of paper in order to justify my position on certain stances I take. I should have submitted a draft email with a small chart to my supervisor two days ago, but I'm stuck on the idea that it won't have been done to her liking. Even though I know in my head that submitting something is better than appearing like I don't care or forgot about it.

 

I would appreciate any insight or advice that you can offer. Right now I think it would be better to try and address the aspects of this that are in my own head rather than approaching my supervisor. As I get better about hitting internal deadlines and more willing to take risks, I may address some of the ""Ask questions/but ask the right questions/but not those questions"" aspect directly with her. For now, I just use it to illustrate part of where my hesitation comes from.",31May2019,1
378,"\- throwaway account for privacy reasons - sorry if this is long as well, brevity isn't my strong point

&amp;#x200B;

I (23F) went on a date with a guy (23) and we hit it off. He was sweet and we got along pretty well. We didn't hook up the first night but he came over the next weekend to watch a movie... and well you know what happens from there. I will be the first to admit that we were stupid and didn't use protection. Beforehand, I was used to having sex with someone who had frequently used the pull out method and we had always been safe. When he was about to come and was telling me that he was, I tried to move away from under him and explicitly said ""Stop, not in me!!"" and he fully ignored me and finished inside of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I felt really violated and disrespected that he didn't listen. Because of that feeling, I decided not to see him again and things fizzled out. I will take a portion of the responsibility in the fact that we didn't have the conversation beforehand and should have used protection, especially for new partners. (Trust me, I'm fully aware of the consequences and got an IUD put in place ever since). Luckily I had Plan B, took it within 24 hours and thought I was in the clear. 

&amp;#x200B;

WRONG. I ended up getting pregnant and had the worst side effects. I had to call out from work for a week and a half because I was too ill to even look a screen as well as take time to go to doctor's appointments. I didn't want to get him involved at this point because I didn't know his stance on abortion and I was confident in my decision (not ready for kids and didn't want to have this man be someone in my life forever). 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the procedure and the great state of Texas doesn't allow my insurance to cover abortion. I had to pay the costs out of pocket that totalled to $750. Luckily I had money in savings but I had that put aside to pay off a portion of my student debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend INSISTS that I ask him for half. I'm scared of his reaction and I'm not sure if he should have to pay since it wasn't his decision to go through with the procedure... although child support would have been much much more.

379,"I just got a new puppy and was walking her in the park yesterday when a little kid (maybe 4 or 5) came up to us and tried playing with her. She's excitable and kept jumping up at him and pushing so I was holding her back. His older brother (7 or 8) was taking care of him and told him to stop. He did, but then kept coming back trying to give my puppy acorns. I told him to stop and he wouldn't, but it wasn't that big of a deal, just a little annoying so I ignored it. As we were leaving he came back one more time and tried to give her an acorn. She didn't take it so he kicked her in the face. At this point I was so mad that I almost kicked \*him\* in the face myself. His brother came and pulled him away, telling him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Their mom was not even watching them. She was sitting in her car in front of the park on her phone, so I walked over there and told her that she needs to teach her kid some manners because he just kicked my dog in the face. She totally ignored that and just went off on me talking about how I don't need to tell her how to raise her kid and all this generic nonsense. As she was talking, the kid came up next to me and the puppy and she got excited again but I didn't hold her back and she pushed him down. He hit his head on the sidewalk and started to cry so the mom came out of the car and I just walked away. 

&amp;#x200B;

The park is right behind my house and these people live on the street over, so I know I will probably see them again. My question is, if something like that happens again, what can I actually do about it? What would happen if I were to push the kid away/down because he was trying to abuse my dog?

January 5th of this year two friends I’ve known since high school and I decided to head to the local bar and shoot some pool, have a few beers whatever.

I AM PRESCRIBED .5MG CLONAZEPAM AS NEEDED BUT ONLY UP TO TWICE DAILY. That day I awoke 7am(estimated) felt the anxiety creep as my grandmother was dying in the hospital(she’s gone now) and felt one was warranted for the edge. She was my world.

Fast forward to 3pm. This is when I arrive at where my friends are. We get in my truck(2018 Toyota, yes it’s worth noting as newer vehicles and their many recalls at times) and head off to the bar. Half way to the bar my brake pedal goes to the floor. Similar to when you’re bleeding your brakes but haven’t gotten all the air out. I kept pressing and pressing to no avail. We flipped 4 times and totaled my truck. My buddy’s were banged up but alive. TOYOTA MAILED ME A RECALL OF BREAK MASTER CYLINDER RECALL. I gave it to my lawyer.

I was in and out(yes I had a concussion and have full paperwork from hospital on everything) I remember making sure they were ok. Trying to gather any documents needed for police, then I remember blue lights. They came to the truck and one of my friends dropped OUTSIDE OF MY TRUCK (as stated in the police report) FROM HIS PERSON(also noted in report) right at an ounce of marijuana. They also took my weapons.(legal 100% and all registered to me) I was never read my rights or anything.

Next thing I remember is police took me to hospital. I woke up ripped IV out and called my friends to make sure they were alive. Everyone was ok I even managed a ride to look at them with my own eyes. They were good. I was in and out of it for about a week.

Fast forward to now. My lawyer is up to speed on everything and paid in full. They took my license at the wreck. I haven’t received a court date not jack shit. They picked me up two weeks after wreck and I sat in there for a week. So I know there is something going on behind the scenes. My question is WHEN. And what is the probable outcome? I need to pay child support. I need my license to get to work. I need money for bills. I’m stuck in the infinite void it seems.

385,"Reposting because I posted this first in the dead of the night

Kinda driving me crazy here. I’ve been attending group therapy once a week and have become good friend with one person (TF for Therapy Friend; it’s a no-no to be friends outside of group, but it just happened?). It’s summer break now at my college so most people have left, but TF and another person (AG for Another Guy) from group happened to live in the same place back home so they hung out, and TF ended up texting me about it.

TF has mentioned previously that AG might have a crush on her, but she maintains that she doesn’t like him that way. I teased her by saying that they’re getting awfully chummy, but she immediately launched into a whole spiel about how she doesn’t like him, all that. Okay, got it.

We knew that AG was going to Ireland to study abroad in the summer, so we ended up talking about him leaving. Here’s how the conversation went:

&gt;ME: ah yeah i think he’ll find an irish lass abroad  
**TF: He’s only there for a month and tbh he doesn’t seem like the hookup type at all.**  
**TF: I pegged him for a typical \[College Name\] bro at first but he’s actually quite a loner**  
ME: who knows if it’ll turn into a long term thing?? not that i know AG at all  
**TF: He also told me he actually rarely drinks heavily**  
ME: oh woah i wouldve guessed he drank a lot  
**TF: wait why are you already assuming he’s gonna meet someone and turn it into a long term thing lol**  
**TF: weird**

At this point I’m thinking “huh, what?”

&gt;ME: lol isnt that what happens abroad  
**TF: nah he doesn’t. he smokes more than he drinks**  
**TF: Not really. I hooked up with people but nothing long teem. Doesn’t really happen**  
ME: yeah we can smell him sometimes  
**TF: moral of the story: assumptions can be awfully wrong**

The self-righteousness rubbed me the wrong way, but I just wanted to have a conflict-free conversation so I decided to let it go.

&gt;ME: lol alright alright  
**TF: Just like AG assuming \[Therapist\] didn’t listen closely when really she has hearing problems**  
**TF: yeah it can really make you fall flat on ur face sometimes**  
**TF: He just keeps saying he doesn’t drink as much as his brother or value it as much**  
**TF: I hope he finds a girl over there but hope he doesn’t get his heart broken either**

Now I'm annoyed.

&gt;ME: what by assuming people get into sexual adventures abroad? it’s mostly true right?  
**TF: No you were assuming he drinks a shit ton and would get into something and then get into something long term, ur just being a bit weird**  
ME: not trying to argue but yeah i don’t know AG that well and statistically it’d be likely  
**TF: And I know him better at this point &amp; that’s not his priority**  
**TF: So idk why you’re even talking about it**

At this point I'm feeling like TF is being unfair.

&gt;ME: i think ur reading too much into my being weird  
ME: i'm making banter and i'm giving you what i assumed about him  
ME: u know? like how we talk about \[therapist\]?  
**TF: Well you know about his ex**  
ME: i don't

I'm more confused.

&gt;**TF: Okay Well I'm just dropping this bc this is bugging me a lot**  
**TF: Pretty sure he mentioned it in group but I'll say no more**  
ME: ok i've missed group like ten times too  
**TF: And whose fault is that**  
ME: MINE!!! lmao  
ME: yeah dude uhh  
**TF: Yeah. You're all to blame for group not being as effective as it could have been**  
ME: ok idk what's going on  
**TF: Exactly! I wouldn't have to feel as annoyed and uncomfortable with u talking about AG like that if u knew more**  
**TF: Cuz u missed group when he shared that part then**  
**TF: Im just annoyed**  
**TF: Just drop the whole sexual adventure thing please**

I tried to keep it light but what TF said ended up being pretty hurtful. I'm confused as to why she's going on about me missing group.

&gt;ME: ok yeah uh  
ME: am i having a stroke  
ME: sorry i honestly don’t see why it’s weird and why it’s a big deal? it’s crass maybe? i dont know his background with his ex and like you go to ireland to get drunk and visit castles and have wild parties that’s like a major reason why people go right?  
**TF: All I can say is sorry for lashing out, but the way you talk about sexual stuff is a sensitive topic for both me (you should know that) and based on his history, for him too so it’s not something I care to talk about.**  
**TF: I simply don’t want to talk about that.**  
ME: okay well you can tell me  
ME: bc i never knew AG’s deal  
**TF: I’m really done talking about this after this last text because I’m super annoyed right now**  
**TF: His ex-girlfriend was raped and that’s where all their problems came from**  
ME: i get that it’s sensitive now. yeah sure we’ll stop  
**TF: And his girlfriend would call him asexual and stuff**  
**TF: I’m not asking you permission to stop**  
**TF: Just stop**  
ME: okay i'll stop  
**TF: Thank you**

Okay, now it makes more sense why TF reacted the way she did. But still, I felt like her reaction was disproportionate.

&gt;**TF: Hope that helps you understand why talking about him in a ""let’s get drunk and party and fuck girls context"" doesn’t really appeal to me and doubt would appeal to him**  
ME: can you explain things when i don’t understand what you mean too? i had no idea and your reaction was confusing

This is the end of the conversation. I don't really know how to move on from here. I get that this was talked about in group therapy and it's a sensitive topic but I was startled by the self-righteousness, the putting words into my mouth, the sharpness... especially since I didn't even know. TF has been a good friend and we've spent a lot of time together but this is the first time she's been like this toward me and, in retrospect, all her romantic relationships ended disastrously with the guy always being a psycho and she's routinely swung back and forth between being totally angry and disappointed at her friends and being friendly again. I don't think I want to be treated the same way. My parents were similar in this way and I certainly don't miss walking on eggshells.

Is there anything I'm missing? Am I actually the asshole here? If not, is this person worth holding onto or should I cut ties with this person?",31May2019,1

388,"I take these capsule pills almost every day. It really only happens with these ones I take. When I take them, it feels like they get stuck in my throat. Almost as if it’s stuck in my pharynx but I know that’s not possible. But whenever I swallow I feel this one specific spot where I feel that it is. I don’t know if it’s actually the pill or just my mind tricking me but it gives me a lot of anxiety. My chest feels really heavy and I get this really nervous feeling. I feel like I can gag it back up but I don’t want to try because that scares me.  This is before the actual effects of the pills kick in so I know this isn’t something related to the effects of the pill(at least I think? They usually take 2ish hours to kick in ). But when it feels stuck I feel really uncomfortable and nervous. Do you guys have methods that you do to not have this feeling when you take medicine? Or is this just me that feels this way. I usually drink some juice to wash it down and eat some food to hopefully have the pill go down with the food. But sometimes that doesn’t work. But again, I’m not actually sure if this is just my brain making this up or if it’s actually stuck. But I still feel the effects of the pills. Also maybe 5ish hours after taking the pill, I sometimes can taste this bitter taste and I feel like as if it’s the bitterness of the substance inside the capsule. Sorry if this isn’t the right sub.

397,"Hey guys, I first wanna exclaim that I am not on a literal risk of death. I’ll try to explain my situation in the shortest while providing the most details possible. So, I live in a balkanic country, not in the EU. Pretty much a shithole country. So I’ve hated and detested the country because of the culture, the way they belittle, berate and control the life of the younger generation. Either way. I come from an upper middle class family, my dad’s an engineer in an italian company, pretty high up, my mom’s a teacher and she has a pretty good financial support since she does private classes as well. Except I’ve always suffered with my family. A lot of personal issues, include here toxic environment, no positive reinforcement or rewarding, no “we’re proud of you” moments whatsoever and they’ve also been physically abusive and threatening even at age 15 or such. They never really gave me enough money and they always picked on me. I got bullied and beat up in elementary school, and I went to the number one high school in my country. Needless to say, the number one high school of a shit country is shitty in itself. I wasn’t a top student nor was I a super hard worker, had several issues with angst and depressive phases, plus a huge demotivation from life itself. Either way, I used to get 60 bucks a month in my last year, keep in mind that I spend 1/4 of that on bus tickets, and that was pretty much all I could scrape for food. Either way, I’ve tried different careers, took a multimedia competition on making a movie with some friends and I won, we had a 2 week tour on Germany and met several politicians of germany as that was the purpose. I am extremely good on socials, took on literature, advanced literature, psychology, english, and pretty much every subject of this kind with grades like absolute A’s. I was unrivaled there. My mother wanted me to get into politics because of this, my father never told me if he liked a certain profession but he was always pro engineer and finance, although those two never got him a lot in life. Either way, I won a part scholarship to go in the US and follow three years of college there for filmmaking, then I had another three years free to establish myself in the US. All good, half of the school year was paid by my scholarship, food and housing included. They didn’t like the degree and that I was gonna be far, told me that schools are mediocre in thw US and didn’t pay it. They urged me to stay here or go to Germany cause schools are free (keep in mind, my father has money, he’s just not a big shot. However in the last three years he built three houses, two of them in the village, for the family cause he likes the village he’s from). So I told them I’ll do what I want, they kept trying to tell me to go to college and pushing me, I always said I applied (and I did, i also got accepted in some pretty high ones by status) but I nevee signed up for them. They threatened to kick me out of the house. End of the day they didn’t, however I’ve hated them before all of this and I hate them more after. So it’s been 9 months since these events happened, I got two friends in the same situation, and we all wanna move out. I also got a youtube channel but I’m pretty much broke long run.

403,"

My bff and I met in 8th grade and we immediately became friends. Keep in mind bff and I our from completely different backgrounds and speak different languages. Pretty soon we made friends with another girl and the three of us were pretty close until 11th grade. Bff and friend got into a major fight, I was stuck in the middle of this. Around this time, bff made a new friend that spoke the same language as her. They had a connection that my friend and I could never have. Friend and I gradually stopped talking and I chose bffs side. Bff and her new friend were getting closer, I admit I was jealous but I took the effort t become friends with the new friend. Gradually I started noticing signs that bff is slightly annoyed with me. For example, I would say something and they would share looks. I also noticed how she would never treat me the same as the new friend.They would sometimes speak in their language even when I was with them, even though I didn’t understand anything. Although this happened to me, I never did anything about it. I know this may sound like I’m jealous, but I tried very hard to become friends with her new friend. I would make the effort to talk to her in class and partner up. Although we did become friends, I never really thought she was interesting. I was only friends with her for my bff. In 12th grade, that’s when things got really bad. They would never invite me to things. I knew at this point that they didn’t like me. It hurt a lot because my bff and I had been friends for so long. Regardless, I still hung out with them during class because I told myself that after 12th grade I would never see them again. I also didn’t have many friends besides them and breaking from your friend group and joining a different one would have been hard. I told myself not to overthink it. Our school trip was fast approaching and we had to pick our room mates for the trip. So the rooms were organized like this: western rooms had 2 beds and traditional rooms had 3 floor mattresses. So I offered that we could go for the room for three mattresses but bffs friend said that she had “allergies” and couldn’t sleep on the floor. I didn’t believe what she was saying, but I’m not one to judge. She could actually have it. They took the western room and I shared a room with someone else. During the first day of our trip, I felt like I was a complete burden to them. They would talk to me normally one second, we would be laughing and having fun, next they would completely act annoyed. At one point, I remember how they had tried to quickly move locations without me noticing. I noticed and that was the last straw for me. At that point I was done. I hated being treated like that. At that time, I was recasted. I had supported bff so many times, I’ve helped her and she’s helped me. I felt utterly betrayed. After that incident, I completely ignored them for the rest of the trip. Even though I did this, I still had hope that I could salvage the relationship so I asked advice from my roommate. She urged me to talk to them and ask them what I had done wrong. I agreed. After the trip, I asked bff that if I did something wrong and that I was sorry. She said I had done nothing wrong and she proceeded to talk to me normally. After a few days of them being friendly, their behavior started again. I couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t care if I would be alone, I was done. I stopped talking to both of them. Bff realized this and she approached me once trying to act like everything is normal but I shut her down. Bff and I did not talk for 9 months. I ignored her, she ignored me. To be honest, I wish I had done it sooner. I should not have been treated like that at all. I should have stood up for myself. I even asked her what I had done wrong and she denied it. After cutting contact with her I felt a weight lift of my shoulders, I made new friends and enjoyed my senior year. 
Now here’s where the real story starts: 
Bff and I did not talk for 9 months, my friends would tell me small bits of info about her like what uni she applied to and stuff. Long story short, we ended up in the same university. I didn’t care to honest. Bffs friend moved out of the country btw. Bff and I started talking, pretending like everything is normal. She’s treating me like she did before, she’s even made couple of friends who speak the same language as her but they don’t speak their language in front of me. If they do, they translate what their saying. My questions is, do you think I should end the friendship? I feel like she could do what she did in high school again? Should I give her another chance? There’s way more to the story but it would be very long....

When I showed him what I was wearing he responded with “Oh no” in a whine that resembled a two year old being dragged out of the toy store.

We have had sex once (not even completely) in the last month and a bit, despite my many efforts to initiate. It makes me feel extremely unattractive and undesirable. How he always  turn down my advances and reject them hurts and my self-esteem has taken a real hit. It makes me feel insecure, angry, and honestly quite resentful. It isn’t fair to me and I don’t want to keep feeling like this. We’ve spoken about this before with no change. It has gotten to the point for me where I am afraid to try to and make advances, and I am ready to just give up on sex altogether to avoid feeling that way.

For example I could be sitting around a campfire having fun hanging out with family and friends, drinking hoy chocolate.

Anytime things are good my head is screaming to fuck it up. Even in a group chat of friends when everybody is making jokes and getting along in a very friendly way, I just want to send something that would ruin their day like a fatal car crash video or sexual torture.

I can't stop it. It's always been a part of me. Even as a kid when I'd be playing at a park I would for whatever reason start trouble. Push my brother of a swing, throw sand in the other kids eyes etc..

409,"Long backstory: First of all I'm 18m and my best friend is 18f. We go to the same school, but are in different classes. We have been friends for about 1 and a half years and she has expressed multiple times her love for me (platonic of course, not even remotely sexual). It's pretty clear, that we have common personalities and that we think alike quite a lot. This year has been very difficult for both of us, just like all people our age, because here in Greece, we take the ""National Exams"" that determine if we'll be accepted to our university of choice. She wants to study medicine, which means she has to study everyday for at least 9 to 10 hours and I want to study Electrical Engineering, which for an above average student (not bragging) I study about 5 to 6 hours a day. We are taking the exams in a week, so its understandable, that there's a ton of stress involved. We have been talking online about 95% of the time, because at school we have different friends and we studying doesn't allow us to go out together. Since July, that the intense studies started for both of us, she has been going on on about the next years, that we are going to be attending the same university, going out all the time and that we will be a lot closer (since most our friends will attend unis in other cities). However, as a person, even if according to her, we are best friends, she sometimes is quite distant and generally doesn't try as much as I do in this friendship (= asking me to go out, when she has free time, choosing instead her female friends with which she says she doesn't share as much, or in school she rarely comes to find me to chat.) I have confronted her two times about all this including the fact that our friendship is basically virtual and she always say, that I'm right and she'll try more. Of course, pretty much nothing has changed. I used to respond to her remarks about our friendship, but after all this I am much more restrained and generally I'm not a touchy feely guy. As I said in a week we're taking the exam and she has ghosted me on instagram for two weeks now. I confronted her in school, but she told me, that she goes on instagram, but just ghosts everyone. And that's where I have a problem. She knows, that I'm always there for her and I love her, but she's really insensitive and shows me through her actions, that she doesn't really care about me. Until we finish the exam on June 17th I'm not going to confront her online(=double text her) and in school I'll behave like normal. I want to be clear, that I don't annoy her about these things apart from those to times and even she may sound as cold person, I feel lucky to have met her. I hope I'm not looking desperate for attention or something, I just want her to be my friend just like she says and all this kinda hurts my feelings. Yes I know she has is studying very hard and she is constantly stressed, but what will happen when we finish ? Will anything actually change ? Am I the one that doesn't show enough affection ?  

From the novel that you just read I want to ask you, if you believe, that our friendship actually means something, or that this turmoil is just in my head. I regard myself as a realist and that's why I'm asking you for an unbiased opinion. What should my actions be during the summer ?

Not long after the relationship began, I found out he was cheating on me already with MULTIPLE girls. Telling each of them he loves them and they mean everything to him etc. 

So I left him. I walked away and left him. Then he  moved on and got engaged to another girl. It upset me but I moved on, I was okay. A few months later I “relapsed” as such. The loneliness was too strong and I wanted him back. So I messaged him again. We tried again, he promised me this would never happen again and I, of course, trusted him. 

He took me home to his family, I met his friends, I stayed the night at his house, we were basically inseparable. He gave me no reason at all to not trust him. 

A few months later the relationship started to get slightly abusive. He has bursts of anger in which he takes his problems out on me. He’d swear at me and insult me, saying really insensitive things, almost as if he chose to say things that would purposely hurt me. For example he’d say that he could go to any girl he wanted, he liked it better to have sex with them (he knows things like this have ruined my sense of self worth and confidence), he’d swear and shout at me in the street; calling me a dickhead, a hoe, a slut, told me I’m worthless and i mean nothing to him, told me he’s glad I never had his child (I had an abortion for him) and many more things which pain me to even think about. He never hit me but he’d pushed me out the way, pushed me onto the bed, grabbed my arms until it hurt etc. He cried and told me how much he loved me and I know I’m stupid but I forgave him. That hasn’t happened for a while so I guess I kind of forgot about how angry he can get. 

Then, about 4 days ago, like the “psycho” I am, I checked his phone. I found calls and messages from girls. He’d lied to them, told them he’s single, got money from them and told them he loves them. 

I forgave him again. I feel so alone and worthless. I want to leave him but I feel like I physically can’t. After my abortion I’ve felt extremely lonely and worthless because I really wanted the baby and he made me feel as if it wasn’t even an option because we’re young. 

He’s selfish and makes me feel like I’m worth nothing. I know people will think I’m stupid for staying with him, but I genuinely feel like I have no choice. I’m so scared to be alone. I want to move on and grow but I have no one. I have no friends and I don’t know what to do.",31May2019,0

I'm trying to be a Surgeon, but money is tight. And let's face it, in the real world, money place an incredibly important role in everyone's life. Whether we like to admit it or not, that is the plain truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today is the day I am supposed to move out of my apartment and into the dorms because they offer free housing for students. To be honest, if it wasn't free, I wouldn't be able to afford it, and that is considering that I go to one of the cheaper State Universities. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents help as much as they can, and I am eternally grateful. But I see them struggling, I see my sister indirectly taking the hit; she's in high school now, and for whatever reason, she still has not gotten her braces. HER BRACES!

&amp;#x200B;

Do I really think they can afford to help me and my sister? The answer is no, I don't. At least not without sacrificing a great deal in their quality of living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Parents who read this might say that sacrificing for their child is their duty, and although it may not appear that way, that you are happy to sacrifice yourself for your child. I've been told, and I make me incredibly happy that there are fantastic parents out there. I see my parents the same way, I think they are truly amazing, but I can't deny the things I see. My sister doesn't have straight teeth, and I know that my parents would get them. Since they haven't, it's because they can't right now.

I applied for a sales job that I fully accepted as a kind of application you do even when you think you won't get a callback.

&amp;#x200B;

But I did, it's as a salesman that makes a very decent living. It's a base salary of around 20k, which is no different than working at Home Depot; which is where I recently got hired (so I do have income on the way),  I can work on commission, and it's a fantastic percentage, (from what I gathered). 

The reason I'm in summer classes is that I failed those classes, I didn't perform well enough to continue onto the more difficult classes. It wasn't because I wasn't smart enough, it was because at the time I was an idiot who didn't have his priorities in order, like many other 20 somethings.

 But I don't want to be at the mercy of loans, my parents' income, or anybody else. Especially when I only want to see my family get forward in their lives, especially my sister who I wholeheartedly love. I understand it isn't my place, it's her life and she needs to work for her success. I failed at working on mine because I was too unfocused in high school, and now I'm paying the price. But that is my life, I didn't know better, I had no older sibling to tell me, ""stop being a dumbass and focus"". That would have saved me a lot of headaches, but life goes on. 

The best time to get your life in order was yesterday, the second best time is right now. 

Let's talk about the income I can expect for a better idea of my conflict. If it was some minimum wage job with shitty benefits, worked in manual labor, or just an all around crappy atmosphere I would not even consider it, college all the way. 

This opportunity, however, isn't like that. Yes, the main source of income would be the commission, but my friend who I've known for years and I'd trust my life with has recently started working there. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's legit. They paystubs don't lie, the benefits don't lie, the insurance card doesn't lie. Can you believe that? Insurance? I couldn't dream of it. 

I'm torn because the plan was for me to go to summer school, which was the only reason my parents allowed me to stay. But my father does not think it is a good idea for me to deviate from my career path, and that it isn't my business about my sister, that they will take care of it. But if I'm being honest, they could not even pay a 1000$ price tag for my school literally two days ago. 

I'm I being deceived by them so that I can continue my career? 

I think so. 

In fact, it's just plain obvious. 

I'm glad my parents are looking out for me, but I will be okay, I'm not planning on staying at that job. I fully intend on saving up enough for me to feel comfortable going part-time, but preferably focus only on my schooling, stress-free. Not only for myself, but for my sister. It isn't my business, but I'm making it my business. I want to fill the potholes in her path so she doesn't have to struggle as much as me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not told my mom, I have to tell her today. She isn't going to like the news, and she will strongly advise me, and may even try to force me into going to school. 

I'm an adult, and I can take control of my life. 

My gut tells me to go for it, but I'm so torn about how my family will take this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I do it? I think I should? 

How should I break the news to my mom?

I did purchase a greyhound ticket, but my family doesn’t want me to take the bus because they say it’s dangerous. My family says that they will take me, and that’s nice if it didn’t have to be so chaotic. There’s always arguing in the car whether we are traveling 20 minutes or three hours to my college. I just don’t want to deal with it. I want a peaceful trip. I don’t want to feel like it’s my fault if they get lost because they blame me. They get super anxious about the GPS and get focused on other things. That bothers me. I understand that I should be grateful that I have someone to take me, but it’s not very pleasant when I don’t always feel that I’m in a safe environment. I would much rather take the Greyhound, but no one likes that idea because I’m blind and they say I look like a child and someone could take me. There are a lot of other people who are worried about it too and I can understand that, but they let my brother do it because he can see and he’s bigger than I am.

420,"I met a guy almost 5 years ago who was practically my soulmate,but lived miles away. I was just coming out of a horribly toxic relationship and at the same time I had made a new friend who was there for me and took care of me and my feelings. The guy who lived away, whom I'll refer to as D, was a little too intense for me, he had had a hard upbringing and suffered from depression, which I could've dealt with hadn't I been through an unstable period. I adored him nonetheless and chatted with him all the time and promised to moved to his country to live with him, but things got difficult, he got distant and told me he had started dating  someone else and we stopped talking. Meanwhile, my love for my friend grew and we decided to start a relationship. It was great and he would visit me everyday and care for my broken heart (the situation with my ex was still hurting). We started sharing a lot of things, accomplishments and goals and became inseparable. 

A while after, my now boyfriend had graduated and he asked me to move in with him. I had dropped out of college and money was short, so I started working and spent more time apart from my BF. Then one day, D texted me again, he said he was sorry and that he missed me, so we started things all over again. Whenever he would call me or text me, my heart would race. This time, I was more stable and tried to support him, I'd help him with his homework and be there for him through the rough days, but I told him I had a BF and I just wanted us to be friends. He said no, that he had way too strong feelings for me to be just my friend. But once again, he got too intense and would be depressed for days. I was also feeling down and started feeling clingy and needy.

So one day, I went to a party and got very drunk, so I texted him to confront him with the fact that he was too absent and I couldn't deal with abandonment (my toxic relationship had me stressed and depressed because my ex would ignore me all the time). He replied that it was too difficult dealing with himself and couldn't give me all I needed. So we argued a lot and I went to bed. The next day, my BF went to work acting a bit distant and when he came home he confronted me asking who D was. He had noticed me a bit jumpy during the party and had gotten suspicious about whom I was talking to. I told him the truth, that we had had a thing and I wanted to be friends but he was too in love with me. He got all angry and asked me to stop talking to D, which I did. I knew we were too much for eachother, so I said my farewells and deleted his contact and forgot about him. 

But I've been thinking a lot about him lately and about the last text he sent me (We used a social app to chat, were we met, and after we said goodbye he sent me a long text and deleted his account. The app blocked the messages and I couldn't read what he wrote). So I texted him through Facebook, since I always knew his profile. And he replied yesterday and we started to chat again, after over a year of silence. Turns out he still loves me and wants to be with me, he asked me to leave my BF and moved with him. And I'd love to, but I love my BF so much and we also share a lot of plans together, we've gone through a lot and we're practically engaged.

I don't know what to do, I'm too selfish to let D go, but I know I'm hurting him by choosing someone else. And I also feel like crap by lying to my BF and having feelings for D.

TL:DR 
I love a guy who lives miles away with whom I've shared lots of drama, but I also love my BF with whom I moved together almost two years ago.",31May2019,2
421,"I just wanted to say sorry for the lenght of this post. I'm really nervous about this and really need any kind of advice/opinion on this matter. Anything helps me a lot.
First of all, context. I am a girl (14), I speak spanish so my translations may not be exact and last year I changed from a mixed school to an all-female school because of problems with boys of my class and friends during my time there. I was really scared and nervous my first day and there was a girl that showed me around and presented me to her friends, I'll call her Aria. Last year, I really struggled to talk to her group because I was afraid to mess up since they were really nice and kind, so I spent a lot of time with Aria. She became like a best friend, we had similar interests and always had a good time, but then these situations started to bug me. 
The first thing I can think of, is being at her house talking, when Aria says ""If I were gay, I'd probably date someone like you"", I was like ""alright"" and just forgot about it until now. She would call me ""honey, my love, dear"" and I would be confused af as to why she called me like that, especially when she wasn't like that with other friends. I asked why she called me that to try te give her a hint that I disliked it, it kinda worked. She told me several times ""I love you, really"", she was really physical (she was always trying to hug me, just jumping at me) and I didn't feel like it was friendly-like, just awkward. One day at a meetup with friends Aria asked me to wait for her (it was in a big yard, our friends went to the other side to eat) and she just said to me something along the lines of ""You're really smart, but when it comes to getting what people mean to tell you, you've got no idea/you're clueless"", I hate confrontation so I asked ""What do you mean?"", she said ""see?"" and never answered me. This year Aria told me the same thing again, with no answer. I told her many times that I didn't feel comfortable hugging and kissing my friends too much (like when you greet someone, but she also sometimes just kissed my arm??) and she never listened, until one day out of the blue she brought it up again. After hearing the same thing I always told her she said ""I see, then I'll try to not be so direct"". Once my friends, Aria and I were talking about hurting others(?), so she says ""That's not the only way OP can hurt you"" and I ask yet again for her motive to say that, she just keeps brushing it off nervously until I give up (she knows very well that I ask what she means when she ""thinks out loud"", I think she does it intentionally). Aria was once with me and read a quiz's question out loud ""If you could date a friend's familliar, who would it be?"" and the whispered ""If only zak (?) had a sister""?, then brushedd it off again. One day she told me her crush was a boy with a personality like mine and asked my opinion if someone asked me out, I said no for various reasons. Days later she cries for the whole lunch and more because of something, one friend told me it was because we distanced, other because she was rejected by that boy, Aria told her that she didn't get it. I apologised for being distant, said it was because I felt uncomfortable and she said it was her fault for being too possesive?? Yesterday while talking with another friend, Aria said that if there were alcohol in our graduation party she would have taken a lot and confessed to her chush. Then Aria and Friend whispered about ""something Aria hasn't told Friend2 and OP"", kind of suspicious if you ask me. I told my mom about some of these things and about me feeling uncomfortable, but she really likes Aria so she told me it was just her way of being, that she was a very expressive person and that I shouldn't forget it was her the first one to include me in this new school. Please give me advice on anything, I feel like an ass because I don't even like touching her anymore because of how it bothers me. I'm perfectly fine with hugging other friends, but not her, I can't stop myself from wanting to push her away. Please tell me if I am just full of myself and she's just being nice. I'm maybe just overthinking it all and hurting Aria in the process. Today she started crying about something that wasn't grades and she asked to talk to me during lunch. help me please",31May2019,1
422,"I'm not really sure what advice I'm looking for, but things between me and my friend have gotten strained. I went through something pretty devastating shit earlier this week, and I became very quiet and a bit moody. He knew what I was going through, but didnt really seem empathetic or caring. The two times I was trying to open up to him, he walked out of the room to do something else. Then when we were meant to watch a show together, I told him to watch without me and he got frustrated with me.

After that he stopped talking to me. I sent him a message telling him that I was going through a hard time and not to take my weird mood personally.

He didn't respond. He also continues not to make an effort to talk to me, when normally we are texting all day and bugging eachother at home. He has completely retreated.

What should I do at this point? Just wait till he decides he wants to talk to me again? I'm trying not to feel resentful, but I really could have used his support. I know people struggle with mood changes and difficult emotions but it still hurts.

He hates having talks about ""feelings"" because he doesnt think friends should have those convos lol. So I'm trying to deal with this in the most hands off way..",31May2019,1
423,"Hi, I think I need some opinions about this topic, it's been a major concern for most of my life, every time I've tried to bring this topic (may have been 3-4 times before) I just get ridiculed, missunderstood or just got answers like ""whatever dude"" so I'm going to try to open myself on reddit, the thing is that I happen to have an over-average intelligence (to clarify I'm seriously concerned about this, I'm not here to brag about it nor to fulfill my ego, I already got those answers before, I suffer from incredibly low self-esteem due to it, and specially dealing with frustration and anxiety because of me not fitting in well, by intelligence I mean IQ, logic, common sense, cognitive capabilities or however you want to call it) so basically I find myself being the smartest person in the room MOST of the time, I may have personally met 2-3 people (not counting people I listen to or read through other types of media) in my entire life that I really admire for their intelligence (I absolutely do not think it's the only important trait in life but it's the trait that I want an opinion about in this post and the one I'm concerned about, I may be claryfing too much but I just want to make sure that I explain myself the best I can). I'm gonna write down two of the main problems I've found:

•I choose VERY carefully the words I use when speaking (automatically, I don't spend 5 minutes thinking before saying something) because I know they have a meaning so I use them specifically when they fit exactly what I want to mean, with not a single exception, If I said a word and you look up its meaning I meant 100% that exact thing, same with how I put together any sentence, I do not leave any room for mistake, however I have to over explain myself (very often) due to missunderstandings and I always got really frustrated over it (never got angry at the other person, just got generally frustrated) that's why over the time I developed into choosing my words this way but somehow it won't change the outcome. It's as if people assume I meant something without me meaning anything close to it at all (and I'm talking about situations where I knew for sure my facial expressions, tone and body language didn't give any reason to missunderstand what I meant).

•I like to try new stuff so I've been through a lot of hobbies, also I crave for new knowledge constantly so this lead me to know a bit about a lot of topics and a bit more about what I'm more interested at the moment or that's what I thought when I was in high school until I've slowly come to realize that when I thought that I knew a ""bit"" about a topic I really knew a LOT more than most of the people mainly interested in that and when I'm into some field I can barely personally share it with anyone and that led me to feel quite lonely in a lot of things (of course there's people that know WAY more then me in every single topic, I'm not saying I know all about everything, I'm just saying that when I think I just got a bit curious about a topic and browsed/researched about it for a week or two I already found myself just absorbing everything I read and being precise with the sources so that I know I'm reading/seeing the correct info, and always thought that this was average, still I don't know what to think about that without the fear of falling into any narcissistic thoughts).

•This one is going to be a bit vague and I'm not sure if I'm gonna explain myself well enough (english is not my main language) but the third problem is regarding thought processes of people. When I'm socializing and a problem/hard question shows up even if I'm not familiar with the topic or I've never been in a similar context I end up being the fastest getting the most efficient answer without even noticing how hard it gets for other people and I sometimes get a really anxious when they seem to be really slow processing some thoughts to finally come to an answer if they even get there.

Finally, every time I shared this I've been told to look for therapy, I know it would probably help a lot but I can't afford it in my country and I can live with this but It's still a big problem in my life so I hope I may find an answer to all of this some day if I keep seeking help through other means.

For those of you that are curious I've been tested and have an IQ of roughly 160 still nothing crazy but enough to initially make me doubt if that's an important factor regarding the problems I started noticing happening to me when I was young.

I really appreciate your patience if you read all of it, I'll happily reply any questions. Thanks!!

TL;DR: I don't know if I have a problem or if my surroundings are the problem but I've been trhough severe anxiety and depression due to what I think is an over-average IQ and I'm trying to find some opinions about it in reddit.",31May2019,1
424,"We were together for three years and during the entirety of that time she would go on about the physical and emotional abuse from her mother and that she wanted to escape from her, so after a couple years after I arranged for her to move in with my mom. But she couldn't. It wasn't that she didn't want to, she couldn't get past the wall of fear she faced. All her mom has to do is threaten to hurt her and sometimes not even that to get her to do whatever she wants. Part of the problem too is that she's incredibly sheltered. I had to explain to her that leaving her mom's apartment wasn't illegal cause she's over eighteen. Her entire world view is dictated by her mom. Eventually push came to shove and she told me she wanted to stay at my place for a night. Her mom called her, threatened to send her cop brother to attack me, just her usual scare tactics. The brother got there, I didn't let him in until the sheriff got there and girlfriend pulled id and said this was where she wanted to be. Sheriff left, brother kept lying to her telling she wouldn't get in trouble and that she'd still get to see her boyfriend if she just left. She caved. Her mom took her cellphone which I paid for. Finally her mom wrote up a bs restraining order thing and my lawyer just showed her the texts from my phone of my ex accusing her of physical abuse so she darted out of court.

I have no way to communicate with her without her mom's intervention, last thing she told me in person was how much she loved me and helped her be stronger but the last thing she texted me, which was before the restraining order failed and before the court date, was that ""she believed it was time to end the relationship"" I asked her if she still loved me. I never got a response.

She told me that her mom hitting her to do what she wanted was what was ""normal"" and that I was wrong.

It's been two years now, I've gone to a therapist, I just can't seem to move on. I constantly wonder how she is, whether she still cares for me, and why her parents kept fucking with me even after they broke communications between us.

I have a clear goal in life and I've pursued that goal for over 10 years but now it's like I feel nothing. Justice is only a matter of perspective. Everything is absurd. Meaning is self - defined and yet everyone wants you to adopt their meaning.

429,"So, I (30,M) am currently living with my mom after a failed relationship damaged my credit and forced me to move in with her until I can rebuild and regain enough funds to move out. I've been here about 3 years or so (I was in a pretty bad depression after the relationship and used money and buying things for others to fill the void so saving didn't go very well in the beginning) but I'm finally coming into a better position and have been presented with an opportunity to move in somewhere much closer to work and finally get out of the whole ""living with parents"" thing.

Now, little backstory on my mom: My dad and she divorced when I was 17 and my mom's never really recovered from it - she's still hurt whenever my sister or I mention my dad's girlfriend, she's lost friends because of the split and their choosing him over her, etc. In that time, she's developed a really bad gambling problem that has led to numerous sleepless nights sitting in front of the slots, forcing me to lie to family about where she's been or just not telling me where she's been (I pretty much knew after a few months). She's recently (like within a month) admitted she has a problem and has even gone to ONE Gamblers Anonymous meeting to begin getting help, but I'm not sure how well that will stick. She went out with friends from work to see a play and never came home so I pretty much know she either A) went out after the play or B) never went at all and just went right to the casino.

I am very protective of all my family and would do anything for them, especially my mom and my sister. I feel that my living with her helps show her that there are still people that love her and want her around and it's good for her to have someone to come home to and discuss this addiction with rather than go out every single night. My fear is that, if I take this new living situation closer to work, my mom will fall into a downward spiral and lean even heavier on gambling to cope with her growing loneliness, but I also don't want to halt my own life. I've tried talking about this with family and close friends of her's but ultimately she ends up just continuing to go so I figured why not try asking here.",31May2019,1

I got bullied for my appearance, I got hit, I got rejected by groups of girls that I wanted to be friends with.

We did everything together, sleepovers, all-nighters, road trips, everything. Then we had a disagreement and all of a sudden they completely stop being friends with me. They started bullying me, cyber-bullying me, I tried to find other friends and they even turned them against me, they harassed me and called my home, and told me not to show my face.

I was heartbroken because coming from a broken home I considered them my family. I screamed, I cried, I broke everything in sight in my room, I was devastated. I started blaming my mother that was only trying to help and have my back  and I started acting out violently towards her. She called my uncle who lived stayed away and then I moved with him for a while and she came down along with me to get away from it all.

Then I made a group of new friends, and the same thing happened. They all wrote me notes, that said how ugly I was and just roasting the hell out of me and I read them in the middle of class. I freaked out on them and stood up for myself.

I’m strong, I over-came things in my life and I accepted that some things about me I needed to work on in order to be a good friend. 

Now I’m 22 Y/O struggling to have any kind of “deep” friendships. I have tons of friends, I would call “surface” friends but every time I feel as if their getting past my barriers I get defensive. I have a 4 year boyfriend, a dog and a peaceful home that I love so much with my little family. I get real defensive of it. And if I meet anyone who was like the girls who bullied me I almost feel choked up around them. 

I don’t know if it’s just all in my head or I just have a good reason to be careful who I’m friends with.

I know personally I’m terrified of other girls, I feel like they can destroy me and my life. 

I just don’t know how to get over that feeling and was wondering if anyone could help me out with suggestions or supportive words?

436,"My boyfriend has had his dog since childhood and he’s a very big part of his life. Recently, like over the past few months, the dog has been sick having a lot of trouble with daily activities and my boyfriend has known he hasn’t gotten much time left. I’m in an LDR with him so sometimes it’s hard for me to express myself over just words and not actions. He found out yesterday that the dog will be put down in a week and naturally he’s devastated. I really need some advice on how I can be there to support him and what can I do. I’ve never had to deal with this before. I’ve never personally met the dog but he means a lot to me too.

437,"Hi Reddit,

First time posting here so go easy on me. I’m looking for advice as a student. I recently received a B+ as a final grade in one of my classes. To many, this might not seem bad, but, to someone like myself who is maintaining a 9.7+ CGPA, it hurts a lot. Prior to the final exam, I had an average, in the course, of 90+%. However, I was not surprised when my grade dropped because, when I passed the final exam, most of the questions seemed like they weren’t even built based on our course book. I had studied every definition and concept and I was still forced to pick answers randomly for about half of the final exam. After the exam, I searched some of the odd questions/definitions I remembered from the exam using CTRL+F on the readable pdf of the book and the class slides. They were nowhere to be found.

I started by contacting my course professor through email to set a meeting. After 3 unsuccessful attempts, I had to contact the undergrad office; they emailed her; then she responded to my emails. We were able to set a meeting.

During the meeting, she started out by telling me she didn’t have much time (10-15 minutes) because she had to go to another meeting. I asked if she preferred to reschedule; she declined. She quickly went through the written part of the exam (30%) and explained why I had 11/30. Even if I didn’t entirely agree with her points, I accepted her views and moved on. I then asked if I could consult the multiple choice section (worth 70%). She responded: “I don’t have time to go through every single question and explain to you why you are wrong. I have to go. You only have yourself to blame.”

I am now trying to understand what my next steps are. Accept how things are and move on? Contact the appeal committee to receive a different grade? Problem is, I don’t think my grade was miscalculated. I think the exam itself was based on the material of a prior book and not the current one. 

Let me know what you think.",31May2019,3

439,"So, a little bit of backstory to clear things up

In the first semester I studied Psychology, wich I moved away from in February due to that it wasn't really what I was expecting and the chance of finding work is under 25% in my country. So Instead I went on to pursue Teacher in High School.

Exams are coming up and I've always been catching up from the lessons I missed in the first semester whilst also attending the classes we have in the current one. It was very stressful to me and I've had many sleepless nights just to be able to follow everything while also studying for my other exams. 

Now I have this feeling that I should just let this year go and relax, just start next year again as that is a possibility. I am totally fine with studying one extra year if it means my mental health will survive. Yet that's where I need advice:

Should I take my exams, of wich I am still behind or should I just leave it be for next year? I know this is my decision I was just wondering what the wiser and older people of reddit would think.

I was always exposed to the real estate as a business (sale and development) and I have always been into tech.

I  while back I came up with an idea for a business -seemed good- so I  looked into it, I presented the idea to people that knew better than me  and they liked it. So much so that they introduced me to some investors  (it would take quite a bit of capital to make my concept operational).

One of these investors liked the idea and really liked me.

My  idea would be a good symbiotic fit with companies he already owns, so  he made me an offer: he helps me develop my idea, but I also have to  come work for him in his other companies. Thing is... I have no formal  education or experience on the subject he wants me to manage.

I  know I can execute my idea because I prepared, studied and spoke with  experts for over a year, I know I can do it. But his thing.... I am not  so sure. Although I definitely know  more than he does I probably would  not know as much as the people that would be my potential colleagues or  even subordinates, and it makes me feel like a fraud, like I should  refuse the offer.

446,"Bit of a long read so bear with me. Last year I returned home from the city I was in college in due to severe mental health reasons. I have been in a lot of therapy since and as a result I needed to stop chasing people all the time for the sake of controlling my anxiety/depression as it stems from low self esteem. Since I have done that I realized a lot of people that I thought were my friends were either acquaintances or not actually my friends. I have also made large changes to my lifestyle and changed a lot as a person making me much happier in who I am even though I 'm not quite where I want to be in my life. Many people never got onto me around Christmas when they would have been in my home town and any time I do meet them they say they were meaning to get onto me. While it hurt, on introspection I can see why some didn't want to contact me (used to be bitter, immature, forget birthdays, shithead humor looking for attention, quiet in social situations etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

 I will likely be going back to the city I studied in for my career and was wondering should I get onto them first or just create an entirely new group of friends. I have reasons for both and I can't choose.

 The main thing stopping me from just starting again is that It could be my poor mental health that frames it in this way and the fact that many are starting their careers and are caught up in it. The reasons I have in my head for not contacting them is that I have forgotten what I used to be like since I have entirely changed my belief system and the depression fucked up my memory. I had some great times with these people but could have been a shithead sometimes. Some have gotten onto me but only once in the last year while others have made more of an effort. On top of that many groups of friends have hierarchies - I have made large changes to my life meaning that II would not fit into that position that I previously occupied and this may upset people. A few people who have met me can't grasp the changes I have made and I don't see the point in going back to that position as I may regress back to who I once was. What should I do?",31May2019,7
447,"A few months ago, a therapist I've seen since I was 16 (am 22) and I had a sexual encounter. The leading-up to this happened very fast and all of it was incredibly confusing. Afterward, I had a full traumatic response and since then, I have been fighting darkness I never knew existed. I felt cloudy after for so long, and even still, I am not the same. At times, it is still beyond horrible to re-experience. It has been very difficult to manage school, and living in general.

&amp;#x200B;

She seems to think that she did nothing wrong, and that this was a mutual endeavor. She kept contacting me after, and I repeatedly had to tell her I didn't want to speak to her anymore. She left her husband (apparently, the two of them haven't had sex in over the decade they've been married), and had been pressuring me to live with her. Recently, I had to threaten with a restraining order, and I haven't heard since. She claims no responsibility and doesn't seem to think she did anything wrong. It drives me insane, and sometimes I just want to report her and ruin her life. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I've spoken to another therapist and a couple of close people, and each of them say I should report -- if only to get her out of the field. I understand that, and I would not want anyone else to suffer. However, I know deep down, the biggest reason would be for revenge -- because I want her to be hurt too. I don't know if I could live with myself after, knowing that I ruined someone's life so they could suffer. I feel that sentiment might haunt me, or the universe might even bite back at me for not taking the moral high ground.

450,"  I’m a 26yo male. My upbringing wasn’t very great. I was adopted at birth because my biological mother was a drug addict/schizophrenic. My adoptee family is very uneducated with a low IQ. I was emotionally and physically abused by my father daily. I was generally an outcast at school. 
  I developed a bad alcohol problem, starting around 15. I went to EMT school and got my advanced EMT license when I was 20. I worked for five years and life seemed to be ok despite binge drinking on the weekends. I never made very much money but I made enough to get by.
  I met a woman at work, another EMT. We fell in love. She’s a bit older, 34 with four kids. We both lost our job at the same time due to dating. She never went back to work and I went to work for another company. Her brother is a heroin addict and one night we were all drinking and I walked in on the two of them smoking heroin in our bedroom. I told her that it wasn’t ok and that it would be a problem. 
  A few months later she became a full blown heroin addict. Her method of using was IV. One day we got into a fight while her brother was at the house; he was outside in the vehicle with her kids getting ready to leave. She got violent with me and I slapped her. I had just gotten out of the shower and was getting dressed when her brother bust in the door and punched me in the face; he proceeded to beat the shit out of me.
  After they left I realized I needed to go to the hospital. I live out in the country and the only hospital is an hour down the interstate. I got on the interstate and saw them. I was pissed off and pulled up next to them. Her brother and I began arguing while going down the interstate. I passed him and pulled over on the side. He followed me to the side of the interstate. I got out of the car and he pulled off and continued down the interstate.
  I continued to the hospital where I was treated. The sheriffs department came and arrested me. I was charged with reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon five times (felonies) and domestic assault. They called the police and said that I tried to run them off of the road and lied about the encounter at the house. 
  I bailed out for $15K and hired a lawyer. I was indicted. This happened about 2 years ago and I’ve made no progress on the case. I’ve spent about 6K so far on it.
  I lost my job as an EMT because of the pending felony charges. I was drinking one night extremely heavily and (purposely) ran my car into a guard rail on the interstate early in the morning when no one was around. I was uninjured and received a DUI. The car was totaled, which was good because I had no way to pay for it. 
  I was completely done with the relationship, and then she told me she was pregnant. I didn’t believe her at first, until the ultrasound. Three months ago we had a little girl. I couldn’t find a job anywhere, even at Walmart, because of the pending charges. I went to work for my parents doing exterminating. I hate the work and only make about $250 a week. 
  I was convicted of the DUI and the fines, probation, sr-22, lawyer, etc. cost the last of my savings.
  I’m just fucking sad. I work everyday and make very little money and I’m trying to pay everything. I have a little girl and I feel like I’ll never be able to give her anything. My girlfriend is still using drugs, meth mostly. I can’t stop her. I’ve tried helping her. She constantly accuses me of insane stuff and instigates fights; then tries to manipulate me into believing I started it.

453,"I had surgery to correct a congenital deformity 2 years ago. Because it's a rare condition, I had to go out-of-state in order to find a surgeon who'd dealt with this condition before. I have a medical assistance plan, and even though the surgeon was out-of-network, it still paid out tens of thousands of dollars for the surgery (but still less than a PPO would). I had just lost my insurance, so I wasn't familiar with how medical assistance would differ from my PPO. Because of the approval letter I received from my MA plan, I assumed everything would be covered. No one from the hospital informed me otherwise prior to the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost immediately after the surgery, I developed a chronic pain condition due to nerve compression. Seven months post-op, I developed hardware issues that indicated the plates and screws should be removed. Now I also have significant scar tissue limiting my range of motion and have swollen, painful lymph nodes, and bone inflammation. My surgeon has been claiming that he would perform the hardware removal for the past year and a half, but his administrative assistant refused to submit for prior-authorization because she claimed the initial surgery was denied by my insurance (it wasn't, I still have the approval letter and explanation of benefits). 

&amp;#x200B;

I started consulting elsewhere last September, but most surgeons were uncomfortable dealing with another surgeon's work. I finally found a surgeon with the right experience who was willing to take on a difficult surgery (four months ago). However, he's acquainted with the original surgeon, so this new surgeon reached out to the original surgeon. The original surgeon again claimed that he wanted to do the surgery and that they'd submit for prior-authorization, so the new surgeon deferred my case to the original surgeon.

&amp;#x200B;

I've contacted the surgeon personally, but there seems to be a disconnect between him and his office staff. I've contacted a patient advocate at their hospital and was told there was nothing the hospital could do for me since they don't accept out-of-state Medicaid. Many of my doctors have told me they believe surgeons are obligated to correct surgical complications, regardless of insurance coverage, but weren't sure if it was a legal requirement. I followed their advice and contacted a lawyer, but was told this wasn't a malpractice case.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, I informed the practice of the new complications and asked about the status of the prior-authorization, but received no response (this is a pattern with this practice). I've always been polite in my correspondence and try to limit my contact so I don't irritate them.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my medical providers agree that the hardware needs to come out and some suspect that I'm having an allergic reaction to the metal. **I either need the original practice to submit for prior-authorization or for the original surgeon to admit to other surgeons that he does not want to perform this surgery.** At this point, I don't know what to do next. I'm tired of dealing with pain that should've been treated a year and a half ago and am depressed by my appearance and feeling of helplessness.

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted about this issue in r/legaladvice but was told that they don't discuss malpractice (but this supposedly isn't malpractice). I also posted in the appropriate medical subreddit and was accused of defaulting on my hospital bill (the commenters believed this was the only reason the surgeon's office would be behaving this way--100% not the case). So hopefully this is the right place to ask for advice.

455,"This is a long one. So, I’ve been with my significant other since August 2014. We’ve been married since November 2016. I’m seven years older than my SO (significant other). When we started dating my SO’s parents told my SO that we needed to break up. It’s been five years since my SO has seen their parents. My SO’s parents did not want us together because of several reasons. The one I’m going to share here is because of religions. I’m Jewish and my SO’s family is very Muslim. I’ve made it clear from day one that I want to move. There’s precious little I hate in this world as much as the city I live in. It’s a big world. It’s been my dream to move away and see what else is out there. Things with my SO and I were fine for a while. A couple years ago I found my SO racked up $5k in credit card debt. I was livid. I had to take out a loan to cover it. My SO lied to me about the actual amount of debt a few times. When I demanded a screen shot I got the truth. A few other times something similar happened. Finally I cut up my SO’s credit cards. It was extreme maybe but I felt I had no choice. Moving forward I had a job offer in a new city. We were going to move. My SO was going to go back to school and use loans to help with expenses. It became apparently later on that this loan would have to be large. I was not sure how soon my SO would find a new job in the new city. I didn’t trust my SO to find a job ahead of time. After some time we decided to not move at this time. I was depressed but hoping that something better would come along. Shortly after this my SO quit their job. My SO didn’t put in two weeks notice or anything. I didn’t find out about this until two weeks after the fact. My SO didn’t like that job at all. I’d offered to help find a new job many times and my SO had been looking for a new job. I was livid and stayed at a hotel that night. I threatened divorce and said we needed counselling and we’d see where we’re at in a year. Moving forward to last weekend I went to switch phone companies. I have next to no reception where I work. My SO got a new job close to mine. My phone was paid off and my SO said I could leave the plan and it wouldn’t cost us anything. I did it. My SO was angry and wanted to switch too. We turned in my SO’s phone and went to get a new phone. The phone company said we only needed to pay $130 since we turned in the phone. I later found out that was a lie. We had to pay out our lease for that phone, $700 total. That’s a lot to pay just because my SO was jealous I’d get better reception. My SO didn’t have a paycheque yet. So I used my hard earned money to pay for it. This week I reminded my SO that I needed to move. I hate living here. My SO can transfer with the new job. My SO reminded me we could always stay here and travel. I explained this has always been my dream and I was not about to give it up. Keep in mind my SO has no ties to our current place we live in. I then realised that if I divorced my SO I’d regret it for maybe a couple years. If we stayed here the rest of our lives I’d regret it until my dying day. After the credit card debt, job situation, and general childlike behaviour my opinion of my SO changed. A year ago I never would’ve considered leaving. I’ve tried talking to my SO about this. It always ends in yelling and bad feelings. That’s why we’re going to a counsellor. I feel like my SO should be supportive of my dreams especially when my SO admitted there’s nothing keep my SO here.

Fast forward a few years and now she’s unemployed but hears a lot about jobs through her last company she was at. She doesn’t really tell me about them. I’m a lot more experienced than her and I guess she doesn’t want to lessen her chances of  getting the job in case I apply for it as well.

She even lied about the last job she heard about and said it was at a place that she knew I didn’t want to work at. It turns out it wasn’t. It was at a great company. So she must have been lying to put me off from applying.

Especially my father who said it's not a great idea to tattoo something ""trendy"" like this. He said in a few years, would I still like this as much as today ? 
I told him yes, because I love the books so much.

My parents are really supportive, even if they don't like the idea they said I should do as I want.

The tattoo I already have is a reproduction of a painting from my favorite artist. At the time they didn't dislike the idea since it's not someting rooted in time, unlike what they think about game of thrones.

And since talking to them about the new tattoo, it made me doubt about all this.
I was thinking on getting it on my arm, but now maybe I will get it on my calf.

I still want this tattoo but talking to my parents about it made me really confused. I know I'm doing the tattoo for myself, but as I said their opinion matters a lot to me.
Should I stick to my first idea ? Move the tattoo to my calf, so it would be less noticeable ? Or should I abandon everything ?",31May2019,1

Then like nothing even happened she tells me she calls me because she needs to give me some keys. 
I, still being in panic mode told her ""are you serious, why the hell do you scare me like that?""  She just said she was ONLY JOKING. FUCKING WOW.

Later that day we have been working together for few hours and I was still fucking upset and told her that her ""joke"" was stupid. She said I have no sense of humor. 
She got really sad/upset that I was so angry and we both had a bad day overall. 

I don't know if I overreacted or not, but we are going to work together tomorrow and I don't know if I should apologize that I was being so angry at her throughout the day or not.

I was already really turned on and got an erection and then I asked her if she could give me a back massage since my back really hurt from football practice and she just said “sure okay” and then I asked her if she could sit on my back while she did it and she agreed. While she was massaging me, I could feel her bare butt cheeks up against my back as she was wearing a thong. Then I turned around and asked her if I could massage her too and she said yes then she took off her T-shirt revealing her perky breasts (she wasn’t wearing a bra) then she laid down and I began massaging her and I made sure to rub my hand up against the sides of her boobs as I was moving my hands up and down her back. suddenly she put her hand on my humongous dick and I blushed. We were on a bed so I pushed her down and started kissing her as she rubbed my six pack that I formed from being on the football team. Soon I put my hand on her clit and started rubbing it super fast. As she moaned I went harder until she said, ""don't stop!"" repeatedly. Soon she had an orgasm. Then she pulled down my shorts and my big hard dick popped up. I said ""suck"" and she did. she started sucking harder and bobbing her head back and forth. I started groaning and then I cummed in her mouth and she swallowed my load. Then she said “fuck me” so I pushed her back and slowly inserted my dick into her pussy. I started going faster and faster. We started groaning very very loudly. Then he cummed inside me. and we just layed there for an hour and cuddled. Is this wrong?

472,"I am currently 17, I just graduated highschool a few weeks ago and in a way conflicted about my sister. She is my half sister and found out about her when I was a freshman and that she was from my dad's first marriage. My family isn't good so during the divorce, I was a baby and she decided to stay with her mom. We flew to meet her a year ago, she said she always wanted to reach out to me but I wasn't allowed to have social media so I snuck it.

  But we exchanged phone numbers to text each other. She always said how she wishes, she could've been there for me, or she told me how she had to pretty much beg my dad for money back when she was struggling. She is 31 right now, months in advance I asked her if she could come to my graduation, if she'll be able to make it. She said she would, then last minute ditched, she said she has work, when the week earlier she goes to a different state to be with her bf, who dumps her and leaves her stranded then she had to fly back to her home.

   So lately whenever she tries to reach out, and text me I've been cold or I dont respond. She could've visited before, she could've been there before, if she knew what I had to go through by myself I just dont understand why she couldn't help. So am I really in the wrong to be mad at her or not wanting to talk to her.",31May2019,1

I look at my friends and they're now all going off travelling or are starting postgraduate degrees and some have even landed jobs making six figures straight out of university. It feels like they've all forgotten me- some of them didn't even wish me a happy birthday. I just sit at home doing nothing but applying for jobs every day. I've been looking for a serious job for the past two years and have had several interviews but never got the position. Most places tell me I don't have enough experience. I live in a rural area so it's difficult to find any good local jobs that I'm qualified for. I recently failed my driving test, too. It feels like everything is going wrong. I booked a small holiday to get away from it all and my mother hid my passport because she couldn't bear the thought of me travelling alone; not that it would have mattered in the end, since my flights were cancelled when the airline went bust. I told my best friend of 8 years that I'd been feeling down and was laughed at. I've tried going out and meeting new people, making new friends, but find it so overwhelming and tend to just... 'blank out' when I start talking to someone. I've been trying to fight these feelings of sadness for years and these last couple of months it's all come rushing in. The only thoughts that make me happy are of perhaps returning to university to continue going what I love, which I definitely do not have the money for and would probably only put off these feelings for another year or two, or to just run away and go travelling which, again, I don't have the money for.

475,"Backstory:

Since she was in middleschool, my sister has been bullied / excluded non stop.   
It went so far that when she was going to 7th grade, she and my parents decided to put her in a school further away from our hometown, so that she could have a new start.  
Everything went great for a couple of months but here classmates started excluding / bullying her again.  
My sister has a bonedecease which is why she has had surgery over 10 times . Unfortunately, the kids in her class often didn't believe that she actually had pain when she for exemple had to walk with crutches...  
Last year, she had a [Ilizarov apparatus](https://i.imgur.com/nmI7Xsm.jpg) (a very serious surgical procedure to fix her leg from growing crooked, not her leg in the pic), because of which she ended up in a wheelchair for 5 months.   
The bullies in her class went so far as to not wanting to join her in the elevator or even get her lunch in the cafeteria eventhough she couldn't get there in her weelchair. 

At the moment, she is starting to make some friends again from her hobbies; but she still has nobody at school who is nice to her. It breaks my heart to see her being so unhappy and going through panic attacks, because to some extend, I feel like i'm powerless...   
I honestly feel like some day, she will feel like she's had enough and will try to do something to herself. She's just not living to life a normal teenager should be living, like going out for a drink or doing sleepovers. Social media is not helping her either, because she sees what most kids her age are doing with their friends. 

She has been acting out against me and my mom lately. She is so vulnerable that she even takes light sarcasm as a personal attack... I try to tell her that she shouldn't take such light things to hard, since the real world is often much meaner than I am (+ I'm honestly tired of walking on eggshells). She's just very irrational in the way she thinks. My parents often just let it happen, because they want to avoid another conflict and don't want to hurt her even further. 

My parents have been trying to help her as much as they can. She goes to a psychiatrist and is taking anti depressants, which don't seem to help.

She would insult me when no one else was around and when confronted denied it all and said if it did happen she must have been drunk/high. 

Now that we’re having a baby my boyfriend’s brother is reaching out and wants us to all meet up to discuss how we feel. I’m willing to have a relationship with his brother but I truly do not want to be around his girlfriend because she makes me really uncomfortable. It was really humiliating having to admit that someone was putting you down for a long time. I just stayed quiet about it because I was so hurt, embarrassed, and ashamed of myself. 

Side note: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and let myself go for a while. I knew I didn’t look the greatest but I was on a lot of different medications trying to get my life together. It was a sad dark period of my life. 

I just want to know what I should do. This is really straining my boyfriend and my relationship because I don’t want to be around his brothers girlfriend. I don’t know what to do or how to come to a middle ground. I certainly don’t want to have to let someone who made me feel so terrible be around my baby.

If we were going to some special event, she'd always say, ""But if we're going we have to look hot, let me help you with your hair and makeup."" On numerous occassions she said she'll help with my makeup or asked other girls to do it. The way I apply makeup is good. 

Also we both work as glamor party waitresses (kinda like private hooters girls) and when I got fired for not being punctual to work and things, she told me she thinks the real reason I got fired is because my hair and makeup isn't good enough and I look too innocent. She said she always shows up to work looking hot and that's why she never gets fired. I told her not to be rude and she said she's just being honest, not rude.

482,"I’ve worked as a preschool teacher for 8 months. The first 2-4 months were amazing, I enjoyed the job I did. I enjoyed the structure, the 2 hour breaks, the kids were (for the most part) great. 

About 5 months in my boss kept giving me the run around about getting a raise, every time I asked for my review she said she would get to it. Never did so I stopped asking. 

I’m also required to pay for my own trainings including CPR, fingerprints, and my trainings are never paid and often at facilities that are a drive away. 

With my current schedule, I spend no time with my children. I am at work from 9am until 6:30pm, leaving me about 2 hours at home with my kids every night, and they are with their father Thursday’s-Saturday’s. 

All of this, has led to my final decision to quit. While I do enjoy being here most days, the kids can be hard to deal with, I am severely underpaid, and I don’t have time to spend with my own children. 

My boss is very frantic, high strung and anxiety ridden. She’s always showing a sense of urgency and she’s very kind. I plan on writing a letter of resignation and need some advice. 

I want to thank you for the opportunities she’s given me and how kind she’s been. However, I am extremely nervous how she is going to handle it and I’d prefer if it stay private from my co workers if possible. How should I go about doing this? I am so nervous.

491,"  

I'll be clear up front -- I am not complaining in the slightest! I realize I'm lucky and in a great situation. I'm just conflicted over which side of the grass would be greener and want to hear advice, opinions, or from people with similar experiences. I have the feeling that I'm too conflicted over this, but most people would see it as a no-brainer.

My current job has amazing benefits. It's great pay, good 401k match, unlimited vacation. We get to wear jeans and t-shirts to work, and I have a fantastic floor-to-ceiling window desk that looks over a tree-lined courtyard. Work is a mere 15-20 minutes away on easy one-lane streets, and it's right around the corner from a great place I take my dog most days. We get to work from home when we need to.

The downside is that my boss is very disengaged and there is zero demand on me for anything 95% of the time. The actual work makes it the most unsatisfying position I've ever had. There literally is no work most days and the company is too dysfunctional to really put me and my team to useful tasks. My typical day consists of me actually being at my desk for maybe 4 hours a day, and not even doing anything during those 4 hours. I've been coming in at 8:30, taking a full lunch, and leaving right at 4:00. I do almost anything I want during work -- shop online, write, read, etc. I know this sounds amazing, and it really can be if I'm in the right mood, but overall, I'm someone who really does my best when I'm kept productive with meaningful work. A few free days here and there are great at any job, but more than two solid years of mind-numbing boredom every day has left me very aware of how much I’m wasting my skills and life just sitting here.

Over a year ago, I interviewed at a nearby company and was offered the job. However, I ended up turning it down because my lifestyle at this current job was just too good. The other company didn't seem to have quite the flexibility with hours, etc. and it was business casual dress (which I know sounds negligible, but I'd legitimately have to get a new wardrobe at this point). The pay was the same, but the 401k and vacation policy weren't as good.

Flash forward to this week -- the person who would have been my boss at the other company reached out to me and said the position was open again and that he'd like to get me in there. I responded, saying that I was flattered, but that the lifestyle at my current company is just too good and I'd only consider freelancing/remote type opportunities in the future. He responded back with a substantial email with points about their flexibility (still not great, but better than I could have at other companies, I'm sure) and a few other selling points about the company, and reiterated that he thought I would be a great fit.

Overall, his persistence gives me the sense that I'd be wanted and needed there, and I'm certain I'd have a good stream of meaningful work. (I know there's no absolute guarantee that I would go work for that company and even like the job, but I did have to go through a practical test for the interview, and it was honestly the most interesting work I've done in the past three years.) It would be nice to be needed and to be productive, and it feels difficult to say no to someone who legitimately appreciated my work and remembered me over a year later. However, I'd be giving up a lot as far as the freedom and perks that I have here. 

Mostly I'm conflicted between being fat and happy, but brain-dead and useless, or having less freedom and fewer benefits, but better job satisfaction. What would you do?",31May2019,1

I’m 27 with a 2 year old. I’ve been with her dad for 3.5 years. Obviously we got pregnant early on and there was no question in my mind I would keep her. We’ve been together but recently have talked about co parenting or if we are better apart. I haven’t been happy in our relationship for a while and I know he isn’t happy now either. I’m not going to make any excuses bc there aren’t any. I was unhappy and started hanging out with an old good friend. 

Flash forward to now...I’ve known for a week that I’m pregnant by a good friend (we’re both 27 and have been friends since we were 20) We were best friends in college then got together but it ended then we grew apart for a few years. Recently we’ve been hanging out and started sleeping together again. He is a great guy. I’ve told him and he’s supportive but ultimately wants an abortion. I don’t blame him. We live 2.5 hours apart and aren’t together.  Yes. We were using birth control but it failed. I’m 100% sure it’s his child. 

I’ve been trying to decide if I can get an abortion. I know I have to tell my current partner no matter what I do. If we are able to work through or previous issues I know I can’t keep this from him and I know it’s not fair to. I want to make a decision before I tell anyone else though. Since I already have a daughter I feel like I’m struggling with this decision more than him. I don’t know if I can physically or emotionally go through with it. I also don’t want to ruin his life by having this child. I have no idea what to do. I never thought I would be in a position where I was even thinking about an abortion.

I basically had an emotional meltdown and took the semester off from school, blaming it all on the stress of the reporting the relationship as well as another sexual assault that had happened to me which in my mind I blamed on the coach for sexualizing me which then led me to be in an unsafe situation. My dad works for a law firm and one of his friends said he would help us out with the case. I had no intentions on suing the coach, I just thought I needed to tell the police. Well the statute of limitations was up and now we are suing the school and the coach for a lot of money and I feel extremely guilty. My lawyer and family say it’s the only way to make him pay for what he did. I feel like I started talking about the relationship and instead talking about it to my therapist and I went straight to the police. Now I’m not sure if it was bad at all and I don’t know if I deserve the money. While he was my coach he would make sexual comments about me, constantly touch me all over me when we had alone time together, and we made out a couple of times. I had never done anything sexual with another guy before and he knew this. He told me it was okay to not have sex but I had to play along with what he said and talk sexually to him. I was totally in love with him and the relationship went on for a few more years and became pretty emotionally abusive. He wouldn’t talk to me if I didn’t send him naked pictures and he called me a slut for hooking up with other guys even though he wouldn’t date me. He would pressure me into giving him blow jobs and getting naked before I was ready to but I did it because he would threaten to end the relationship because I wasn’t mature enough for him. He definitely is a jerk, I just don’t know anymore if he was a criminal. He was actually nice to me during high school, the relationship didn’t get mean until I was in college and by then I was of age. I’m worried I’m ruining someone’s life who doesn’t deserve it. Do you think this man deserves to be sued? Was it actually abuse just because he was my coach or was it not that bad?",31May2019,2

500,"Little background:
He's a buddy of mine who I actually greatly enjoy speaking with usually, and he has offered much fantastic advice in my life. I went to his wedding, known his wife for ~15 years and him for ~12, we go on vacations together sometimes, and we have some game nights here and there. I see him maybe 6 times a year.

Now I'm not an overly masculine man, but I'm definitely not feminine. I'm pretty open about expressing my thoughts and feeling and I don't really have any hangups about having feelings. This is probably where I'm most ""feminine"" in that I'm capable of feeling joy and sadness and this is what he seems to take offense to. For example, when commenting on how ""I love boxers! They're so damn adorable and they wag their whole butt!"" he replied, ""you're such a faggot. you're so gay dude.""

I've never addressed his comments, but there's now a history of the last three times we've spoken, he makes a note to call me some homophobic slur in an otherwise normal conversation. My wife tells me to ignore this because he's a good guy and we believe he means well, but this is starting to grate on me.

So a few questions that maybe I could get some advice on:
Should I talk to him about this? It seems like it could be a minor issue for someone who really means well, but it also feels like he may have issues dealing with his own emotions so he's lashing out at me.

Is it wrong to express yourself as a straight man? Or is there an acceptable way for straight men to express themselves?",31May2019,1

505,"This is pretty difficult to write because I’m still pretty shaken up over the whole thing. To make a long story short, my friend had a physically, verbally and emotionally abusive ex boyfriend somewhat recently. She is still coming to terms with what he’s done to her in the past. She came to my work yesterday on my lunch break expressing to me that she was suicidal and lonely. I tried to be there for her and help her look into different treatment options. 

Unfortunately her ex owes her over $6000 in back rent that he never paid her while they were living together and she’s not been able to climb out of the financial hole he has left her in. She got her car impounded yesterday and it just set her off. So being out of work isn’t an option for her right now, meaning she can’t get the treatment she needs without finding herself homeless upon return. 

I offered to try and find outpatient therapy for her, but she seemed so upset about everything. Around 6PM she texted me saying she had called the emergency line on her insurance card and pressed the option to say she was thinking about harming herself. Her next text to me was “I’m not sure if the cops got called on me or what”. 

Radio silence for about 3 hours, and I was losing my mind trying to figure out what to do. She then texted me telling me she got 51/50’d and that she’s being held in handcuffs in a cell while they wait for a psych to evaluate her and get a doctor to stitch her up because she had in fact hurt herself badly. 

I’ve never dealt with this kind of situation before and I want desperately to be there for her when she gets out, but I don’t know what I should do, because I work most days and don’t have that much time off. How can I be there for her to help get her through this?",31May2019,2
506,"Do you realize what hell of a time we do live in? Okay this is gonna be long so prepare your popcorn.

I'm 19 years of age now and I think I hit my existential wall at 15 or 16. Not once or twice I thought of suicide, but, to be happy, I went through this shit successfully. The more I think over it the more I see that it was necessary tho, in order to achieve the same view over the world, that you are mentioning, the same purpose as you, namely ""I want to help."" 
The previous two generations (after the WW2) have made quite impressive achievements in the area of politics, economics, science, art, music architecture etc. But they have also achieved some great downfalls. Our planet is dying. No, actually it is being killed. By greed mainly. And this is all done by the previous generations. I'm not saying that they're bad, Not at all, but somehow they have happened to let the greedy and the unscrupulous be in charge of the money and the actions that have been taken. That are being taken. We are barely in our second decade, but it's time for us to take action. 

The more you think, the more you'll see what potential actually we have. Think about all the fruits and vegetables. In the 15th century the corn was as big as a teaspoon and with similar edibility. The melons were as big as apples and tased like shit. The tomatoes - not bigger that hazelnuts. We have tamed them. We have actually achieved something. And I believe that if we go to completely unfriendly environment we will succeed to tame it as well, to make it enjoyable.

And now we have so many great things to achieve and we still are uninspired? Not mindlessly enthusiastic? I personally don't know if there is a bigger plan behind everything (faith, God, god, whatever you will), but I very much want to believe that there is. Because if it is so, then this mass depression, this mass anxiety and mass existential crisis that happen to exist in our reality are given to us for a reason.
 I want to state here that I'm not a religious person and I try to keep an open mind as much as I can and as much as the biases that I've been raised with let me, but it seems very logical to me that in order to oppose the crimes against nature that the previous generations has committed, the nature itself is putting us through this great suffering, this struggle for meaning, in order to make us aware of the pain that we may create with our decisions. To make us so understanding that we never leave the planet to oblivion. That's why I like religion, particularly Christianity so much. It's a moral compass. It will stop you from signing this deal for 100 milion dollars, burning one milion tons of unfiltered charcoal, it would stop you from killing Nicola Tesla because his ideas of free energy will ruin our oil empires.
So always keep your moral compass I would say. 

Now when we're not afraid that we will obliviate the planet let's move to the interesting stuff.

We live in extraordinary conditions. We have global network, that we can communicate through, we have lots of power and advancement. Don't forget that we set foot on the moon with technology less advanced that the smartphone that you're reading this bunch of nonsense from. If someone stumbles across something, he can instantly share it and not be killed for the threat that he poses to the oligarchs of the world.

So aim high my friends. Dream high and aim high. Shoot for the stars. Lets do this goddamn colony on mars, lets clear the oceans, let's save the planet. Let's make art, music, movies, let us blossom. Aim high and don't rest easy untill you all have done something of significance. Don't be afraid to be the next Elon Musk, don't be afraid to be the next Freddie Mercury or the next John Lennon. Don't stop searching for a way to cure cancer. Do whatever you do, but do it.
Besides, do you want to be remembered as the generation who gave up? The generation who didn't do anything significant? The dark ages of the new era? The generation who didn't do anything to stop the death of earth? Or worse? The first of the last generations. Or the last generation itself? Cause really earth is all we have. Or do you want songs to be sung for our feats, and poems to be written?
Doesn't matter if there is or there isn't God. Doesn't matter if there's bigger meaning than us. 
Do whatever you like, and never compromise and always keep pushing for more, because extraordinary times are coming ""and the new day will dawn, for those who stay long, and the forests will echo in laughter"". Let's make a better world for those who'll come after us. Whomever they might be.

And as a meme master would say ""Oh yeah spread it."" Spread this message, so that it reaches every human out there, every lonly soul. Because you never know whose life it may save, or whom it may give reason to.

Peace, and ""take it to the sky!"".",31May2019,6

I kept hooking up with one because I felt like damaged goods for years. He would not want to talk to me unless it were about sex he would ignore and leave after sex.

514,"Thanks for reading about my problems...So since April of 2016, I was attending a private school, pursuing a BS in audio engineering. The program is only 3 years long and I was about 3 months from graduating until the school abruptly closed due to losing funding from the dept of education. This was back in March of 2019. Not only are my credits worth nothing now, but I'm a veteran with a GI Bill and the VA only gave me back 6 months of it back (That will make sense if you're a vet). Anyways, now after 3 years, I have no degree, no GI Bill, and the main point of this post...I absolutely have no interest in the job field. I'm also an intern at a recording studio, which has only opened my eyes and shown me that although this field is cool, it's simply not where I belong. Everything I do is forced, going through the motions. My main dilemma- After wasting 3 years of my life at a school that literally just closed and left me hanging, I don't want to go back to school. I'm tired. I just want to enjoy my life with my wife. So, I have no degree and no desire to use what I've learned in school. I simply just don't enjoy it anymore.  I want to choose a different career path but I feel like I'm truly just not good at anything. I don't mean to self loathe, but thats how I truly feel. I have no REAL skills that a good employer looks for and my level of intelligence is just average. I'm terrible at retaining information, and not good at having conversations with people I don't know, which also makes me bad at first impressions. I'm stuck at a dead end job and I literally dream about going to work and loving what I do...sometimes I feel like that's just not gonna happen. I know I'm not lazy and I'm certainly not stupid...just a little sad and a little lost. I don't know where to go from here. (28, M)

515,"So, I kinda just joined Reddit this morning because why not? This is my first post! I was kinda inert to the idea of Reddit, and for this I need advice.  So buckle up, I really need help... And it's not my fault!

I am really quiet which is related to this story and I got into a fight which is also relevant.

So, it starts in grade 8, we were about to move into grade 9 before the summer, for a taster before we actually moved into grade 9. I live in Scotland, so I'm using the American term instead of S1, S2 and S3 as such.

So, my class originally was let's call it 1D

So I was in 1D, I had a group of good friends many of them being from different primary schools, or Middle school (I think that's before High school in America? Correct me if I'm wrong!) in different terms. Because we were still getting used to this High school environment, we didn't have our actual group of friends yet, still experimenting, though some people just stayed in the same group as they originally from in primary school. I had this one friend from my primary school in my ""group"" - or rather - best friend, at the time...

Let's call him RM.

RM was my best friend, we supported each brother throughout the majority of primary school. P3 through P7.

Now, he was heavily influenced, like a sheep. He followed everyone around unsuspectingly. But, y'know, it was blue SCOTLAND, and all the teens here are as depressed as trash, it is unfortunate. You either have a good wealth and are living a good life, or you are suffering from fear from the damp, uneventful terrain. RM was influenced by the ones with no dignity or will.

RM changed over time, he became more aggravated and just more angry in general, I didn't like this.

He wasn't my friend nor my pal anymore, now I was his punching bag, although not literally. He kept making fun of me in front of everyone for weeks and that was all it took for me to defend myself because I do not get heavily offended by anything, but when it comes to these heights, I will fight back.

RM didn't like this obviously and he knew my weak point, my family. It is my private subject and that only, not to be shouted in front of the whole class, he shouted out stating that my brother was... well, I will not say it but it was shocking, it was about my brother's autism, yes he's in the spectrum, but my brother didn't have Asperger s or anything, but he was on the other side of the spectrum, meaning that he had no anger issues nor any social problems, but literally any other emotion, like jealousy or kindness.

He can be too kind, like if someone asked if they could stab him or give them too much money, he would do it, and he has NO jealousy! He doesn't care about what other people think, he just cares about himself which is good, unless it is a factor like money or what other people want. Yes, it makes no sense!!

So, on the contrary of the fight, you don't want to get into a fight with me. I beat him up, no bruises, but yelling.

This is Scotland so everyone does it! lol!

RM literally gave up, and ran away, this was in the fitness suite, so I could not partake in anymore activities that day, I got sent home along with RM.

 

Now, I am forced to move class. That was the downside, but the bright side was no one would mess with me! I went through RM!

I move class to the class that I am still in today, the class that I met 'Her', who we will call EL.

EL was in 1O when I moved, now of course so was I.

She was kind and exactly my type! Long, wavy black hair with glasses, that was her! She liked ginger hair, which I had, So I was certain she liked me too, which she did.

We grew to like each other, and then, in grade 10, which is where I am just now, I ask her out.

She says NO

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

She was in a secret relationship with RM... FOR 7 MONTHS!

&amp;#x200B;

I need help, what should I do? I hate RM!

518,"Bit of a trivial issue here, but I'd appreciate an outsider's advice. 
So my dad has pretty much always smoked weed, but only really started being open about it once I got older. I have absolutely no problem with this whatsoever, it's just the frequency of it that I find kind of.....annoying, for lack of a better word. 

For the most part, I mainly see him on weekends. These are obviously the times he smokes the most, and as time goes on I'm finding it harder and harder to have a proper conversation with him. When he's high he's loud, talks over everyone, nags me about things and is generally kind of hard to talk to (when I'm sober, that is). I've always just kind of accepted this, but it feels like I'm intentionally avoiding conversations and spending time with him now because I find it frustrating, and most of the time when I'm at home and have time to talk, he's smoking.

I have a really important art exhibition coming up that I worked really really hard on, and he keeps talking about how he's excited to come so that he can get stoned with his best friend beforehand. I was kind of disappointed when he said this, because it's a really important night for me and I kind of just want him to be a normal, sober, supportive dad for me? I know he's just being supportive in his own way, but everytime I mention that I would rather he wasn't stoned for the night he gets really offended and insinuates that I find him annoying and a bad dad. He's not a bad dad. He's a really good dad actually, and apart from this issue I couldn't say a single bad thing about our relationship. 

I just don't know how to express this problem to him without him feeling like I'm personally attacking him? I've started kind of just avoiding conversations with him now when he's high, but he's noticed and won't stop nagging me, asking if I think he's annoying and weird. Aaah help",31May2019,1
519,"Hey r/advice,

     My girlfriend’s grandmother just passed away and there are some issues arising with her will.  Specifically, some questions are arising about two of the houses on the trust and the equity tied up in them.

    Somewhat confusing so bear with me as I try and explain the details:  the grandmother gifted two houses in her will. One to her son, whose name is Tom and one to her daughter (my girlfriend’s mom) whose name is Jean.  

    The issue is that Jean was willed a house that Tom originally owned.  Conversely, Tom was willed a house that Jean originally owned.  The grandmother was able to do this because she had substantial equity in both the houses (she provided the down-payment and then some).  However, the house that was willed to Tom was completely payed off by Jean while the house that was willed to Gene was not completely payed off by Tom. 

    The question is where does all of Jean’s equity go that is tied up in the house being gifted to Tom? Same for Tom; where does his equity go that is tied up in the house being gifted to Jean?  Will Tom receive the house (Jean’s old house) and all its equity? Will Jean be gifted the house (Tom’s old house) only to start making mortgage payments even though she already payed off the other house (being gifted to Tom)?

523,"I work as a freelancer on-site for a client whom in this case I'm going to call my ""boss"" just because honestly, it's closer to the relationship we have. I do design work on site mostly because it's easier for all of us to communicate if I'm actually there. However, ""my boss"" asks me **at least three times a day** to help him with tech support stuff. Things like:

* He received an error in a program we use and needs help
* He doesn't know how to do something in a program 
* He doesn't understand what cables he needs (ex: USB vs Lightning cables)
* He can't figure out how to set up new hardware like printers or a new router
* He can't figure out how drop box works or needs a link he could easily generate himself
* He runs into computer issues that are usually solved by restarting the computer or reinstalling the program

I'm honestly sick of it. I'm technically a freelance designer, not tech support or a computer program instructor. He pays me for the time—albeit probably not as much as a tech support person would get—but it's not about that.

524,"My sister is being delusional and I don’t know how to react. It’s a long story, but I’d appreciate any advice y’all could give. About five years ago, my sister (I’ll call her J) got a job after graduating high school and moved into an apartment with my other sister (I’ll call her M). After living there for several months, my other sister M discovered that J had been sneaking around with a guy and was lying to her about it. It turned out that this guy was nearly twice her age, divorced, and had kids. 

M got mad that J was being deceitful and my parents got mad that she was sneaking around with someone they told her to stay away from, and things were said and done that led to her moving into his apartment. I don’t know how it escalated that fast because I wasn’t there and my family doesn’t tell me anything. For the next several months, we didn’t really hear from her, and she turned into a completely different person after being with him.

Over time, we realized that we had to suck it up if we were going to have a relationship with J, and we started inviting them over and spent time with them occasionally. For the next few years, they would come over (with their dogs and kids, who are monsters btw) and play games or barbecue with us, and we had an ok, superficial relationship with her.

As I mentioned before, she turned into a different person. She became secretive about everything. Out of nowhere, she said she never wanted kids, even though she always talked about how she wanted kids (he had a vasectomy btw). She started working out all the time and died her hair and cut it just like his ex wife. It’s like she became something for him to use. He got a pretty young girl to sleep with, do chores, take care of his kids, and tend to anything he needed. I know that you can’t control other people’s actions, you can only control your reaction, so my family realized that she was going to do what she wanted to do, and there was no rationalizing with her.

We were hoping that we just overreacted and maybe he was actually a nice guy that wasn’t taking advantage of her. After being around him a while, we noticed that he was weirdly controlling and he would even slap her butt in front of us. Who does that in front of their girlfriend’s parents! To me, this reinforced my belief that this lonely, middle-aged man just wanted a piece of meat.

This weird, superficial relationship with J went on until about two months ago when J showed up out of nowhere crying. It turns out that he threw her out and said he didn’t want to be with her and he said he knew it would never work out. We were happy that she was finally free from this guy, so we were all ready to help her move out her stuff and move her back home.

Over the next couple of weeks, and after spending a lot of money and taking personal days off from work, J was moved into a travel trailer outside our house, and things were looking up. She seemed happy and a little more like her old self. Then a bomb dropped that we thought would be the final nail in the coffin. He told her he had cheated on her with her best friend. Though it was terrible that she had to go through that kind of betrayal, we were happy that it meant she would be over him.

Well, this didn’t last long, and last week M found out J was texting her ex and was lying about where she was and was sneaking around with him again. Now she’s apparently back with him and is going to spend the next few days with him.

I have as much respect for her as she obviously has for herself. She’s put my family through hell the past few years worrying about her, and now she does this! She said he is blaming her and her best friend for his cheating, so apparently he didn’t even apologize. Now she’s turning us into the villains by saying she didn’t want to move out so quickly and we made her leave him. I am dumbfounded by how the smart, beautiful girl I grew up with turned into this stranger. I don’t know what to do and neither does my family. We tried to be understanding and were trying to accept the situation, but does she really think we’re going to accept him now? I’m so mad and irritated by her lack of self respect, I just want to scream, “What the hell is wrong with you!” We tried being firm the first time, which made her move out, but there’s no way we can just accept this. I have no idea what she sees in him. He’s not attractive, rich, or charismatic, which would at least explain her delusion a little bit. Ugh, I don’t know what to do and I don’t see how we recover from this 😞

TLDR; Right out of high school, sister moved in with middle aged divorcée with kids and alienated family. He cheated on her and kicked her out. We spent a lot of time and money moving her back home, and now he’s manipulated her into going back to him.",31May2019,1

530,"I realized lately that I believe I am addicted to social media. I scroll mindlessly all the time, and I get nothing out of it. It's really affecting my school performance and my mental health, because it's so difficult for me to put my phone down and focus on what needs to be done. 

I can't delete my social media, because a) I have far too many close friends and family on varied platforms that I have no other way of keeping in contact with, and b) I am a small internet personality/business and the way I keep interest in myself and my business is to interact with my followers and post often. 

This makes it very difficult to disconnect myself from social media, because I want to present myself as someone who who is active and responsive to my followers. 

So my question is, how do I overcome this addiction without compromising my business? Is there a way to ""disconnect"" my mind from social media without letting it affect my public social media and my business?",31May2019,1

533,"I am getting married this summer, and would like to include my childhood friend (let's call her Luna) in the wedding. Luna died 8 years ago, but I can't imagine getting married without her. I'm looking for advice as to whether or not I should reach out to her family, and any ideas for including lost friends in a wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: Luna took her own life at 16, and the world hasn't been the same since. I was broken beyond any ability to function for some time after. Our friends didn't understand the way my grief came out. I fear that now they will misunderstand my wishes to include her in my wedding. I want to include her because she made me who I am. My personal values, my spiritual beliefs, even the way I pronounce certain words, comes from the time we spent together. She was the sister I never had. She was my best friend, although I doubt I was hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was never close with her family, I was always too shy to talk to them. But I spent time at their house, so they knew me. I've wanted to reach out to them many times since her death, but have never been able to find the courage. I worry they don't even remember me anymore. I'd like to invite them to the wedding, or at least her parents. But even if they do remember me, would they want to come? Or would it just be a cruel reminder that their child will never grow up to be a happy young woman like her friends?

&amp;#x200B;

At other weddings I have seen a little table set up with pictures of loved ones who have passed. But I don't have any good pictures of her, and I feel it would be insensitive to ask her family for pictures. They might think I'm just seeking attention and pity by reminding everyone of ""my loss"" when it was they who lost the most. I also thought about reserving a chair at the head table for her, but I worry someone will put their feet or their purse on it. Is there anything I can do to make her a part of my wedding day, or should I just hold her in my heart?",31May2019,1

In that moment an idea popped in my head that I needed to choose between her and them. I choose them as you would have guessed. Yes I cried over it A lot but after that I was ""fine"" after that. Apart from think about her every day. Recently I was walking to class when she asked what room we were in. I answered and we both continued in silent. I couldn't breathe. I didn't have anything like this near her before I thought it was just a problem I had at that moment but it happen again the next day. Now I want her back so badly but to afraid to do so.

537,The past year he has became the worst. Idk how long it can continue. It makes me feel sad that I would feel happy if he died. I honestly don't want to hate him but he is so unlikeable. I try talking to him normally and relaxed. I try ignoring him. I try yelling at him. Nothing is working. I lost count of how many times he made something into a huge deal. He can make a argument about literally everything. he acts like a retarded clown then all of the sudden gets mad and pissed off about everything. He is always never relaxed and his mind had a hard time keeping up with things. He changes his mind fast and always think everyone is againts him. He has hit my mom a couple times. I always go by them when they are screaming so I can get him away if he gets physical. Recently it was my sister's middle school 8th grade graduation. She wore makeup and a dress. And he was fine with it. He is a truck driver and drives 5 days and is home 2 days. Btw the weekends are horrible since he is home. He shared those pictures with my grandma ( his mom ) and she said that she gained weight and should not be wearing makeup and heels at that age. That got in his mind and he called my mom and grandma here and told it's their Fualt she is wearing makeup and wants to look older. Btw my sister reallly isent bad. She isent a hoe like it is sounding like. She is just a avrage 8th grader going into highschool. He said when he comes home he will cut my mom and grandmas throat and kill them. Obviously he wasn't serious. But no normal person would say that multiple times. Not the first time he said shit like that.  So he always calls and asks stupid questions. Asks me where I am in the house what I'm doing. Calls my mom and somehow manages to make a argument out of nothing.  It's almost like he has every mental illness in the world. My uncle (his brother) has sxchofrenia I think I spelled that wrong but yeah he is in a mental hospital. And im thinking the same type of thing got to him. He tells everyone else they are mentally ill when it's very clearly him who is the problem. Idk what to do I have my own personal problems with school and my grades. He is doing nothing but making life worse. I don't wanna give up on him and always ignore him but he is just becoming worse and there is nothing I can do.,31May2019,1

540,"Hello,

I just purchased a house, yippee, now I'm broke but at least I have a house. I'm curious on how much to charge my roommate for rent. The mortgage is $2075 and with utilities it will be upwards of $2500 per month in total. We lived together previously in an apartment and we both split the cost which ended up between $750-$800 per month. But that apartment was closer to his work by about 10-15 minutes of driving. But the house is much nicer with more space and he really can't wait to help remodel the place to get experience for his future house he buys someday. He's also much handier than I am, but I will be helping every step of the way and paying for all the materials and tools. Also last but definitely a good thing to mention, my GF will be living there as well and she will not be contributing much to rent because she's not making much right now. But they both get along great.

With all that being said, what should I charge per month? And when he helps me remodel, how much should I pay him per hour?

I was thinking $850 flat for rent and I'll pay him $5-8 per hour up to 500 dollars per month. Is that fair? Or am I being a scrooge? Also keep in mind I'm not made of money.",31May2019,1

545,"I apologize for this long post

We are foster parents who’ve had 10 placements. Our very first set was for an infant who was in the hospital for months withdrawing and her older sister. The mom was no where to be found for months. Once she came around the first thing she did was call cps over a tiny bruise on the toddler. Investigation was of course false. She then hired an attorney who somehow convinced a judge because she had a negative drug test the kids should go in In Home dependency. There was an ftdm meeting held where the person conducting the meeting gave our names to Mom after we asked her not to. Once mom found out our names she realized her children were living with a gay couple. She spent the next 5 minutes bashing gays and alleging all gays molest children ect. The meeting facilitator told mom she understood her concerns further validating everything she said about  gays. Luckily an investigator in the meeting actually reported the meeting facilitator for not doing her job by cutting Her off and reminding her of the ground rules. 

We did not want them to have our names bc on a previous occasion the children were placed with their grandparents for 8 days. The cps transporter who was supposed to pick the girls up did not come with car seats and convinced me (23 year old new foster mom) it was totally normal and safe to just let the grandfather pick them up at my house. Well 8 days later they were removed from the grandparents for neglect and put back in our home. It wasn’t for another two months when mom finally came around. So now mom has her girls but they’re technically still in state custody. She is posting all over Facebook trying to “expose cps”. There are videos of cps workers in her home, pictures posts ect. Most recently she made a long post about the “abuse” her toddler underwent in our home. One picture she posted is a picture I took in my home of the child’s bruise. She did not say our name in the post. Saying we are evil and will get payback. She made the bruise look awful. It’s literally smaller than a dime and toddlers bump into things daily. Of course the investigation from the bruise turned to nothing. 

My concern is mom posting this on Facebook it’s getting shared. Bc of cps Mom knows our address. We have other foster kids. Who’s to say if the wrong person sees that post Mom gives them our address and they will come after us. What can I do?",31May2019,1
546,"I feel like the pinnacle of wasted potential. I was an amazing student in high school and ended up getting a full ride scholarship to my top choice college to study engineering. I'm currently a junior and for the last 3 years I've done nothing but fail and repeat courses. 

I've attempted 90 credits worth of courses and only passed 60. There are 3 courses that I've had to take three times in order to pass, and I've failed a number of others and taken those twice.

The last three years of my life have been an absolute train wreck. Besides failing so hard at college, I've fallen out of shape and gained a lot of weight. I feel terrible and look terrible too. On the outside I make myself look confident and fine but internally I'm falling apart and am living day to day trying to figure out where it is I'm taking my life.

The part that pains me the most isn't the fact that I've failed because of lack of understanding, it's because of the lack of motivation and misplaced priorities. I'm good at math and science and engineering but I just don't care enough to study and work on assignments and keep up with my responsibilities. None of the material was ever impossibly difficult, I would just lose motivation and stop putting effort into my coursework.

I know that if I actually applied myself and eliminated all the distractions from my life I would be excelling, but I've spoiled every chance at redemption I've been given. 

Since I failed a necessary core course 3 times and can't appeal to take the course again, I've effectively eliminated myself from any and all STEM majors offered by my school. 

If I wanted to major in STEM I would have to start from zero at another school which would mean starting another 4 year degree program except this time without the benefit of a full ride scholarship. I myself can't afford the cost of tuition and can't fund a complete reset so I'm sitting here now clueless on what to do.",31May2019,2

550,"(19 year old Indian Male) When I was in elementary school I never had a problem with racism and because of that I was a very open and friendly kid with a lot of friends. And my first year of middle school was no different but that all changed when I started 7th grade. Before 7th grade I didn’t know what a terrorist was or why some people were calling me that. People would say racist things to me everyday in class saying “allah ul lak bar”, or saying that I’m gonna blow up the school. This started to diminish my confidence and made me afraid that everyone thought of me like that including my friends. By then I became less vocal and started ghosting my old friends because mentally I couldn’t get the thought of them thinking of me as a terrorist out of my head. I began having  a harder time keeping my grades up because I tried to do everything by myself so that I didn’t have to deal with the constant ridicule I got from my classmates. One by one I lost my friends and my drive to go to school was lessening everyday. I never told my mom this until I got in high school because I didn’t want her to stress out about me because of everything she had to put up with from my dad. Fast forward to high school and even though I didn’t hear as much racism as I did in middle schools I was so mentally broken that it still stayed with me and continued to hold me back from my potential in school. I graduated in May of 2018 with decent grades and started working until December when I went to a wedding in India for a month. When we were coming back my aunt and uncle told me find a new job and go to school with them in houston. My second month living in Houston I found a job and have been working there since then. Because of what happened during my schooling I don’t feel like I’m ready to go to a university yet so I decided to go to Lone Star community college and then transfer to a university. But even though it’s a community college I’m still afraid to commit and they think that I’m wasting my time not signing up since I’ve been living with them.

552,"This is to the best of my knowledge, I can't remember the exact details but this is around what happened.

Also, I have never made a post on reddit before. I have an exception today because I have no idea what to do anymore and need help.

I am 16 (M) and had a friendship with 17 (F). She was always very nice and outgoing to everyone she met, she is a little quirky at times but we enjoyed talking to each other. We are in the same Choir each day and walk to the bus that heads down to the colleges since we are running start students. 

We had known each other for about 2 years and I asked her out a year and a half into to the friendship. She rejected me telling me that she saw me as a great friend, and this was the beginning of my oneitis. I later told her again a few months down the road that I still had these feelings and wasn't sure what to do with them, as I knew she didn't share them mutually with me but I didn't want to be dishonest with her. I am an idiot, I did this after her breakup with her boyfriend. I knew deep inside I said this partially because I wanted to have a chance to be more than friends with her but at the same time I wanted to be honest so that it wouldn't ruin our friendship later. 

At this point I suppressed my feelings that I had for her knowing that they would always be unrequited. We stayed friends but from here we started losing our connection, we had a streak over Snapchat which she dropped and we started talking less and less. I would try to strike up a conversation with her but and she would go along with it but she never really seemed too interested in talking to me, as a friend. 

On the bus while the two of us were conversing a stranger (17? M) started talking to us and joined in on the conversation. He was a nice guy but I could clearly see that she was more interested in talking to him. She didn't have any romantic interest AFAIK because she later found out that he was gay that day. Even then, we started talking less and less again and I was at the point where I wasn't sure if she cared or not about talking to me.

After a week went by I found out she had a streak with him and would text him often, at this point I acted rash and out of jealousy. I texted her saying that I didn't want to be friends, and that I didn't really felt care about. Inside my head, I think I was just hurt inside because I wanted to be better friends with her and spoke out in jealousy. We gave each other space. 

We stopped talking to each other completely, and would try to avoid each other as much as possible. Within a few weeks, I learned that what I did deeply hurt her. I told her that I wanted to be friends with her again in person, but she told me she had to think about it. 

Another week or two went by, and today I asked her again if we could be friends and she told me she didn't want to be friends anymore. I wanted to try and make it up with her with flowers but she told me there was nothing I could do anymore and that I really messed up. She also mocked me a little bit, which hurt a lot considering she never said or did something mean to me in our two years of friendship, and was always the nice person who helped others out, and was humble.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have no idea what to do. The one close friend that I always had who stuck by me through hard times I did really stupid things to. She has no feelings of wanting to be friends and wants to never talk to me again. At this moment I still have feelings for her (although suppressed) but don't know what to do in life anymore. 

I really messed up. I don't have any friends to turn to, and I'm just painfully crying to myself. It's really painful. Since she doesn't want to be friends anymore, where can I go from here? I can't even think rationally right now and don't have any support from family or friends. At this point, I don't even know if its possible for me to be happy anymore.",31May2019,1

556,"So I have a guy friend from my high school (we're all 17) who really likes me in a non-romantic way. He always tells me that I am the most valuable person for him and always tries to get my attention, but he's kinda weird as well, like kind of immature and goofy in an annoying way. Im just really sick of him smothering me.

So the problem is, my crush is close friends with this guy, and we usually hang up as a group of 3, since my crush probably has no idea i like him ""that"" way. Sometimes I just want some alone time on discord with my crush but he's always there and calling me to play stuff with them. And when i do go on discord to talk with them, I try to ignore him in the kindest way possible but he just doesn't seem to let go and take the hint.

Not that I hate him, we actually helped each other a lot in the past, but we were pretty distanced from each other back then. Now I'm also in the same class with him and there is no escape, it seems. 

So, how do I stop him from smothering me and ""liking me too much"" if you will, without being a rude b\*tch? I feel like if I distance myself from him, I might get some more alone time with my crush, im kind of desperate for that :/",31May2019,3

So the other day my friends and I all volunteered at a school we used to go to and afterward they all hung out without me. Five of the seven people there I'd like to think I'm good friends with and I've known them for several years. Four of them volunteered with me and even spoke to each other about the hang out they had planned and asked if one of them needed a ride. I heard and asked and the only person who really heard me I guess said that it was nothing. Later I saw on someone's story that it was basically five of my friends plus two others who are friends I haven't known as long were all hanging out without me. I feel like they all left me behind and either didn't even think of me (even though I was standing right there earlier that day when they talked about it) or they were purposefully excluding me. Am I wrong to feel upset over this? I spoke to one of my good friends who wasn't there and they sort of suggested that I speak to them but I shot down the idea. My real reason for not having done so is because I don't have any clue what to say and especially how to say it without sounding like an a\*\*hole. Some people I know already see me as one but I also don't see the justification when it's like I'm trying to invite myself to things, you know?

I've always wanted to lose weight, but every time that I've actually gotten inspired and motivated to change, I've had my hole family against the idea, saying that I don't need to work out or eat healthier, so therefore I've accepted my body and moved on, living the same unhealthy way I've been almost all my life. 

However now I realize that every time a family member has said that change isn't needed, it was only because they thought i was sad. They knew that I should've lost some weight, but thought I was to young to care about such a thing. 

I know that even though my family says there's nothing wrong with my weight, there is. Change is needed.

I know this because since I started high school, I got new friends that told me the truth. That made me realize the things my family said was just to comfort me. 

I recently got motivated to start changing my unhealthy lifestyle, however for some reason it doesn't feel like anything is changing for the better.

574,"Hey r/advice,

     My girlfriend’s grandmother just passed away and there are some issues arising with her will.  Specifically, some questions are arising about two of the houses on the trust and the equity tied up in them.

    Somewhat confusing so bear with me as I try and explain the details:  the grandmother gifted two houses in her will. One to her son, whose name is Tom and one to her daughter (my girlfriend’s mom) whose name is Jean.  

    The issue is that Jean was willed a house that Tom originally owned.  Conversely, Tom was willed a house that Jean originally owned.  The grandmother was able to do this because she had substantial equity in both the houses (she provided the down-payment and then some).  However, the house that was willed to Tom was completely payed off by Jean while the house that was willed to Gene was not completely payed off by Tom. 

    The question is where does all of Jean’s equity go that is tied up in the house being gifted to Tom? Same for Tom; where does his equity go that is tied up in the house being gifted to Jean?  Will Tom receive the house (Jean’s old house) and all its equity? Will Jean be gifted the house (Tom’s old house) only to start making mortgage payments even though she already payed off the other house (being gifted to Tom)?

    Thanks very much for all of your advice.",31May2019,1

577,"A few weeks ago the kids suddenly appeared at our house and made friends with my young daughter (she's 5). They actually came from the street behind our house. They walk all the way down their street, then up our street to get to our house. There's two little girls (one is 4, one is 6) and two boys (7 and 10 maybe? not sure). The boys are really kind of badly behaved and don't listen. The younger boy gets REALLY angry if we tell him the smallest thing like ""please stop doing that"". He gets very mad and mutters under his breath. He honestly kinda scares me when he's around my daughter, as I feel he has uncontrollable anger issues and could possibly hurt her or something if he gets mad at us. My grandma also thinks he may have scratched the side of her car after she yelled at him once. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The girls are angels, though they lack some manners. The first few times they all came over they would walk straight into our house like it was their own until my grandmother yelled at them. She's been having very thin patience with the boys in particular so now when she gets angry at them, she curses at them and tells them to leave, which they'll do for about 5 minutes or until no one's looking. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I don't really mind the girls being over. I let my daughter and them play around the house and check on them often, or sometimes me and my boyfriend go outside and just watch them play while talking or something. My daughter really enjoys having friends to play with since she's an only child. And honestly, it gives me a much needed break sometimes because she used to be super demanding of my attention when she didn't have the girls to play with haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, me and my bf feel really bad for the girls. Their mom hardly checks on them. I've never even met her. My bf said he spoke briefly with her once or twice, and one time it was because the mom couldn't find the 6 year old girl anywhere at like 8-9pm at night. I've noticed the 4 year old is super trusting and sometimes she randomly comes to our house with ice cream or popsicles, which she says she's gotten ""from the man down the street, he's nice"". We live in a town that doesn't have that great of opportunities, so I suspect maybe the mother is either doing drugs, is an abusive mother, or just plain doesn't really care about them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today in particular my bf was home as he's sick. My daughter is home with him because she's out of school. He looked outside before my daughter was even awake and the two girls were in our backyard swinging by themselves. He told them they had to go home but they said ""our mommy said we can't go back home until night time"". Like....... what?!

To avoid you later realizations and in an attempt to eliminate the comments in which you might use to let me know that I am a horrible person.. I already know that and I am actually working on myself with a therapist..

I am a 20F and my boyfriend is 25
My boyfriend is the sweetest person you can imagine, he would marry me now if I accept.. Which is party very bad because I don't feel the same way, at least not as much as him.. He is very attached to me, very..
I am maybe one of the coldest and hard hearted people on earth.. I am sort of detached from my feelings.. I do feel so many stuff but none of them really affect me. I do love him but I don't care about it at the same time... It would hurt my consciousness a lot to break up with him but it'd a piece of cake for me,.. I can get over anything..
So yeha I do get the loving feeling for him but at the same time and a lot of the days I get the meh feelings about him..
I am a bit sexually traumatized to even sexually I can't be with him, and I am preventing him from being sexually with someone else because he thinks that it would hurt me(I tell him to go fuck other people I don't mind it because I trust him)

Bottom line how careless I am and how cold is hurting him in a way and I think will hurt him even more later on.. It is unfair for him to be with me because I am not sure of the person I am because in a way I know that with the therapy going on i surely won't be the same person later on.. So who knows, maybe I'll turn out to a worse person and hurt him, it is not a safe bet for him to be with me at this phase..

However as much as I try to tell him that I am a bad person he doesn't care he wanna take the bet.. So maybe my only chance is to fake being harsh and bad so he distances himself from me for his own good.. And maybe for mine as well because I am not sure if I love him or not.",31May2019,2

I'm trying to think of a solid logical reason to give her, why would be beneficial to be with, not her, but her illness. 

Some thoughts:
-something to do with the fact that you'd have to appreciate each day more. Being with somebody who could die tomorrow would make every kiss sweeter, ever hug harder, and every good moment that much better. 
-the fact that she's strong enough to make it through each day, that she can still function even with her past and present burdens

Any other thoughts would be much appreciated.",31May2019,3
593,"Throwaway account. English isn't that good sorry. 

So this is probably going to sound like me being irrational or being a baby but Reddit is my go to anxiety relief because you all are great people and there's not to many great people in my life. 

So to start out I've always had depression and anxiety, it's bad to the point where it's affecting my health, I already have heart issues because of other reasons but anxiety is just stacking more issues. (I'm going to doctors and stuff). 

So my girlfriend is going away on a trip and I won't see her for a week and a half but it feels like forever. Even when I can't see her for a day or two it kills me like I haven't seen her in a while. I sometimes get thoughts like what if she doesn't actually like me and what if I'm being too annoying etc etc. 

One part of my brain knows that she does like me, she reminds me every day how lucky I am to have her, we do our normal couple stuff. But the other part of my brain just keeps getting me down over the smallest things like what if I'm trying too hard? Or not trying hard enough? 

I'm just tired of feeling like this. I need some help to stop and just enjoy my life without worrying about the smallest things. Am I being irrational? 

Tldr: I struggle with depression and anxiety, irrational thoughts, what if my girlfriend doesn't like me? Worrying about the smallest things. Bad separation anxiety even for the shortest periods of time. She's leaving for a week and a half for a trip and it's killing me. 

Any help is appreciated, I am very grateful.",31May2019,3

595,"I don't want this to sound 'woe is me', it is a little but it's also about being realistic. 

I'm a 36 year old woman, I've never been married but also don't want to marry, I'd like a long term monogamous relationship and a child but this doesn't seem likely to happen. I've not found anything close to love, twice thought I might have had it but the last time was a year ago and only lasted two months...before he became abusive. 

It seems very unlikely I'll find a partner - for one I have no friends so no social life and I just don't get to meet people let alone date. It seems the men who are single are single for good reason, such as being abusive, so chances of finding someone who's a good match and capable of a good long-term relationship feels impossible - finding someone who's not been married, doesn't already have kids, is attractive, and is good in bed also clearly asking far too much at my age. 

I've been single for a year - my last relationship was only two months, prior to that I'd been single a year and a half but before then the relationship had been long-distance so isn't the same as a normal relationship (no one else on the scene during those five years). I'm told I'm attractive so that's something, but I just don't meet anyone!

597,"So, I live with my parents still. I'm 30 years old. It's been a weird set of events that led up to this:

I never had a career plan so I couldn't reasonably afford to live on my own.

I didn't like the idea of renting as it felt like throwing money away + I couldn't afford it.

My grandparents got ill so I had to stay at home to look after them, stopping me moving out.

Now I'm at a point where I could move out. I have a career of sorts, the money isn't great though. I could afford to rent. I might be able to afford a mortgage.

However I'm trapped by fear and at this point, I'm used to living at home with my parents. It makes things easier. I save more money. I'm scared of moving out and not being able to afford it solo. 

I guess I'm paralysed by fear. Should I just bite the bullet? If I did move, I'd not move far so I'm near my parents. Which makes moving kinda more pointless as I'm spending money to live alone when I could still live with my parents and save.

I guess I'm stuck on what decision to make. I know I left it too long, it feels weird that I'm still in the same room I grew up in, but the earlier circumstances stopped me from moving.

599,"TL;DR - I'm only a teenager, have no clue what career to take and am being pressured by teachers, feel very uncomfortable in my life right now.

This week was the start of a new year in school, had to make some changes to my timetable. When I went the teacher he pressured me the best he could into picking up an extra subject I don't need (I went there to drop a subject I didn't need). 

He was very insistent that without an extra subject I would not get into university because I wouldn't ""have an edge over other students"". 

This went on for some time, with him insisting that I pick up specific subjects to help me with university when I explained to him that I already had a large workload and would like to focus on the subjects I already have. It ended with him stating that it's up to me but I really should pick an extra one, making me feel like I'm wrong for wanting to only focus on what I can handle.

Before this point I was happy enough with the path i was taking and thought that I was taking the right steps to give me the best chance at getting into university but this interaction has made me question everything.  

I'm fearful at the thought of going back, and am now generally uncomfortable with being in school. I'm not sure why this conversation completely derailed me but now I'm very scared that I'm making the wrong choices in life and that all of the universities will reject me for not being good enough.

This has also made me question if I'm going into the right career or not, and to be honest I'm just really crapping myself about everything future-career related. It feels like I'm expected to know exactly what career I want to go down first time and I hate it.

I'm not sure if everyone will think I'm just being stupid, but I'm genuinely terrified and have no clue how to cope, any advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea what to do.",31May2019,2

Since MIL doesn’t speak good English and can’t fill any paperwork out on her own, my husband has been doing everything for her. As well as fighting/arguing with his dad. This whole situation has caused my husband to have more frequent seizures where he has fallen on his head and it caused injury. I keep telling him to stay out of the lawsuit and that his mom needs to find someone else (like her brother) to help. But my husband is obsessed with his mom and will not listen to me.

601,"hello everyone. this is probably something i should discuss in depth with my therapist but .. haha, i can't. it's a lot and i can't communicate that but i have reached a point where my lack of ability to cope is pushing me further into self destruction.

I'm 21 and my entire teenagehood has been an absolute shit show. 

I went to an awful middle school where i got bullied and was basically treated like shit by almost everyone. I developed an anxiety disorder and later depression, which led to later dropping out of high school (different school/s) (((multiple times))) 

now what comes with middle school is also puberty. i'm trans (ftM) and the dysphoria that comes with it further amplified everything. it took quite some time to even acknowledge there is something.. deeper going on. meanwhile, in girl mode, going through puberty, while being bullied; of course excessive body shaming has taken place. what apparently affects me to this day is the ""fat"" shaming. i'm very short (especially for a male -&gt; dysphoria) so it's easy to not be particularly slim. it devastated me but through blurry memory i didn't think *too* much of it or at least i didn't develop a full blown eating disorder. fast forward though, i have. BECAUSE the trauma resurfaced (due to me being a massive clueless dumbass and triggering it). because i have carried these thoughts within me the entire time (but didn't act in such a damaging way on them). because i can't transition and i can't live like that. because i am a huge failure and not in control and i desperately need. to do something.
i managed not to cut myself over the years but damn, if it's not something i vividly fantasise about during dark times and was/am very close to actually losing it (many fears come with the idea of cutting). self harm and an attempt to have control over something comes in many forms and i've jumped from one to another (already have scars even, oof). but that isn't a life. i want a coping mechanism that doesn't come with self destruction. the answer could be easy, i know, like draw or write, or something normal like that, but i can't?? something keeps me from doing it, probably depression since when i do try it takes so much to overcome the mental block and it doesn't reallly bring the brain/emotional/whatever response i seek.

working out is a tricky thing (even though it's awesome) since i kind of like to use it for weight loss rather than actual improvement (and i'm weak - -&gt; dysphoria) and i'd probably easily slip back to a very restrictive diet as well and the ED cycle would continue 

the mindset that i don't deserve good things, only suffering is deeply engrained so how do i engange in self care and stuff. how do i not harm myself in any way (sabotage is part of it)? 

what doesn't help is that i'm constantly triggered, mostly by my father (i still live with my parents, yikes .. this happens when u are a failure such as i am)

it's really bad currently with binge eating.. i also have body dysmorphia on top of all so at this point i assume i'm really fat (beforehand i was restricting hard and apparently quite slim and absolutely thriving off it) and this freaks me out since the whole reason i even want to be a fuckin twig is dysphoria, i can't with this body

the last two months have been me losing my mind over that, a bit more than usually .. and eventually going back to my depressed, non-skinny, uber feminine🖕, traumatised self

btw i'm closeted as hell due to being scared shitless of the consequences and i generally don't do well with acknowledging emotions and problems, not to mention disclose them unanonymously .. i'm so ashamed of my existence


how do i mind my own business, be sane with all that's going on and eventually crawl out of this shithole i dug myself? if i struggle everyday with the feeling of being torn to pieces by my own perception and beliefs .. i currently go to school, trying to get that fuckin diploma, and i really can't lose that. i believe it to be the very end of the very last straw

summer break is soon but still.

i gotta fix life or at least myself, man



kudos to you if you read through this entire shit. i don't expect any advice since literally, what else is there to do than try to get ""back"" on track but venting helps i guess :)",31May2019,2

608,"So I work at my local church in the summer as a camp director. Being in my position, I was given two keys to the church, one that opens all of the doors on the outside of the building and another that opens all of the doors inside of the building. About three weeks ago, I got home from helping a friend move, opened my house door (house key is on the same ring as the church keys). I juggled our family cars to get mine out, grabbed my bag and went to play basketball. In total I was home for maybe five minutes and in that time I managed to lose my key ring. After searching my whole house and recycling and garbage bins, I’ve still been unable to find them. Today I went to talk to my pastor and the office administrator about losing my keys and they told me that they would have to change all of the locks and that I would have to pay for them to do so. I was kind of taken aback and didn’t know what to say. There are 20+ people who have keys to the church, so they would also have to get everyone to come in and give them all new keys. This seems really unnecessarily excessive considering there is no identifiable information on the keys or the key ring. I asked my friend if he would cut me a copy of his key, but they all have different numbers on them so they would know they weren’t mine. I don’t really know how to approach the situation and don’t really want to have to pay however much money for losing a pair of keys. My house key was on the same ring and if anything I lost them in my neighbourhood, and we’ve had no issues in almost a month. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",31May2019,7
609,"(Stole title from somewhere)

In 2 weeks I have prom. Should be one of the happiest moments of my life. Instead, my 3 best friends decided to get a transport without me after I said I would follow in their steps if they chose the vehicle. Guess I fucked up there. After a slight row with my friends one of them offered to switch places with me because he could join someone elses ride. I thought something was fishy.

Now yesterday, the same friend who helped me told me he and my other best friend went to a party of another friend of mine. He didnt want to talk about it and tried to hide it from me after he slipped his tongue. So apparently they were talking about me behind my back and someone is trying to hide everything from me. Idk what I did wrong. The summer vacation had barely started and im already miserable. These were just 2 examples of many more of just the past few weeks. 

In a month i will go on a trip around europe with 2 friends of the 3. I'm already regretting that decision. They will just laugh about my weight for the nth time. They know i tried to end it 2 years ago because of the same reasons. Guess they never learned. Guess some things dont change.

I'll be confronting them tomorrow and maybe break off everything, friendship, holiday, contact etc. I will be moving to the other side of the country in 3 months anyway. But 3 months without any contact from anyone will be very long...

Maybe I'm just getting paranoid that everyone is trying to hide stuff frorm me and talking behind my back. Why would i otherwise never get invited anymore? I am just lost.

610,"Hey reddit, first post here. I just want to get help. So I’m dating a girl (let’s call her Karen), but I’m scared the relationship is turning toxic. She doesn’t want me to be myself in public, holds my previous relationships over me, and puts words in my mouth. Despite all this, she still wants me to please her sexually, even though we haven’t had sex. 

I’ve recently started snapchatting with a girl from a theatre class I took (let’s call her Pam), and she’s awesome. We both like memes, have similar music tastes, and I can definitely see myself dating her. She even wants to apply to the college I will be attending! However, there are a few problems.
1) I’m so nervous to talk to Pam. Yeah we’ve “talked,” but all we have is a streak. I really want to get to know her, but I’m so bad at starting conversations with girls.
2) How do I break up with Karen while still being respectful to her? I really don’t want her to be overly mad at me.

I probably sound like a horrible person, but my mental health comes first. Karen is manipulative and toxic to be around. I really want to get to know Pam, and I know it’s not a rebound. Pam is one of the sweetest people I know. As far as I can tell, Karen just wants a physical relationship, where I can see Pam and I having a healthy one.

618,"Hey, so I ((F) am in my 20s and live in England. My ex and I broke up a few years ago. We broke up because I felt like he didn't have enough time for me. But I cannot blame our break up entirely on him. I have always been a bit passive, not that active in life or talkative. I have a hard time telling people my opinion, because I don't care, or don't really mind any option and can live with the choice they have made. Or worse, I accept what have happened and continue with my life. However, when I do care about what happened, I don't say anything about it, until it happends more frequently. And thus end up with resentment and comment on the behaviour way too late.  Which is a very bad trait. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also rarely take initiative or risks. After the break up I have met some new people through college and shortly met up with some men after my ex. What I have noticed is that all men that I have met are more risk-takers and more talkative. For example, one of them was a real risk taker, for example I would never just go on a holiday when I have classes. I sometimes get real quiet, and I don't know what to talk about. I felt pretty much scared, because I was afraid that I am too boring for them. And especially one guy had big plans, he wanted to travel and perhaps work during traveling. With no plan. And when people say these things, I get afraid. As u can already predict, nothing resulted into a relationship or dating. And have been hurt quite frequently in the process. Which still hurts, when I think about it. But I blame myself. And I keep blaming myself, and that's a bad trait, because I keep putting myself down. 

&amp;#x200B;

One was actually a massive asshole. The guy didn't meet up with me for quite some weeks and didn't show up at the arranged meeting. We didn't arrange a time, however we did say that we'd meet up for that day. The first time he did that I made excuses for him and I let it go. The second time he did that I called him out on it. He apologized and wanted to make it up to me. However, weeks pass and I didn't make time for me. Eventually we did meet. But I was too afraid to hurt his feelings to call him an asshole. I told him that we'd not work out, because of personality differences. But in reality it was because he was a massive asshole. Instead of calling him out I shyly told him that my friends thought he was an ass. I sometimes do think back on the time I've spent with him, because he was kind when we actually met up. But he really hurt me. Gaving me the idea that he was being serious, but his actions said otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

And thus I also don't know what I am looking for in a relationship. Am I looking for someone that is more social than me? But what if that person that is more social then me finds me boring. And until now that has not resulted into something. But if I look for someone that is less social than me then I am afraid that I will never escape my problems. And where the hell do you find someone like that. Not at social events.  

  
I do have a bunch of friends, and I can be talkative to them occasionally if I feel like it. And I have been working on being more social. However, I feel so afraid and frustrated when in 'rofessional settings or just at social drinks I get so closed that don't know what to say to people or even have a small talk.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel at a loss, and I don't know what to do anymore. What kind of person to choose as a partner? How to 'fix' myself? How to stop being so hard on myself? How to be more talkative, open to people and more assertive?

Is it just my personality and someone will accept this? But I am not willing to accept my flaws.

I take the photos do the captions, create events, read and respond to messages, and other basic social media things. It's hard to account for my hours since it's so all over the place.

622,"I have a gpa over a 2.0 after doing a retroactive withdrawal for a previous semester, I did really bad that previous semester due to mental health issues that I’m currently getting help for. The current semester I didn’t get over 2.0 either and was placed on academic suspension yesterday.

Since my cumulative gpa is now over 2.0, will I be taken off suspension?

I emailed my advisor earlier after realizing my appeal was approved, I wrote that **""I just dropped off the petition at BLANK can I get the suspension removed since my cumulative gpa is above 2.0""**, she responded by saying **""Unfortunately, no this does not change your suspension status.  Suspension is determined based on a snapshot in time of your record.  The retroactive withdrawal does not change the fact that at the end of spring semester, your term and cumulative GPAs were below a 2.0 so the suspension stands. ""**

However after rereading my suspension letter I realized it was time sensitive, it stated that **“Suspension is determined at a single point in time. This snapshot of your academic record is taken at the time you are receiving this notification. Students have one week from the date of this notification to provide documentation of a grade change that moves the GPA above a 2.0. If a grade change occurs you should submit documentation to your advisor of the changes to your grades by Noon on Monday, June 3, 2019.”**

Since my gpa moved above a 2.0 through the retroactive shouldn't the suspension be lifted? I screenshot this and emailed it to my adviser, I have yet to hear back though.",31May2019,1
623,"I cry every time I'm alone. I have so much self hatred. I wake up and I really try to be kind to myself or optimistic, I try to meditate or exercise but I can hardly make it 3 hours without crying. 

I used to love my job, it is the career I dreamed of but lately I've been starting late and finishing early and spending every minute in between just trying to hold it together. 

I was offered the opportunity for my work to support me going to university to study a course which is exactly what I want. I've spent so long agonising over my application and folio not being good enough that I'm sure I've missed the deadline.

I'm in a long-term relationship which has been so safe and supporting. Every time I see him now I cry. 

I feel absolutely trapped in a body and mind which I despise and I just can't imagine ever being happy. I'm at a point in my life where I have everything I've ever wanted but I'm in the pit of despair. 

I have had recurring bouts of depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried many anti depressants, only stopped my last batch in January this year. There is a stubborn part of me that doesn't want to rely on them.

I feel like I'm really going off the rails and ruining everything that I've worked for, I think on some level it is deliberate. 

How do I find peace in myself after a lifetime of self loathing? How do I safeguard my boyfriend from any more of my damaging emotions? And should I really go to university if my mental health is so bad?",31May2019,3

Ik she likes me she shows it a lot she always leans on me and stuff hugs me a lot and tells me she loves me ( Obv because where best friends and stuff ) anyways we've done intimate things before we even kissed a bit once and I've kinda groped her and stuff but we just made it a friends with benefits kind of thing. 

I don't know what to do I know I'm not gonna get to be with her anytime soon cause she's still getting over her ex and stuff. As well as I want to get over these feelings for her but I don't because  yeah I really really like her. 

Whenever she talks about guy trouble and stuff cause she likes some other dudes and stuff it kinda hurts just knowing I'm not the only one she likes and idk if I'll be good enough to get her and stuff as well as when she goes out and does stuff with other guys it makes me jealous and I over think a lot of things so I think to myself what if she's doing stuff with them ( Ik I can't expect her not to talk to other guys and stuff but yeah I get jealous )

It also makes me think what if she's just leading me on and doesn't like me that much and is just using me as like a cuddle buddy or something what if she only says that I'm cute and stuff cause she's nice or something Ik I'm over thinking stuff but I can't help it.

I have a problem where I don't detect my tone very well until after the fact. So I end up coming across very snappish and rude, without meaning to.

This is not the first time someone has brought the snapping to my attention. The other person is my ex boyfriend, who's my best friend. 

I would like advice on how to better manage my tone and not be snappish or rude to people, in the moment, instead of having it brought to my attention after the fact. I'm honestly at my wit's end because 90% of the time, I literally don't hear it in my tone.

642,"So I’ve been in Japan for the past 2 weeks. It’s a school trip with 20 students. We went around different places staying with different Japanese host families. With each host family you either went alone or in pairs. My first home stay I went alone. Me not knowing a lot of Japanese I didn’t enjoy/ feel comfortable in a strangers house who I couldn’t communicate with well in a different country. They were really kind people I just didn’t enjoy it. The next home stay I was paired with a friend. I thought it would of been easier and more relaxing but I just still felt the same. So now with my groups last location before we go home only two people in our group got chosen to go do a home stay and I was one of them. I didn’t want to go in the first place but I told my self the night before that there was nothing I can do. So I came to terms with it. 
The next day I didn’t feel well on the train and was shaking while waiting in the hostel where everyone was staying other than me. I had my head down on my suitcase. Some one asked me if I was okay and I broke down. it turned into a panic attack. Keep in mind I’ve never experienced a panic attack ever in my life. Long story short my Japanese teacher tried to force me to go telling me that I’ll be fine, which made me have another panic attack. And then he still forced me to go spend time with them.

643,"So I’ve liked this one girl in school for roughly a year now. She makes me smile whenever I am around to her. She is just an overall pleasant person to be around. She acted very flirtatious towards me, we did this on foot dance together where you tap your feet together and do a little hop, she would write notes to me in math class(we had the same desk but sat there at different times), and would always talk to me in Spanish. I started crushing on her in mid 7th grade(I’m now in late 8th grade) and she has just made me happy in general. So I decided to grow a set and ask her out(first day of our summer vacation last year) the text was “Hi _____, I’ve liked you for quite a bit now and wanted to know if would want to go out with me sometime over the summer.”   I unfortunately got the undesired answer of no but I understood since I act like a jackass around people when I don’t know what to say/do. She responded by saying that it was family rules and that she couldn’t date until highschool. And when I went bike riding with one of our mutual friends she told him that she just saw me as a friend. Now in late 8th grade I still like her just as much. She sometimes laughs at some of my “jokes” and I have a friend who is touch with her. And the school prom is next week and I’m considering asking her out. But I do suffer from anxiety and depression(wow how cliche, but I’m not kidding, it’s real), I get bullied, I’m not the skinniest but nor am I to fat. I was able to make conversation with her today(progress!) about how we both tripped down a hill because of mud, when we were talking she maintained eye contact. What any advice.

644,"So here’s the scoop. I’ve been a dental assistant at my current employer for 5 years. From the get go, it didn’t feel right. It wasn’t by the books what so ever. Lots of fraud. Lots of suspicious patients. And a front desk that ran the entire office like children. It’s been a very toxic environment. But I’ve learned to adapt. And grow as a person. My boss (the dentist) is a very cool person. Very down to earth. VERY generous. To a fault. Everyone takes advantage of him and it makes me sick. Don’t get me wrong, he has plenty of things that bother me, but for the most part, he’s amazing. I get plenty of bonuses and when he takes time off, or leaves early, I get paid for the day. 

But I can’t take the lack of team work anymore. And after a blowout with a staff member that was blatantly lying about me, I had my breaking point. I wrote up a resume and got replies to every single job I applied for. Today I had an interview. Today I was offered the job for 4+ more dollars, wayyyy better hours (normal people hours. I work 13 hours every day at my current job). I’ll actually be able to do stuff before and after work and maybe even start a family ! And there seems to a very strong sense of team work and everyone working together for the same goal .. making patients happy.

647,"I keep making colossal fuck ups. This is a long one, so hang in there with me. 

I have just been kind of doing my own thing and I tend to forget that she wants me to tell her pretty much all the time where I'm going and what I am doing. I have been getting better at letting her know what I am doing, but I'm still kind of stupid sometimes.

So this all starts a couple of days ago when I offered to take her flower shopping so that we could plant flowers together in the front garden. I told her after the first day of flower shopping, ""we should go again tomorrow"" and she took that as though we were 100% going the next day. I hadn't thought that she had been thinking that, and so I left the house early  last Wednesday to go to therapy. Afterwards, I bought myself some food and then got texts from a group chat of new friends. They were all like, ""let's hang out! existentialegodeath, come over!"" and since they were new friends, I was super excited that they wanted me to hang out... so I went there. I ended up coming home late that night and just going straight to bed. The next morning I was eating breakfast with my grandmother and grandfather and I told her that I had nothing to do for the rest of the day and that I was going to be able to take her that day. Then I went upstairs to get ready, and I stayed in my room looking at reddit and talking to my friends... and then I realized I promised my friend the weekend before that I would go to her house so that she could record a presentation for her college class. She needed at least 8 people and she had no idea how many people were going to come. It was 1:00pm at the point that I was dressed and ready to go, and I knew that was not enough time to go flower shopping. So I went downstairs and I told her as best as I could in my poor spanish that I had forgot about it and I had promised her. She passive aggressively told me, ""No, it's no problem. Why would it be a problem? It's not a problem at all. It is not like I have been waiting to go get flowers. You have to keep your promises or else no one will ever believe you. Go. Leave, then. You are just like your uncle.""

Side note: She is very unhappy with my uncle/her son. He doesn't come to visit her very often, but he has his own business (2 actually) and has a wife and daughter to support. He does his best to come over on holidays and on her birthday, and he always shows her that he loves her when he comes over, but he does not come to visit often. So she basically just hates him for this. 

That kind of sucks because there are only three other people in my house. My guardian, and my grandparents. (My parents passed away, but that’s another story.) So it is often quiet when things get tense between her and I, because I get too afraid to talk to her. She likes to lecture me for an hour or two about how to live my life. 

Earlier that Wednesday, she had been talking about how I shouldn’t get anymore piercings (I have a septum, double lobes, a daith, and a double helix) because it messes with the meridian points in the body, and it closes off energy. I was listening to her, but I don’t personally believe in stuff like that... and then she started bringing up about how people who have piercings and tattoos are people who are in cults, people that believe in satan and just murder people for fun. And it was really shitty hearing her say that because it felt like she was comparing me to that. I would like to think I am a nice person, so it doesn’t feel good at all to have someone you love compare you to bad people. 

Anyway, I continued to fuck up. I had my graduation on Saturday morning. My psychiatrist took me off my meds on Monday that week and I took my last dose on Wednesday, so I was going through withdrawals big time. The night before my graduation I was sweating, feeling like I was going to throw up, and feeling really dizzy like I couldn’t stand up straight. So I expected that I wasn’t going to go in the morning. But my uncle called morning of graduation and told me he was on his way. I was supposed to be there at 8am. It was 8:30am. I was still feeling awful. I couldn’t put makeup on or anything. I went as I was, put a random dress and heels on, and just booked it. The graduation center was 20 minutes from my house and I BARELY made it. I got super lucky. 

I left without saying anything to my grandparents because I knew I would have had to take my grandmother and she was not awake at that time. (My grandfather has dementia and would probably have gotten them lost) I didn’t want to be late to my graduation, so I really did not have time to deal with this, especially in my sickly state. 

I left and when I came back later that day, with my boyfriend, she was outside gardening. I said hello and told her that I graduated. She said she knew and that she had wanted to go. I didn’t know what to say to her so I said nothing, because her passive aggressive tone was just too much for me to handle. 

I have keep putting off talking to her, and the situation just keeps getting worse!

I think I deserve this treatment, because if I were her, I would not feel very good. But she tends to blow things out of proportion. One time when I was 15 I did not talk to her for three days because of homework and just... being a dumb teenager... and she approached me one day and said, “I haven’t seen you in three days! Do you not love me?” 

So...... Having a civilized conversation with her doesn’t feel possible...

The other night my area had a bunch of tornados and that was the first time she had talked to me in ages. That night, my boyfriend and I smoked some weed and I left the stuff out, thinking no one would go down there. 

Next day, things are fine, she and I talk about how scary the tornados were. I tell her I have to go to work with my boyfriend, and she’s like “okay, cool, I’ll see you later.” 

Time goes by, I’ve been busy running errands and hanging out with my friends. This morning, I remember I left the weed out, so I ran downstairs to go put it away and I could tell that she had investigated my things. Everything in my glass container was neatly placed upright, in a visible manner. I thought, “Fuck. She’s seen this.” I pack it up and put it away. 

I walk upstairs to leave my house to go to a math tutoring session, and she says, “hey, go look at what you left downstairs.” and I’m like. Fuck. Shit. All I could say was, “Yeah.. I know. I put it away.” And I just left. 

And that’s where we’re at right now. I’m at a coffee shop typing this up after my tutoring session. 

So, here’s where I need advice. I don’t know what I should even do. One of my friends suggested that I should just go home and go to my room to see if she comes to my room and knocks on my door. She said I should just go through it.

I was thinking of getting a card and writing her a big long note in spanish so that I could explain myself. I feel like this might be the best idea because I can succinctly get everything out and have her absorb it. She tends to like to cut me off while I am trying to think about what I’m saying (Spanish is not my mother-tongue). 

But I almost feel like it is too late to write her a card? Like she’ll just ignore it and go straight to yelling at me????

I don’t even know what she’s gonna do. I’m sure she’s known I’ve been smoking weed for months, but she’s had no proof until now. I have no idea what her stance on weed even is. I remember she told she wanted a marijuana plant for medicinal reasons, but I think she stated not for recreational reasons. I don’t know. I’m so scared. 

What’s worse is that if my guardian finds out (he smokes weed, and he’s chill with me doing it) he’ll be pissed that I was so careless!!! 

I’m such a dumb teenager and things get out of my control sometimes, and I’m still learning how to be more responsible. I’m doing really well in all other aspects of my life right now, but this is where I have supremely fucked up. 

TL;DR: I told my grandmother I would do things with her, went and hung out with friends instead. I told her I would do things with her the next day, and then remembered I couldn’t actually do that. Then I forgot to bring her to my high school graduation. I thought she let things go, and then today she found my weed and made a comment to me about how she knows it was mine. 

I don’t want her to think I’m a horrible person. I feel like I have really tainted her view of me, and she’s one of the only family members I have left that cares for me so strongly. I would be really heartbroken if she hated me.

648,"I have a fear I may to talk to a sex therapist for shame and disgust I have for myself over my sexual habits.ive posted about this before and concerned now whether or now to get help 

Backstory When 19 I had a phase of incest porn. It started from a liking of older females and younger guys I think, and them generally being cause it really started from one video of a supposed older sister pov style. I took a strange liking to it. I looked more into it it developed from there. I don't think I was exactly into the actually incest, but rather what I found while exploring. The videos were more amateurish and relasitic, as they could be. I didn't exactly enjoy lines like "" fuck mommy"" or "" what if mom and dad hear us"" and was often more focused on the females then incest act. I never had a desire to do it in real life, but it made me have instrusive thoughts at times about my own older sister ( only a year older) which I hated. It stopped after I was watching a movie and it had a pov style and their were some sex implications between the sister and part of me did get aroused and I kinda looked back and thought about it. It disturbed me afterwards and from the on I couldn't watch those videos anymore, and kinda realised how weird the whole thing was. Thinking about the videos make me gag now. I look back in some, there's some arousal from the girls, but once I think about the incest it just completely turns me off

I have alot of shame now and I have been finding difficulty at times dealing with it all. I've considered to talk to a conselor, but I'm not exactly independent now.

649,"This is gonna be a long one but I'll try and keep it as concise as possible.

TL:DR

I have a longtime friend who admitted to me sometime ago that he has a desire to hurt people and has in the past hurt animals for pleasure. We recently reconnected and I'm not sure if he dealt with this issue or not and the knowledge of it is concerning me.




I've known this guy for around 10 years and we were never very close until around mid-2017. We were both going through some things and our friendship was born out of both that, as well as a shared passion for film.

For around 5 months our weekends always consisted of the two of us going to his place and getting cross faded and staying up until we passed out. Wed have a lot of heart to hearts, and even worked on writing screenplays. We complimented one another really well artistically and made stuff better than either of us could on our own.


He always had a lot of issues. He was suicidal and had a lot of dependency on the substances both of us were abusing together. It was a healthy friendship built on unhealthy habits.

Towards the beginning of last year he began having relationship issues.

One night while leaving another friends house I get several drunken cryptic texts from him and I decide to call him and make sure hes okay.

He answers completely drunk out of his mind and bawling his eyes out. He tells me he thinks he can really hurt people and he would kill himself before he ever got the chance. He keeps on about this for a few hours but I stay on the phone with him until he sobers up and goes to bed.


After this phone call a lot of experiences with him took on a new meaning and made me feel much differently about our friendship.




One night, while both of us were baked he kept making jokes about ""Bro I wanna go to fucking prison tonight!!"". Naively I'd joke along with him about robbing banks and other dumb shit.

At one point in the night I was far higher than he was. I was standing at the counter beside an empty pizza box when he began stabbing and cutting the box aggressively. This went on for around 5 minutes and I was far too intoxicated and ignorant to be any bit of concerned about it. 

After he did it he apologized to me and I shrugged it off. The phone call we had only a few weeks later gave that action a much different meaning.



Still he was my friend and I cared about him and as far as I know I was and still am the only person he felt like he could talk to about this. His willingness to open up about it at least somewhat made me believe that our friendship was helping him move past this. I didnt want him to have to hold those feelings in and never deal with them or worse. Maybe I was still naive but I really believed I was helping him.


The very next day I got another late night drunk call where he was saying the very same things as the night before.

A while into us talking he tells me that in the past he has killed animals and enjoyed doing so. He was crying hysterically and saying how he deserves to die because of it. I didnt dismiss this, as someone who doesnt even eat meat I'm especially sensitive to this sort of thing.

I'm not sure that he ever actually did this, maybe it was just an excuse to desire ending his life. Maybe that's wishful thinking.

I didnt hold back in telling him how terrible his actions were, but I didnt want to say the wrong thing and give him reason to hurt himself. He obviously wanted help and to change, and I told him all of this.

After around an hour i convinced him to call 911 and told him to tell me once he was safe.


He was taken to a behavioral center for a few weeks, once he left he asked me to hang out. 

I clearly felt differently about him at this point and didnt know exactly if I felt safe or even comfortable seeing him. Still, I didnt want him to lose the connection we had and believed our friendship, which I also valued, was helping him in some way. I made an attempt to get him to admit everything to his counselor, which he agreed to but I'm not sure if he ever did.


We had a falling out over dumb shit, I moved away for some time and we hadn't spoken for almost a year.




Shortly after my return to where I once lived he contacted me just to thank me. In the excitement of wanting our friendship and art again I forgot all about what he had told me and reached back out to him. 

Eventually he told me how he had matured and changed a lot since last knowing me and it didnt feel phony at all. We decided to hang out again.


We did and it was nice. At one point during our time together we did smoke a little bit of weed.

Out of nowhere the memories all came back to me and remembered what he did to the animals, the pizza box and what he maybe even thought of doing to people. Maybe even me.

I became terrified, but it subsided.





My goal right now is just to be a good friend. Hes a very fragile person who has done bad things and nearly took his own life for it. 

If I learn that hes still doing these things I'll undoubtedly take action to help him stop no matter what that entails.


Still I cant help but fear for my own safety when around him. I value our friendship so much and I trust him but I dont know what hes feeling. He really does seem like hes changed, and his personal situation and environment also have changed to reflect that. 

When he mentions things like us going out to clubs drinking or going on hikes together my mind goes straight to the fear of him hurting me.


What do you guys think? 

Am I being ridiculously naive? 

I dont want to betray his trust and lead him to hurting himself, maybe hes moved past those things. Maybe hes gotten help and admitted to it, maybe I'd just be reopening old wounds.

I hate this. I have a hard time making friends, let alone ones who share my passion and value me like I do them.

Regardless of that he claims to have done terrible things and if it turns out hes still doing them I wont allow him to continue.


I'm maybe rambling at this point, but how do you all suggest I move forward from here?",31May2019,1

Due to some recent events, I have decided that I need to better myself already and stop procrastinating so I did a weekend of research of programs I can get done in 2 years or less.

The technical college will let me finish the program in one year, if I don't like it though, I feel like I'm screwed in the longer run. If I go to community college, I'll be able to get the pre reqs done so if I don't end up tolerating cyber security, it is quicker to switch. It'll be two years going to community college, which is the con.

653,"I'm writing this now because I have lost yet another friend today to this problem, and I don't know what to do about it. It is very challenging for me to form relationships, and it seems that a large reason is because I have an unusually difficult time being interested in other people. I can't bring myself to care about their life, hobbies, how their day has been, their deeper problems, aspirations, etc. I *want* to care, truly. But I can't stomach faking it. I think it is connected to my difficulty in getting absorbed in novels or movies of any kind, and my complete lack of interest in any sort of news or gossip. I am highly introverted but have a profound need for emotional intimacy, so despite being very prone to withdrawing and isolating, I am chronically lonely, sometimes to an intense degree. The best I can do is form a relationship with one person at a time, but since it takes a long time(if it happens at all) for me to start becoming interested and caring of them, I burn them out, or I get bored. I can't stand this anymore. I don't even think I really cared about my childhood best friend, and I am afraid I barely care about my parents. My dad is in the hospital from an accident and I visited him the other day. I couldn't understand my behavior; my eyes watered and I felt completely blank and withdrawn, and I barely spoke to anyone. Eventually I felt bored, like I wasn't interested in any of these people and just wanted to go home.

The only exception I have found is that if I become romantically interested in someone, I do start to care. I am quite 'hypermonogamous,' in that I focus heavily on only one person at a time(... which is a very unstable configuration). I am 20M and I think I may love someone I know online. He has his own issues and is very resistant to intimacy, so for almost this entire month I have heard nothing from him, except finally today, when he at last replied and said we would talk soon... but despite all the incredible anguish from him being gone, I care *so* deeply for him that I cannot bear to give up, because I want to help him realize himself and grow and love someone, and if I had to, I would wait another month, and not even be upset, just deeply worried and hoping that I can help him. I am terrified of losing the only person I care about. That is usually a sweet sentiment, but it feels very unhealthy. He shouldn't be the only person I care about. Why can't I seem to give a shit, no matter what I do? What is wrong with me? I know many people have this problem to some degree, but after years of watching myself and talking to other people, I know there is something not right about it. I have met people who don't seem to care about others, but they also don't have much of a need for close bonds-- this is not the case with me.",31May2019,3
654,"This past semester was a big doozy. I have done well in school up until last semester and am proud of my accomplishments, but I realized the major (accounting) I am in is just not for me. Last summer I interned for a Big 4 firm and hated it but they offered me a job on condition I get my masters degree and pass the CPA exams so I accepted. 

I think I had an internal crisis with myself this past semester and did not know how to get out of accounting. It was almost an existential crisis where I kept asking myself, 'is this going to be my future for the next 40 years?' I just was consumed by the fear of stepping out into the real world I guess.

My parents are very loving and understanding but this is where I need the advise. I feel so so so bad and I feel like a piece of shit for failing so miserably. They have given me so much and I gave them nothing in return. I know they will understand but I just feel like I let them down so much I am so apprehensive to break the news to them. I already told them on May 4 ( my graduation day) that I would not be walking because I failed one class and they understood but there were a lot of tears on my end and it was basically the worst thing I have ever had to go through. Now I have to tell them a month later that I failed three more classes and that I will have to go to school another semester to complete my degree and get on with my life. 

Once school ended last semester, I weighed around 140 pounds and my usual weight is 155 pounds. I am a 6'3"" boy so I am not really in the position to be losing 15 pounds like that. Over the past month, I have regained most of the weight and started running and biking regularly. I have finally felt good about myself for the first time in a long time and all I want to do is get back to school to finish what I started. I want to tell my parents to get this damn secret out of me and I think I will then be in a position to get back on the horse. 

How do I break this news without making my parents hate me?",31May2019,1
655,"Guys, I have no idea what to do. After my mother passing in 2014 I've developed agoraphobia. My panic attacks were so unbearable that I could not even walk outside. My day consisted of laying in bed in the dark all day. I've experienced the lowest point when it comes to mental illnesses and I cannot even put in words how horrible it was. It's something someone personally would have to go through to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I've currently been trying to save so I can move to be with my boyfriend, we've been together for 3 1/2 years. His family is amazing and supportive and he is just absolutely overall a great person. My income was coming from reselling on Ebay, it was pretty successful for awhile but towards the end I've became in debt and lost money. I feel moving to Chicago would be better for me.  Part of improving my mental health is constantly going out places and not isolating myself but I wont go out by myself due to my anxiety. I don't have family, friends or a support system here and I feel I am at a stop improving my mental health even though I came so far I feel I need to move onto  the next step. I'm so scared of falling back into that dark hole I was in.

&amp;#x200B;

While I've became much better mentally by seeking professional help I'm still nowhere near to the point of working a out of home job.  To feel more productive I have been dedicating from the time I wake up til the time I go to sleep on researching on things I can do for income from home. I also start online college classes June 4th which is awesome. But still financially I'm clueless.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've done and some information:

&amp;#x200B;

\-I've applied to around 45 remote jobs, I've not heard back from a single one. I assume because they are in high demand and my lack of education / work experience. They probably choose people more qualified :(

\-I've contacted Ohio Jobmeans which helps  people in my state find jobs they linked me to their website which mostly consisted of shitty survey sites, things I don't qualify for, etc

\-I've tried mTurk again - It's not as good as it was 5 years ago and is pretty much pennies. I try to steer clear of sites like these as I'm looking for something more dependable. 

\-I've applied for disability but it's a long process and I'm waiting for papers on a hearing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I literally out of options? I do want to note I am on government assistance for my housing, electric and food. I honestly would be fucked if these resources weren't available and I'm thankful for them. I often think about the people who struggle with the issues I do and aren't able to get these resources. The system is kinda fucked because not everyone is mentally capable of working a normal job and our system lacks resources.

657,"This is a fucking crazy idea.

My parents have become downright authoritarian about my school, and are refusing to treat me like an adult. I turn 21 in less than a week now, and I want to go on a road trip. I am taking online classes, and one of them would be greatly improved by getting out of the house more, since it is a hands on film course.

I recently got my motorcycle license and would like to buy a cheap used Honda to go down to the southwest and back on. I haven't been there in quite a long time, and there are a lot of things I would really like to see now that I have a chance.

I have a budget of about $2000 to pull this all off, which makes it pretty damn hard for sure. I can get a decent bike for about 500, and I am good enough with wrenches that I could get it to a good condition for probably about another 2-3 hundred more. That leaves me with about a thousand dollars, more or less.

I only have about 3 weeks left of the semester. I live in the north east, which is about 2000 miles from where I want to go. 

I need a plan for shelter from weather, since I only have a mesh jacket and no rain gear. I also need a plan for where to sleep, since I don't have enough enough money for motel rooms. I can eat cheap food, such as rice and beans with some local produce and spices (and multivitamins too.) I plan on getting a nationwide gym membership for showering. 

I could probably get a tent and sleep on federal land if I plan my route well enough. I can go to libraries and coffee shops for wifi to do my homework. 

Is this adventure even remotely possible? I know my eyes are bigger than my stomach, but I really want to go on a journey and be an adult who is alive instead of the slug that I've spent my last 2 decades being.

658,"So I won't go into the details of what I do, but basically I wasn't there to help handle an emergency. 

So I usually work M-F but took today off because I'm scheduled to work Sunday.  Weekend work isn't regular or normal, but it comes up every now and then. No biggie. 

So I don't go into the office and set about enjoying my day off.  Around noon I check my work phone and email just to make sure there's been no disasters or emergencies and lo and behold, three missed calls from my supervisor.  Fuck. 

I call my supervisor and he updates me on a developing problem, asks for some information that I have that he needed to deal with the problem.  I send it over and ask if there's anything I can do to help and offer to come in.  He gives me a fairly simple task to do, and says I don't have to come in to do it as I can just do it from my laptop and send it to him.  The task involved some things I wasn't familiar with doing, but I can tell how stressed out he was already and figured I could do this one small thing just to take something off his plate. 

Here's where I fucked up. The task took me longer than I expected  it would and I didn't even do it right, so when I sent it to him he had to redo it anyway.  Normally, I think this would be all right as I'm a fairly new employee and still learning, but given the emergency and time sensitivity of the situation, I just feel awful. 

I've been trying to take on more responsibility at work and get involved with more complex projects outside of my usual work scope, and I feel like I just shot myself in the foot.  Why would they trust me to deal with any of that if I couldn't even handle this one small thing when it really mattered. 

I called my supervisor a bit later to apologize and get an update, and he's still really stressed out and basically said that they're still handling it. 

The problem is still ongoing and I really want to go in and help, but at this point I feel like I'm just going to hinder them more and obviously my help isn't wanted or needed.

Also sorry if this is organized weird.
Fyi I'm 16
So recently my mother has been angry at me for eating food out of the pantry without asking. Which I think is a fair reason to be angry.
But when she decided to come yell at me about it she said some things.
1. I'm the reason she is always so miserable. (Has said this multiple times last few days and before)
2.You make me wish I never had children. ( again been told before)
3. I'm also the reason she cant live her life.
That's mostly it. But I should point out she has been saying this stuff to me for awhile
So what I plan to bring as reasoning is
1. Me leaving would let her live her life the way she wants to since she constantly reminds me about how I'm the reason she is miserable and cant live her life.
2. I dont agree with her anti vax ideology and that she believes in those crazy government conspiracys you see in Facebook groups.
3. (I feel like this one makes me look like a dick but I feel like this is a huge reason) That she cant keep a job and that I'm tired on relying on the government for food stamps and all that.
4. She has always told me I would live with my dad as punishment everytime she was angry at me which makes me think she has wanted me gone for awhile

But still does it causing our apartment floor to stain and stink. He doesn’t bath, brush his teeth, change his clothes, or move from the couch we’re he pee/shit. He’s racist against my mother who’s a native of another country who he views as inferior to his race. All the while she cooks and cleans for him.

&amp;#x200B;

 

I don't know how I feel so I just want to get this off my chest and see if anyone can relate? I think friends would be baffled if I made such a dark post like this. Because I'm optimistic and very grateful, and express those feelings a lot. I had a rough childhood but since moving out and going to college, I feel that I'm in a beautiful fantasy world full of loving roommates, friends, and a major / career I can be passionate about.

There's a lot of downs to college of course (and normal downs from school, relationships, etc...) but still, I feel overall grateful. But I don't feel like I should be happy for me, if that makes sense? I'm so stressed with school (particularly one class) that I don't eat much anymore. Everyone is in the same boat pretty much so when I need to find motivation to continue, I want to help others. Unfortunately I'm not doing great myself, I made a 24 page study guide and for some reason it didn't benefit me as much as others (everyone who I helped did better). I understand concepts well so I can help others with projects but it's hard for me to find motivation to help myself. I just... don't feel worth it.

I realized I oversacrifice a lot for others even when it takes a toll on me. Luckily I have such a good group of friends that no one has taken advantage of it, and they often help me in return (not that I expect them too). I haven't seen my parents much because my Dad is so intuitive he knows when I'm suffering, and I don't want him to worry. I just become reclusive and don't want to talk when I visit, which makes them worry. I don't know, I try reaching out to others during times when I want to better myself, because I truly want to be happy. I just don't know if I deserve to be happy.

All of this just made me realize, I don't know why I'm alive. I don't know if I'm truly happy anymore, I used to do hobbies for me (piano, games) but I don't feel worth investing time into those, I don't feel up to it more often than not cause of stress. I wouldn't hurt myself because I don't want to put anyone through that or make anyone pay for a funeral, because I know I'm loved. I have so much to be grateful for so I turn that into repaying those who make my life happy, but I don't have any motivation anymore to live for myself.",31May2019,1

671,"I am looking for advice on how to help my brother. We live in Maryland if that matters. My brother is early thirties and I am late twenties

My brother works/ed for my dad who runs a small seasonal business (he was sent home yesterday and its my dad, him, and another guy a really small operation, I also work for the business part time but have a 9-5 elsewhere.) My brother started out the spring season happy-go-lucky and was in a good mood, showed up to work and talked to the family. But then about three weeks ago he became reclusive and agitated. This is a common occurrence with him where he will get into one of his ""moods"" and not talk to anyone or show up to work. These moods will last a week or a month.

I know ""mood"" isn't the most respectful way to put it but that is how we refer to it. I believe he has mental issues and he refuses to get help, we suspect he is bipolar or clinically depressed. My parents and I have talked to him several times about seeking help and talking to someone but he refuses. The truth is that he was an asshole as a kid and had problems and then that was possibly exacerbated by going through chemotherapy in high school.

My parents, for the 1000th time, have told him he is done at the business and needs to leave the house, this is usually an empty threat. He lives a very cushioned life, eats all the food my parents buy and sits in his room playing games all day or watching sports and does not go out with friend. We are at wits end trying to help him get out into the world and have no idea what he is going to do once my dad eventually sells the business. My other siblings and I have talked to my parents about what the heck he is going to do when they inevitably pass.

Something about this occurrence really doesn't feel right to me and I am genuinely afraid that if he goes on without receiving help that he will end up hurting someone. I drive home from work an hour everyday and fear that my brother and mother have gotten in an argument and that my brother hurt my mom or that my brother has snuck in at night and robbed the business because he has stolen from family members before, he stole my checks one time and cashed a couple for himself. 

I don't know what I can really do to help the situation since my brother won't talk to me and my parents are getting older now I fear that don't have the stamina to go through with it.

How do you get help for someone for a mental illness if they refuse to get help themselves?

What do you do with an adult family member that becomes an emotional drain?

I really don't know what to do anymore, I just want my parents to be able to retire and be happy.",31May2019,1
