1,"Ok, so there is this girl (lets call her Rose), that I've known ever since I moved to my neighborhood. We became best friends in 3rd grade (I'm a 9th grader now) but I had never thought of her as anything else until towards the end of elementary school. Saying I had a crush on Rose was an understatement, she was all I could think about, she was just perfect to me. At this time I was kind of a loser because I was the new kid from LA who nobody really wanted to get to know. Anyway, we got closer and closer but I never had the balls to tell her I liked her. In 7th grade, while we were hanging out at a football game I had decided I was gonna tell her when she got back from the bathroom. I was gonna take her on a walk, make it all romantic, and we'd be together forever. She ended up coming back all excited with the words ""Matthew just told me he likes me!"" and a whole bunch of amazing stuff about Matthew. After that my dumbass middle school self decided that the only way to get over her was to just ignore her. This kept going until mid 7th grade when she asked me why I was being such an asshole. Then I told her, about it all, how I've loved her since I moved here, and how much she meant to me. But, understandably she turned me down as she loved Matthew and was dating him. We pretty much cut ties after that. Fast forward to mid 8th grade and her and Matt broke up because Matthew had cheated on her with a girl from another school. Rose and I still stayed away from each other, but I always had these butterflies in my stomach whenever I looked at her. She was gorgeous, and every dude at our school knew it too. I'm talking, dirty blonde hair, copper skin, insanely intelligent (has never gotten below a 4.0), athletic, and one of my favorite parts, her hazel eyes. She has the most beautiful fucking eyes I've ever seen, they just reflect the light in a way where you can see the specks of green contrast on the light brown and just.. wow. Anyway, I can't really remember how but Matthew and I started getting really close and he became one of my best friends. Now, Matthew is really really popular so I never thought we'd click. So towards the end of 8th grade, I started dating this girl named Gigi from a school close to us and honestly forgot about Rose. I started to get more popular, I joined the football team over the summer, got in great shape, and I've always thought I was a decent looking dude but no girls had ever really tried to hook up with me. At the beginning of high school, I started to lose contact with my old friends, and started hanging out with the ""popular kids"". I had lost my virginity to Gigi by then and was fucking around with her everyday so I was really happy. Then Matthew and I started experimenting with alcohol, vaping, weed, a lot of shit. I fucked up big time, got drunk at a party and ended up getting head from another girl which ended up ending things with Gigi. It was mid 9th grade when I started fucking around with girls and partying every weekend but it never satisfied me. Even though Rose and I stopped talking the butterflies feelings for her never went away. Skip a couple months to now, I'm still partying but am laying off the substance because I'm focusing on school, still ""popular"" or whatever, and Rose and I started talking again. I don't think she'll ever have feelings for me, but we've been hanging out a lot and I can't stop thinking about her. She just gives me so much energy and enthusiasm to get through the day and I think I love her (big word I know). All I want is her, she's the only girl I've ever looked at and lost complete brain function for. I don't know whether to tell her how I feel and risk our mending friendship, or keep on the lowkey and just suppress my feelings. Idk, just ever since I started talking to her again, I've turned down head, sex, a lot of shit because nobody makes me feel like she does. I've stopped talking to basically every girl but her, deleted all the nudes in my phone, just everything. It's like I feel nothing for anybody else. And she's gotten smarter, funnier, prettier (i didn't even know that was possible), is the president of our ASB Leadership Team, and now has an ass and tits which doesn't really mean anything but like adds to it. I just need help from anyone who knows what I'm going through and is willing to share some advice.",13Apr2019,1
2,"Hi all. 

I’m 21 years old and have been raised in a catholic household which does not believe in premarital sex. When I was younger and disagreed with these views I was basically told if I had sex out of marriage my parents would be extremely disappointed in me, would not talk to me and so on. 

I have had sex outside of marriage with my boyfriend of 4 years. We have had to keep that side of our relationship a secret. He would like to get married and move in together. Only I am way to scared to move out with him because of the issues my parents will cause. 

I’m stuck in this rut of wanting a relationship with them that’s happy but deep down I want to move out already. I want to take that next step with my boyfriend. Either way I let either my boyfriend or parents down. What should I do? How should I go about things? 

Any advice would be much appreciated it!",13Apr2019,0

4,M19 (college freshman) my roommate sometimes refers to black people as “nigger” and “negro” when talking about them in a negative or neglectful context. I know if I say anything he’ll give me some long drawn out speech about how it doesn’t matter to him but I really think he should stop because he could get into serious trouble (especially being in a more liberal college setting) and it goes completely against my morals of respecting others no matter their background. What should I do about this if anything at all? Thanks for any and all advice you guys have for me.,13Apr2019,0
5,"I don’t post a lot, so I’m not sure if I should be here or the relationshipadvice subreddit, so I hope this is ok.

I live in an apartment building that is all micro-studios and down the hall from me lives a couple who gets into frequent fights. I would say they happen at least 2-3 times a month but until recently I was often gone at work during the day so it could have been more frequent. I always know when they’re fighting because I can here the guy screaming/cursing etc. For context, they live at the end of the hall, approx. 6-8 units away and I can hear him screaming through closed doors.

Today when it started I was coming in from walking the dog so I stayed in the hallway and walked by their door to try to overhear. All I could tell was that the guy was accusing her of being a liar, not appreciating that he supports her, and telling her not to play the victim card. It didn’t sound like there was a concrete thing that he was yelling about but you never know she could have some other issue that is pushing him over the edge (like gambling, drinking, spending, etc.).

When I was close to their door, I could kind of hear her saying “I’m sorry/that’s not true/I appreciate you” etc. but it was clear she was upset and not enraged like him. It’s never sounded like there was anything physical going on but things don’t need to get physical to be bad. 

What should I do? Should I be phoning police or the apartment management? Should I knock and check-in, we don’t really know each other but we’ve made small talk in the elevator and mail-room and such (on that note: the 2 of them are always together, seem content, and there’s no physical bruises or anything on the girl)...I just don’t feel right not intervening",13Apr2019,1
6,"Hey so i’m a little worried, was walking around after a old glass table broke yesterday and punctured my heel, found the small glass piece that did it. thought nothing of it till there was excessive bleeding. i don’t know if i should go to a doctors or not, my tetanus shot isn’t up to date by a few months and i’m really worried. wound is properly cleaned too.",13Apr2019,1
8,"I just needed to vent here and yes, I know it’s wrong to have these type of feelings. Please don’t comment things like “SWEET HOME ALABAMA” etc. I could use some advice to get over him. I’m female and he’s a few years older than me. We weren’t previously that close but recently my family and his family had been making plans to hang out more. We stayed at their house for a few days and we played games together etc. And we travelled together too. The most heartbreaking part is that there are NO signs of him liking me. I know it’s probably one-sided. I notice everything about him - his eyes, his smile, his laughter, his sense of humor, his masculine energy. And I know he has flaws like everyone else but I still like him. I’ve never felt this way about anyone else because I only liked the idea of my old crushes, not the actual person. And idk if I’m liking the idea of him but I feel like I’ve spent enough time with him comfortably to know how he’s not my typical dream guy, yet I’m still hopelessly crushing on him. I obsess over the times he offers me his jacket and even his sweatpants, lets me sleep on his lap or rest my head on his shoulder during long car rides. I want to spend every moment with him, even when we’re not doing anything. I wished he would cuddle when we play games, which we don’t. I don’t think he has a girlfriend now, he spent Valentine’s Day with me not as a date but just because we’re single but I’m scared my heart is going to get broken when he does. I stalk him and get jealous of girls he had been in love with before. I want to know what it feels like to be loved back by him, if I weren’t his cousin, and if I was his type. I tried looking for other guys to distract myself but honestly my love life is practically non-existent now. I feel like I could fall in love with him because I’ve seen him being himself, comfortably, because he has no one to impress, so I’m relentlessly crushing. Please give me some advice to get over him, thanks.",13Apr2019,1
9,"So I'm in highschool (15m) . There is an anonymous meme account on Instagram where all the memes are about the school. Lately it's gotten more into cyber bullying by singling out individuals. I'm the latest smear of theirs. I went to the school's administration but they can't do anything because it violates the districts policy of ""digital privacy"" and without threats of violence they can't do anything.

10,"My girlfriend and I (both 20 years old) have been dating for almost 2.5 years now, our relationship is great. We get along perfectly, we have a great balance in a lot of things like seeing each other, doing things she likes, her doing things I like, etc. We even run a business together. We are far ahead of our times. I come from a great family, my parents are divorced and have both found love again, everyone is great. My parents are big on mental health, happiness, communication (especially in relationships),  great parenting and what not, so I’ve rarely seen fights. Of course fights have happened but you’ll understand what I mean shortly. 

My girlfriend on the other hand, her parents are miserable. They hate each other but they won’t get divorced. The mom sleeps in the bedroom and the dad sleeps in the basement on an air mattress. The mom makes him sleep there because he snores too loud. My girlfriend has an autistic brother who is 18, I believe this also puts a lot of strain on their relationship. The mom does not drink a lot but when she gets 1 touch of alcohol, she can’t stop and will drink to the point of the police coming to the house and arresting her. She has been arrested multiple times for assault, public drunkenness, possession of cocaine (I don’t think she does coke anymore) and disturbing peace. She’s a mess. No job, no degree, stays at home all day every day. My girlfriend marked down the last time her mom went out, it was to go to get cigarettes January 2nd of 2019. That was the LAST TIME SHE LEFT THE HOUSE! Anyway, even when she’s not drunk she will occasionally lash out with screams, throwing stuff and hitting my girlfriend and her dad. As you can imagine, it’s hard not to go to her guns blazing (verbally, wouldn’t kill anyone lmao), but I’ve bit my tongue.

She only allows me to see my girlfriend 1 day a week (ONLY SATURDAY because that’s the day her dad is home from work and somebody has to be there to take care of the dog) and she can sleep over BUT she has to be home the next morning at 11 am or she gets screamed at again. The reason behind her needing to be home? Their dog. She made my girlfriends dad install a fence around the entire property so they didn’t have to babysit the dog outside. Now, the dog can’t go outside alone because he will get “lonely”. Oh, forgot to mention, he’s a chihuahua mix and weighs almost 100 pounds because she (girlfriends mom) FEEDS HIM HUMAN FOOD FOR BREAKFAST LUNCH AND DINNER. Oh and get this, they can’t eat breakfast lunch or dinner until the dog is ready for his meals because again, the dog will get lonely, if he has to eat alone.

So basically long story short, what prompted me to make this post, she’s now mad at my girlfriend because she is planning on coming over my house (on a Monday so it’s dad is at work). After that, she freaked out on my girlfriend for not taking the dog outside, so she took the dog outside. When they came back inside (after exactly 17 minutes because her mom locked her out of the house until the dog pees and poops) her mom got mad because the dog was wet (ITS FRIGGIN RAINING OUTSIDE YOU NUT).

Because this is taking a toll on my girlfriend and her and I’s business is growing, we were planning on her moving in with my parents and I when she can transfer her job to the store in my area (waiting for a position to open).

In the mean time, how does my girlfriend deal with her mom like this.",13Apr2019,1

12,"My father was made redundant a few years ago and ever since then he's started doing charity trips to Asia and travelling there quite regularly and sometimes for months at a time. The charity work is real, I've seen it and it's something I've always been proud of him for. Apparently that's not all he does over there though...

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking through the old shared storage drive in our house at some holiday photos and reminiscing when I found some pictures of my Dad kissing an Asian woman. Immediately I knew he had been cheating while he was over there. That's quite upsetting but common, I Can deal with that.

Oh what's this? A whole family photo with his girlfriend and her two kids. Oh and he had a screenshot saved on there of the daughter calling him Dad, so fuck knows what's going on there... Do I have half siblings? I guess his real family isn't enough for him, he literally joined a whole new family. Meanwhile my Mum is just the loveliest person, I know she'd never cheat and I'm already thinking about how this will break her heart.

Now I'm looking and I see some screenshots of messages... A message threatening death: ""I'm coming to your hotel with a gun... give her the $1300 or I shoot you"".  So now I'm just freaking out and there's nobody I can tell because I can't risk breaking my Mum's heart. He's supposed to come home soon, a day before my birthday.

I matched with this girl on tinder (we're both 18, looking for a relationship) a week ago, as we talk we both express our mutual interest, then proceeded to get her number.
We now text about nothing and everything, she flirtes with me, i answer positivly, we're on the same page.

Now it begins, i ask if she would be down to go on a date in the days to come, tells me yes that she would like but that atm she's busy this week and has a formation the one after. I know what you're thinking but i had my fair share of tries with dates and i know when one is lying or not and i strongly believe that she isn't.
After that we talk of other stuff, including her encountering people of her ancient school who allowed themselves to do, I quote ""weird things"" because she wore a skirt one day. After me answering ""what a bunch of frustrated fucktards"" she didn't replied for 3 days.

I sent this text some hours ago :
 ""hey is everything alright ? You know if you're busy or just don't want to talk to me you can say it, i don't mean harm nor wanting to impose myself""

Got this answer some time after :
""I can't talk to you right now because i'm not allowed to anymore...
It's complicated i'am sorry, waiting for stuff to settle down to get back to you""

I've been worrying nonstop since. 
Why would she lie anyway ? What would be the point ? There isn't any but then how did she answered ?

Please help, i need to know what to do to help her, being powerless/clueless sucks ass.

14,"Hi!

I'm being super indecisive so looking for some outside opinions.   I'm currently choosing between 2 apartments. Its pretty much just me (boyfriend lives in a different city).

 So, reddit, which apartment is the better choice?

Apartment 1 Basic Facts, Pros, and Cons:

Rent: $1075/month, includes water, gas, sewer, trash

2 bedroom.  Probably 950 sq feet.  Ground floor unit, in a rather large complex, which is only 2 stories

Swamp cooler. May get central air in summer (as it gets super hot here, central air is a huge PRO).  I live in an area where swamp coolers don't do much in summer because its too hot.

Has full sized kitchen appliances, normal dryer venting.

Newly renovated 

Covered parking

Large property management company

 Location is slightly worse as compared to the Apartment 2 (it's in an area surrounded by just residences for about a mile around so not convenient, but in a super safe quiet area with no homeless, is ~10 mins from any freeway access or ""area with stores"", commute is about 15-20 mins, is ~10+ mins drive from anything I may want to do and very out of the way from friends/coworkers.)

Probably just has comcast in area


Apartment 2 Basic Facts, Pros, and Cons:

Rent: $1045/month, no utilities included.  Sewer/water/trash split between 16 units.

Small complex, with 16 residents total. The apartment has a slightly ""dated"" look to it in terms of style - wood cabinets, yellow wood floor, older cabinets.  Everything is in good repair

 Really nice, convenient location, pretty safe (more chance for homeless, so simultaneously more chance for vandalism, but still low crime area). Very close to stores and restaurants (easily walkable).  Very close to many friends/coworkers. Very close to freeway access.  Commute time ~12 mins regardless of traffic

1 bedroom, ~700 sq feet

Covered parking

Has access to Google Fiber

Window AC

Apartment size smaller fridge, regular size stove/oven

No exterior vent for dryer (so non-healthy indoor venting with attachment, or buy a condenser dryer)

Smaller property management company

TL;DR: Can't decide which apartment I like more - is it worth $45/month extra to live in a renovated larger downstairs apartment, with a less convenient location? Or do I go for the smaller apartment complex/smaller unit with upstairs unit and more convenient location?

Please feel free to ask me any questions, and thank you",13Apr2019,2
15,"My (13M) So we have a beach house up north of where I live which is beautiful, and is right near one of the best beaches In the country. Anyway, it was built by my late grandad (my mother’s father). Since he died, my mothers younger brother has assumed all but full control of it and often cheats my family out of getting to bring our dog up. My mother lets him tread over her and cheat her without realising. It is kind of just sad.

So we have a dog (a four year old cavoodle  with traces of schnauzer, relatively well trained and behaved). 
My mother’s brother has a cat which is super old and is two steps away from dying which he brings up. For a long time, we had a system where we took turns bringing our pets up, but of course he had to go and ruin that.

So myself, my brother and mother all went up over New Years last year and it was rightfully our turn to bring up our dog. Meanwhile, their cat was in a chattery suffering from a sort of throat cancer (I think my uncle said that it may be terminal) and was paying something like 500$ a night to keep it there and pay for its medicine. Anyways my dad came up on New Year’s Eve and all was well until he told us that his cats illness was worsening and that he would appreciate it if he could be with her in her last days. We understood this, and decided to let him as we knew what this felt like.

My father had to go back to work anyway, so he drove back with our dog. While this was a move of respect for him, it was also extremely inconsiderate of him. My father had to dump him off at  his mother’s house as he is working long hours with very short notice which was also quite thoughtful of him. 

We stayed up there a few more days with the cat and then left. What annoyed my family though, was that in it’s “dying moments,” they were all out all the time at the beach and on their boat and hardly payed any attention to it. You would also be a fool to believe it died. 

We said that since them bringing up their cat cut into our turn, that we should get another turn as we got cheated out of ours. Of course they didn’t listen and now they are bringing it up next week when we go up again. 

Some ways of settling this dispute I thought of are: giving my family two turns in a row or resetting the cycle starting with us.",13Apr2019,1

21,"To make things clear it was a one time incident, it's been well over a couple of months now, but I can't stop thinking about it and it's making me really confused. In short, what happened is that I was over at my grandma's house. My youngest aunt, who's only a few years older than me, was also sleeping over at my grandma's (she usually spends the weekends over since she goes to college in a different city). It was past midnight and we got to talking in her room, drinks were involved. She kept encouraging me to drink with her, even though I almost never drink and she knows this (she kept teasing me about it). To make things clear she didn't force me to anything, she pressured me but I did it willingly. Anyhow we got to talking about dating and relationships, her asking me if I have a girlfriend and whatnot (she has a boyfriend herself), and  somehow we ended up kissing. There was nothing more involed, it was just kissing. I don't know how it happened, but I did kiss her back. We kept talking for a bit before I went to the other bedroom and fell asleep there. Again, I'd like to clarify that she didn't force me to do anything, and I kissed her back willingly. I didn't think much of it but after it happened it's all I can think about it and how wrong it was. I still saw her a few times after and she acts as if nothing's happened. 
I didn't tell anyone about what happened, but lately I've been freaking out thinking about what if someone found out and thinking I'm gonna get in trouble if that happens.

About 15 minutes after that the police called my mom and physically demanded my sister to screenshot the child pornography or ""we'd be useless to the investigation"" literally after they hung up someone else from the police branch also demanded we don't take a screenshot.

He recently got introduced to a girl who he has started to hang out with, and is basically in a relationship with. They've only been together for a month, but his best friend has been bringing up some issues with her. Apparently, according to her (ex)friends, she uses multiple drugs and sells them. She has admitted to using previously but denies the fact that she sells and uses still. With the evidence that we have, it seems like there are 2 possibilities. Either she is recovering from addiction from prescription drugs, and has sold in the past, or she currently uses them for recreational use and sells them just to make more money. I don't have an issue with people using, but when my brother is involved, he can completely end his career if she gets caught with drugs on her while he's driving her around. I'm also worried that she wants to drag him into it. She supposedly stays away from alcohol and drugs when she is with him so he doesn't see that side of her, and I'm worried that she does that to drag him into it.

29,"Hi everyone! So this is for school project. We had to ask other people advice on a problem we have with ourselves. No matter what I do, whether it has to do with school, work, family, friends, relationships, etc. I always second-guess myself and worry if i’m really “enough”. This type of thinking has stopped me from doing so many things in life that I really regret not doing. 

What solutions would you give to help me stop doubting myself? It can really be anything (practical, impossible, funny, weird, basically whatever comes to mind)  Thanks!",13Apr2019,1

32,"She knows I like her, and shes in my first period class we sit next to each other(only cuz of assigned seats) and shes in my lunch. But I normally sit alone, but I can see her (only discovered shes in my lunch two weeks ago)she'll sometimes catch me looking over at her during lunch, and often during first period. I have delayed for a week or a week and half to ask her out. Even though I really want to. I'm pretty sure she likes me as, well. I have noticed the signs. The playing with her hair (mostly after catching me looking over at her, again shes next to me in class, and the desks are solo desks, not double. And shes next to me and will catch me looking at her often), after catching me she'll often look away, sometimes sigh a bit loudly, I'm pretty sure I even caught her smiles a few times after looking away, sighing heavily. And playing with her hair. And about 2 or so weeks ago. Going to certain classes I'll see her in the halls, mostly going to 3rd and going to 9th. But about two weeks ago, I saw her going to her 9th hour (though I hadn't all year) and she....smiled and waved at me....I almost froze in the middle of the hall and my heart probably skipped a few beats, i couldn't  stop thinking about that for a while, I still kinda think about it now and then. And when I am going to school on the bus or like lunch I all of a sudden get weird sharp cold pains in my chest dosnt really fully hurt but it does a bit, but also feels slightly good too. (I have never felt that before. And even thinking of her gets my heart beating faster. I also haven't had a crush on someone like this ever only one crush like this but that one was only cuz it lasted long, this one only this year, and I have never felt the sharp, cold pains) could this mean anything?


I am also an extreme introvert I sit alone at lunch, I talk it bit in some of my classes, but am mostly silent, when called out I sometimes will get red. 
And when it comes to romance I get extremely shy and hard to talk, jello legs, heart pounding, sometimes even sweating abit.
And I am great at speaking in front of lost of people, 90% of the time if not more. Along with I extremely rarely ever studder or mumble (like 96% of the time) but when it comes to asking a girl I like for anything or even talking to her or asking her a question I then start to mumble alot, studder and trip over my words, and find it sometimes difficult to talk. 

But when would be the best time to ask her? Lunch sometime or at the end of first period? 

One thing I do try is I try to make chances for me. Or just saying screw it(if I'm lucky it'll be a chance that opens up where shes alone, and I'll say screw it)

Maybe how should I ask her I'm mostly broke and dont want my parents to wonder. They can know if I'm dating someone but not crushes.

And the school year is running out almost a month left, so I need to act or I'm screwed..



For everyone who actually read this entire thing, and actually replies, I think you very much. The reason I'm trying to date someone tho I'm 15 is it seem like everyone is dating. While I'm sitting in my basement gaming or on my phone. (Typing this in my basement rn lol)I have one friend, but we are super super close, been friends for 6ish years, but I still want a few more even if the just for hangout with at like lunch. And I also just feel plain alone. Everyone is dating hangout actually doing stuff..I'm sitting alone in my basement, doing nothing but gaming...plus dating does sound like fun and great, plus something different, and finally being able to date someone I love, would be amazing.

And for those whom it may concern, yes I know not to get to attached, as MOST high school relationships dont USUALLY last.

33,"This is alos kinds helping taking things off my chest a bit so it will be ranty.

Advice part: I’m a femboy. Have been for a while and I’ve been dropping hints for a while. My hair has grown really long and I love it like that, though I need to go get it trimmed down soon. My only issue is that I haven’t spilled anything to my parents and I’m scared to ask for a more feminine haircut as I don’t know what the blowback from that would be.



Rant: I wasn’t well liked by the guys in my elementary school. I was nerdy and quiet and soft spoken so the girls took me in and let me hang out around them. This continued up until middlenschool. I was well tapped into my feminine side and eventually middle school forced me to shake that off in order to not get bullied quite as much. Towards the end of 8th grade i went ahead and start to tune back into that side. Of course, my school being a lutheran and relatively conservative in a rich, white, conservative and christian neighborhood this came as a culture shock to my fellow class mates. During the summer time and and some friends went ahead and had sleep overs. We had lots of fun and one time me and a friend snuggled. It wasn’t just like ‘There’s no more room looks like we have to do it.’ No...it was a passionate and loving snuggle. This kinda of tapped into the gay side of me and I’ve been privately getting in tune with that.

34,"About a week ago I approached my boss and let him know I felt unsafe around another employee. This certain employee has been negatively viewed in our office as he performs poorly, jokes to much and shows up late almost weekly. The boss had even mentioned at one point he was on the verge of firing him but decided to hold off because his performance kind of improved.

At this point I should note that me and this guy go to school together. I even suggested he apply at my work and that's how he got in. We talked at school and been acquainted but I didnt know too much about him until he started working with me. That's when it all went to hell.

Two weeks ago I went to hang out with said employee after work (trying to give him a chance) and it was going pretty good until we got into a really serious talk. He ended up telling me that he murdered someone and that he was an accomplice in a murder.  Not sure why he told me but he never claimed it was a joke and we were far from joking in our conversation.  He let me know I was the only one who knew about it. He also confessed that he scammed our company out of money through expense reports.

This really bothered me. I feel like he put me at risk of being a liability.  I have a family so it makes it more worrisome for me.

So back to the main point...I feel really uneasy and nervous around this guy.  I talked to my boss about it and told him everything this guy told me but nothing has been done.  I hate going in to work and I keep having to help this guy with his projects and it makes me sick.  My boss knows I feel unsafe and he still directs the guy to come to me with questions.

How long should I give my boss before I start considering other options?

I am an intern and graduate soon. I've accepted a job offer with the company that starts in a month so I'd hate to leave after already accepting but I dont know how this should play out.

35,"  To start this off, I don't feel like posting on throwaways because it feels disingenuous. So there may be a slight chance of the person I'm mentioning in this reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

  Over half a year ago I made an amazing friend over reddit. They're not typically active here and they can't be identified through my history, so I'm not worried about posting on this account. 

  
  They are my rock and the only person I trust. It's them that I go to when I'm not feeling well, but Wednesday night this week I ended up making her very upset with me. I came home from work in the most terrible suicidal mood of my life. A lot of things have been taking their toll on me mentally and I was genuinely scared I might end up trying something, so I was considering admitting myself to be safe.   
I'm absolutely terrible about telling people when I'm feeling like that, so I started saying things in a way that would get her to probe for more, but I decided halfway through that I shouldn't do that and just told her, after sending her messages about it and deleting them(I wanted to revise them because I didn't think I worded it right).

  She took it all as me trying to play mind games and manipulate her, when I just didn't know what to say myself. I didn't say anything with that sort of foul intent, and I never would. I was having a panic attack from how suicidal I was. She got really angry at me for the first time in our friendship and it made(and is still making me) have SEVERE anxiety from the PTSD of being in this type of situation before, and having lost my friend.

  The way I sounded made her think I didn't want her to be mad at me because she wasn't allowed to be mad at me, but in reality I was just panicking and trying to repair what I'd done because in that situation I just shut down and go full fight or flight. When I make someone angry I'll start blaming myself and self hating really hard. Saying stuff like:  ""It’s okay to be mad at me I deserve it"". She took those words as guilt tripping her into feeling sorry for me instead of being angry at me. And I didn't know how to fix things. It was all just misunderstandings.

  I didn't give her the space she needed away from me when she was mad at me and now I'm suffering the consequences. I don't have the necessary resources to deal with my anxiety and I asked for advice from some people I met recently that are all older than me and they said to wait it out until she messages me. Doing that goes against my anxiety so hard it's a huge massive struggle for me. That night I could barely get to sleep after I cried for hours. My heart was pounding so hard I could feel my entire body move with every beat. It's been like that every time I try to sleep. I sent her one message the morning after just apologizing for everything straight up, ""I love you and I respect your need for space"" etc.

I've just been waiting since then. I'm constantly looking for advice, so I thought hearing from anybody here might help too. I've decided to wait at least a week before messaging her myself, and then another week if I feel like I can manage. Nothing dramaic, just check in and stuff. I'd like to hear anything anyone has to say, or any advice. I'll answer any questions in DMs. Thanks for reading my post.",13Apr2019,1
36,"I’ve been feeling extremely lonely recently. I haven’t really been able to make any connections with anyone new, and all the strong relationships I had in the past seem to be fading out. I’ve been going through some rough times, and I haven’t really had any friends to help me. It kinda sucks because I always tried to be present for people close to me in hard times, even if I wasn’t sure what to say or do. It just seems like it’s me here, dealing with everything. Nobody to really just hang out and laugh with. Most of my time this past year has been spent alone and it seems all the attempts I make to get out of this bad situation just make it worse.  

I guess I’m having a hard time coming to terms with everything. Maybe I wanted too much of my friends and it pushed them away. Or maybe I was just too much of a dark cloud to keep around.  

I’ve sent them a few messages trying to get together - just stuff like “ it’s been a while, we should get together” they normally seem quite excited to hear from me and say yes but then stop talking to me for weeks until I try again. 

Just looking for anyone that could help by giving me some outside perspective/advice if they have ever been in a situation similar to this. But any advice is much appreciated.

39,"I’ve been having this thought in my head for a long time. Ever since 4th grade in my school, fake friendships have been a thing, which always made me ponder if my friends didn’t like  me at all.

Lately, i’ve moved from one class to another. This one is way more casual and light hearted compared to my previous judgmental and ironic class. I adapted behaviors that would make me like-able there; behaviors not common on my other class. So when I talked to my previous friends (which I had a more fond relationship with), they began to notice these behaviors and slowly begin to talk less with me.

Stressed out from this, I went back to my group of online friends and began hanging out with them more often. Some of these friends include /b/tards and people with a really dark sense of humor. They made fun of me being more light hearted at first, but as time went by I began to stop being this mask I built. Instead, since I was free to do whatever I wanted with my online friends, my filter began to break up, and my flaws started to become noticeable.

I began to make fun of people at school, talk too much to the point its annoying, act dumb in public as a joke and do very dark and offensive jokes with friends that weren’t close. 

I was at lunch with my best friend (whose companion I was since we were three years old), and when we were discussing about soccer, I made a extremely racist joke. He pushed me in disgust and said “get out”. I realized the mistake I made and remembered how sensitive some people were in real life, so I began to carry this guilt on my back ever since. He accepted my apologies a few days later, but he felt really fake to talk to ever since.

My other class friends all were even more annoyed by my flaws that began showing up, to the point one of them said to my face “you should’ve stayed here so you would still be cool”. I also found out that one of my online friend hates me.

Any advice? What should I do to get back on track and make everyone like me again?

Ok, so my mother and her partner and my siblings are moving in toghter in June- a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom townhouse. We have a picture of the houseplan, and there are 3 rooms upstairs, one for me and my 2 siblings. My older sibling (17F) is going to college in the 2019-2020 school year, and wants to try and live with her boyfriend of 2-3ish years? She literally said that she won't need to take that room, so it's between my brother and I. We're both 13, his birthday being a month behind mine. 

Anyway, today, during lunch, I asked him if he wanted the master bedroom, and his reasons behind it (bad idea) He IMMEDATLY said that he should have it, I asked him why. He said that he just should, and I told him I very much want it because I know I have a to of stuff that my current room is very small, but I also have a center bed so idk. 

But he says something else, I tell him ""we'll drop it, and talk to the parents about it together."" We don't talk for the rest of lunch, because we sit together, but our table is long. He came up to my side of the table, and takes my chips. I tell him to give them back, he says ""not untill you give me the master bedroom."" I thought he was kidding, untill he OPENED MY BAG OF CHIPS AND ATE THEM. I payed for them, I was gonna eat them. I told him to knock it off and that I want them, because their mine, and he ran into the boys bathroom and ate them. They were mine, and that's all the money I get untill next year. I am livid, and I flipped him off, and am not speaking to him.

43," 

Took  a trip and was expecting to stay Tuesday through Friday. The listing on  the website says ""Private room in a condominium"" and the description  was pretty brief, but there was enough pictures to think it would be a  decent place to stay. The host didn't meet us when we got there, he had  buzzed us into the building and left the unit unlocked for us to get in.  Right away I noticed that none of the pictures on the listing matched  the actual unit, which was unusual. When the host called us I overheard  him say ""the space you rented was the living room, but I won't be home  during your stay so feel free to sleep in my room"" which was confusing  because according to the listing we were booking a private room. Also,  the door to the bedroom couldn't close and this wasn't disclosed until  after we had booked, which was inconvenient. He also didn't let us know  that the roads surrounding the complex would be blocked off due to an  event so we had to park blocks away and walk all of our luggage. On top  of all this, the place was a complete mess. Another thing, he was  charging a $65 cleaning fee but I fully believe we left that unit better  than when we found it. All of this is of course enough to warrant a  less than perfect review. I wrote a very honest review that touched on  all these issues, and after I had sent it in he called me looking for  feedback. He said he wanted to make sure he got a good review and made  sure to let us know that once he reviews us, there is no way to go back  and edit it. My friend let him know that there was a lot of confusion on  the trip and he would ask me about my review and left it at that. Since  then, the host has been continuously contacting me about my review. The  last text I got from him carried an almost threatening tone, saying  that we left the lights and fan on (if any light was left on, it was the  bathroom light and not a huge deal) but he still wants to leave a great  review and to let him know. This seems wildly inappropriate and  unprofessional. If I tell him my review was less than perfect he is  threatening to review me as less than perfect, even though all I did was  allegedly leave a light on. I took photos of the entire place when I  first got there because I had a feeling I would need them, and at this  point I don't believe this guy should be hosting. When he sees my review  he is for sure going to contact me. What should I do? I'm sticking by  my review but I think I should contact AirBnB about this, but how would I  go about that? Also, would this warrant any sort of partial refund?  Sorry about the wall of text, I just can't believe I'm still hearing  from him about this review.

44,"I feel like this is a common situation..?

Me: 30ish, moderately educated, raised in a stable environment etc. I am selective, but I don't find it hard to make friends, but it seems like I gravitate towards users. (this is the worst case, but most of my ""best friends"" have done something($500+) to take from me)

So in early 2017 I was living in what i considered a very nice place, in a very nice neighbourhood. I had a good enough job that paid me what I needed and kept me in shape. I was in a relationship that made me happy. After working in this job for some time, I ran into a guy (x) I actually liked hangning out with. We started doing stuff on weekends, whatever. I got fired from the job for a hilariously petty reason, and X quit the job that week...I took it as a token of loyalty, I think. 

At this point he owed me a very small amount of money, think $100. I got a new job. It sucked, but it paid my bills and I was able to get X hooked up full time a couple weeks after me. He quit after day 2. That's fine. I was upset he couldn't at least work enough to pay me - but  aside from my bosses being on my ass on why he no-showed I had no major problems with this- I didn't hear from the guy either. 

Attribute it to pride or whatever, I didn't talk to him at all until a few months later, I was fighting with the GF I had put so much time into.  We got back in touch and he would come over to my place on weekends. He said he was thinking about moving out west to a pretty popular tourist town in our country. (Oi it's Canada}

After breaking up with the wifey, and spending a few weeks hanging out with X and some other friends who were completely neutral in the matter, I was convinced it was a really good idea to move out west at the end of 2017. 3 days of driving and we made it. Woo.

Cool we made it. No one made any plans, only one of us had savings. I make some bad really bad decisions here and I know it.

I had planned to come for 3 days and sleep in hotels to see the place. Got drunk with X, decided to stay another 3 days. ETC ETC ETC This ended with us staying in hotels togehter for about 50 days. In this town that is not cheap. I paid it upfront (yes a huge mistake) with us both understanding (very clearly) that we were eventually splitting the costs.

Afterwards we just found a place we could rent. I took over the electricity and gas bills. He got the internet. He did pay his own rent.

His mom visited shortly after. Very nice woman. Her 2nd husband treated us to dinner and stuff.

7 months later (june 2018 now), X moves out. I had forced him to. The internet had been cut off and he hadn't paid a thing towards gas or electricity. A woman had accused him of raping her in the house a few months earlier and I didn't believe it because he had never really shown me anything like that. Her and her friend wouldn't really tell me more when I asked what was going on. When he left he grabbed a not-cheap backpack of mine, despite a few requests it hasn't come back.

Since then, he's only messaged me thing likes ""when are your weekends??"" which i replied to matter-of-factly and got no response. He has ""good friends"" out here he's known since childhood who, while not getting ripped off, still have barely heard from him in this time. 

For what it is worth. The money he stole from me is essentially pennies(I think he knows this.) I'm having a shit time coming to terms with people doing ""this"" to me. Not losing the money. 


So the end-ish result is: I moved across the country with X, he owes me at least $3000, we still live in the same, very small town. I haven't seen him yet, mostly because I don't go to bars. Small claims court seems out of the question, beating his ass is out of the question? I don't even know what is reasonable.

I guess the advice I am looking for A) Is it reasonable to contact this person to clarify wtf he is actually thinking? I think this is for the best, but I don't know what angle to take that will even get a response.. B) Is there any recourse here? I don't see it  C) How tf do I deal if/when I see this person in town? I'd put myself as a large favourite to win in a fight - but I have an aversion to the police and way more to lose.

45,"I’m a college full time student and I work 32 hours a week at a large private company as a security guard. I got this job originally because my Dad encouraged me to, it looks good on a resume and I thought I’d have time to get school work done. Now I’ve been told buy this company that it looks very good and a lot of the people who do this through college (with a good degree) get pretty good jobs. 

Fast forward to now, 

I don’t have time to get any school work done as I am almost always walking around or sitting at the front desk. This has become a problem as I work 32 hours a week and don’t have time to get all my schoolwork done. Thankfully next semester they are willing to work with me. 

A big problem for me is that I work alone. Some people like this, but I enjoy having someone with me or in the building ( it’s a huge building). I work 3pm to 11pm and by 5-6 everyone is gone and I’m completely alone for the last 5 hours. On the weekend I’m alone for all 8 hours. For some context I guess I used to work at a pizza place that was always busy and I enjoyed it as I always had someone to talk to or something to do. 

Which brings me to my next point, this job is completely mindless unless I’m sitting at reception or the fire department has to come because of a fire alarm. My mind is constantly racing so I enjoy having constant stimulation of my brain if that makes sense. When I take my ADHD medicine it helps a bit, but I still enjoy having to think about something. I just walk around and press a button to show that I’ve been there. A dog could do that. 

Honestly This job is making my depression worsen. I can’t do anything with friends or family because of the hours. This is big because I’m super close with my friends and family as they’ve helped me through rough times. I’m also not doing well in school and I already stressed this to my boss and hopefully my requests for next semester to be less hours will be allowed. 

The lack of a social life and not doing well in school on top of not having picked a major yet it weighting heavily on me. I can’t seem to motivate myself anymore. 

What can I do to help motivate myself? How can I improve this situation at all? Am I truly stuck in this job? Will it look bad if I leave this job after only a year?

Truth is, I know so many stories of people who died so early in life due to heart complications and at one point he warned me his doctors or him don’t know his life expectancy. 

It really freaks me out. Like we always talk about marriage since we’ve believed we were for each other since we were so young, but then I imagine we have kids and their father is gone at an early age in their life. Or that I’ll be alone without him.

My father was estranged from his first wife, he'd made a point to avoid my mother having any contact with her - my father was an alcoholic, he was abusive (controling and emotionally abusive) towards my mother so that may be why. I've no idea what his relationship with his son was like, but he did claim to be in contact with him. 

When my father died his family claimed to have no way of contacting my brother, to this day I've no idea if my brother knew our dad died.

I'm 36 now, which means my brother is 48. I think I found record of him marrying and I think I know where his mother lives, in theory if I had the cash I could pay an investigator to find him. 

My question is why wouldn't he have reached out? I always wanted siblings so I always wanted to meet him...what's stopping me is my life is shit right now, I don't have the cash for an investigator, and with him not trying to find me I wonder if he'd not want to know me.",13Apr2019,6

A little bit of bg, me and this person have been friends for nearly 2 years and we’ve helped each other through a lot of hardships. For example, bullying and being betrayed and even sexuality (homophobia). She’s gay and Muslim and very much closeted to her family whereas I’m gay not Muslim (altho I was brought up in a seemingly Muslim household) and I’m also closeted but only to my parents. She was one of the first ppl I came out to and just the fact that I knew another gay person made me feel more comfortable and eventually helped me come out to others. She has always been aware of this and is quite open herself. However, I always got the vibe that she thought I was getting carried away or not thinking about who I was coming out to, that type of thing. 

Despite this vibe we never had any arguments or issues with each other during this time we were just always supporting each other and it was actually so fun to discuss things with her whether it was religion, tv shows whatever. However, now there’s suddenly all this tension and it feels quite scary too. It’s not so much intimidation it just feels like she’s angry all the time and is thinking things or being very judgemental. I know it’s easy to say that I’m just assuming these things but I have the strongest gut feeling I literally can’t be making this up. 

For one, the subject of religion seems to come up way too often and everytime it does it feels like we’re going back and forth. Every time I say something even if it’s a neutral statement she always interrupts with things like “oh but stay open minded” or “you never know though so don’t decide that you don’t believe”. It’s phrases like that which don’t sound bad but the way she says them comes across very forceful. There was also a conversation with my little sister where she asked her if she believes in god or not and my sister said she doesn’t know. I noticed my sister getting uncomfortable so I just said smth like “it’s okay you can believe in whatever you want” again a neutral statement and my friend says “but don’t cross out god from your options”. 

Another thing is that she seems to have a lot of tension with my brother too. I thought I was the only one who noticed because my brother would never talk about smth like this but my best friend noticed one day at my house when apparently my brother said a joke about the weather idek and while everyone was laughing she was noticeably stiff. This wasn’t the only occasion it’s literally every time. 

Lastly, there’s the random complaints. She says I don’t call her enough or I our calls are not long enough etc. It feels very possessive and most of the time she doesn’t even have to say anything. 

I’m sorry this is so long but what I’m asking here is how do I end the friendship ? What is the right way to go about this ? She knows all of my friends and is friendly with them. Also, I’m one of the only ppl she can talk to but it really feels like it’s getting too much because I really dread talking to her.",13Apr2019,1
49,"So basically, a little background: 
  I’ve had this friend, let’s call her Kaylin who has been in my life for three whole years. Kaylin has had this amazing “boyfriend” for 3 years who has bought her puppies, had a string quartet playing for her on their anniversary, and apparently has basketball scholarships across the country. She admitted to my friends and I that she’s shown him to other ppl but not us and we have known her so long. Not even a picture. My friend Sarah was encouraging her to show a picture of him so we can at least have a face to the description and Sarah said “ come on... sharing is caring”. All of the sudden, Kaylin hits Sarah’s head really hard. Apparently Kaylin thought Sarah was suggesting that she should share her boyfriend. Anyways, it’s been two weeks and she has still not apologized and basically has no remorse even though she hurt Sarah, almost made her cry, and insinuated that she’s a hoe. It’s hard cause Kaylin and I were very close but now I don’t know how to feel… advice please!",13Apr2019,2
51,"Long story, please bear with me! :)

For context; I was born and raised in a strict Christian faith. My sister and I were expected to pray at dinner and go to church every Sunday for the worship service. My mother loves to bring God into her life lessons for us. I don't scorn them for that, a part of me still believes that maybe there is a God up there somewhere. Up until I came out, my parents showed no signs of bitterness for homosexuals, in fact one of my father's close friends was gay. So at the time, I figured there would be no conflict.

I started piecing together my sexuality when I was in 6th grade (11 or 12yrs old, for the international gays). I was never really able to relate to fan-girling over One Direction in elementary school, to me they just looked like people. I didn't get the appeal of having crushes on boys like my friends did. I remember in 6th grade health class was the first time I heard the words 'homosexual', 'gay', and most importantly, 'lesbian'. For years I had thought that being attracted to the same sex was physically impossible, my parents never told me it was a possibility! When I got home that day I asked my mom so many questions about it. She simply said that she'd never had the need to teach me about it, and that some people believe God says its wrong. 

As the next 2 years began to drift by, I got my first crush, the girl that sat in front of me in my math class. I had figured out by this point that I was, at the very least, bisexual. I remember feeling crushed when I learned that she was straight. I won't get too into detail, but it seems that triggered a 2yr bout of major depression in me. I was so unmotivated that I wouldn't leave the house for weeks. I was rushed to a stress center during my 8th grade year, things were not going good for me. About a week after the stress center visit, I came out to my parents during a therapy session. Not ideal, but I didn't want to hide it from them anymore. I told them that I never had any attraction to guys, but I had some sexual feelings for girls. During the car ride home, they kept on asking me. "" Are you sure?"" ""Could this be a mistake?"" ""Why do you feel this way?"". Over and over and over.

During the next few weeks, I noticed a change in my parents behavior. They were more hesitant when I asked if I could go hang out with friends, began to talk about the Bible much more than usual, and talking about marriage. By this point I identified as a lesbian, and the weight I thought would be gone by coming out somehow got heavier. Then one day I heard my mom pull my dad aside while I was in my room, and my mom said, ""I'm worried about -my name-, I don't want her to go to hell for her sin. What can we do to show her that her attractions are wrong?"" My dad followed up with, ""Its just a phase, soon enough a man will sweep her off her feet."" I was crushed. 

Fast forward to my freshman year. I had met this girl during marching band who went to a school close to mine. We hung out and I developed strong feelings for her. Eventually I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said she felt the same way and she would love to be. Despite my parent's prior statements, I was still super excited to tell them about what was going on in my life. I thought they would be happy for me. When I told them, my mom began to cry. My dad was furious. He demanded to know why I would make my mother suffer like this, what they ever did to deserve this. I began to cry too, I didn't understand. I told my dad that I thought they would be happy for me. He proceeded to yell at me that I should be sorry, and that he refused to accept his daughter was a 'faggot'. My mom is soft-spoken, she didn't say anything, but I knew that she agreed with a fraction of what he said. I talked about this with my (ex) girlfriend, and she told me everything would be ok. My dad's disdain towards her is what led her to leave me altogether, about a year later.

I'm now 16, I'm required to go to church and be glared at because my dad has told everyone about me. I have to see a Christian therapist that my mom wanted me to see. I don't confide in this therapist, all she says is that homosexuality is a path I don't want to walk down. My only escape from all of this is marching and concert band. My mom works at the school as a choir director, so if I went to any teacher they would probably let her know, which I don't want to do. I know my parents love me, I just wish that they would be more accepting of me. Being a lesbian isn't my defining factor...but they don't see that. Every punishment I've ever received is followed with a gay slur from my dad. How he didn't raise no faggot, or something like that. I cry about this on a daily basis and I'd like to know I'm not alone in this.

tl;dr my mom and dad dont like that im gay and im forced to participate in religion, plz help.",13Apr2019,8

55,"i’m 17 and i feel like absolute shit all the time. it started to get really bad when my dad let himself catch an infection (which turned to sepsis) in his leg last may, causing his to lose his job and our house. me and my two younger siblings had to move in with my mom in her one bedroom apt while my dad was dosed up on antidepressants in the hospital. she had to, and still does, support all four of us (and my pet rabbit) on her $14/hr because my dad wanted to die. it’s almost a year since it happened and we are living with my mom’s grandparents now because my dad (who is living in a weekly hotel paid for by his parents) has not been bothering to find a home for us. 

everyday i dread to go “”home”” and it leaves me really drained and i honestly think i’m depressed. i have no friends because i’m bad in social situations and i have abandonment/trust issues and just fail to understand and connect with the people i’m around. 2 months ago i tried my best to tell and explain what i am feeling to my mom and even my guidance counselor at my school. my mom said she would consider letting me see a therapist but nothing happened. 

i don’t know how to ask for help. i am constantly telling myself that i do not deserve to be happy and that i should always be sad. i don’t allow myself to enjoy anything happening in my real life. i get anxious and shake randomly and i just want everything to stop. living in the same room as my siblings and having to share a bed and my sister sleeping on the floor of my grandparents house makes me feel like i don’t deserve to have anything good to happen to me like i’m destined to always be in a shitty environment.

59,"Hey everyone. I am 29F. I tend to keep to myself at the gym and put my headphones in and get to work. I really enjoy lifting weights and I do a little bit of interval training. This really isn't important so here's why I'm posting:

I typically want ZERO attention from the opposite sex while i'm at the gym. In fact, I feel this way in general when it comes to being anywhere. For some reason though I am extremely attracted to this guy at my gym. It's been like this my entire life: I don't find anyone appealing until suddenly I see this one person and bam, I really want to get to know them and can't help fantasizing about talking to them and who they might be. My question is, what's the best way to introduce yourself to someone at the gym? Are there ways I can tell he might be interested? I know he's quite a bit older than me and always works out on his own. For all I know he's married but I just really feel like I want to get to know him or at least make some sort of move so I can move on if that's what it takes. So I guess my question is: Guys, how would you like a girl you approach you at the gym and are there any signs you give women if you're interested in them?

60,"I was 1013'd (Georgia's involuntary commitment law) for the third or fourth time a few weeks ago after my dad beat the fuck out of me, and I didn't have anywhere to go (btw my finger is still broken from blocking a punch, so I'm going to try to make this short). I just got out about two weeks ago, stayed with friends in Atlanta for a bit, and came up to Pennsylvania to stay with another friend's parents. My friend's mom thinks I should just get a job in IT here (although I have been on disability and haven't really worked in a few years other than a month at Coachella). My friend thinks I should write a book (others have told me this, too). If I do write a book, I'm going to have to go somewhere nice to write--at least within walking distance of a decent coffee house. My dead boyfriend's parents (he died in June) said I could live with them in a tiny town in Georgia, which is within walking distance of a nice coffee house I played a show at once. My old friend in Berlin also said I could come stay with her, but it'd take me a while to save up for a passport and ticket (I get just over $1000/month in disability). And my friend in Hollywood said I could come stay with her, but she has a 2 bedroom with a boyfriend and 3 kids.

I've also been through a lot of shit and have SO many unresolved major issues and questions, which is a big reason I thought it'd be a good idea to write a book.

Like he followed a woman in a vehicle with me in the car, tailgating her, just because she didn't let him pass as we were getting out of our complex. He didnt do it very long, but he got so close to her car that I was freaking out.

He laughed about it, but I just felt so uncomfortable because, I mean that's not only creepy and scary for the woman, but also embarrassing for me. I felt guilty for just being in the car with him. Plus she had a girl my age in her car!

In an old post, I described how he yelled at a bank employee over the phone for barely anything. 

And we ordered pizza yesterday, and he got so pissed that it took them 30 minutes (he went early when I told him not to) that he left 2 negative reviews, and tried to phone their companys corporate office to probably yell at them to. Luckily they didn't answer. 

He watches those 'Liberals getting rekt by logic' videos and has become such an extreme conservative that it makes me cringe when he says that, ""Liberals should just fucking die."" 

I tell him he shouldn't say things like that and he just goes on a rant about how he's right and that they're ""better off dead"".

I feel like he's taking the 'no filter's life way too seriously. He provokes people for no reason. And has even told his depressed coworker, who was contemplating suicide to ""just kill yourself then"". He thinks everyone with depression is weak minded and that they're selfish and should just die and stop complaining then...

He picks fights with religious people, being a super atheist. And is one of those people who will argue saying ""God doesn't exist"" when people say freaking ""bless you"" when he sneezes. (If I could eye roll through the screen, I would) I'm not religious myself, but like jesus christ can't you just respect that they have different beliefs than you...

His boss even lectured him apparently because he ""yells to much"". He's a manager so I can't even imagine what he puts his poor employees through.

My dad used to be a really nice guy. :(
He used to have empathy.

I’m so exhausted when I get home, and I still have tons of chores to do.  I can barely keep up as it is.  We also have to get up very early because I need to be at work early.  Even when I have free time, I can’t help but get anxious about things I need to do for work.  I feel like I can never relax.  I don’t enjoy hobbies anymore.  I don’t want to do anything but watch tv.  Sometimes I just sit and stare at the wall.  If I sleep in to 9 or 10 am on the weekend, I feel incredibly guilty because it feels like I’ve wasted the only time I have to get things done.  This seems like a common complaint, but I honestly don’t understand how people can live like this and not want to kill themselves constantly.  

I have been battling depression that has been getting steadily worse.  I’ve lost 20 lbs from not eating, and there are times when I lose control and start screaming and banging myself hard against the floor or wall for no reason other than to hurt myself.  I pretty much always have bruises because of it.  My depression is pretty bad these days, and I think about suicide daily.  As far as my job goes, I’m a professor and do generally love my job.  I am the kind of person that hates getting yelled at or told what to do...one of the reasons I love teaching is that I am in control of what I’m doing without people breathing down my back.  Every other job I’ve had has been terrible.  At least with teaching, it’s something I enjoy doing and don’t dread everyday.

That said, I wish I wasn’t so exhausted all the fucking time.  Yesterday when I got home, I slept for 4 hours, stayed up a couple hours until 11 pm, then slept for 12 more hours.   Depressive thoughts were really bad today, and I got so far as to plan out my suicide.  For the record, I’ve been in therapy and have taken antidepressants for years.  I’ve tried everything - multiple therapists, different medications, and different doses.  All of this started because I was raped at 6.  I was such a scared, fragile girl that I often attracted predatory people...leading to me getting raped and sexually assaulted repeatedly.  It wasn’t until I became an adult that I fully acknowledged being raped (at the time I thought it wasn’t *really* rape because I felt I deserved it).  I’ve had suicide attempts already which got me hospitalized.  When people look at me, they’d never know...they think I’m a normal, well-adjusted person because of the face I put on in public.  But I’m not well-adjusted, I’m miserable.

I just don’t see the point in living anymore.  For what?  Why prolong my life and keep going just to see my life get progressively worse as I age?  People always tell you to get help if you have suicidal thoughts.  I’ve tried to get help, and wish there was something that would help.  Nothing has helped, other than drugs.  Edibles have been the only thing that has ever made me feel happy.  My husband is a kind, gentle person and makes me happy, but I’m still depressed all the time.  I love my husband so much, and he is probably the only reason I haven’t killed myself...I just don’t know what to do anymore.",13Apr2019,1

87,"(Obligatory on mobile, TLDR at end.)

Hey, Reddit. I was hoping someone could offer me some insight on this.

So I am 16, female, and anemic (which may be the cause of the issue). Most of the time, I don't have time in the morning to eat breakfast and sometimes skip lunch.

Today is one of my bad days in terms of eating. I had a muffin for breakfast, but I skipped lunch to help a friend with some emotional problems he's been having. It's now nearly 8:00 PM for me and I haven eaten dinner. Yet, for some reason, I don't want to. I don't feel hungry.

I often find myself looking in the fridge or pantry, and if I don't see anything that looks good, I may ask my brother or my mom what they're having to see if I could get some too if it sounds good. If not, I may just decide to skip the meal.

My entire family is concerned about my eating habits. I am not a self-conscious person and I don't care what other people think of my appearance. I have always had a smaller appetite and often have leftovers from restaurants.

My mom doesn't make it any easier for me. She often complains about ""Why am I even buying you food if you won't eat it?"" and other similar things. My brother even asked me if I was anorexic at one point (which I'm not). I want to have a larger appetite. I want to be able to eat more just to get them to stop. But at the same time, I'm scared of gaining weight because I don't think I'll be able to work it off.

I'm scared for my health at this point. With the health history in my family, I'm constantly worried that I'm going to die at a young age and I think my eating habits will only contribute to that problem. I want to fix this but I don't know how. I'm not hungry. Nothing sounds good to eat. I know there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is or how to fix it.

TLDR: I don't feel hungry despite hardly having eaten anything all day. I'm worried this could be linked to my anemia and potentially damaging to my health.",13Apr2019,1

I am going to be working on a project more for myself and my  portfolio than anything else, but I want to do it the best that I can.  The idea is a blog about my personal journey through a cybersec career.  After more thought I have decided to maybe expand on this idea to create  a single place for people to get up to date news, interviews with  career professionals, certification info, career pathways, forums, etc.  Still a very new idea and in its infant stages but because of my passion  for the field I want to take it on as a personal project and just see  what happens. I have been playing around with some naming ideas and  focusing on keywords/hot words related to the industry but I am no  business//marketing guru. Just wondering what you all could come up  with!

He confided in me today and broke down crying saying he really wants to wear one. Also he explained in detail that it has to be those skinny ones, not like a summer skirt. I told him that these feelings are real and that we should explore them and see how he feels afterward. I also told him he should hide how he feels both to me and others. I think he’s just very scared at how people will react to him at school. School is pretty rough at this age, as kids can be little shit heads at this age group. 

So I think he may be gay, which I’m going to support him no matter what, or he just might like to cross dress? I think he still likes girls, he hasn’t talked about liking boys at all or anything.

100,"I've come to notice I become very attached to the person that I spend most of my time with. It started with my mom, then carried over to 2 of my romantic relationships and currently I can see it creeping into my newest friendship and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

I can see the flags and the warnings when I'm about to become super attached. Suddenly I want to know where they went, what they were doing, and if I can't get this info out of them I feel terrible, as if they were trying cut me off when I know that's not what's happening at all.

This thing started with my mom. Whenever she went out at night she would come back home late, and if I asked she wouldn't tell me where she went. This would always make me very upset because all a child wants is to spend time with their parents, that was not the case for me (my mom was either out working or partying and my dad left us when I turned 6, he kept in touch over phone calls). Then these feelings got stronger when I got into my ""first relationship."" I wanted to get to know them better, I would text them every now and then but no reply. This time around the person who I was dating was just flat out ignoring me for some reason, even though we were going out as a couple and shit. This ended badly, I was left hurting knowing the person only wanted nudes and sex from me, never really liked me for me at all (never sent them pictures anyway, that's why we broke up). I started realizing I had a problem when I got into my ""second relationship."" I knew I was being possessive and controlling. I wanted to know who they were talking to, what they were doing and when they were doing it all the time. I realized what I was doing was wrong but couldn't quite figure out what part of it exactly was the wrong part.

Some of it is my feelings, me wanting to know the other person is doing fine and all the lines in between. The other part is me trying to control everything that happens so I don't get hurt again.

Which takes me to my current friendship. She is my best friend and I love her because she's honest with me. Is hard to find friends like that and I am really scared to lose her. I know I've been annoying her and I can't stop myself because this is who I am. I understand my actions today are a reaction to the actions of others towards me in the past, but I don't want to be this way anymore. I've been going to therapy for 2 years now, and taking pills but I can't seem to get any better.

103,"I didn’t know of where else I could post this so I figured I’d come here and see what advice you wonderful people give me.

So, I dated this girl for 2 years and I seriously loved her. I saw a future with her and everything. Out of nowhere, she broke up with me because she is moving soon and caught me completely by surprise. She said that she wanted to experience this new chapter of her life single, and meet new people. Okay cool, I dealt with it even though it crushed me, and I moved on. 

My best friend, I have known since high school. He’s been there for me through everything. Even through the breakup I went through with my ex. He’s like a brother for me. Now, they were friends as well, and knew each other through a place they used to work at. So they obviously talked but it never got to a intimate, emotion filled level. That was never an issue while her and I were together. 

Months have gone by since the break up, and I helped him get a job where I worked at because he desperately needed one. It was a sales job so there was some downtime every now and then. I remember a few times I would be sitting next to him and his phone would go off and I saw her name pop up on it with a ton of different emojis. At the time it confused me but it never bothered me. My ex would still text me every now and then, (she eventually realized that breaking up with me was a mistake and she wanted to get back together but I never went through with it), and I would ask her what the deal was with that just out of curiosity. She always said, “it’s nothing like that, I would never!!” And “omg I would never see him like that!” There were times where him and I would talk, and he always assured me that he would never do that to me. We were brothers and that was a line he would never cross according to him. So, I let it go, and then some more time went by, her and I eventually stopped talking completely. Then out of nowhere, I was made aware by friends that they started hanging out and going to parties together. I was very surprised, but I didn’t let it bother me. What really got me was a time shortly after that. There was a big concert coming to a nearby city so we made plans to go with friends and when I asked him if he bought his tickets he said he did, but for another city. 2 tickets I might add. He said he was taking another friend of his and I didn’t know what to think of it at the time and just let it go like it was whatever. I ended up finding out that he went to the concert with her, and I was more pissed at him than anything. I blew up on him and the next time I saw him it was not a pretty encounter. I was hanging out at my place with friends, and they had to take me outside before things got out of hand when he got home. He tried explaining things to me and I didn’t want to hear any of it. I honestly hate him for that and spending the whole weekend with her. Even more time went by and he texted me saying that they were talking on a more serious level, and that they will most likely begin dating. And that they did. The rest is history. I feel like I don’t want anything to do with him and just the sight of him makes me furious. Mainly because I feel like that’s a line you don’t cross with a so called, “brother.” He knows what I felt for this girl and how crushed I was when she broke up with me out of the blue. 

Which is how I ended up here, looking for advice. Am I overreacting when it comes to this? Should I be bothered by what he did?",13Apr2019,3
104,"Hi. My name is Alex and the issue I have is quite a strange one. First and foremost, let me start off by saying I know a lot of people. At any given time I could be messaging 15-20 people to do something, as sometimes they would all be messaging me. In this - I don't want this. Let me explain -

I work in the restaurant industry and I have an extroverted personality which can facilitate interacting with a lot of people on a deeper than superficial level, as I like to do. Nothing wrong with that right? Well, here's where the issue comes in. I love my personal time. I am not a lonely person. I may be naturally very extroverted, but if I'm not at work or out on the weekends, I love to be by myself. I am single and live by myself and I am very content with this. But, as I have said, I know a lot of people. It is very easy for me to interact on a deeper than superficial level with almost everyone I meet, and given the chance to, I enjoy doing this. The thing is, I only enjoy doing this for short amounts of time, with new people. I don't have many close friends, but again I am comfortable with this. I get a rush going out on weekends to clubs or bars and interacting with and meeting new people, but what I genuinely do not want is to create long term friendships. There are a few big reasons for this - I can get along with almost everyone. Literally. Put me in a room with someone and we'll have a lovely conversation that will go somewhere. I love hearing new stories, understanding new perspectives and all that. But because of this, I don't have the mental and physical capacity to develop friendships with all of these people. And again, I'm comfortable with that.

Sometimes when I meet new people, we might exchange Facebooks, numbers, etc. and this seems fun and dandy for me in the moment, but if I were to ask myself honestly if that's what I want, I'd be lying to myself if I said it was. I enjoy the time we are spending together in the moment, but I truthfully believe I wouldn't be interested in developing a few friendships over a long period of time. This is just my personality. I am very okay with being a social butterfly. 

The point to this whole post is that a lot of people I interact with want to do stuff with me. dozens a month want to hang out, maintain friendships, do different experiences - all which are great but I sincerely have no interest in exploring those avenues because I know for a fact I will have such an easy time meeting new people with equally as interesting lives. I am very comfortable being by myself and I don't want to  maintain the 30-50 friendships I could have over the course of a year, as I do every year. I have met hundreds of wonderful people but don't want to hang out or develop friendships with any of them.

Am I terrible for this? What is the appropriate course of action if some people consistently want to hang out but I have no interest? Obviously they get upset and may get insecure/create anxiety/hold a level of resentment towards me. I don't want this. I enjoyed the moments I may have spent with them but I love my social butterfly personality and don't want to hold on.

108,"So if you're reading this, you're in for a decent story. So let me put you all in perspective

I just turned 18. I've never had a job until about 2 and a half months ago. I work at a pizza place, and this job was special for me for multiple reasons. This job was to show my parents that I was ready for the responsibility of a car (my dad owned 3 and everyone else in my family owned 1. I own 0 and felt it was unfair since it was my 18th bday). Anyway this job was absolutely perfect at first. It was a close walk, minimum wage, and hours that adjusted to my schedule. The only thing which is a bonus was it was under-the-table. My friend who is a female vouched for me saying I'm in all honors/AP classes and I'm a good kid (I am in all honors and I'd like to think Im a good kid) and I was forever grateful. 

Anyway I've met the boss and everyone who works there. It was about a month after applying in which he called me and said I got the job. My first day I learned the basics and such. I was told I would be paid 7.50 an hour which was good for me (Thats our Minimum wage in my state). I was pretty happy because it really felt like everything was coming together. Anyway time passed. I've messed up a good amount. Basically my job included these things: Clean up front, cashier/phones, make salads/hoagies, mop the floors and ""flip"" all of the containers of food so they're in fresh boxes. It seemed pretty simple and it was! The only things I have problems with is hoagies and every now and than messing up an order. It wasn't big order mess ups, like it was things like they ask for mozzarella fries and I put cheese fries.   
Anyway I was told by my friend that after about 2-3 weeks of working there, you get a shop-shirt and you're officially working there. I also was to be put on nights by myself before receiving the shirts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now about two weeks ago is where I started my ""downfall'. Now I've been mostly doing phone calls and I'm very efficient with them. I can make salads very fast and equally as efficient. I've been working EVERY friday/saturday since I've been working there. I only make about 40$ a week and we're very busy. It really doesn't seem worth it but I do it anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks ago I was on a friday night basically by myself (I had another person equal to my position shadowing me to make sure I was doing good) and we usually have about 2-3 people of my position on. We only have 4 people in my position excluding the boss's wife. Anyway since I've never had much work with making hoagies, I was very bad with them. Two weeks ago (on a friday) I had about 6 hoagie orders in front of me. This is a lot for my position. We usually have 2 maximum in front of us on a busy night. I had 6. I was very sweaty and nervous because I was so out of position. The owner was watching me and I was oiling up a hoagie and my finger slipped and squirted oil on him. I was so upset about it, and he clearly was too, and I really couldn't handle it. They threw me on the phones for that night.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway ever since than I've been scared as hell to mess up. When I did, I was always so upset. This is about 2 months into this job. This brings us to today (April 12th Friday) where I was working. He had me stay later and inconvenience my family who was giving me a ride to clean a wall with dents. If this is hard to imagine, he wanted me to ""clean out"" a dent of a wall. For example, a dent in a car. No matter how much you scrub, you can't remove a dent (obviously). He wanted me to do that with a wall of them. I really didn't understand so I did an extremely crappy job. I than had to make bread/butters (which  is part of my normal job so its fine) and while I was doing my job, the co worker asked me a question and I responded which sparked a conversation, but I was getting my work done. The owner comes up to me and says ""\_\_\_\_ if you keep gibbering than I'm going to keep you an hour later) which would've been 10pm. My family member was to pick me up at 830, which this occurred at 9. I felt sort of threatened but also really upset because I made him angry (I'm very easy to manipulate so if he was upset I'd feel like I ""owe"" him to work for the next days).

&amp;#x200B;

Basically heres my decision I'm sure you all have been waiting for. Its been 2 and a half months, I don't have a shop-shirt which Im supposed to receive after 2 weeks. I haven't worked a single night by myself at all. I'm sort of ""scolded"" upon by him and the head-manager. The other manager really likes me (from what I know). I also had to work my 18th birthday and he wanted me to work my junior prom which I paid 80$ for already ,and was very angry when I said no I can't. I am also missing a spring-break long vacation to Florida at our beach house because I have to work. My decision I am faced with is that do I quit or stay for a little longer until I can drive? I would totally quit right now, but the thing holding me back is the friend that vouched for me. I was talking to her about it, and she said that I can't because she vouched for me. I told her she never lied to him, he just told him I was in all Honors/AP classes and a good kid. That's literally the only thing holding me back.",13Apr2019,1
109,"I was playing on my PS4 and I noticed a BIG ASS SPIDER crawling along my floor. I flipped the fuck out, my first instinct was to trap it(because had nothing to kill it with at the time).

112,"So...as the title suggests... I am a 29 year old female U.S. Marine Veteran currently about to finish premed undergrad and I have a girlfriend who is 25. Well her family is great. Her parents are very accepting and open except for her sister. Her sister is my age and cut off all contact with my girlfriend when we got together, not responding to any messages. 
She just had a baby and also recently stated that ""my girlfriend would never be around that child."" We are dumbfounded. Her and her husband are very radical right as well, well I know he is. He's always posting things about how women should be women again and in the kitchen, just alot of racist, sexist bullshit often. Her sister doesn't work at all and lives in a trailer that belongs to the family. My girlfriend's mother is extremely well of so everything gets paid for for them. We, on the other hand work very hard and I just made the Dean's list at my school and ultimately working to become a GP. We pay our bills on our own and have a beautiful cabin on a a couple of acres and a pond. We are doing really well for ourselves. 
The sister also likes to tell the mom that my girlfriend is a drug addict and that we are living up here in filth and nastiness?? It's mind-blowing. Our place is consistently cleaned spotless. I'm a former Marine so I know how to clean. 
Anyways, this is getting ridiculous and I'm tired of the rumors and shit she spreads. I've suggested multiple times bringing it up and calling them out but my girlfriend ""doesn't want to cause problems.""

114,"Lately, a lot has been piling up on me. I work two jobs and am a full time college student at a top 40 university. My dad is out of the picture and my mom isn’t able to support me financially in any way, she barely makes anything. I started in the fall with a good group of friends, but lately they’ve just been making me upset, and they don’t even seem to notice - or to care, more likely. Like yesterday, in the span of an hour, they all laughed at simply how I walk and one of them told me I was “copying them” just because I pronounced “Grecian” the the same way as they did. I had a speech impediment when I was little and I still pronounce certain words wrong because of it, so I listen to other people talk and pronounce difficult words the same way as them because they’re more likely to be right, given that. They made me feel so awful about it, even though saying something the same way as someone else is far from “copying” them. If I “copy” them, they make me feel insecure about it, but had I mispronounced the word, I would’ve been mocked for it. I know this because I’m still mocked by them for words I mispronounced months ago. 
Additionally, my roommate and I had a falling out at the end of last semester, and although we still are able to live together without conflict, I’m *always* on edge in my room. If I go to my room after class or work and the door is already unlocked because she’s in there, I always whisper “fuck” under my breath and feel disheartened. When I’m alone in the room and hear the door start to open because she’s coming in, my entire body tenses up. It’s bad. 
Lately, because of everything - feeling overwhelmed with my jobs and schoolwork, my friends, my roommate, and a generally sucky family situation - I’ve been having times where I start crying and my jaw tightens and my whole body tenses, and I feel like I can’t breathe. Similar “episodes”, for lack of a better word, have happened since I was 14 or 15 (I’m 19 now). It happens more when I’m overwhelmed or stressed out.
I just feel like what’s happening - not with my family, but with my friends and my roommate - is my fault. Like it’s because I’m not a good friend/roommate.

Can anyone give me some suggestions?

I do enjoy retreating to my room and reading/ watching a healthy amount of Netflix as well. I love food. I love all types of food. Mainly asian and mexican foods, but I like to have a lot of options. I don't think I'd like a huge city like NYC, but I also know living in a tiny town with nothing to do would kill me. I'm not big into shopping, but I don't wanna be so far away from anything that I can't go clothes shopping when I need to. I prefer to be close to the ocean, but as long as I'm near some good swimming holes that isn't a necessity. I'm more on the liberal side of politics but I am open to being around people who have opposing views.  I am queer, but in an opposite- sex relationship right now. Another thing about me, I'm kind of shy, and I'm trying to break out of that. So I'd love to be somewhere people are open to meeting others. Small towns like the one I'm in is really not a good environment for making friends.

123,"(On mobile so don’t expect perfection)

I have a septum piercing in my nose, and which will be important later.

So, me, my aunt, and my two younger sisters are at the beach right now for the weekend.

Last night, we went to the beach when it got dark and went crab hunting. As we were leaving the little restaurant/bar that you had to go through to get to the beach and from the beach, some old, probably drunk guys called to us as we were walking down the stairs. He said “hey, y’all wanna see a circus dog?” And basically threw his small dog down the stairs handle or whatever you call it (it’s late and I’m tired idk what it’s called lmao) and the poor dog slid down it and slowly walked back up the stairs, and it looked really uncomfortable. So the guy picks it up and hands it to my aunt really forcefully and says, “take her, you can keep her” as a ‘joke’. 

So we give the dog back, and they kept making ‘jokes’ about like giving the guy a dollar to pet his dog, dumb shit like that, and one of them comes over to me, a fifteen year old girl, already quite uncomfortable with the situation, and he kind of aggressively puts his hand on my shoulder and asks what’s in my nose to be funny. I told him, he laughed, and then said “I like the ones on the side of the nose, the uh, studs, you know?” And basically just WOULD NOT leave us alone. 

So what I’m asking is, what do I say to guys like them to get them to shut up or leave me alone? My mom always said to speak up and tell them not to touch me, but I’m too shy and scared of their reaction. How do I get over that?",13Apr2019,0

I have not even finished an associate's degree due to mental health issues and struggling with math.

I want to translate Japanese but keep being told by many people it's worthless, stupid, etc. and that you can't find a career in it. No careers bring me happiness or interest outside of art (which I'm trying to build a portfolio) or Japanese.

I wonder if it's too late to turn it around, because it is starting to feel like it. Every semester I get up and try again but end up falling behind even if I only take one or two classes. I just want to finish and make a decent living. 

I feel like so many people who have it worse would have done better things with what I was afforded, and they would have appreciated it so much more. Instead I stayed in my room and cried and used the money to pay bills while I thought of killing myself. I don't want to kill myself anymore, but there's an aching sadness from all the things I regret that seems to follow me around wherever I go.

My important exam just finished today and I was expecting to feel free, happy, energetic and relax. And yeah I did... for about 5 minutes. 

Until I just felt tired, annoyed, angry, sad. My mood was all over the place. I already noticed this happening for the past days... but it just really got to me today. 

Well, I guess part of this is because I’m just so fucking tired of people in my school. I don’t even know what’s happening anymore. One of my closest friends has just decided that me and my friend are not worth her time and she hangs out with other people all the time now. It was always the 3 of us but I guess it’s down to 2. She gave no explanation to anything. But I have a feeling she just doesn’t like the other friend... she’s normal and her usual self when with me, but when my other friend appears, she’s distant... and funny thing is that they were both inseparable. They had so much in common and suddenly now their friendship just died off and now I’m stuck in the middle.

And I guess because of all of this, I’m always annoyed with my friend too ( the 2 of us). It’s not that she’s a bad person, but sometimes she says things that just really gets on my nerves. 

I’m so mentally tired. I’m eating dinner and I want to burst into tears in front of my family. I feel so lonely. And isn’t it fucking great that maybe a month ago, I was having the best time. Everyone was united. We got along so well. I felt on top of the world.

And now I don’t know who to trust. I feel like everyone is fake.

131,"I'm not really good at writing these but I'm in a tough spot and I just really want this to land on some outsider ears. 

So I am a 3rd year apprentice Light Vehicle Mechanic in Western Australia. I am 23 years old and not that it should matter, I am a female. 

So backtracking, I started my apprenticeship at a car dealership because nothing else I applied for was interested in taking me on. It was a foot in the door atleast. I worked there for almost 3 years, basically learning to do the same task repetitively for months at a time. For example, there was a big air bag recall which had me changing vehicle airbags for 8 months. Needless to say, I felt like I wasn't really learning how to be a proper mechanic. Just a recall mechanic for a specific make of car. Which, in the real world, will get me nowhere. I like to know how things work and I wanted to know how cars work and how to make them work when they aren't working. I wasn't there for some female rights movement or as some inspiration to women alike. I just like cars. Yet, somehow I was constantly reminded of who I was and where ""I stood"".  I had other apprentices telling me I got treated better because I was a girl when the truth was I got treated well because I treated other people well. I  am a good person. But no one saw it that way. And it broke my heart. Anyway I kept pushing. This post isn't about depression but its something I do struggle with and that workplace just pushed me out big time so I decided to get in touch with apprentice support who helped out a great deal.

Another relevant note to this story is that I am a beer drinker and I would frequently go to the pub by myself just to unwind. I love meeting new people and hearing stories and expanding my horizons and the pub is great for that. So, while I was employed by the dealership, one afternoon I went to my local pub and met a couple a decent old fellas (like i usually do), and quickly learned these guys run a small mechanics workshop in the same suburb. Ben and Pete (changed the names for anonymity). Ben is a very Irish mechanic and Pete is a sweet talking ex car salesman. They were great to chat to. I told them about my situation at work and Ben told me if I ever wanted to learn how to properly fix a car that I was welcome to swing by after work or on Saturdays to get in some proper experience before I qualify.  It is common knowledge that a qualified dealership mechanic is completely different than a qualified small workshop mechanic. And I didn't want to be a limited qualified dealership mechanic. I wanted to take my knowledge from the dealership and ability to work efficiently and apply it to a small workshop job to really expand my knowledge and qualify with the confidence I need. 

I also do graphic design and other arty things in my spare time. Which I also love but wouldn't want to pursue fulltime (I am a very logical and practical person who believes you don't really make it in art unless youre dead. And I'm not ready to be dead). 

Anyway, I stayed in contact with Ben and Pete. Closer friends with Ben as he is the younger one, Pete being older and a bit more old fashioned. Long(er) story short, I visited the fellas a couple times, made a logo for their business and did them some other graphic design jobs to help their business properly get off the ground. 
Then one day when I had had enough of the dealership I contacted Ben and asked him if he could take me on to complete my apprenticeship. I had seen the way he works and I really appreciated him as a person and a teacher. He ran everything past Pete (being the money guy) and they left me hanging without an answer for weeks so I spoke to my apprenticeship counsellor and she told me I could transfer to a part time apprenticeship and do my design the rest of the time. So I could chase all my dreams at once. Sounded like a golden opportunity.
So I contaced Ben again and proposed this idea to him. I also said I would pay for my own schooling. Took a bit of back and forths but they finally agreed and took me on. I was so happy. 

So I quit the dealership and took a few weeks to get my graphic design gig off the ground properly, got some customers under my belt, and then got started working with the guys. It was just the 3 of us. A lot of coffee and some 1 on 1 training. It was perfect. Exactly what I needed. The only downside was I had no real timesheet system. I was told my hours were 26 a week. I would work monday, wednesday, thursday and friday and my tuesdays are my school days. School that I have to pay for. School that I dont get paid to go to. Leaving me no time to design except for half some early finish days and night times and weekends. I was desperate for the job though so I let it slide. 

There were some flaws with the place like a lack of communication between Ben and Pete, leaving me im the dark a lot. And also Pete didn't really do anything but sweet talk the customers. Which is helpful.  So I had to learn the whole computer system, how to write invoices, how to order parts, how to price jobs, how to talk to customers, how to take payments, send emails, all that good stuff. Stuff I'd never done before but it was important information for a job like this and I enjoyed learning it as well as learning how to take engines apart and diagnose different smells and smokes and sounds. I was even cleaning cars and sweeping floors. I got to do everything, it was great. Pete never said much. He was always so quiet. Sometimes Ben would talk behind Petes back about this and that. Typical workplace behaviour. 

Then all of a sudden, Ben had to go to jail. A bad part of his past had caught up with him and he had to pay his debts to society. So he went to jail. It sucked being left without a mentor. I thought I would lose my job. I thought Pete would just sack me, sell the place and move to Bali. But he didn't. We sat down and had a huge talk .  It turns out Ben had taken thousands of dollars from the business to pay for cars and lawyers and takeout food and he never paid it back. He left us $4000 in debt before he went to jail (its a lot for our little business). Pete told me every little wrong doing the Ben had done and how its all only surfacing now. We made a decision to find another qualified mechanic and to change the way this place was run. I told him that I was serious about the workshop and I would do my part but I also told him that my graphic design business was really important and I need to not put it on the backburner like I had been because I was so broke and it was my only way to make up being on a part time apprentice wage. I also demanded full transparency. I said the only way the workshop would work would be if we were all open and honest. No more talking behind eachothers backs and keeping secrets. He agreed. 

So we took on a guy called Danny who was also irish and needed a sponsorship so Pete took him on at a good deal rate so that he could also help him with his sponsorship. Danny is great and I love having him there. He respects me and teaches me well. 

But since having Danny there I've noticed Pete start to show his true colours. He calls every woman that comes through that place a 'tart' (behind her back ofcourse). And hes made me teach him the computer system which I was happy to do. But since he has learned it a bit he has started to really attack me for some of the things I do. He says I am organised like a woman, all over the place and that I need to be more organised like him. Linear. But that was a lie, he inputs random stuff in the system, he spells peoples names wrong, inputs the wrong car details, doesn't get any contact details for customers, remembers their names wrong and embarrasses me when I go called them the wrong thing. He knows a lot of people personally and has a story for every person that walks through that place. Then when I write up an invoice hes like 'how could you charge debbies uncles goats second cousins psychologist that much, shes done so much for me'. Or 'if youre gonna charge him that much how do you expect me to pay your wages'. I literally charge every customer in a fair way that allows for profit and helps us keep our doors open without hurting the wallet too much. He also told me to stop itemising my invoices so people don't know exactly what theyre paying for, apparently they complain when they see labour times and rates. But I know we have a cheap labour rate. Honesty with the customer is key. But like I said, he's a sweet talking salesman. And I'm a woman who is always wrong. Not to mention I only get paid $400 a week and ever since I started making my hours match my wage he has gotten real salty towards me. He keeps telling me he should dock my pay for days off. I have to keep reminding him that I only get paid for 26 hours. Then he goes and has a senior moment where he undercharges a $600 job by $500 simply because of a computer typo. 
One more thing, Danny will suggest ways of doing services to Pete and Pete will relay them to me and it'll be something that I was already doing, but because pete isnt a mechanic, he doesn't notice. Then he goes and buys a product that we already own and says we need to start using this for so and so. but we already did that. 
He sees Danny as the mechanic I'll never be and its really annoying. Danny is so respectful to me and doesn't stand up for me (and I dont expect him to). But having no on visibly on my side is just making me look like an unneccessary liability at that place. 

Pete has even stopped giving me a beer after work. He used to always sit down with me and have a beer but now he only brings on in for Danny. Sometimes in front of my face. Sometimes he says 'what are you still doing here' at the end of the day. I just don't get it. 

Sorry this story was so long and so jumbled near the end. I'm getting really worked up typing it. I could honestly type this one out for hours. 
I just need to know if he is treating me different because I am a girl. I'm at my breaking point soon. I asked politely if I could use the workshop this weekend to fit an exhaust to my boyfriends car and all he replied was 'sorry no'. I know for sure he would have let Danny go in. He never turns down an opportunity to have the workshop doors open for walk ins to book a job in. 

I'm so stuck. Did I just move from one miserable job to another or are all men just opposed to women wanting to learn the same stuff? I honestly don't understand. Now I'm broke and sad and to add to it, doc says im iron deficient. Another wonderful aspect of being a woman.

I'm feeling pretty burnt out on school and life in general. I'm a junior in college and I'm an education major. My particular field of education is notorious for being pretty difficult because we have so many credit hours we have to take and everything is so time consuming. I'm at a point where I'm just tired of it. I can't find the motivation to go to class or do my homework. It's wrecking my grades. I was a Deans List student last year and now I'm making C's mostly. I'm dealing with some other personal stuff which kind of contributes to my general state of being burnt out as well. I went to a counselor and she wasn't much help. It was a super uncomfortable experience and I couldn't really open up. When I tried to speak she always seemed confused by what I was saying. She let me go after two sessions because she didn't think I needed her help anymore. I left feeling super unsatisfied. 

I can't find motivation to do anything except go to the gym and cook. Cooking is a chore and I don't want to do it, but I can't afford to eat out all the time and it's unhealthy to do so, so I force myself to cook. If I had the means to eat out everyday, I would. I find no joy in cooking for myself like I used to and I don't even find much enjoyment in food anymore. My old hobbies like piano and learning German are things I no longer find joy in either.

I don't remember when it started. I don't remember how it started. After my stepmom and my dad got married at some point, it all started. I remember the first time they left us alone, he told me people were breaking into the house and the only way to stop them was for him to throw me in the air and catch me. I was younger than 6 so I believed him and let him do it. I think this was him testing my obedience to him. I think he was testing how much I told my parents when they asked me what we did while they were gone.

He began to tell me more stories my young self believed. He told me everynight, monsters would come and try to kill me and he would have to fight them to save me. He said they were going to kill me unless I had a forcefield, and the forcefield was inside him. The only way to get the forcefield was for me to suck it out of him. His Penis was where it was. I believed him. It happened many times, almost every time we were alone, after each time I would ask him if I was safe and he kept telling me not yet. I was so young and so innocent and so trusting I believed every word he said. 

This eventually turned to more. He would began beating me, touching me, and doing terrible things for seemingly no reason, without any warning. It would just start. I was too scared to tell. He told me if I told, he would kill me. At this point, I was ashamed. My dad always talked about gay people and hell, so I didn't want him to know. 

It got worse, so much worse. He began to tell me he needed to look at me to make sure I was healthy. He tricked me into bending over naked. I was raped. It hurt. Alot. It happened many times. Each time he would tell me I was going to hell because I was gay. I cried everytime. During and after. I told him it hurt and he said he didn't care. He was so much bigger than me. He was 6 years older than me and he's always been bigger than me, so it was easy for him to force me into these situations. He would tell me if I told anyone he would kill me, but there was no way I was telling anyone at that point. I was so ashamed. I couldn't tell my parents, I couldn't tell anyone. I was terrified of going to my dad's house. I would cry everytime. I felt bad because my dad thought it was because I loved my mom more but it was because I was being raped by my step-brother whenever we were alone.

This went on for too long. I let it happen for too long. One day, he came into my room and pointed a gun at me. He told me I needed to tell him 3 reasons why he shouldn't shoot me. I was terrified. I was 10 years old.  After about an hour of him sitting on a chair and pointing a rifle at me, my stepmom came home and he ran to put the gun back. We all went bowling that night. I cried in the bathroom. I knew I couldn't live like this anymore.

My grandpa died that summer. I couldn't stand the thought of him looking down from heaven and seeing his grandson living like that. I knew it was time for it to stop. I told my dad two things. I told my dad about the gun incident, and that he beat me when we were alone. My dad took care of that and made sure of it that I never was alone with him again. But I never told him about the sexual abuse I went through. I don't know if I'll ever be able I tell him. 

This was over 10 years ago. My family is still in contact with him. I'm tired of being scared and angry. I lay awake at night and feel unsettled he got away with it, I want to take action. I don't know where to start",13Apr2019,1

143,"To preface, I am a adult female in her 20s. I have been single for a year now and im moving to a new city. I am putting myself out there on online dating again (mostly tinder) and I am wondering if i should put in my bio that I have high libido. To clarify, i wouldnt put it out there so bluntly - I would have a normal bio/dating profile and then I would put in ""i am HL"" or ""-HL""  so I wouldnt be advertising it to the world - anyone interested could ask me privately and I could explain what HL stands for. 

I think it would be good to specify this because I am looking for a long-term relationship and I want a partner who is HL like me or atleast supportive of my needs. I was with my ex for 3 years prior and the first year we had sex 3-6 times a day which slowed down to 0-2 times a day after that. It ended up causing a lot of emotional problems in the relationship (for me) because our sex life declined in many ways and I felt undesirable and unloved. 

I think it could be bad because most men believe a woman who has a high sex drive is the greatest fantasy - until they settle down and realize this is not a phase this is the rest of our lives (I am not interested in having kids at all so the sex station will be up and running till my sex drive potentially dies in my +70s, who knows)

Maybe im spending too much time on relationship subreddits and overthinking it but I really think this is important for my future partner to know about me before getting too serious. So, any advice?

So I just found out that my friends aunts dog died today, for the record none of us like her aunt and that entire side of the family is just completely awful and horrible people. However she lives right next to my friend and so interaction amongst everyone is inevitable. With that being said we loved her dog. He was so fucking sweet and just such a kind good dog and I always felt so fucking bad for him because they were just so awful to him. Yelling, screaming, hitting, he always had a shock collar on and would get shocked for absolutely everything, literally for wanting attention he would be shocked. He was just so horribly abused and I just felt so fucking awful. He was only about 3 and a half mind you. 3. He shouldn’t be dead right now. But they knew he had been drinking out of the toilet with Clorox bleach tablets in it for several days. Not once did they stop him.  “It’s his own dumb decision” they literally just were saying and laughing yesterday. Fucking yesterday and laughing. And clearly he was very sick for the several days THAT THEY KNEW HE WAS DOING THIS. And they never stopped him, they never took him to the vet, nothing. Fucking nothing. And as of today he is dead. I’m so fucking pissed and I’m crying because I’m obviously very upset and I’m so pissed. I just don’t know right now. I just needed to rant I’m really upset I’m sorry.

- know area more than city 2: w/ grandparents there, we’ve spent a lot of time there
- big, well known city

City 2
- different state: 3.5-4 hrs away
- cousin my age whom I’m pretty close w/ lives there
- smaller city
- only been a couple times, so don’t know area as well

151,"I'm a 19 yo female btw.

In short, I grew up being raised by a narcissist who left a lot of mental damage on me and once I escaped from that I walked straight into a relationship with a sociopath. I also grew up being aggressively bullied and had no friends + being autistic so my social skills and stability around others are AWFUL. My first year of uni has been ruined by my ex inducing trauma too. I self harm a decent amount to calm my anxiety and have tried killing myself a few times. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder too and the meds I've been on have only ever made things worse.

I'm sick of being a mentally damaged hermit, I'm frustrated at everything and I am very negative because I lack positivity anywhere in my life. People I do interact with say I'm gifted at everything I try, get called a genius a lot and have been called very pretty by everyone who's commented on how I look yet I'm too insecure and traumatised to listen, trust and act on anything people tell me. I also always fuck up with others due to my terrible social skills and emotional instability.

I want to fix myself desperately, but I lack the energy or motivation these days to do anything more, I've tried psychological help and medication and they haven't worked, I'm too emotionally overwhelming for getting new friends to help, a better diet feels impossible because I've had issues with anorexia before and physically can't eat more than one meal a day, can't eat anything when stressed.

152,"I don’t know what to do. My mental health has reached a point I am so scared of. I made an appt to see a psychologist, and today my GP prescribed 75mg Wellbutrin that she wants me to start immediately. 

My spouse is very supportive of everything I’m doing to try to help myself, except for taking the Wellbutrin. It’s a firmly held stance that they do not think psychotropics help, only hinder, and if a doctor thinks I should be on meds then they are basically being lazy in their care for me. Depression also runs rampant in my family, not at all in theirs. They are very much the “going for a brisk walk will fix most things” type of person, because for them it *does*.  With strong enough willpower, anyone can do anything. There is zero maliciousness in their opinion. Just a very matter of fact POV based on personal experience.

They are my best friend and biggest cheerleader. We’ve been together 10 years, married, have kids and a house. I love them today as much as the day I met them, and vice versa. I respect that decisions made in a marriage should be shared decisions, and if they put their foot down about this then I will respect it. 

I’m just so, so tired. I can’t claw my way out of this hole any more. I’m scared that I do need antidepressants. I’m scared my brain has some crossed wires and all the talking in the world isn’t going to help on its own. I don’t know what to do.

155,"Okay so this is complicated. I’m a 16 year old girl (turning 17 soon) and one of my best friends is this guy who’s 18 right now. We’ve been friends for over a year and we’ve gotten really close recently. The whole time I’ve known him he’s identified himself as gay. He clearly like boys. Basically our whole friendship, I’ve liked him. And I didn’t want to, because obviously I knew nothing would ever happen because he’s gay. And I’m a girl. But we had a conversation once where he told me that he really only said he’s gay because that’s what he’s always said. Like it was an identity he was given (by his mom) and that it didn’t really fit. He told me then that he had liked girls in the past but he didn’t know how to go about it in the future because they all thought he was gay. I asked him about this months later and he kinda blew it off, like he either changed his mind or really didn’t want to talk about it. 

But our friendship is complicated. We do things that people might say is dating. We go out at least once a week- and we do a lot of stuff. Mostly it’s shopping or going to the gym. Sometimes we go to dinner. He always wants to take me to movies. A lot of the time, we drive around just so we can see the night sky. And to me, that seems romantic. But I really don’t know if he sees it that way. 

I’ve kept this secret for over a year now and it’s getting to the point where I think it’s affecting our friendship. I know I should tell him, but I’m scared. Not only is it scary because I don’t know how he would react, it also could be bad for him. If there’s this whole part of his sexuality he’s been hiding from himself, I don’t want him to have to face if it he’s not ready. But at the same time, he was ready over a year ago. So I don’t know. 

I don’t really know what I want out of this post. I guess just second opinions. What do you think I should do? Should I tell him? How would I tell him? How do I go about it in a way that won’t jeopardize our friendship? Thanks",13Apr2019,1

157,"Before I start sorry for the poor formatting, I’m on mobile. TLDR at bottom.

So I got a job in a bar in my city centre and I’ve been in it for two weeks now. Generally I work either through the day or on a weeknight. During these times we have the music at a comfortable level and i can hear everything fine. The problem comes on a weekend night; I can’t hear people’s orders over the music which we turn up to a much higher volume. Because of this I end up making mistakes such as tonight I thought someone wanted a vodka sling (after I asked to repeat 3 times) which I took to be a variation of a Singapore sling but with vodka instead of gin. What she actually wanted was a vodka and slimline tonic. It’s like I can hear the sounds people are making when ordering but the sounds don’t make sense as words in my head. 

My question is: 
                               Is there any way that I could do to practice with or improve my hearing, or any devices that I could buy to single out voices over the music?

Any and all help or advice would be much appreciated. I don’t want to leave this job as it’s taken me so long to find a job and I can’t imagine there are many other jobs I could find that would be much different at this point in time.

I half so see this point.. But I am pretty sure I also agree with being mindful of what slips your tounge around others.

159,"I just turned 35 and realize that I have wasted the best years of my life. I'm financially stable but I am working a job that I don't like. I've never had a girlfriend and live by myself. I've only been on 2 real dates after college and none of them lead to an actual relationship. Most of my friends are married now or atleast have a boyfriend or girlfriend to come home to.

I'm not depressed but I'm just not happy with my current life. And I blame myself for it. In my teens and 20s I didn't really make enough effort to take care of myself (eat healthy, go to the gym, etc.), which is what gave me confidence problems. So I never felt like any woman would like me and also I didn't meet any close friends. I barely pass college but got my degree and found a job that I don't like anymore. I would always procrastinate and put things off. For example when I turned 21 I said I would start eating healthier and taking care of myself more but that only lasted like a month and I gave up.

Part of me now feels like I still have hope, but everyday I still feel like I'm already past my prime and so I have almost zero motivation to turn my life around. I feel mixed emotions now. I feel like I should just accept my life as it is but I also don't want to. I want to lose weight, find a job i enjoy, get married, and maybe start a family. What do I do? How do I find motivation?

160,"I am a senior in high school, and throughout my education I have been incredibly secluded and antisocial, not by choice. I am incredibly intelligent and conservative which has always fueled disconnect between me and my peers.

What can I say, I'm bored. I'm tired of staying inside during the weekend. I'm tired of scrolling through Instagram and seeing all the fun stuff people are doing, unable to relate. I am bored. I am depressed. I am lonely.

I've had friendships, and continue to have them, but very few. And all of them have way more friends than I do, which makes things weird. So upon arriving at University (one 300 miles from my current peers) I think I'm going to change myself. Here's some things that absolutely repulse me, yet actions I plan to adopt in the next few months

1. I will make as many shallow unstructured friendships as I can with whoever I can. 

2. I will attend parties and (at least act) drunk and stupid. Do shots, take hits, and inevitably wind up dancing on a table or jumping out of a second story window.

3. I will act stupid 100% of the time.

4. I will start sending sTrEaKs to hundreds of people on Snapchat who I barely know.

5. I will lower my voice and say ""bruh"" a lot.

6. Maybe I'll get a juul?

7. I'll try to post something amazing on Instagram at least once a month.

8. I'll probably lose my V card to some hoebag in a car

9. I will become a gym rat and actually get in reasonable shape (probably a good outcome to all this actually, something I'm excited about)

To me, this is the only way to really live at my age. This isn't what I want but what I've tried the past 13 years hasn't worked. Something needs to change. I'm tired of being that guy. I want some excitement in my life, I want a girlfriend, I'm tired of everyone hating who I am. If you have anything to add on to my new persona, feel free! If you think there's another way, I'm all ears, but I doubt it. 

Before you come raging at me about how I should love myself and be myself and not pretend to be anything else, shut up. You don't know what it's like. I am honestly so depressed and have been most of my life. My best friends are my parents and my parents' friends. It's time to cut that shit out. Time to get a better life.

My worry is that this has clearly been on her mind for some time and she might seriously try and get some from another source. I told my parents, because we have awesome parents that are not just going to go yell at her for thinking about taking drugs, or completely overreact. They understand how stressed she is and they understand why people turn to drugs in hard times. (My moms bother is a heroine addict, and I abused weed through my teenage years and ended up with CHS which is when you have so much thc in your system it becomes toxic) I just wanted them to know so they could keep an eye out for any signs of her acting different, and for them to understand and be sympathetic toward the amount of stress being put on her, and put on by herself. I feel I made the right decision, but is there anything else I can do to help her out? Or are there any major signs I should look for in someone taking this drug?

Yours truly is 17

So I’m.... not great at relationships. I normally get myself hurt because I trust too easily, and my last one ended because I refused to have sex with him cause I wasn’t ready. Now, some background, I’m 80% a lesbian. And my current boyfriend is pretty damn gay too; but we’re straight for each other so it works.

I’m scared to do anything sexual with him, like below the belt, because of how abusive my last boyfriend (one of the reasons I prefer girls) treated me in hat area. It’s not that I don’t WANT to, trust me I do, but I’m scared he’ll get bored and abandon me or I’ll do something wrong and he’ll get mad.

His parents already asked us if we’ve slept together, and my parents have done the same. It kinda hurts my feelings that they think I’d rush into sex like that, and that they think I’d give up my virginity after only a month of dating. But that brings me to my confession. I don’t know how long a couple is supposed to wait before they do that, all my other relationships were rushed, forced, short, or Heaven forbid online; so this has never been something I’ve even considered putting on the table.

Am I being too cautious? Am I supposed to be ready for sex after a month? We hang out every day after school, and I genuinely love him, but I’m still scared.

166,"Time is running out for me and someone whom I've had a crush on for what's been almost three years. I'm a junior in high school while she's graduating from high school this year, and even worse, all seniors leave school earlier than everyone else on May 3rd, so I don't have much time left to confess feelings. So I've come on here to ask for advice on what to do. So the past couple years, me and her have only been in one class together for all three years of high school we've gotten to share together and that's through the school band. She sings in the band, and I play guitar and I've been the lead guitar player for two years. I've wanted to walk up to her and start conversation with her for all that time, and I ended up not doing so until this year. I'm gonna skip all that happened the first two years because my feelings for her didn't really begin until this year, and also when I started becoming interested in her I noticed some other people in her life whom I assumed were better than me and more.

So for privacy of everyone, I'll keep all names private because they are all unimportant. So throughout this year, I began learning more and more about her. My feelings for her began to show when I noticed she looked much more beautiful than what I remembered, it could have been the busy summer break I had that made me forget about how attractive she was. But no matter what hit me, when we returned in August something about the way she looked made my stomach drop and crash like nothing else I've felt. Like deadass drop-dead gorgeous. 

I don't know where else to put this in the story, but I should mention that I have social anxiety because of past experiences with bullying, physical, verbal and cyber bullying and my mental position has been worn out for years. back to the story.

As I mentioned, I'm a guitar player, she's a singer in our band, and I didn't know that much about her and her relationships with everyone else in the band, but there's another guitar player in the band who is good-looking for a dude who seemed to be close to her. I'd seen her posts on social media, and when I first saw them, I automatically assumed they were in a relationship. Like he took her to prom of the prior year, and they looked and acted like a real couple in those photos. But as the year went on, I noticed he didn't really hang out with her in the hallways as much as I thought he did, which made me think she was single. Then, towards the end of September 2018, there was homecoming dance, which was the first social event I ever went to in high school, and I went on a whim.

I genuinely had the most fun there, I got really hyped up, being a musician and a guitar player, with a different definition of ""fun"" to everyone else there, I got some friends to lift me up and get me to start crowdsurfing, which was the first time I did that, and at the end of it all, I shared a couple of dances with her (even though I don't have any clue how to dance or anything of that sort) but I went REALLY out of my comfort zone, and even asked for a picture with her on the spot. 

The day after, we played a gig together with our school band, and we interacted with each other, and I don't know if it was just me and my feelings building up, but there was an electric connection between us. We were the only ones in the band who had any clue what stage presence was and how to have fun on stage, so we'd look like idiots while everyone else would stand around and hold their instruments and stand and play. There was one time where I had a long guitar solo in the show, and she had gone out to the audience to watch. I did a couple of stage tricks to be entertaining (it was a two minute long solo and those are boring to watch) like playing behind my head, on my knees, etc. and I remember looking up and seeing her seeing her face with this large smile, and her in front of the stage jumping and screaming for me and there was just something about that that gave me the biggest smile inside.

Shortly after that performance, I got a text on my phone from her, and she was saying that she wanted to head into a local studio to record two of her songs for her college application. And me, being someone who rarely gets invited anywhere by anyone, much less someone who I just love being around and love the energy they bring me, I accepted the offer. We spend multiple days in the band room during study halls preparing for the studio so we didn't have to pay too many costs, and we planned to perform together at a student-organized performance at my school they call the ""coffee house."" So we planned that out, practiced, went into the studio, and recorded her songs. The two days we had together in the studio after school were two of the best days of my year. I remember looking at her and getting this electrifying feeling inside me thinking I wanted to make a move, and in fact I asked if she wanted to go somewhere to eat after, but I don't remember what happened but she said no, likely because she probably already had plans (she has a lot more friends than just me), so I didn't think much of it. 

But after that, our connections really increased, we didn't talk much personally, we texted some, etc. She came to some and maybe most of my gigs outside of school, which I was thankful for.

Now here's where another kicker comes in, and why I've not confessed yet at all.

She has another friend (who is a girl) who I quite honestly don't know her relationship with her at all. Like for all I know, they could be dating, they could be really, really, really close friends. Like the friend will very openly rest her head on my crush, and there would rarely be a time outside of class you wouldn't see them together. I never wanted to ask them if they were in a relationship because 1. I didn't want to give my feelings away, 2. I didn't want it to seem obnoxious or offend them or anything, 3. I just didn't work up the balls to ask if they were dating anyway. But one day, my crush posted a picture of her at a pride thing, and that's when I brought in the possibility she might be bisexual, or she could just be supporting it. I was pretty convinced she was for a while because one of my friends I know from outside of school got a job at the same place my crush worked at shortly before she quit. What that friend said is that my crush's co-workers said she was gay. 

But then, she went to winter formal with a guy from another school. I'd never seen her with this guy, so for all I knew it could be a boy she was going out with, but I never heard anything more about him.

So life went on, l was (and still am) confused about whether or not she is in a relationship with the girl I mentioned in one of the above paragraphs.

Fast forward to about nine days ago, we had our very first conversation together. It got really real and I honestly could have shot my shot then. We talked about her graduating soon, how little time we had left together, our backgrounds, our pasts, and it lasted over an hour. And if I could talk about that shit to her forever I would. We've made some possible plans to hang out at each other's houses to play music together with the time we have remaining. So this is where the advice part comes in.

**Should I shoot my shot or should I keep the good friendship going with no risk of possibly losing her or the close connection I have finally made with her?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I (junior in high school, same age as a senior) have a crush on a girl who is a senior at school (so I got 3-4 weeks left with her at school) who may or may not be bisexual, and if she is, she's really close to a friend who is also a girl. We both play music and there is an electrifying connection between us. She has invited me to do things with her, and we've connected really well on stage. We've recently started talking personally, and I'm not sure about whether or not she is in a relationship with her close friend who is a girl. I'm not sure whether or not to confess feelings to her or not, and time is running out.**

168,"Hey y’all. I’m new to reddit so please forgive me if I make a mistake or something, I’m still trying to figure out how it works. A friend suggested I post on here so that I could get an unbiased opinion on what to do because I have very different opinions among my friends. 
Buckle up, it’s a long one. 
So I’ve known my best friend (let’s call him F) for about 4 years now. Let me start off by saying I really never felt anything or thought anything could happen. He was voted most handsome and was quite popular while I am a -6/10 . I’ve only started having feelings for him about a year ago. We’ve been pretty close and he’s told me things that he has never told anyone, not even his friends of 8+ years. Also, when he left the country for Uni, I was the only one out of everyone he met up with and said goodbye to (he’s very close with my mom so we had breakfast with him; she had to pretty much pry him off me because he stayed hugging me for a long time and would not let go). Not even his longest friends. 
Anyway, when I realized I had feelings for him was when I saw one of my friends (let’s call her T) try to start something with him. Everyone always told F and I that we looked and acted like a couple because he followed me everywhere and always had to be touching me; whether it was standing close to me, hand in my back, sitting close to me, anything. I always denied it but F never said anything, whether pro or against it. 
Anyway, He had just gotten out of a pretty bad long term relationship (she knew this very well and we all told her it wouldn’t end well)  and he pretty much used her as a rebound (I know this because he told me later). He had told me when he broke up his relationship (I was the only one he told) and I helped him through it. However, he never told me about what was going on with T; I found out from one of my friends (let’s call her S) while they were all on a trip (I was going but had to cancel last minute because a family emergency arised) and I was really sad. I know this was very childish but I ignored him. The first day they left, he called me first thing when they arrived but I ignored it. Over the course of the trip (one week long) he texted me at least twice a day but I never answered. When they arrived back, I had agreed to get breakfast with S so I waited for her at the gates of the airport. He saw me first and ran to hug me and would not let go at all. He kept asking me why I ignored him and even gave me gifts he’d bought me. 

One other thing to note is that T was very jealous. A year prior to this, She had gotten really nasty with me when a guy she previously liked asked if he could take a picture with me while at a party; mind you, I said no and made it clear I was not interested. However, she got so nasty that I actually left and our other friends got pissed at her and said that it wasn’t my fault. A few month prior to this, T had also gotten really nasty and temporarily ended her friendship with another friend (C) because a guy T was interested in liked C. Keep in mind that C did not pursue anything with this guy at all because she didn’t want trouble with T. Anyway, I forgave T and while they were on this trip, she sent me pictures of them two together (F and her) every day; I only replied once to say “cute picture” and then didn’t reply at all anymore; also only S knew that I had feelings for him and she didn’t like T (or F either actually) at all so she didn’t say anything. 
Anyway, a bunch of stuff happened over the months, including that everyone tried to talk F out of going out with T because she was super into him and seeing things for the long term (she called him the love of her life when they had been talking for 2 weeks) while he was just playing around (they were never official; they just went out but he always said he was single and he wouldn’t be tied down, even in front of T) 
Our friends asked me to talk to him and I did for about 5 minutes (I was really emotional and cried a bit). He said that if it made me upset, he would break it off with her straight away. He then hugged me and said he loved me (he also ran way immediately after that; he had also only said I love you to his previous gf , the one in the bad relationship) which he’d never said before because he is not affectionate with words at all.  His long term friends were extremely surprised and said,” wow, he does really care about you”. 
Long story short, he didn’t because he didn’t break it off with her. They kept seeing each other and he would only tell me how she was annoying, he didn’t like her, etc but never told me how they’d already kissed and stuff. 
I started distancing myself and started dating and that bothered F a lot. It ended up with T being super jealous because he always chose me over her in things and things that happened (Example: F drove for an hour to my house and surprised me with food while he never went out with T because he claimed he didn’t have money; I never called him to do these things and would tell him to not piss her off and just go out with her) and he was jealous when I was with other guys (F was also very protective of me and he didn’t care for T at all really; he once said to his friends,” if I was her (me)  dad, I don’t know how I’d protect her (me) from guys. “ when his friend asked why he would struggle, he said,”I mean Just look at her, dude”. His friends would jokingly hit on me because they liked pissing him off). 
T started saying I was a slut and saying that F had told her how I was jealous and stuff like that ( mind you, F would always send me like 7 messages because sometimes he would text me and I wouldn’t reply so he’d keep texting me until I did; he would also always text me after we hung out and say he had a good time, etc. I never texted him first unless it was for school and never made any move that I was jealous; I bottled everything in). My friends stood up for me (keep in mind, I never let him hug me or anything, especially in front of T, &amp; told him to leave me alone and stuff, which often made him mad). I got pissed at F and pretty much told him that I didn’t appreciate him lying to my friends nd causing trouble and blocked him. He later found out what happened from a mutual friend and completely cut off contact with T, which left her very heartbroken (I do admit I still feel really bad about that to this day). 
About 2 months later, F called my mom and asked if she could bring me to breakfast; he would treat. We had not spoken at all during this time, although he had tried asking my friends if they could let him know when I was home so that he could surprise me but none of them relented. 
Anyway, Even after all that happened, my mom loved him because he didn’t have a good family at all so she pretty much adopted him (also keep in mind, F always called himself my brother but the ways he always hugged/touched/ treated me and things he said made all my friends/my own family tell me that is not how a brother treats a sister). He ended up asking my mom if he could drive me home afterwards and we ended up going to talk for about 3 hours (he continuously said that T had lied) and we kind of fixed things. He left for Uni and I still speak to him pretty daily. 
I have to be honest and say I don’t trust him like I did before and he’s also gotten pretty possessive of me. He keeps telling me I am not allowed to date at all, tells me to blow off guys that try to talk to me and stuff like that (I first thought it was a brother thing but both my brothers &amp; dad encourage me to date and told me that F is being jealous). 
I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Finally, for advice: 

Should I keep hoping? 
Should I give up hope and not even stay friends with him at all? 

Does he even like me at all or is he just using me? 

I’m very confused because my mother says I am over reacting (yes, she knows every single thing that happened between us; in fact, she comforted me when I cried when we stopped speaking) so I don’t know what to do. 

Side note: I also stopped speaking to T for the whole time I didn’t speak to F. However, we are now okay. We are not friends and don’t speak anymore but when we see each other at Uni (very rare since we are in completely different fields), we do say hello in a friendly manner.",13Apr2019,1

172,"3 months ago I ended a potential relationship, and I still haven’t fully processed it. I can’t decide if it was because I can’t trust that somebody could like me because I’m a cripple that doesn’t contribute to society or because I just didn’t like her that much, or maybe because I just didn’t have enough to like her that much. Ok, so some backstory. Around Christmas I met this girl on tinder and we texted back and forth every day for over two weeks. She was completely accepting of my FA and that was great. Here’s where it gets dicy. She would constantly say things like “your so wonderful” and “I love talking to you” and “I get excited every time you text me”... I couldn’t bring myself to say anything but “me too”, and that’s where I really screwed up because I didn’t feel that, and I couldn’t understand how she did. I made it about my FA in that nobody could like me because I’m a burden. Now I’m left wondering if I’m going to end at that point with every potential partner. For the longest time I dismissed it as her getting attached too quickly, but now I don’t know. What do you guys think?

173,"Right now I am a sophomore in high school and lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my future and what college I want to go to. But I cannot make a decision on what to major in. Maybe I shouldn’t be worrying about this but it’s really stressing me out and keeping me up at night.

The majors I’m stuck between are Political Science and Film. 

I love film and enjoy watching movies more than anything. It’s definitely my dream to one day become a film director and hopefully make it in Hollywood. I used to be certain that this was going to be my major in college but now I’m not so sure. I’ve been reading many articles and they’ve been saying that a film degree is really overpriced and not even really worth it career wise. My family doesn’t have a ton of money, and I know tuition to film school can be high. Also I know making movies is always a 1 in a Million chance and I’m afraid that my family can’t afford that chance.

My other passion has always been politics. I wanted to be sorta like Al Franken (before he was MeToo’d) and transition from entertainment to politics. But as I’ve doubted the film career path, I’ve fallen onto political science. It is widely ranked as one of the most useful majors in college and allows for multiple career opportunities. I feel that getting a political science degree would open up more doors for me and allow me to help out my family more.

If anybody has any advice, please help. I’m in in desperate need of guidance and I hope you guys can help me. Thanks for Reading:)",13Apr2019,1
174,"Hello, this is my first time posting something in this subreddit and I mustered up a bit of courage to ask for an advice.

I have been struggling for the past three years after graduating from my University. I have a B.S in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and failed to secure an job during and after my undergraduate years.

After a whole year's worth of interviews, I never got past the second round. This landed pretty big blow in my plans and my motivation to do anything. It was first time I ever felt defeated. I can still recall every interview, ever regret, every little thing I should've done that may have changed things around. But I'm here now trying to move to next plan.

My parents suggest graduate school as the next course of action. Thus, I studied for my gres, contacted professors, and used up most of my money on graduate applications. I applied to nine graduate programs in hope's I can get into at least one. With seven out nine rejections letters I can only hope for the best with the last two programs.

But I can only think of what if I fail again. Then what? Should I give up and continue to work at my dead end job in order to pay for my student loans? Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore and I am open to all suggestions.

For now I am planning to reapply for graduate school depending on the last two decisions that are left.",13Apr2019,21
176," I am overwhelmed and want to scream on top of a mountain.

For one, I am extremely unhappy at home. I can't remember a time when I actually felt comfortable living here(home). I don't give a damn about my mother's SO, and he most likely doesn't give a damn a about me or my brother. It's so fucking awkward. When I try to initiate conversation, he responds with a conversation killer, so I gave up with everything. It's frustrating, because he talks a ton more with my cousins and other family members. It's bullshit to me, but I can't change him. I understand that. I just hate living under the same roof as him. I don't appreciate him talking about me or my brother to my little (half) sister saying that I am lazy while he throws the dishes in the sink complaining that we don't wash or clean around here. It's like if I do *one* thing wrong, the world has fucking exploded. He fails to communicate and blames us. I hate how my mother is messenger. My brother and I have talked to her about it, and she tries her best to not take sides, but really? Why can't we all talk to one another? She keeps saying that ""we're all adults here and have work/school...we will all do things to make someone unhappy or not to their standards,"" but this is unnecessary. The other day, I forgot to take out my bedsheets from the dryer, and he took it out and threw it on a tote. He failed to tell me. It's not a big deal, but it's ridiculous how different the situation would be if I did that to him. I've never thrown his stuff like that. I try to find a basket at least and talk about it. I hate pretending like I care. It's not me. I don't want to be nice to someone who doesn't care about me. He's the biggest hypocrite I've met, and we're all hypocrites in this world!

On another note, I'm 19 and am terrible at ""adulting."" I can't drive. I'm not comparing myself to others that much, but at 19, I don't feel free. I should be driving and doing a little more than I am now. I honestly am home most of the day if I am not at school. I don't have friends IRL. I talk to people online. I'm working on my social anxiety, but in the mean time, I am lonely and stressed. I'm talking to a clinician with the psychological services at school, and it seems like she thinks I am doing fine, but she only hears the anxious stories as there is not much time since the psych services are in high demand. I used to go to therapy, but they closed as the owner passed away unfortunately. I also don't have the finances or transportation. There's insurance, but I don't know how that works. I've not even worked a day in my life. 

With school, I am at another turning point. I want to change my major again. I'm rerouting, and I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to study a science, but I don't know which one. That's probably something I can talk to a counselor about, but I've gone to a career counselor already for over a year and settled on Recreation(Rec) as my major, but it makes me think...I don't really want to starve and struggle to find a job. I know there's no guarantee with anything almost, but there's not a great demand for Rec, and I can learn those skills on the side of my studies or double major.

I don't know what I am doing. I feel like I'm drying. It's spring break, and I am overwhelmed. I have research papers to write, homework to do, and career research, but I am home...unhappy and listening to music. I should practice driving, but my mother works, gets tired, and watches my little sister too. Everyone seems to have their own life, and I'm trying to get mine together.

It's so easy to just end it all to solve things. I'm not saying I'm going to do that, but I can't organize my thoughts. I don't want to be here. Every time I pause my music, I can hear him talk. I don't want to hear him. I can't focus on my work with music on. I want to get out and improve my life. I want it to be better. I want to get better.

179,"Context: We met last July in school, but only started talking regularly starting this January in class this semester due to sitting close to each other. 

So, I've known them officially for 4 months and it's not like we're complete strangers, however we do not talk outside of class and say hi occasionally when we bump into each other in the hallways.

I vaguely tried asking them to hang out with me at school (very romantic) for Spring break, but because they commute and live too far, they just said they were sick and couldn't come and now I'm kind of avoiding them because I'm scared of them.

Feel free to point out anything that comes off as too intense or creepy, or if I should just let it go.

School is ending in a month and we haven't been speaking much lately because we barely speak now, but I just wanted to clear up some things up.

The letter:

**Hey \*name of recipient\*,** 

**I've contemplated saving face by not saying anything at all, but since I'm better at expressing myself on paper rather than in-person, this will do for now.**

**I also apologize in advance as the content and subject matter in this letter might elicit some uncomfortable emotions since we don't necessarily know each other that well.** 

**Feel free to throw away this away after you're done with it. I'm not expecting a response of any sort, but I trust that you have a decent level of empathy and maturity to not to go around and tell a bunch of random people in our class, or so I hope.** 

**I'm not entirely sure if you've caught on already, but when I asked if you would come meet me at school for a matter I had to take care of last March, I was really just testing the waters and trying to play it safe. There are a few cultural and societal factors that prevent me from disclosing what I'm trying to say in the most direct fashion possible, but I know you can read between the lines and draw some sort of conclusion. There were a couple other people I could have asked to come meet me, but I saw my academic advising appointment occurring during Spring break at school as a very casual opportunity to see if we could get to know each other outside of class a bit better (oh, the irony), but judging from your response I guess you weren't even interested in being friends.** 

**Now that I look back on it, maybe I should have just been straight up and invited you out to a bar or somewhere more interesting, but yeah...oops. I guess I'm too late now.** 

**I know I appeared angry and as if I was avoiding you out of spite, but it was only because I was scared that you found out my underlying intention and I was so...dare I say..nervous?**

**You probably don't view me in a very high regard due to my behavior these past couple of classes, but just know that I'm not angry with you...I'm just..very shy when it comes to expressing my emotions.** 

**I specifically also wanted to say sorry for the way I spoke to you during the last speaking partner exercise. It was very rude and disgusting of me to have snapped at you like that and I was surprised you didn't snap back at me even though I 100% deserved it and needed to be put back in my place.** 

**We barely know each other or talk to each other in class, and I'm most likely going to forget about this and move on with my life, and so are you as there are plenty of other matters to take care of and worry about in this world. As a way to tie some loose ends before I graduate I've been going out of my way to tell several individuals about how I truly feel, as it is something I need to work on in my life. (Not that you care for all I know but I guess this is a way to justify how long I've been rambling in this letter, lel.)**   

**I still feel a bit unsure on how to talk to you again in person, and I might continue doing what I already am doing out of habit at this point, but I wish you a good rest of the semester and good luck on your future endeavors with the ever so complex German language :)**

So I have this chemistry teacher who is really really good . She's witty and makes chemistry which is usually a brain dead subject , a fun and lively one . The whole class loves her and absolutely look forward to her lessons . The thing is , she is four or five months into her pregnancy and once in awhile we can see her uncomfort when she is teaching. 

As the chairman of the class , I have an idea to create a care package for her with the help of the whole class . They all love the idea but none of us actually know much about the needs of a pregnant lady . I tasked the class with an assignment to find out some things we could include but so far we only have a few things such as bath salts etc. I still feel that the package is lacking something but yet I don't know what to do  . Which is why I turned to this subreddit. 

It would be really helpful if your could give me some tips on how to move forward with this project. I understand that most preferences are objective to the person but I would eternally grateful if your could help me infuse this care package with love and care via your ideas .

But even though I have, what I think is a solid foundation of how I should live my life I still find it difficult to start, it feels as if I've dug myself in a hole so deep I'd need a 1000 foot ladder just to get myself out. I know I'm young and just recently graduated High School and my life has only truly begun, but The pressure of where I should begin is what gets to me, it's as if I form the wrong path through life I could end up being stuck going forward on that path with no way of turning back. So how do I know if I've chosen the right path?",13Apr2019,2
185,"I’ll preface this by saying i have a super complicated history with this person. I was told she liked me and I liked her back and so i asked her to homecoming. We went to homecoming together and a few weeks after she friend zoned me. I still liked her for awhile until i tried to argue my case of why she should like me (stupid i know). During this time between her friend zoning me and me doing that she was borderline abusive. She called me fat, ugly, and disgusting, and hit me a lot. I let her do this because it didn’t affect me all that much since i have pretty high confidence, and her hitting me didn’t hurt except for a gigantic bruise on my arm. Anyway after the whole incident i distanced myself from her. Now she has a few (understatement of the century) problems of her own and this led her to accuse me of stalking her. This was because i went to my class maybe 10 minutes early after lunch, and she was in there too. This led to a lot of drama, and then she apologized and we ended up being friends. A few weeks later she basically tries to fight me at school, punching me multiple times in the face, and my leaving bruises all over my face because i was teasing her about being better at basketball then her. We make up the same day, and then later we fight again a few weeks later about which of us did worse things. She tried to say that teasing her about being bad at basketball is the equivalent of calling someone fat, ugly, and disgusting when it isn’t and she did it for months when i did it for a day. Anyway she says she’ll stop with all her negativity. She does and has been pretty good ever since. During these months our friendship was really good, and we both helped each other a lot. One thing we did that maybe was not so good was talk about sex. We did this a lot, like a lot, a lot. We’re both teenagers and we were apparently hormonal and needed to air out some of those hormones. Anyway this built up until the grand finale of a few weeks ago. I start asking about her comfortablity with me. Then we get into a really long conversation about sex. We talk about what we want to do, if we want to do if before marriage and that kind of stuff. Then i do probably the most stupid thing possible. I literally ask her if she wants to do those things..... with me. Now i don’t mean have sex but i do mean pretty borderline stuff, like groping her, making out, and fingering. She apparently was thinking about it too. Let me say i in no way like this girl. She is attractive but i wanted to do it with her because i thought we were comfortable enough to do it and remain friends after. Anyway we talked about it and she decided she didn’t want to do it, but said she would if she felt like it sometime. The next day i think our hormones went away and realized how stupid it was. She basically got mad at me, went to our school councilor, which is her best friend’s mom. Skip to a week later and her parents find out what happened after they’ve taken her phone away. Now they’ve found out and a whole bunch of things have happened. What i’m looking advice for is that should i salvage the relationship and how would i. Her parents and the people that know won’t let me near her, and she does still want to be friends. I don’t know if i should tho, but she’s been a pretty good friend for the past couple of months. I also made her feel super bad, since i objectified her and that effects some of her problems. I want to know how i could get her parents (specifically her dad) to let up on me a bit and let us be friends.

187,"So this might get a bit long and unorganized, but I’m just lost. So here we go. I’m a 21 year old trans man. Transitioned about 4 years ago and live 100% as male with a completely supportive family. I graduated from a great high school and went on to study for 2 years at CU Boulder and was in a fraternity, but I dropped out because I couldn’t focus and had shit grades. I deal with ADHD (unmedicated) and a LOT of anger problems. I’m currently working a dead end factory job which pays decent, but not enough for me to comfortably move out of my parents place. I’m $35k in debt with absolutely nothing to show for it. I owe the government $350 every month for the next 10 years. I’m miserable. I want to move out and do something with my life, but I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. I’ve been trying to figure it out but literally nothing is what I want. At this point I’d rather just die than live this shitty, miserable life any longer. I’m a failure of a child. I was so smart in school until about my junior year when I got into a really bad car accident. That’s when things turned bad. I can’t think the same anymore. I can’t remember things. I’m angry and irritated with everyone almost all the time. All I wanna do is drink and do drugs and stay out late but I don’t wanna be an addict my whole life. I have no friends that live close to me and I haven’t had a girlfriend in over 5 years. Haven’t even had sex in at least 2 years. The only good thing going for me is that i go to the gym every day. I’ve actually, literally contemplated getting arrested for something crazy so that no one will ever have expectations for me again. Or so that i can rot in jail and not do anything. I can tell my parents are disappointed in me and what I’ve done with my life. I have no goals or ambitions, but not because i don’t want to do anything. I just literally cannot see a life for myself 5 years from now. I’m scared. And quite honestly the only reason I haven’t offed myself yet is because I believe that no parent should have to bury their child. But I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t handle all of this. I wish that car had just killed me 4 years ago. Everyone said I’m so lucky to be alive and ok from that accident but for what? To be miserable and stuck in this dead end? Everyone around me is doing great in school or has a family started and I’m just... here. Doing the same thing I was 4 years ago. I don’t know what to do anymore. Im ashamed of myself.",13Apr2019,1

192,"Well to start, I’ll give some background on myself. I am a 20 year female with A LOT of mental issues. Those issues being borderline personality disorder (BPD), anxiety, PTSD, and depression. And as some of you may know, mental illness can just take you over sometimes and cause you to do some dumb shit. However, I strongly believe that mental illness isn’t an excuse for shitty behavior. 

Last night, my boyfriend and I were arguing. I don’t even remember what over but I’m pretty sure it was me who started it. At one point he was hysterical and crying due to his anxiety being triggered thanks to me. It was like 2 am and everyone else in the house was sleeping. The person we NEVER want to wake up is his dad because he is very abusive and has laid hands on my boyfriend over even the smallest things like not getting around to doing dishes until later or something like that. 
My BPD episode had begun by this point.I kept telling him to keep it down and that his dad would wake up if he didn’t keep quiet. The next thing I knew I had slapped him in the chest as a way to tell him to get it together. And then proceed to say shut up over and over. He claimed that the slap didn’t hurt and wasn’t that hard. For all I know he could’ve been lying just to make me feel less bad. But after the argument stopped, I realized what I had done, and now the guilt is eating me away. I don’t think it matters if I’m a female or not or that he’s a whole foot taller than me. Everyone knows if the roles were reversed, people would be telling me to report him to the police. He keeps telling me it’s okay and he knows I didn’t mean it. Of course I didn’t mean it. I didn’t even realize I had slapped his chest until after I did it. He says he still loves me and wants to be with me but I’m now convinced I somehow have manipulated him into staying with me even though I tell him he should report me or something because what I did wasn’t okay. I apologized and owned up of course.  But it doesn’t change what I did.  I’m even thinking about maybe even turning myself in. 

I’ve talked to some friends. They tell me, “oh he’s bigger than you, it’s really not that big of a deal,” or “bro shitty behavior is a BPD symptom and he should’ve known what he was getting into.”  What they had to say was pretty bias. 

I can’t forgive myself for what I did and I’m beating myself up (mentally) over it. He has been abused by both of his parents, I promised him I’d never lay a hand on him, and I did. I’m officially an abuser and everyone is just trying to justify and makes excuses like what I did wasn’t a big deal. “Oh it’s just a slap to the chest.” 
If he had slapped me in my chest everyone would be raising hell about. It shouldn’t be any different for me. I feel absolutely awful. He is nothing but an angel. I can’t let this go. I feel like I belong behind bars with all the other domestic abusers. Abuse is abuse whether it’s a slap, kick, punch, with words, or whatever.",13Apr2019,3

I am trying to get a custom tshirt made. It's of my favorite video game character, but it's a very specific screenshot a random person took that blew up on reddit. This screenshot is hilarious and I want it on a tshirt.

194,"Firstly, apologies for any formatting issues or spelling errors - I'm on mobile.

For some back story - I've worked for the same company for 8 years and have progressed pretty quickly during that time. I've had 6 jobs in this period, each one has been a promotion and I now work directly for one of the executives.

This week my boss met with me to discuss an upcoming opportunity which is two pay grades above my current role. She is strongly encouraging me to apply for the role, and since then two senior managers that would be involved in the recruitment have also strongly encouraged me to apply.

This is all really nice and confidence boosting but I worry that they believe that I can do more than I can. At this point i have some small detail of what the role involves and I think that I would struggle to meet the minimum criteria when applying. I also then have some anxiety that if I did get the role, as much as I know I would work hard, I might not be very good at it. 

I guess the advice I'm after is - do I apply and at least show them that I do want to progress further, but then potentially risk capability issues if I get the role, or do I stick to the role I'm in, which has no upward progression, but is an ideal position to improve my skills for a future role.",13Apr2019,1
195,"I’ve been seeing my girlfriend, call her Laura, for about 5 months, known her a little longer. I really love her, find her incredibly beautiful, and could see a long term future with her. One of my best friends, call her Erin, moved out of state before I met Laura who has only heard about her in passing. I don’t have Facebook or anything so she’s never seen Erin. Laura hasn’t ever made an issue about it and I don’t think Laura is really the jealous type but in this fairly unique situation I wouldn’t necessarily blame her if she started to be.

Erin is, to put it bluntly, a model caliber beauty. Not even joking, when I walked past a restaurant with her once a guy literally ran out of the place to ask her for her number. Which I think goes to both my point about her being super pretty but also the extent of our platonic relationship because the guy obviously knew we weren’t together based on our body language (and/or had some serious balls to do that he thought we were).

Our mutual friends and my family have asked (before I met Laura obviously) why Erin and I don’t go out because we’re so close and she’s obviously a catch. When I first met her it crossed my mind (who doesn’t want a girl that pretty esp. when she’s also smart fun etc.) but we’re just not compatible that way. We have different views on a lot of things that I care about in a long-term partner and I don’t want to risk such a friendship for a few hookups. In the 8 years we’ve been friends, nothing has ever happened between me and Erin and aside from her generally flirtatious nature neither of us have indicated a desire otherwise.

My friends who all seem to like Laura and also don’t think she’s excessively jealous think she’s going to flip a shit when Erin comes to town. I think it’s a possibility and in most circumstances I’d consider that a major turn off but here it’s sort of justified (not by my actions but by Erin’s attractiveness and our closeness). I’ve lost some of my best friends who were also girls in the past because some of my ex-girlfriends have basically said I couldn’t see them anymore. Jealousy there was even less justified than here, but I really, really don’t want to kick Erin out of my life. 

In pondering the problem I realized if there was some way to ease Laura’s mind I could avoid it all together. It occurred to me if we were somehow related (I was thinking like second cousin or something) this wouldn’t be an issue. I don’t want to be dishonest with Laura and probably won’t actually but I am really that nervous. Any thoughts?",13Apr2019,0

197,"I have debt of about £4k and have agreed to pay £75 a month, which I’ve been paying for over a year. The thing is, I agreed to pay back this much each month because I was afraid of what would happen if I asked to pay back less. However, I’ve been really struggling with money and this amount is difficult for me to pay. I have missed a month recently, I have been unable to set up a direct debit because sometimes I am just so tight on money that I can’t afford it on a particular day each month, living paycheck to paycheck. It’s easier for me to just pay it when I have it because it’s so much for me and sometimes I need to even borrow money from my boyfriend for it, which makes me feel like absolute shit. But they keep asking me to set up a direct debit and I don’t know how to tell them that I literally can’t afford to set it up for that amount.
I want to ask them if I can pay a lower amount, maybe like £20 a month because that would be easy for me to pay via direct debit and more manageable for my finances, but I’m really terrified that they would try to take me to court or I would get in trouble. 

Sorry for the vague details, I want to remain anonymous and some people I know use Reddit.

198,"I am not going to say my YouTube username, as my intentions are not to self promote my channel. However, I will give you a few statistics so you know the size of my channel. I have almost 50,000 subscribers and almost 10,000,000 total views. I usually post funny moments of my friends and me playing games and having funny moments, or I do videos where I rank different cosmetic items in games. Therefore, my audience mostly consists of younger people. As a teenager, I watch Fitz and other similar YouTubers on my free time. So, my friends and I decided that we wanted to record a Fitz-style video. 

This led to my friends saying stereotypical racist/offensive things (note: I did not say anything offensive in this video, and I also put a disclaimer at the beginning of the video saying basically ""if you are offended easily, don't watch this video"". We are not by any means offensive or rude in real life. We are actually really good people. Most of us are good students in school with a GPA of 4.5 or above and are in general very nice people). We were really just trying to target the ""immature teenager"" audience. However, a few hours after I post the video, I get a bunch of texts from my mom who is furious (which I kinda expected) and she forced me to take it down. So, I put it on unlisted which means it doesn't show up on my channel or in peoples sub boxes, but if I send them a link to the video, then they can watch it. 

She said that the video would ruin my chances of getting into college, which I agree with, but I would also have hundreds of other videos and little to no other videos would be like that, so I don't think they would spends hours upon hours watching each and every one of my videos. I realize that racism and other offensive talk is not acceptable and I do feel guilty about posting the video, even though YouTubers with upwards of 14 million subs do the same if not worse. I feel like a broke a trust barrier with my parents and I was warned that if I ever do something like that again, they would shut down my channel (even after thousands of hours of hard work developing my community). 

I really don't know what to do. I provided warnings that the video was offensive, but clearly that didn't help. I would prefer to not have advice like ""you should talk to your parents about ____"" or something. I spent around 17 hours editing the video, so I would really like for that to be able to be posted. I would really love some advice on what to do.

TL;DR I posted a video on my yt channel of almost 50k subs where my friends said offensive things. Because we were going for a Fitz-style video. My mom forced me to take it down, but I spent 17 hours editing it and would really like to put it back up. Need advice on what do to.",13Apr2019,0

202,"I’ve had toxic friendships in the past. I moved from the southeast to Los Angeles about 6 years ago and started over and it’s been amazing. I met this one guy “Eric” on a freelance gig and, trying to make friends, invited him to dinner.  

We became friends but not super close, chatting once or twice a week, hanging 2-3 times a month, smoke pot and chill. I started noticing he was a little “off” — no exact proof, just a feeling after spending time together. He had trouble getting repeat jobs in the film industry we both worked in and was hung up on a girl who had zero interest in him. 

He basically became obsessed with her and would just constantly complain about his unrequited feelings and how unhappy he was in life — at this same time he was attempting to follow his dream to be a professional artist. I’m now married to a working artist and I know it’s super hard to make it.  There is so much competition and it’s a tough life. 

So it became every single time we spoke he was just sour. It got to the point where I just didn’t want to see him anymore. He would just constantly complain and have the worst attitude. This was about two years in. 

That year for my birthday he randomly gave me a $400 camera after he bought a new one. I did not feel comfortable accepting it and tried to give it back several times that night but he insisted I keep it. I told him it was inappropriate for me to keep such an expensive gift and he should take it back. 

I really didn’t have a need for a camera like that so I never used it and he would bring it up all the time! “What do you ever use your camera?” or “I never see you post any photos from that camera.” Each time I would ask him to please take the camera back to no avail. 

At this point I was living with my future spouse and we always tried to be supportive but this dude was a relentless Debbie downer and was STILL obsessed with that rando girl who he never even went on a date with. 

The next straw was when he started complaining about me not trying to hang or texting him as often. He would complain to my future spouse about me not calling him, etc. I couldn’t take it anymore and did not want him in my life. I felt like I was an adult and should be able to choose who my friends are and who I spend my time with. 

One day when he was about to leave after hanging, I broke down and just told him I didn’t want to hang with him anymore because he was so negative and toxic. I asked him to take his camera and give it to someone else because I honestly felt bad keeping it and I felt like he only gave it to me for leverage. 

He accused me of being just like everyone else in his life who’d stop hanging with him and I told him it might be because of his constant poor attitude. I get friends being down but I feel like a friendship is a give and take and he only took. 

I started crying while I was telling him but I felt like I just had to say it. I was not cruel at all. I just had to tell him how I felt and that I didn’t want to be his friend. To me at the time it felt like the adult thing to do. Be honest and forthright but as soon as he left I felt terrible and regretful. Like I was immature.

It’s been three years and I still feel bad but at the same time I really don’t know what I should have done. Be a shitty friend who avoids you in hopes you’ll take the hint and stop calling or be upfront and honest?

Honest feels like the way to go but is it petty or mean? What do you guys think? Did I fuck up? If yes, would love to know how you think I should have ended it. 

Thanks and sorry for the rant.",13Apr2019,1
203,"Backstory: my mom, brother and I all rent a house together and have been living here for 7 years or so. I recently got a decent paying job that will allow me to take us out of poverty.

Mom works full time at $13 an hour. Is in CC currently getting an associates. No overtime. 

Brother works part time at $19 an hour, limited to max 29 hours. Has been working on his associates degree for 6 years now is lazy but content with his life.

Me: former drug addicted for years who went from 11.65 an hour to now working full time + overtime making about ~60k a year or so. 

I’m paying my mom $700 a month for rent &amp; the family phone bill(230 for unlimited data + paying their phones off). My brother also pays $600 a month for rent, the rest my mom pays which is around $500. 

My mom knows that I make more than her and my brother combined and is really pushing me to buy a house next year once I have enough for a 20% down payment. I currently have paid off all my credit cards (was 8k in debt due to drugs, have been sober for a year now) and still owe 20k in student loans. I have 5k in savings right now and I typically bring in ~3000 a month after taxes, 401k, hsa, insurance.  Of that I’m paying nearly 900 a month to my mom and I’m saving around ~1800ish each month for my savings. I’m very frugal and have an allotted fun budget of $100 each month for going out for food, shows, stuff to buy which I never go over budget on.

At this point I want to buy a house but I don’t want my mom to live with me, I’m 26 and I can’t imagine bringing dates over or friends to my house and having her live there critiquing everything I do.  Id much prefer to rent an apartment which would cost the same my rent does right now and live there by myself, I wouldn’t mind giving my mom a few hundred to hep her out. 

My brother only works 29 hours a week and is only taking 1-2 classes a semester towards his degree, it makes me a bit upset he so slow at progressing but he’s been this way all his life, it’s a miracle he got a raise from $11 an hour to $19 - still not sure how that happened. I worked 35 hours a week, went to school full time to finish my degree and was a full time drug addict. 

I love my mom but I also want my independence, our accounts are linked and she watches my money like a hawk, it’s part of her morning ritual examining my online statements and asking me what’s what. I understand why she does it because I was a drug addict and put them thru hell for a few years and I don’t blame her. Honestly I just want to give her like $5-10,000 and tell her to figure it out while I rent an apartment. 

I wish my brother would finish school or find a 2nd part time job, all he does is work 7.25 hours 4 days a week and play video games the rest of the time while I’m working 8-14 hour days 5-6 days a week saving every penny I can. I also think he hates me because I was a drug addict who lied to them for years and embarrassed them, but also because I have the ability to move in life really quickly. 

Any advice? Am I an asshole? Not sure what to think here. I’m ruthlessly saving my money, finding side hustles for more income, maybe going back to school to further my education and potential finally double my income which would solve all these problems.",13Apr2019,5
204,"OK, this is long, and painful. Both to write and likely to read. Please bear with me, I'll try to keep this as concise as possible.

The background; my sister is a deadbeat POS. She raised both of my nieces in a literal pile of garbage and has openly resented having them. They both know this, and now neither of them live with her any longer. The oldest moved out to live with my mom a few years ago and the youngest just left last year. They both hate her, rightfully so. I could go into details, but y'all don't need to read an essay about how shit my sister was.

So, onto my problem; the eldest (now 20 years old and living with my mom - her grandma) has now also become a POS. I believe it's from years of the bullshit that her mom spewed at her, but she hasn't been able to move past it. My mom and her new husband (of only 5 years) are in their late 70's. My mom has retired, and her husband is trying to, but can't due to the cost of having my niece living there. 

My niece literally does nothing. She refused to finish highschool claiming anxiety, yet she also refuses to seek treatment for it. She lays in her bed all day long. She does not help out around the house, she doesn't even get dressed. She doesn't make her own food, but FB messages my mother to make her a snack and bring it to her. All she eats is garbage. She's ballooned in weight, and she is so weak from atrophy that she falls down sometimes just walking down the steps. She literally spends all day in bed. She only showers if my mom asks her to, and usually only is there is a reward involved, such as a trip to the local fast food joint. She's become so socially inept that people in public treat her like she's disabled. I'm not exaggerating, and it breaks my heart.

I have tried to suggest therapy for her, to see if she can move past her latent issues from her abusive mother, but she would only go once, and refuses to go any longer. I've suggested that it's time for her to start contributing to the household, but she won't get a job. Likely due to the anxiety (which she won't get treatment for).  

My mom used to be a fun, energetic lady, and I think that this situation is draining the last good years from her. It's put a major strain on her relationship, and her husband has told me that he's thinking of leaving. My mom was alone for almost 30 years, and this would devastate her, but she doesn't know how bad he's feeling because he refuses to tell her the truth. He doesn't want to upset her.  

Now, my trouble: I live overseas. It's incredibly difficult for me to try and help the situation due to the distance. I am a 17 hour flight away from them, and a 16 hour time difference for phone calls. I've tried to come up with solutions, but my mom merely shuts down and puts on her ""grandma glasses"" - it's not a problem, really!! I don't know how I can help, and I'm terrified it's affecting my moms' health. Her husband reaches out to me, and he's so stressed I'm worried that he's going to have a heart attack. 

So - glorious people of Reddit; what are your suggestions? Am I an assh\*le for trying to help my niece/mother? Should I just let them live like this? My greatest worry is what will happen when my mom passes away. Her husband has no desire to continue looking after a 20 year old infant, and my niece has zero life skills and won't be able to look after herself. 

What can I do? Please offer up any ideas you've got, I'm beyond stumped...",13Apr2019,1
207,"Here’s the whole story. 

I work in a restaurant as a bartender/manager. 

I’m only 19, but I assure you my age is anything but a reflection of my character. 


There’s this girl I used to be friends with who now (like day and night) doesn’t like me.. LETS CALL HER, J.....  J’s issue with me is that she believes I was shit talking her, and I’m really being honest when I say this, I NEVER SHIT TALKED J. 

J and I bartend at a fairly small bar. She’s only had 5 shifts ever behind the bar but we opened the restaurant together a year ago. She’s still learning how to bartend. I was supposed to be training a girl tonight and taking care of all the drinks people at the restaurant were ordering while J was taking care of all our bar guests. We’re still bartending together so teamwork is really important. We were behind the bar when left my trainee to finish up the pineapple that J was cutting because I needed it for a drink. She comes back and tells me I shouldn’t worry about it and proceeded to grab my right wrist while wrestling the 9” in chef knife out of my left hand. I’m just standing there frozen at this point, trying not really left go, but her hand is shaking my right wrist and going for my knife.


I wasn’t in a good situation. 

shortly after that, they needed me as a manager, so I changed and starting taking care of business elsewhere in the restaurant. 

I told the manager higher than me, he asked me if he should tell our regional manager, who’s in town while our GM is out of town... I told him yes. 

Tomorrow I already don’t plan on going to work.

This is what I’m going to do, 

Go to the police and file a report and take this person to court. 

Call out of work and tell them I am in fear of my life because of this individual. 
 
Is this the right thing to do???  I love my job but I can’t work there with this person. Seriously what should I do?? What would you do?",13Apr2019,0
208,"I’m 18f and my friend we’ll call Joseph is 16m. Joseph and I have known each other for as long as I can remember. We don’t go to the same school, but we are in the same group of friends outside of school and we hang out, usually in a group with other friends, every weekend. I consider him to be one of my best friends. We know each other so well. We’re sometimes very physically affectionate and flirty with each other. Also, we’re going to be each other’s dates to prom at both of our schools next month. And our families are close friends with each other.

I see where this seems to be headed. Joseph hasn’t said he wants us to get together as a couple, but he treats me like I’m his girlfriend even though I’m technically not. And I don’t want to be. It’s not that I don’t like him. I love him (platonically). And I’m attracted to him romantically. But if I were to get into a relationship with him, I’d risk the possibility of breaking up with him and losing the best friendship I’ve ever had. Also, the 2-year age difference might not seem like much, but it does make a huge difference in maturity. I’d prefer to date guys who are less than a year apart from me in either direction in age.

209,"I'm a pretty girl, 22 and single. Other Women don't like me because I'm pretty and have very few women friends for that reason. I seem to get along very well with guys which is unfortunate in my case because just simply having women friends would be the easiest answer.

My biggest problem comes in with the fact that I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had a few years back. Sexual abuse, gas lighting, psychological manipulation, cheating and rumor spreading among my closest friends. I didnt just lose a dumb boy I lost every friend I had. I lost the people I considered my emotional family. No one stayed around and I've been scarred by that.

I've regained my personal confidence sense then however it takes a lot for me to trust someone else with my heart and due to that I haven't been in the dating game for a long time and probably won't be for a while more.

I'm very nice kind and accepting. I don't judge and I'm always there for my friends and make new guy friends easily. However somewhere along the line 99.9% of the guys who I befriend end up falling for me unless of course I actually like them and want to try and open up... 

I've had to deal with ghosting, passive aggressive notes and as of last night more than 24 hours worth of angry/""I still love you"" spam messages about how I'm not being fair and should just date them because they are ""better than any other guy"". I've tried to explain that I don't feel the same but appreciate their friendship and enjoy their company. I try to explain my situation with my past relationship and how I just can't handle anything like that. Nothing works its almost always the same story. I'm always abandoned and/or yelled at.

I love people of all types. I love hearing and learning about their unique interests, stories and experiences. I'm a strong believer in the fact that everyone has something to teach and everyone has a purpose. I've met so many wonderful people often in some of the most unexpected places.  I judge only based upon my own safety as everyone has something to give. However what I'm looking for in a relationship is someone who has a gentle and curious soul to match my own. I need stability and balance for my future. And obviously attraction is important in a relationship as well. I also need someone patient. I'm not the kind of girl to kiss on the first date or even the third and each step forward in a relationship takes time for me. I often find guys want to take leaps forward with things when I'm just not ready and that scares me half to death. Too often they simply leave because I don't want to take the leaps and bounds right then. 

At this point I just feel stuck. It hurts to be abandoned so often and it hurts to hurt people who I care about. I'm a gentle soul and never want to hurt anyone. I can't allow myself to go through life alone though. People just aren't meant to be like that. 

What do I do? What can I change? How can I stop hurting people and being hurt by the people I care about? I'm pretty lost at this point. 

I'm thankful for any advice you have for me.",13Apr2019,1
210,"I’ve been dating this guy since high school. I’ll be going to college this year and everyone always says that’s when you experiment, make lasting friendships, and sometimes find the One. I work full time overnights, and plan to continue that while doing full time school. That doesn’t leave much time for social activity anyway, but what I do have will definitely be spent with my bf as much as possible. Is this realistic? Right now we feel like we don’t even have that much time for each other, but with both of us going to college and working it will be much less. Yet I don’t want to waste the years that will apparently yield good friends if I put the effort in. And what about the dating scene/hookups, is that a big deal in college? What’s it like to already be dating someone while going into it?

212,"This girl I met in class last semester had a huge crush on me basically from the start. Long story short, she was really weird about shit so we never got into an actual relationship but for a long time, we talked almost every single day exclusively and I think we were actually in love. We had a huge fight and I didn't things would ever be the same, even after we made up, but I got multiple drunk calls from her asking why I don't love her, why I'm ashamed of her, why I cheated on her (even though we were never in a relationship), etc. Each time she'd say she didn't remember what she said and I just left it at that basically 

Recently, she's been seeing some other dude, but she still calls and texts me almost as much as before (even though she says that she likes him). She always tells me that we're gonna end up married, that no other girls can have me, that she'd kick any potential boyfriends out if I came around, etc. She said that it ""wouldn't count"" as cheating on him if it was me. She's got really low self-esteem and anytime I tell her that she isn't worthless and isn't a loser, she says that I'm the only one who thinks that about her. I really don't love her anymore (I did once), but this shit is just turning me off completely. I feel literally no ways about her and the other dude, but I have this feeling that she's trying to get me to make a move or something. 

Does she still like me or is she just trying to make me jealous and get back at me for ""not liking her""?",13Apr2019,1
214,"(throwaway account)
My birthday is coming up soon and I asked my bf if he could come to a dinner with my family that my mom invites. He said he will be going out of town that night with his sibling to buy something for his mom on Mother's day, since he will also be traveling for a month (by the end of April) and wouldn't be able around on that day. And he can't move it to the next day because he already booked a hotel room.

It really upsets me because I hoped he could plan things out better and squeeze me in, along with the plan for his mom. I said this to him and he replied ""It didn't come up to my mind at the time. I'm sorry:( "". I mention about my birthday and ""quiz"" him about it occasionally (just for fun. I'm not mad when he can't remember as I'm not that great at remembering birthdays either). He also sets up my birthday in his calendar, so it's disappointing to know that these two things aren't enough to remind him about it.

I probably sound very ""me! me! me!"" right now. birthdays in general are important to me as I see it as something more special than usual. It's a day to spend with loved ones. Nothing fancy, just a casual dinner is good enough. Last year, when I get upset about him not asking me to hang out for my birthday he said they aren't that special to him as he doesn't need to celebrate it. 

On his 21st birthday, he went out with his co-workers to a bar and I couldn't come because I'm not 21 yet. I asked if we could do that at a restaurant that also serves alcohol so that I can join too. He said but his co workers were very hyped about this and they want to do that in a bar. I was also disappointed that he didn't make the effort to count me in as his gf, but wouldn't dare to make changes to his own birthday party. So yep, at that point I said sure then and let that slide.

Am I being reasonable to be upset about these? It hurts my feelings and makes me question a lot about how he feels about me.

So yea, sorry for the rant and my bad phrasing (it's my 2nd language) I wanted to get these things off my chest and provide as much context as possible. I do need to hear different opinions on this. If you suggest breaking up, please state why. I don't like to give up easily when it comes to relationships and when I still see ways of working things out. Any advice is appreciated, however. 

TL;DR: bf can't come to my birthday, will be out of town to buy gifts for mother's day and he wouldn't be around his mom on that day. Is it ok to be upset?",13Apr2019,1
215,"Hi Reddit, Apologies if this is a bit all over the place.

I'm a teenage guy in my second year of High School. Over the past year, I have become undisciplined and less emotionally stable. I don't I'm depressed, but I think that I have experienced more negative emotion and anxiety than is normal for someone my age, and I'm already anxious by nature. This post might be a little long, but I hope that someone will be able to help shed some light on my situation and what I should do.

I had a huge amount of free time this year, as I don't have exams or homework. I decided to set some goals for my self at the start of the year because of this. As of right now, I have made very little progress with any of them. One of my goals was to clean up my diet and to stop overeating. My relationship with food is even worse now. At some point last year, I entered into a cycle of restrictive eating followed by a large consumption of food in a short span of time. This binge would be followed by a couple of days of overeating at meals and snacking on high calorie foods throughout the day until I got myself back on track. These periods of overeating were accompanied by feelings of guilt and frustration, as well as a lack of interest in my hobbies and daily chores. This continued for about five months, until I managed to apply a new perspective to my diet. For approximately three weeks I ate like a normal person, and felt great. However I relapsed back into the cycle of overeating after getting drunk at a party 3 weeks ago. I had an embarrassing experience at the party, and the next day I felt extremely bummed out. I had feelings of hopelessness, embarrassment and self-contempt that lasted for roughly 1 week, and I lost interest in my hobbies and in socializing at school. I had many strange, dark thoughts that I wasn't used to, and I spent several days browsing through subreddits like this one and r/SuicideWatch. I told my parents I was sick one day, as I didn't feel like getting up for school. However, my feelings got gradually better throughout the week, and I was soon back to normal. My memories about that week are quite vague, as is my memory about this year in general.

Throughout the year I have drifted between short periods of motivation and periods similar to the one I described above, but not as bad. (Again, I can't fully trust my memory.) When I'm motivated, I eat well and spend my time doing things I find meaningful. However, the cycle of overeating returned after the party, and I have become even less disciplined. I haven't been to the gym in almost a month. One of my goals this year is to learn the piano, and over the past  four months I have made zero progress. I try to read daily, but I haven't managed to do that either. The thing is, on my good days I feel stable and motivated. I structure my day well, and I spend time working on my goals and hobbies. I make some progress, but it all becomes undone when I can't stick to my diet, and I relapse back into my unmotivated, undisciplined habits.

I am also worried about my social skills. I have always been anxious. I have no friends outside of school, and I have few close friends, and none that I would feel comfortable opening up to.( I'm not blaming them for this.) I struggle to make conversation, unless I let the other person talk the whole time. I not good in group situations. I have never talked to a girl for more than 5 minutes. (I'm pretty much in an all boys school.) I rarely ever go out or do things with my friends outside school. All this contributes to my feelings of hopelessness when I'm feeling bummed out.

TLDR;

I'm a  Teenage guy who is having problems my diet and with mood swings I drift between periods where I feel extremely hopeless, unmotivated and undisciplined, and periods where I feel stable.

In the spur of the moment, I never seem to mind paying and driving because otherwise we would never be able to do anything, but my parents and sisters say I’m always being taken advantage of and they’re right. 

For example, my one best friend just turned 18 and the rest of us, I mean I AM throwing her a party. We all agreed we’d pay some for savings or something. This was a planned thing but it’s at my house so I’ve been buying everything expecting people to pay be back before then. This party is tomorrow and when I asked yesterday when they were paying, everyone flaked out except one person who is giving me only 10$. I’ve spent over 200$ on this damn thing.

I knew I was going to be stuck paying the bulk of it, but some help would have been appreciated. Thinking about it, they never seem to care about me at all. I’m not trying to sound selfish but over high school, I’ve been in the hospital for weeks at a time for a new medical issue, been hit by a car, and they didn’t seem to care much at all.

226,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep it as short as I can, with filling you guys in as much as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when my roommates and I first moved in together, we delegated ""chores"" to one another so that we could keep the house we were renting in relatively the same shape as it was when we moved into it. Since the first month, they both have been severely irresponsible in upholding their end of the bargain, leaving me to do most of their work simply because if I don't, it won't get done, and it drives me crazy. So, in the end, I do it. I've talked to them about this MULTIPLE times, and each time they say, ""Oh, I'll try to get better about it. I've just been so busy with blah blah blah"", the usual excuse. It happens this way every. single. time. I feel like there's nothing more I can say or do that will get them to be more helpful and productive around the house, and outside of it (the lawn, etc). I'm constantly cleaning up their messes from cooking in the kitchen. I'm constantly picking up dishes that are left around the house and washing them. One of them has ruined quite a few of my glasses by either breaking them or leaving half drank milk in them for weeks, allowing it to curdle and stain the glass. I've had to wash some of the glasses 5-10 times over just to get close to getting the cloudy stain out. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I'm frustrated. But, getting to my real point here. So, one of my roommates gave themselves the duty to do the lawn. They kept up with it for a bit, but, over time, let it get worse and worse, up until the point that, now, we have received an HOA notice. Well, our landlord did. Our landlord contacted me and told me about it, and at this time I hadn't been home in quite some time due to being at my girlfriend's place, and I told him I'd get right on it. This was two weeks ago. The yard was overgrown with weeds, and the grass was horrible. I went to town on most of the weeds, and asked my roommate to take care of the lawn, and that if they did the front, I'd even do the back, even though it wasn't my chore, nor was it my fault it got THIS BAD. They did the front, but only mowed, and didn't bother weed eating the sides of the house. However, this was done too late, because our landlord received another notice from the HOA about the lawn again, and now he's coming by our house tomorrow to take a look at it &amp; I'm concerned we have received a fine. I don't know if we have yet, but, I'm preparing for it. If we do, what should I do? How should I go about handling this with my roommates? I don't believe I should have to pay a dime if we get hit with a fine, seeing as how this was entirely preventable on their end. I suppose I could've jumped in and just got it done, but, maybe my pride was too high and wanted them to actually do their chore for once. But, I didn't and now we're faced with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 4 months left in this place, and I'm absolutely not going to sign a lease again with them. It sucks, too, because it's a really nice house, it's cheap rent, and in a great location. But, there's just no way I can do it again.

What scares me the most is the yelling he'll go on for hours at a time especially when we're home alone, he also used to try to get into my room and hurt me when he was mad so I had to start locking the door and he would just bang and yell for what felt like forever, and it really f**ked me up like I'm not good with people yelling at me or touching me and when I told my parents they just got mad at both of us and so I stopped telling them . And I suppose I just need help like he's really trying to reach out to me and I keep pushing away but I feel the need to try and connect with him (but I'm not really sure how to do that because at one point I really thought he would kill me, ) So any ideas on what to do because I literally have no clue.

231,"So for the past two months, I have spent a majority of my time alone.

I'd reckon 70% of it. Went out a few times and of course have to work. Here is my experience:


First of all..Why? In the beginning, I was asking people to hang out but I would get one of the following outcomes:
1) No response
2) Late response to the point where I couldn't hang out.
3) Straight denied. Reasons being busy, plans I couldn't join in etc.
4) We could not find time for our schedules to line up.


After a while, I realized that no one ever asked me to do anything. I was tired of people treating me like shit. I didn’t want to put up with it any longer. I would have rather been alone than chasing people that don’t want to be with me. I felt angry and disappointed. Wishing people were all just a little bit nicer to each other.  After more introspection, I realized that me making a majority of the effort has been a huge portion of my life. It’s stupid and it’s draining. Regarding my view on friendships, it's an effort from both parties. Why should I always ask the people I want to meet to hang out? ""Got any plans?"" ""Can I join ya?"". It was just very one sided. Made me question my thoughts on what a friendship is. I decided to make no effort at all to see people.


Anyway, I used all this now free time to do things I was interested in. I immediately upped the amount of time I spent exercising, studying Korean and playing guitar. It worked out really well. My posture is better, I'm a TOPIK level 2 and I feel comfortable enough on guitar to play in front of people (I have btw. It went well imo). Then I started branching out to other things like dance. I'm shitty at waltz and tango but I know how to do it. I've learned a few moves on my own thanks to the magic of the internet (heel toe shuffle and the Spongebob). I learned how to cook better meals. A few other things but lastly, I'd like to mention that I have not had alcohol in about a month.


I mentioned that 70% of the time was spent alone, the 30% of the time that I did go out was so awkward and it was mainly because of me! I realized that my social skills regressed terribly. I was quiet and very anxious. It made myself and the people I was with uncomfortable. I developed this fear of leaving my house. The more I stay though, the more problems arise. I feel lonely and depressed. Learning something new or practicing things don't give me the feeling enjoyment anymore. I rarely interact with people as well. Partly because of my stubbornness in waiting for people to ask me to hang out rather than making the initiative (It feels like I've been forgotten tbh). The other part just being afraid to leave my apartment. I'm not sure what to do. If you have read all of this, I appreciate you taking the time to do so. It's a long rant and I apologize for that. 

tl;dr I spent a lot of my time alone because no one wanted to hang out and I got tired of making an effort. I did things and at first it was very productive. But the few times I have gone out, my social skills are absolute trash and now I've developed a fear of leaving my house and anxiety problems.",13Apr2019,2
232,"So I’ve been in college for about 2 years now and I met this guy (we’ll call him friend A) and we’ve become really close. He’s told be I’m his best friend and he loves me a couple times and tbh he’s my best friend as well I’d take a bullet for the man and he’s even told me he’d do the same. The problem is I have this other close friend who I’ve known for around 15 years now. For most of that time I thought I was his best friend (we’ll call him B) but it turned out to be someone else in our group. He also did something else which genuinely hurt me but don’t think he took it seriously. We gradually grew closer again. Now recently the other guys in our group let friend B down quite badly including the guy friend B used to consider as his best friend. He was telling me how crap he feels and stuff and it just reminds me of how crap they used to make me feel. I want to tell him but I know he’s going through a tough time (and also he’s not managing studying away from home). He was telling me that I’m his only true friend left etc. even though tbh I would like to distance myself from him because it hurt so bad finding out your friends u know for over 10 years don’t like you much. The problem is that I know these two guys won’t get along, they’re just too different and I know wouldn’t like each other. Tbh friend A is what I always wanted a true bro, Friend B knows almost everything about me, I even know a lot of his family etc but I don’t like becoming his best friend by default

Friend A said I must give a speech at his wedding in future. It just got me thinking what do I do for mine. I would love Friend A to be my best man but literally everyone else will be expecting me to chase friend A. I’m not getting married anytime soon but stuff like this still bugs me, what can I do?",13Apr2019,1
233,"i feel like i’m going crazy and don’t know how to bring this up to them. it started on tuesday, we have class together every day but this week i haven’t been going bc my depression is getting kinda bad again ): so they said they’d let me know if i missed anything important. so at the time we have class i went to text them and saw on their location that they were still in the parking lot. i tried to ignore it but then a couple minutes later i saw that they had moved to a restaurant and still weren’t in class. this wasn’t a big deal to me so i texted them after class asking if i missed anything important and asked if i could see the notes and they texted back saying that class was just boring that day, i didn’t miss anything important and they didn’t take notes today. it was weird but i ignored it 
so today, friday, i skipped class again (i suck i know /:) but we had talked about hanging out during our gap earlier this week so i checked their schedule and noticed they were at a mutual friends house and then drove to the mall. so i text them and ask if they want to hang out today still as i was on campus and they said they hadn’t left their house yet and then after that i was unable to see their location. i ignored it and said i’d see them next week and they text an hour later saying they barely got to school and missed most of their class. 
i don’t understand why they’re lying about things that seem pointless to lie about? like maybe this post doesn’t make a lot of sense but i’ve never kept or lied about anything with this person, i feel like we’re best friends but after this i feel so confused. my first instinct is to just start avoiding this person but they mean so much to me i’m just in a lot of pain. on top of being clinically depressed, my anxiety has also been getting worse and this just sort of made my thoughts race trying to figure out what’s going on. and i feel crazy for even having checked their location in the first place so many times, in some ways i feel like i did this to myself. but idk. sorry for the long, badly worded post ):

242,"Hey people reading this post, I'm just looking for some advice on some of my life decisions and how to proceed on them, along with some general loneliness as well.

I'm graduating this year, fortunate enough to earn a technical degree in horticulture. But, I'm still unfulfilled by my life. I've always felt disconnected from this world. It seems that we are slaves to the economy and technology, and it's obvious that nobody in power truly cares about you. We work to fuel the economy, which has a life of its own in a way. There is less emphasis on exploring ourselves and what it truly means to be human, or what it means to exist in the first place, but much more emphasis on a bigger house, or a new phone. Most people upon graduating go to college, find a job, get married, have kids, grow old, and die. Pessimistic, yes, but it's also the truth. I'm just yet to be satisfied by my daily life. I've always felt very lonely. I was never like others, and could never relate to most people. I worry about being lonely all the time, and I'm not sure how to find a person to spend my life with.

The reason I studied horticulture is because i'm very interested in plants, biology, and nature. But, a job in this field just doesn't seem sufficient for what I want in life, heck, no job does. If it were my choice, I would travel the world, living nowhere but Earth itself spending my life talking to new people, learning new ideas, and seeing things I've never seen before. I'm not looking for anything super special in my travels, I just want to experience  my world and be free from society's expectations of what happiness is . Most people I know who work full time jobs aren't particularly happy, they just ""are"". I want to be happy, as in truly happy, but I just don't know where to start. I'm serious about the travelling though. I never particularly liked the idea of ""settling down"" and having kids. But, a life like this is unheard of in this day and age. I want to experience the impact of nature and humankind on this world. The reality me and you live in is but a small box compared to what exists out in the world. I want to see everything. Is that possible, or just an unrealistic dream?

Sorry if all that seemed really cheesy, but I'm just hoping anyone had some advice on how to act on this. Is there truly a way to travel whilst living off the grid, and is this possible without what is typically seen as a job? By no means am I saying I don't want to work. I just want to help actual people, not a system. I've actually considered doing chores, or even volunteering on a farm to make cash, and travelling that way. Not sure if that would work. Anyways, thank you for reading my rambling. I know it's a lot of things to address, but if someone can advise with this in any way, then you would be really helping me and I cannot describe how much I'd appreciate it. Does anyone here live a similar lifestyle to what I'm describing? If so, then how do you do it?",13Apr2019,2

He works in a different country and barely visits. My mother is what you would call a tiger mom. I have very little recollection of my younger years, but I do remember bits and pieces. She use to beat me a lot, I don’t really remember what for. Often she would call me ungrateful, lazy, or just dumb. My brother is much older than me, to the point where by the time I can start remembering memories, he was out of the house. He went on to be very successful (going to an Ivy League and becoming a doctor) and is often a source of comparison for me. My mother is incredibly traditional and stubborn. Nothing is ever her fault, I remember once she was driving to the store with me in the backseat, I was reading, and missed the turn. She proceeded to blame me for not seeing the store and yelled at me.  Once she beat me so badly, she didn’t let me go to the water park with my friends for fear of people seeing my bruised skin and asking me questions. Luckily, she mostly stopped the beatings once I got into middle school. She constantly compares me to others, telling me I’m not as smart as my brother or her friend’s children. If I win third place in a competition, she would comment on how our neighbor’s daughter won first and how I’m lazy and stupid for not doing the same. I often feel bad or awful when she makes these comparisons and retort by insulting her as well (this has just turned into my default defense mechanism). I often hear her tell my dad that there’s no point in raising me and that I’m a worthless person. She always threatens to throw me out. I recently got caught with drugs by the cops( I know, this is super stupid of me) and it’s only made things worse. Everyday she berates me by telling me I’m a terrible son and that I never do anything good and that I’m lazy. She’ll usually push me around when we argue and today I pushed her back. She tripped and fell down and injured her arm. She spent the next hour threatening to call the cops and tell them I tried to kill her, something I would never do. I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep listening to her barrage me everyday and I don’t know how to please her. My dad and brother are no help.

Tl;Dr :  My voice is naturally soft and I have trouble projecting. This is negatively impacting my social life. Question is right at the bottom of post.

I am soft spoken. No I'm not shy. My voice is literally soft. It literally takes extra effort for me to speak louder. Like I get told ""you speak so soft"" all the time, and I hate having to take a deep breath and speak from the diaphragm every time someone asks me to repeat myself because they didn't hear me. And that's becoming annoying, constantly not being heard the first time. 

And it just sucks that when there's even a slight noise in the background I have be conscious of projecting myself. And yes I've been told in drama lessons that I have take a deep breath and speak from my core, but I don't want to have to take a deep breath and tighten my stomach every time I want to make a pun that everyone can hear. 

As you can imagine this impacts my social life as I basically cannot socialise at parties and festivals, and even when I go out to restaurants I try to sit closer to the where the waiter would stand just so I don't have to borderline shout my order.

I'm haunted by past sexual and mental trauma from 5th grade (fuck you ""Makoa"" and other dude) which has caused a pretty large inability to have long withstanding trust which has been a good and bad thing.

However she's pretty depressed at times which I try to help out in one way or another but I suppose it's been draining as well to hope for her to get better but to not always see that come to fruition. I'm currently in my last year of high school and I've got a plan to figure out college and whatnot though its quite hard to see that goal despite it being so close. It's just been a rough fucking season. Money has been tight as a fucking vice, parents have been a bit more obtrusive as of late (to an unnecessary point bc I get that parents need to parent but still, it's hard to reason to a decisive end), and I've had to give up some things as to help some other people through shit as well as aim for things but ultimately for them to not come through for one reason or another.

She comes to my class, asks me to ‘ditch with her.’ (Note: It’s usually during journalism, where each student has a pass and they can basically use it to roam around campus and “interview” students)

I say I can’t go. She looks around, sees that we’re doing absolutely nothing, and asks “Why not?”

She can really be a helpful person at times and she has a good heart; That’s why I don’t want to tell her to stop harshly. Any ideas on how I can get her to stop doing this multiple times a day? She doesn’t seem to process the word “no” and is so persistent to reschedule if I say it. 

After all, I guess it’s just me, but how do you firmly state “no” after they ask why, very well knowing that you have no good reason? How do you firmly state “no” when after that, they continue to schedule something for the future? How do you make it clear that you don’t hate her, but that it’s all too excessive? 

I feel really guilty now, since I have to blow her off on every plan she ever tries to make. She always says things like “You’re literally the funniest and most relatable person I’ve met lolll you’re my best friend man” and I’m just like “yeahhh! Me too! Haha!” So I guess it’s because of my personality. But also due to my personality, I can’t straight up tell her that it’s annoying. 

Please help me Reddit. She’s been trying to get me to talk to her all of Spring Break, going to the lengths of even “lets make a list of colleges that we HAVE to apply to together!!” I don’t like seeing people get attached to me that much, especially when I don’t necessarily feel the same. It’s also ruining my reputation with counselors, teachers, etc.

258,"So Im going to try and make this short for everybody,

When i was a good four or more years younger, I made a really bad decision, I didn't hurt anyone, or do something insane, but trust me it was a very bad decision.

No one else in the entire world knows of what I did but me.

I know what i do in the past doesn't make who I am, but for some reason I can not forget it, I am reminded of what i did by the most random things, and it's evolved into this wierd mental pattern, I think of something, generally to do with the past, and i immediately think of 5 words that i say, it's basically what i did.

I say these 5 words in my head ANY time i get reminded of what i did, and it's starting to drive me crazy

This has been going on for like 6 months, almost daily.

I tried humming a tune or beat in my head every time i get reminded in order to avoid saying these fateful words but i slipped up after 4 days of ""peace""

I don't know what to do, this secret can never be revealed, and I think it's something im willing to die with.

How do i move on from it though, how do i stop saying these 5 words any time im reminded.

How do i have peace of mind again, I don't think i can live with this playing like a broken record in my mind for the rest of my life.

I don't even hate myself for what I did, I made a mistake that didn't harm anything but myself, but I'm haunted by it for some reason.

There has to be some solution without revealing the secret. I can't live with this in my head on loop.",13Apr2019,1

We have a school program where every class does a play. Our topic was MIB (Movie).

We literally don't have one person of color in the ENTIRE school. That would be the problem on itself.

The PROBLEM starts when they want to recreate a scene from MIB 3:

&amp;#x200B;

The scene happens in the 50-60s and cops stop one agent played by Will Smith due to racism.

Cops think he stole the car, he uses the brain-washy thing and tells them that he stole the car, but not because he was black.

[(This scene)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNOZhAc26I8)

264,"Hey, so a little advice from people with experience would be so helpful right now.

My boyfriend (32) isn't officially diagnosed yet, but has had a lot of chats with his doctor and done a lot of research and its agreed he is on the spectrum. He's high functioning but naturally still struggles with certain things.

He's recently moved into my place, and I'm starting to see a lot more of where he struggles. He struggles with planning, processing, executing, time keeping/managing etc. We're noticing a lot around keeping up with things like housework or getting to bed in time for me to not be kept up too late. 

Quick side note: it's worth mentioning here that I am quite a tidy person, I have my own M.H conditions and I find that a tidy house correlates with me feeling good and doing better. I also have M.E so it's super important I get to sleep and keep up with my routines in order to be able to manage work and not be too unwell. 

So, what we keep hitting is it will take him a long time to do a task that would usually take a lot less time. For example about 2 1/2 hours to clean/tidy the kitchen yesterday where it would have taken me 20 minutes. This means I'm often doing the entire rest of the housework, whilst he just washes up and wipes the sides down (in a very small kitchen). I don't want this to be an issue, but of course I'm also only human with my own health conditions and I'm finding it very tough to be doing so much, both physically and mentally.

It's very much the executive function side of things that he struggles with and he'll admit this to me. Timekeeping, planning, executing etc. He tells me that he doesn't understand what order to do things, or how long it will take and he gets stuck. 

I totally want to support him, and I know that there are lots of techniques and methods for him to learn how to better plan/time keep/execute - and whilst I'm doing lots of research to find ways that I can help I would really appreciate advice from people who have been there themselves and found ways to help them with this. I'd love to hear what has worked and what I can do to help him too. 

I've heard of apps that can help. I'm also wondering about writing a list that orders things that need doing and a little time frame for how long they should take and sticking it up on a wall. I'd appreciate any more thoughts or advice for that.

TL;DR - my boyfriend is on the spectrum and struggles with executive function: managing time/time keeping, planning, prioritising, executing. I would like any advice for techniques that have helped you to get better with these things and also advice for what I can do to help him.

265,"I used to have two really close friends. We had different career paths with mine being extremely hectic and demanding, but I always tried my best to make time for them. One of my friends was understanding, the other was only satisfied if I dedicated at least a whole day to her every week, which I did. 

During this time, I was going through a lot: an abusive relationship, struggling to meet with my school work, family problems, and ultimately I became depressed. I could not balance my friendship and usually when I find myself at a breaking point I dissapear for a while to recoup.

The other friend got upset that I ""no longer make time for her"" and told me she found the relationship to be toxic (because whenever we would talk I could not hide my depression/stress easily) and told me she doesn't wanna be friends anymore. I had known her since we were little so it hurt, a lot. I apologized and tried to fix things but she was insistent saying I was bad for her mental health. When I told my other friend, she told me she agreed and could see the basis for her wanting to leave me. That to me was the last straw. I ended up cutting them both out. My other friend who agreed with the first friend was angry at me for cutting her out ""out of nowhere"", but with everything happening, I just could not take it any longer.

5 years later and I went through a lot: depression, an eating disorder, and a few failed suicide attempts, but I am still here and alive and thriving. I have slowly begun to work my way up to a normal life, and a lot of self-meditation and yoga and really, self care has helped. But I still miss them and wonder if I should reach out to them. They were my sisters and someone I could be open and around easily with no formalities. It does not seem right to not have them in my life.

282,"Hello,

I am looking for advice on what I should do.

I work for a large Fortune 500 company that has very strict rules. I am an hourly employee that has a salaried employees job. This includes paying employees. I have like 23 employees that report to me, but aren’t my hierarchy, but are on my Managers. 

So this is what happened. The company has a strict call in policy. Everything needs to be planned and paperwork signed for approval. Each employee is allowed 1 unscheduled vacation a quarter. Well, I had employees that would call in and if they had vacation time and wanted to use it then I coded them vacation. I did not know that I could not do it that way as I have been doing it for at least a year and it’s never been mentioned to me as a problem. 

I got pulled in to the HR office yesterday and was told this has been found that I am doing and that I am falsifying documents. She said this is a major deal and is very serious. She asked me to write a statement so I filled out a statement form that basically said “I have been doing this awhile and did not know that it was wrong and I won’t do it again.” HR read it and laughed because i was refusing to take responsibility for my actions and own it. 

They suspended me until At least Tuesday while she finishes her investigation and she said that she will call me and let me know what to do. 

At this moment, I am hoping for the best but planning for the worst, but I truly enjoy my job and don’t want to lose it. 

Additionally, here are a few of my concerns. Hourly employees have a coaching form that is progressive discipline that starts as “coaching,” then moves to a progression of something like verbal warning, written warning, final written warning, suspension, termination.

This entire process was not used as I pulled to the hr office and suspended without seeing any paperwork or signing anything. Does this matter? 

To give more information, we changed HR professionals a little over a year ago, and since then HR has pulled me in the office for payroll related problems and wanted me to get them right. However, the problems they had with payroll were never a problem with the old HR person who trained me. Additionally, I changed my ways and did it the way HR wanted. 

When pulled in to the office yesterday, the HR manager also used my previous problems with Kronos against me. I tried to defend myself by asking why she is digging up old bones and throwing them at me as I have done everything they have asked me to do with Payroll. 

Again, I don’t think there is any written documents that I signed for prior payroll coaching. 

She claims to have more than enough evidence on my in email form to say I am falsifying documentation which has resulted in my suspension and may result in a termination.

Any advice would be great.

283,"Some background: I’ve been volunteering at a library for over a year. It started off as a way to help my depression and anxiety, an advisor suggested it because I had mentioned I like going to the library and love books in general. I go every Monday and Wednesday, give assistance to people using computers in one of the IT clubs and also provide one-to-one sessions , I really love doing it and it’s been like a form of therapy for me. The main library staff are always so great, friendly and treat me no different just because I’m a volunteer there. 

So a few months ago a permanent job came up and I applied for it however I was unsuccessful in getting an interview. It really sucked but I carried on doing my volunteering and recently applied to another post that had come up. This time I’d managed to get an interview but I’ve just received a call today from one of the higher-ups at the library that I haven’t got it. Honestly, I’m devastated because I really felt like I’d be such a good fit and I would have loved to have become a permanent part of the library, it’s just felt like the perfect place for me in every way. 

I’m feeling so embarrassed at the thought of going in on Monday, the staff knew I was going for the job and were really rooting for me to get it. All I’m thinking is I won’t be able to face them without looking/feeling like a loser. My husband said (when I got the interview) if I don’t get it then I should stop volunteering there and move on to somewhere else. He said it would be unfair to me if I carried on helping out in that capacity when I’ve been told by my manager how much they value me and the work I do.

hi, I'm a junior in high school and he's a senior. i am a lightskin black female and he's white. we have one class together but have taken it all year.

we can call him Ibsen. Ibsen is very racist (slurs) and constantly very, very upset over little things such as 'jeopardy' games during class. no one sits with him at lunch or genuinely sees them as his friend because he is racist and says very weird things (""what a fucking snowflake""""we're super poor"") at inappropriate times. he doesn't have any kind of disability, he's just the kid you see online calling people libtards while you hope they don't actually exist. our school is mostly hispanic and that terrifies me because of his hatred towards them so... bluntly. he's in jrotc and definitely knows how to use a gun, and given the context clues from the patriotism, he probably has a few. he's outcasted and either hated or ignored. he's mentioned not having a future (""I'm only in this class because my mom wants me to go to a 4 year college"").

 although Ibsen is very racist, i used to be nice to him because i didn't feel like dying at school. one day he was calling brown kids in my class slurs and i yelled at him for it. like, a lot. ever since then, we've been on very opposite sides. i dont talk to him at all nor show kindness. this is the part that worries me the most. i know i would not survive whatsoever. there is only one door and you can't leave through the windows within time at all.

i don't think the school administrators would believe me, i don't even know what they would do.  yeah, we know the lockdown drills, but that doesn't help when he's in the same class and he obviously knows it too. what if they don't believe me? I'm going to try to tell the teacher of our shared class after spring break but i keep having nightmares. what if it happens? what if no one believes me? i know I'd be one of the firsts.

291,"**TL;DR:** *I was a generally happy but outspoken freshman who got recorded making inappropriate jokes with two other teenagers. One of them selectively edited certain parts and posted them onto YouTube for a few days, attaining them a bit of traction. Although it was deleted, I fear that the video is still around somewhere, and my obsession with it is driving me insane.*

I'm a young high school student, and live in a beautiful area of the United States. There's trees everywhere, the weather is nice and warm this type of year, and people are generally careless. I'm sort of an introvert although I'm very outspoken - although I used to stay home and create things a lot, I also have a way with words and try my best to create things that people will like.

In the past, I made videos, art, various creative stuff. I was generally a happy kid who did not struggle to make friends, surrounding myself with tons of people. My family is somewhat wealthy and due to the fact I had no problems, I spent time studying so I can go to college when I finish my education. My mental health was almost perfect, although as all people with raging hormones do, I swore at an astonishing rate.

One day, I was walking home from a bus stop with two acquaintances, let's name them Carl and Philip. Carl is a short Hispanic guy who spends a lot of time on his phone, and is way younger than me and Philip. Us two on the other hand are generally quiet but joke about the weirdest of stuff.

This time, around halfway home, the conversation set a dark path. We started making jokes about things we don't usually joke about: pedophilia, nudity, violence. The topic was kind of obscure, and I don't remember it in great detail, but I do know it was severely inappropriate at best. Right after doing my part with an awfully crude sentence, I looked up at the sky and thought ""Damn, how damaging would it be if someone recorded what we were saying.""

Unfortunately, that was precisely what happened.

Carl wanted to get revenge on Philip, and recorded our conversation. He then selectively edited it and came back the next day with a new version. Having my worst nightmare come true drove me insane, and I paid him 20$ to delete it, but he didn't budge. I then promised to bring him lunch the next day, but right as he deleted one version, he made ten copies. Eventually, he posted the video on YouTube, it having received around two hundred views.

**I was shocked. I didn't know what to do.**

I stayed home all day in fear of him, in fear of the fact he might share it, that it might destroy me. The internet is a cruel place, and even if I do finish my education and get a career, it all will boil down to nothing. People will hate me for what I said, for what I did. There's no doubt about it. I used to be convinced that it's not what I normally behave like, but I don't know if it's even the truth anymore.

**I stay home all day, worrying about that goddamn video.**

I have a copy saved and have watched it around 1,000-2,000 times, all the while Carl is unaware and still makes jokes about it. I see him every day and secretly despise him, but every time I confront him about it seriously, he says stupid things back like ""You called me a loser, so it's only fair"" all the while it is literally ruining my life.

**I don't know what it will do to my reputation if it gets out.**

I might say it's not me, although it sounds very much like me. I'm hopeless, worrying about a thing that may not even happen. And the worst part? He took it down ages ago. I may have the last copy. But the fact that it was on the World Wide Web for even a second suggests that some other way it is still around. I may never know for sure. I hate not knowing for sure.

Philip doesn't care. He has no ambitions and it generally doesn't concern him - but I do.

Small things drive me insane - losing a pencil, pulling a hair, hearing an insult. It's ruining my quality of life to the point where I question whether it is actually worth effort, and that makes me feel like even more of an asshole to myself. I count times as before and after the video, and try to use the excuse that I was stupid beforehand and am not improved, but I'm just the same person. Only this time around, I feel sick.

294,"Okay, so I have a problem.

I'm not a very big love dovey, puppy love type of person. I haven't liked someone in a long while, and don't plan to date till I'm older and ready to commit to a serious relationship. However, once in long while, I see someone who piques my interest...and when I finally see someone, I hold on a bit too tightly. 

Recently, I came to a new high school, and found myself trying to build more confidence and identity. I didnt care much about anything else, except focusing on myself. 

But then, I suddenly saw someone who I caught staring at me. I saw it again, and again...and again. I was in the same class as him at the time, and we saw each other daily. At first, I didn't think much of it once my confidence is still pretty low and I hate setting up hopes and expectations. 

But it kept happening. He would sit in spots where he could see me directly (not in a creepy way), and stand around me and always somehow be there. 

It was here I knew, I was sort of attracted to him. He was shy and smart, and reminded myself of me. He was very kind to anyone, and I try to be kind and nice to anyone I run into. We both were studious and had the same morals and values based on an interesting assignment we had to write in one our classes. We both had little self-esteem, also.

This cycle happened for a series of months and even though I denied it and still do, I know to an extent I was more than just physically attracted to him. We were both too shy to actually talk to each other, but personality-wise, we had a lot in common just by how we acted on a daily basis. 

Eventually, classes were switched, and I began not seeing him often. I would still see him a couple times a week, but that was it. It was then, I saw him care less. He wouldn't give off any signs or seem to care anymore. Of course I don't expect him to, but it was rather surprising. 

I'm not really asking for much since I don't expect nor need anything to come out of it, but I was hoping more for a friendship since I really admired how kind and nice he was. He reminded me so much of me, I admired the things he did. 

But here I am, kind of stuck in this weird spot of desiring the friendship that could've happen...perhaps this whole event blossomed from an attraction, but what I wanted more was someone like me.

Or perhaps I'm in denial...I'm not really sure. I just need some advice to clear up my head on what's actually happening.

So maybe this whole post wasn't really about me fixing my problem or confessing anything—it was more of me just trying to talk about something I'm too shy to admit.

295,"TLDR: neighbors run an in home daycare. Noise has gotten louder and earlier since addressing the issue with the homeowner.

I purchased a home two years ago and found out the morning I moved in that our next door neighbor runs an in home daycare. The home was previously owned by my neighbors parents who failed to disclose a SIGNIFICANT noise issue.

There are roughly 18 preschool/toddler aged kids who were outside screaming at 8:00. EVERY DAY M-F. We tolerated it for quite some time, but recently the noise had gotten louder and earlier (more like 7:30). My wife went over and had a discussion with the owner about the noise and asked that it be decreased and to start later in the morning (8:30-9:00). We thought this would take care of the situation.

Since going over, the noise has become louder and earlier (starting at 7:00) I know, and have known since I moved in, this day care is not allowed in the community as the rules specifically state no businesses of any kind. I’ve tried to be tolerant of the situation I moved into, but feel disrespected. 

Here’s the rub; I cannot file an anonymous complaint with the HOA regarding noise or a violation of CC&amp;RS. If I file a complaint, it’s also likely that the day care will be shut down. Sounds great, but I’ll still have to live next to them, and I don’t feel good about hurting someone’s earnings.

Added bonus: they are very popular in our highly Mormon neighborhood and many of the neighborhood kids attend this daycare. I am not Mormon and am concerned about potential retaliation.

We kind of change the pace around October where he send some videos of him singing or voice mails. Then tough times happen. His ex came back. Of course he choses the ex. Then I tried letting him go. Then I realized, I just wanna befriend him because in the first place that's what we have. Then I knew that his ex was just someone who messes him up. He was in a terrible situation. I was like someone who is there to support him when he is heartbroken. Then we were back to normal. But I knew something has changed. So I asked him of what we are cause I dont like to be played or what. He was being sweet and telling me sweet nothing and I dont wanna assume. So we hit it off. We're in a relationship now. For three weeks, too early I know. Then a tragic thing happens again. When everything seems so pleasant and happy but then a terrible stuff happen.

He told me he's sick for about three weeks. Four days later he told me he has Cold Sores. I search for it. I was so scared. I am scared. It's contagious. And honestly, a part of me wanted out because I dont know how to handle it. I dont know what will happen to us or to him or to me. Should I break up with him? Honestly I dont want to leave him behind. He needs some support even from the distance, even from someone like me far from him. But... the cold sores. I'm afraid of it.

The problem is, I seem to be his only friend.

Which means sometimes I'll want to hang out with someone else, or talk to someone else, etc. But then he reacts like I've abandoned him, or don't care about him, he guilt trips me...

I know people think that's the definition of a toxic friendship... And maybe it is, I don't know. But I'd feel terrible cutting the ties with him, first of all because I actually like hanging out with him (when it's sometimes, not constantly), and also because I'm his only friend, and I'm afraid of him being alone since he can't bear it.

299,"So I pretty much don't have any friends cause it always seems I end up making them miserable.  The ones I do have were from when I used to do drugs and I've had to distance myself from them to stop myself from ruining my life.  

My girlfriend just recently broke up with me cause we have been arguing constantly this last month.  4 months prior to this I ended up tearing my miniscus in my knee with some severe bone contusion on my knee cap femur.  It was from a roller hockey incident. I ended up losing about 10 kg cause I couldn't train in the gym, I wasn't eating as I just couldn't stomach it with the pain medication I was on to handle going to work which was quite laborious which didn't help my recovery and ended up causing more damage.  During this time I started to become quite depressed I ended up isolating myself, I wouldn't want to go out cause I was tired from working. Over New year's I could barely walk and having severe headaches causing me to throw up. I had just finished my shift at work and went home to sleep.   I ended up falling asleep for about a day and a bit and was still having severe headaches at the time.  I was pretty much bed ridden and couldn't move.  At this stage in time she found out an old family friend had died and was quite upset about it understandably.  She really wanted me there and I couldn't be there.  She was incredibly upset about it and I hadn't told her about me not feeling well besides that I have really bad headaches.  She was really upset and wanted to talk about it and I reluctantly agreed,  I didn't want her driving out to me cause she gets quite emotional, I thought she was going to break up with me there.  When I arrived I threw up and she realised I was actually quite sick and that I could barely walk straight and hold a conversation without having to throw up.   Before I drove out there I told her I don't want her being on her own if she was going to break up with me that day, so I asked that she called her friend over after I left.  She held that to me when we broke up that she was upset because I didn't fight for her when I thought we were gonna break up. Which I told her I was in so much physical pain that I was over everything,I just wanted to get it over and done with if it was going to happen.    

Three days before Valentine's Day,  I was going to have her over for lunch.  We had made the plans the day before and she said she was going to be over mine at 12 sharp for lunch. I ended up spending the morning preparing for lunch cause I hadn't gotten to cook much at all recently and wanted to make it special.  12 O clock rolls around and she isn't there so I assume she's just running a little late.  1 O clock rolls around so I send her a message telling her hey look I'm going to eat cause I'm starving.  I've saved you a plate. I receive a message at 2 30. Oh sorry I've just caught up with Hayden for his birthday.  Another 2 hours go by and she asks if she can stop in for a bit of it. I text her back and I say it's up to you.  When she arrives at 430 I ask her why she didn't tell me she was going to catch up with him for his birthday.  And she said to me ""Well plans change""  so I asked why she didn't tell me so I wouldn't have wasted my time preparing for  a meal that wasn't going to be eaten.   That's when she decided to apologize. I told her I'm still not happy with you. I could have spent my time doing something else instead of having preparing a meal that you aren't going to eat and not doing something else because I'm waiting on you.   She eventually apologized again over text after she left.  I was still upset about it over New year's and decided I'll take her out for Valentine's Day to somewhere she wants to go so if she decides to cancel I'm not left waiting somewhere wasting my time.  So I messaged her the afternoon before asking her where she wants to go for breakfast. She decided on place X at 8 am.  I'm working til 1 am the night before which she knows.  I agreed to meet her there at 8 am. So I wake up around 730 getting ready to go. I open up snap maps and see that she was last online 10 hours ago and hasn't opened up the morning snap I sent her.  I didn't get her a gift for Valentine's day. I'm paying for the meal and haven't had the time to get a gift cause I forgot it was Valentines Day until the afternoon before and handn't had time to go to the shops because of work hours.  So I decided I'd pay for the meal.  She  gave me a handwritten poem saying that she loves me.   I told her I was sorry that I didn't get her anything and she said it was fine and she was sorry for arriving half an hour late.  I told her it's okay I just wanted to spend the morning with her.  We ended up making up about her being late the other day. 

The last argument major argument we had was about a week ago.  We were making some last minute plans together and she didn't want to do anything I offered. So I asked her what she wanted to do and she said just watch tv and lounge around at my place.   We had some smaller arguments that month because I said it feels like she doesn't want me around when ever she is here. She said it's not the case and she's just really tired and she's sorry.  She ended up cancelling on me saying her friend really needs her.   I see on snap maps that she's driving to a party that her friends are having.   So when I see that she was at the party I told her. It really doesn't help that I don't feel wanted. 

We broke up 2 days ago and she said she cares for me and really doesn't want me doing something stupid cause I told her about 3 weeks prior that I was going through an incredibly rough patch cause I havent been driving around cause I'm feeling suicidal and I didn't go to her friends game night because I was feeling like crap emotionally and was scared of driving there cause I was going to do something.  She said it's normal I told her it's really not cause I've been feeling like this for the last 11 years of my life. I never felt welcome in Australia and just wish I died in the bank robbery I was in, in South Africa.  I told her she was the only person I felt like I could tell because it's affecting her and it's bringing up smaller arguments like me not feeling emotionally up for things.  

I feel like I just need to tell someone but I can't tell my parents that I'm miserable because a kid bullied me and would tell me to go back to my own country, when they moved us here to Australia and I've just never felt welcome here and the robber had just put a bullet in my head when we were in the bank.",13Apr2019,1

306,"So first a little background info. I’m in 10th grade at a school in Germany (NRW in case that helps since laws are not different from state to state). We have to pick what is essentially our majors (LKs if that helps any potential advice givers in Germany) for high school. They’re the classes that we have more lessons in, get deeper learning, and are tested on more when we graduate. They also take more work from the teachers, however my music teacher has said that he would teach a major. I want to pick music, which is offered, but I am the only one at my school who picked music. We can build courses with a few other schools so a few more people might pick music, but in all likelihood we wouldn’t be more than about 5 people. The school wouldn’t allow a course if there aren’t many students because they believe it would be a waste of teachers and money. I think that there is also a law that says that you need a certain number students for a course, however I know of exceptions.

However I believe that once the class is offered it should also be taught because school exists to prepare us for life and give us the best possible education. I think I want to study music in college so this is something that is important for my future. In my opinion they have no right to give me and other students that chance and then take it away. 

This doesn’t just affect me. This is relatively common for many students in multiple subjects. So I think it’s important. 

How can I best go about making a case for this. I really need to be able to take this course and I am willing to go to any lengths to do so, even if I need to get a law changed, which I know sounds drastic. None of my friends are any help nor are they supportive. They say it’s hopeless and that I can’t change anything.

314,"Hi all, 

I have a friend, don’t really see him often. For context, I have a girlfriend who I’ve been seeing for a really long time. 

When we started dating, whenever I would see this guy, he would be fine. As he would drink more and more, he would get more insulting towards me in front of my gf. Making fun of the job I have, my career path, etc. This continued over time, and really the only reason I would see him is because he’s a mutual friend among my other friends. Aside from that I would never see him outside of events where all of our friends would be. 

Fast forward a few years, last night I saw him for the first time in about 2 years at an engagement party for a friend. Said hi, went to mingle with others. As the night went on, he got drunk (I don’t drink), and he repeated the same thing. Insulting me in front of my girlfriend. 

I’m the non-confrontational type, my idea of resolving this situation was just avoiding him because stuff like that isn’t really worth my time. Plus, the venue wasn’t appropriate to be like “could you fuck off”. Anyways, night was over, saying goodbyes, said bye to him and he came and gave me a hug said “it’s always nice to see you man” and he did a full squeeze grope on my junk. My gf saw it, her friend saw it, and I just pushed him away and said “woah that’s not appropriate”. We left, gf said that was really weird, and it was. 

My opinion is it’s a power thing stemming from jealousy. His weird behaviour only comes out when he’s near my gf and I. Doing that in front of her was like a demeaning way of saying “I’m better than you”. 

Looking for advice on how to handle the situation/situations like this in the future. I’m obviously going to have to see him in the future, and I’m not dropping my friends for the sake of him. Thanks in advance.",13Apr2019,1

318,"The puppy is very cute at 9 weeks old. Her owner is very adamant about crate training the puppy which I agree with. Her first two nights were great, but now she is entering the phase where she doesn't want to be crated and will loudly bark/scream/whine. She did it from midnight to 12am, then from 5:30am to 7am until I finally gave up. She is not potty trained, so letting her free roam is not an option. The crate or in bed with me where I can wake up when she wakes up are the only solutions I see. (Because I have to wake up 2x per night to let her potty, I'm already charging 2x my normal rate.)

I texted the owner letting her know this isn't going to work for me, and that I'm going to just let her sleep in the bed with me until the owner gets back in town. Then the owner can resume crate training and the pain and suffering that comes with it. 

The owner texted me back begging me to please continue the crate training and to most definitely not let her sleep in the bed with me.

I have been petsitting for 10 years and have 5 stars on every review I've ever received. I don't want her to be mad and give me a bad review, but this barking nonstop and not letting me sleep at all WILL NOT WORK for another week. Additionally, I have a roommate!

319,"I've known this friend since 1st grade, when he joined my school. It's a small private school (not a religious school or anything, a Montessori school), so all the students of the same grade were in the same class. So, he was in all of my classes. We were both the weird kids. We usually hung out and played by ourselves during recess and did projects and such together. Hell, we were the 4-time **champions** of the 3-legged race in field day. It was legendary.

Which brings us to Red Flag #1: Anger issues

He got angry at everything. And I mean *everything*. The littlest things threw him into a tantrum. And it wasn't just in 1st grade. He kept that reputation with him for 5 years, until we parted ways in the transition to middle school. When we graduated from elementary school and transitioned to 6th grade, I went to a public school and he moved upstate and went to a religious school. Of course, he kept that temper with him. When we visited him over the summer, he told me a story about how he beat up and cussed at this kid, not even explaining a reason why. It was strange, but I laughed it off at the time..

Next up is Red Flag #2: Not trying to accept my likes/dislikes

Basically, the things he didn't like, he tried to change. Some of these things were: BTS, anime, and Broadway (Because it's not family friendly enough nowadays. Said he liked classic Broadway, which is just as bad pretty much :/) to name a few. He didn't really bother to even try out these things and started pushing his likes on me, which were Christian Rock, Doom, and Bionicles. Pretty much all of these things I dislike, but I went through a process (listening to some of his favorite songs, watching all the trailers for Doom, and looking up bionicles) and he doesn’t seem to be doing that, yet still getting angry at me for saying for the 5th time that I don’t like Doom.

And now, Red Flag #3: Homophobic comments

My friend is extremely Christian. To the point where it got a bit excessive sometimes when we talked. I had nothing wrong with it (I'm Christian as well, but not extremely), but he took it to a new level. The worst part was the homophobic comments he made. I'm straight myself, but I had and currently do have LGBTQ+ friends, who I care deeply about.

In 7th grade, I had a female friend who was LGBTQ+ with a girlfriend at the time (They were a cute couple, but aren't together anymore). By 6th grade, my friend had gotten a hold of my phone number. We would talk every now and then and when I mentioned her by saying ""her and her girlfriend"". He tried to correct me, like ""Did you mean 'him and his girlfriend?'. When I said no, he said ""okay"" and the conversation went on, but he started mentioning God more in it after the little event, which was a bit weird for me.

The summer of 8th grade, I was going to my first anime convention and decided to invite him, since he liked Doki Doki Literature Club (literally the only anime-related thing he likes). The convention was happening a bit after the time of two crucial events: Shiro from Voltron coming out and the Rupphire wedding from Steven Universe. When I mentioned Voltron to him, he said he liked watching it. But when I mentioned Shiro, he said, and I quote (this stuck with me), “If he actually turns out to be gay, I’m going to stop watching it.” That was just ridiculous but it gets worse. Remember the Rupphire wedding? We went to a Steven Universe panel where Steven, Connie, Ruby, and Sapphire cosplayers were all dressed in their wedding outfits (Ruby in her dress, etc.). During the panel, Ruby and Sapphire were being cute together (cuddling and stuff, it was cute). And whenever they did that, he was scoffing, mumbling and talking shit about them. But not to their faces, but to me. I don’t know who those cosplayers were but I loved them and I felt so bad for them cause they actually had good cosplays on and he was just shitting on them behind their backs. It was rude and embarrassing for me and I knew the people around him were uncomfortable because they could hear him.

And finally, Red Flag #4: Victimizing himself

Oh boy, these are probably the worst for me. This all started when I confronted him over text about everything above. Everything was going smoothly, he was apologizing, saying he wouldn’t do it again, but when I got to his homophobia, that’s where shit hit the fan. He kept saying that it was his religion and he can’t help that he was raised that way. I told him that his religion doesn’t matter in this situation, and that it was the way he expressed it that was the problem. He was rude and disrespectful to them, and it was embarrassing for me to have all his complaints thrown on me. Then, he drops the bomb: “Does being on the autism spectrum not change anything?”

Now, he never mentioned to me that he was on the autism spectrum ever before this conversation, but he still expected me to acknowledge it? This was the breaking point for me. He kept going on about his thousands of dollars of therapy and how that wasn’t enough for me (Note: After doing research on the autism spectrum, he does show signs of Asperger’s Syndrome, but he never told me what exactly he had. Not trying to diagnose him myself but that’s what research is telling me), but at that point, I was having none of it.

I didn’t want to talk to him at this point and I haven’t talked to him since. He continues to try to start conversations by sending me videos or memes, but I never reply.

I‘m in 9th grade and I’m not brave enough to block him because our moms are friends and I don’t know what he’ll do. When he asked me if we were still friends at the end of the convo, I just said “I don’t know” even though I wanted to say no (which I know is something I shouldn’t have done, but it was late and I didn’t want to argue with him anymore). He constantly guilt trips me into continuing to talk to him and I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t know if he even is on the autism spectrum, but what would that make me?

Am I at fault? Should I have just told him I didn’t want to be friends? Should I have blocked him? Should I try to talk to him again? I need help, please.",13Apr2019,1

He lied to me about my medical rights and kicked me out when I said I wanted therapy.

He complains about his miserable life as a truck driver but fails to listen to ways he could change.

323,"I've self harmed for almost a year now, I can't remember exactly. My Mum caught me a few times in the last 4 months and in January she found out and took me to a private counsellor. I started the sessions 2 weeks ago but the last time I went she diagnosed me with moderate depression and anxiety. Once I realised that things are starting to make sense, like why I get so nervous all the time and I don't know exactly why. It's really confusing for me, I am only 13. But I think I understand most of what my counsellor tells me.   
I have a group of friends irl but I'm not planning on telling any of them because they will think I'm attention seeking like all the girls who post on their story that that have 'depression'  even though they've never been diagnosed. I don't understand how people can do that because I'd hate to have my friends worry about me, that's just cruel. So I don't want to tell any of my friends irl  
The only person who knows about this is my online best friend who I've known for 2 years, shes the only person I trust really. And I realised that when my counsellor asked who was in my close circle of friends that I talk to about personal stuff, it's just her. 

But I have this group of online friends, they're all boys who are one year older than me, there's 4 of them in total and I've known them for almost a year now, they all know each other in real life and we play together like every day for ages, they're really nice and they make me happy every time I talk to them so I am so glad to have them as my friends.   
But I've been keeping a big secret from them since the day I met them, that I have a self harm addiction. None of them know about it and since I'm going to the counsellor and been diagnosed with depression and anxiety I feel guilty that they don't know because I spend a lot of time with them, I'm not sure whether to tell them or not because I'm scared they'll misunderstand or think I'm attention seeking or treat me differently or think I'm messed up in the head and not like me anymore. And most of all I don't want them to worry about me. 

(Short ver: None of my close friends except my best friend know I self harm and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety by my counsellor and I'm not sure if I should tell them.)

  
I'll feel guilty if I never tell them, but I'll feel guilty if I do tell them, what should I do?",13Apr2019,3
324,"I am a 20 yo female from a European country. My parents build up a business from nothing, learned to save up money and wanted to support my sister and me. They promised to support us until our education ends (preferably university). My sister finished uni a couple of years ago but if she needs help (she can't really save because she loves money) they still help her.

I am way different. I was an exchange student in the USA and now I am doing my university in Denmark. I couldn't lend a job yet and my father sends me money every month and I have some money saved up from previous jobs. I never spend all the money he sends me I always save up a nice amount.

My boyfriend on the other hand hase a non-supportative family and decided that since his father doesn't help his children, his mother don't even have a high school diploma than he is the one who have to support everyone. So almost everything he earns goes to his family. Don't get me wrong I don't want him to spend that money on me!

So in the relationship I am the one with more money and usually I buy the groceries so he doesn't have to. But when it comes to money he looks really judging and calls me ""rich girl"". Which is not my family. We are not rich at all. We are a middle financial stable family and through my high school years I was bullied because everyone believed we are rich.

325,"I’ll just get straight to the point. There’s this guy at school who is incredibly toxic and put me in a very dark place. I realized this, and got out, but I am still very bitter at how he treated me and how he treats some of his ‘friends.’  Earlier when I first ended it, I was doing good because I knew I couldn’t give him the time of the day and that if i wastes time thinking about him, he would win.

But also, he’s friends with a lot of my friends, because I met him through those friends. 

He told one of my friends that he didn’t want to talk to her, very rudely, and I was incredibly irritated. Because he’s using this girl who’s only ever wanted to be his friend as a punching bag. I want to yell at him and scream at him, but there’s nothing I can do, because its not my situation. It’s hers. I already told her everything I knew about him, and how toxic he was. She realized it too! But she still fell back with him even though he was hurting her because she still wanted to be his friend. And it really fucking hurts to see her like this. But there’s nothing I can do except be her friend.

Later in the week, he joined the tennis team. And while that may not seem like a big deal, it is too me. I’ve played tennis the last three years, and it’s been a safe place for me. And now, three weeks after the season starts, he joins. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how I can still go to tennis with him there. I don’t know how to get over this so I can play tennis and be happy. I don’t know why I can’t get over this. I don’t want him to win. I want to protect my friend but I feel powerless. 

Does anyone know how I can get this out of my mind, when I’m playing tennis so I can enjoy my sport without worrying he’s going to drag me down again?

Also, is there anything I can tell my friend who he’s still hurting, anything more than I have?

*He’s friends with my tennis partner on the team, so I’m worried my partner will make me hang out with him.

*Me and the guy were also extremely close before his behavior changed and he became hurtful and toxic. So there is some feeling of betrayal along with the bitterness.",13Apr2019,1

Yesterday, after days of interrogating him (politely) to tell our friend group a story about him kissing a girl, (We were on the subject of first kisses, as we are seniors in high school, and normally we would have dismissed it, but X wasn’t giving us a clear answer) he finally tells us, with a cloak of shame almost. We thought he kissed someone who was related to him, or she was ugly. Another 2 hours go by, me and a friend “get the honor” of seeing a pic of her. Now, I’m gay, but if I was straight, I would be HONORED to kiss her. X KISSED A HOTTIE AND PUT HIMSELF DOWN FOR IT.

I don’t know what kind of string of events put X so down in the gutter, and I feel shitty for not knowing what, as we have been friends for a long time.

2. I plan on taking 20 months to achieve the money I need to have my own place and rent for a couple of years in advance. Hence I can get a car too. This will help me be where I want to be in 5 years. 
3. I want to be positive and live a minimal life and I've learned that I can't live with other people because they affect me and make me think negatively so I need to live alone and do positive things on my own or with people that lift me up. 
4. After 20 months -24 months, I want to study and make a change for myself but I feel that for my mental health I would need to be in a clear space to this. Although I can begin right away but I have this urge to come hunting that when I study then I keep thinking about my negative situation. 
5. I want to chase my dreams and make them come true but sometimes you have to drop dead weight and negativity.

It's not that I have no hobby's, it's just that they're FUN but not 'this is what I want to do with the rest of my life, this is what I'm an expert on'-fun.

First I wanted to be an artist. Then I wanted to be a writer. Then I kept switching between those 3 until I wanted to be a musician. Then a teacher told me in my face that I would never be successfull at any of these things. Then I needed to pick something that would be at least 'somewhat realistic', and so, I decided to become a programmer. Had tons of fun at first, but now I'm like 'meh' and not looking forward to doing it. I'm an intern in a computer store kinda thing, and it's meh. It was fun at first but now it started to suck. I'm afraid it'll be that way with everything. Fun at first but when you need to do it in a routine, every day, for the rest of your fucking life... I wanna turn back but don't think I'll find a better road...

I started the eighth grade in September. I promised myself that this year would be amazing (since it's my last year of middle school) and that I would open up to people, trust them more.
 It's April now, and I've never been happier with my social and school life.

In October, my class met our new French teacher (he's turning 29 this year). We switch a few of our teachers every year, so we weren't that surprised.
My first impression was that he was pretty cool, but that he didn't like me that much. I mean, it was the first time he met me, so obviously he was a bit distant.

Time went by and we spoke more. He realized that I'm really good at French and that I'm quite good at school in general. He also found out that I'm going to one of the toughest higschools in my city after middle school. 
The educational system in Italy (I live here) is particular (especially regarding highschool). 
Basically, there are 3 main kinds of highschool and they branch out into further categories (a highschool that prepares for college aka liceo, one that prepares for college and for work aka istituto tecnico and one just for work aka istituto professionale) . 
I chose a highschool that will prepare me for university and specializes in Latin, Greek, Philosophy, Literature and things like that. He went to a similar highschool, so he sometimes talks about Latin during our classes (none of my classmates are going to a highschool that teaches Latin. I'm the only one). 

He's also insanely nice and polite. He always says hi to everyone. During tests, sometimes, he'll come up to me, touch my shoulder and ask me how I am. 
He's so nice and I hate to feel this way, believe me. I know it's wrong. I know he'll never like me the way I like him. I know that, even if he liked me, it would be wrong. 

My school also held the parent teacher meetings on Thursday and he said such nice things about me and my brother. 
It was incredible. 
I feel conflicted. 

Btw, I'd never act on it. Never. It isn't OK. I just feel wrong. 

I don't really need anyone to tell me that what I'm feeling is wrong and that I should feel ashamed. I already feel that way. I just wanted to type everything out and ask for advice. I can't stop thinking about him. It's ridiculous.

The thing about it, is that my (now)ex is a bit of a neckbeard and gets offended when I do things without him. He told me that he wasn’t going to go if I didn’t. And if he finds out I’m going last minute he’ll tear into me about how I didn’t tell him sooner and blah blah blah.

341,"So— I have this friend who, up until a few weeks ago, was part of the same D&amp;D campaign as me, where we played a mother/daughter duo.

I had to leave the country last minute due to some family stuff, and I left under the impression that I’d come back from my trip and be able to pick up the same character. I *definitely* told the friend I’d be back and to let the group know I’d be gone, though now I wonder if she actually passed it on. 

Anyway, we’re a very loose school group that lets new players come in and out, and we have this kind of ideas board for new players? Like, people can check it and see that we’d like more rogues, or this person would like someone to play their long lost sibling, or something like that. 

Literally the day I left, my friend posted on the board looking for someone to play her daughter. I left at nine am, and by sunset the posting was up. I was gone for a few weeks, still texting and talking with her, and at no point does she tell me this. I found out from another person a few days ago, and I messaged the friend asking.

She said because I was gonna be gone so long (Six weeks! I know that can be a lot, but...), and she’d wanted to progress the story about finding the daughter’s long last dad, she’d thought it’d be best to look for someone new. I say, well, I’ll be back in another two and a half weeks, so could you maybe take the posting down? She ghosts. Has not replied at all.

I can’t help but wonder if it’s something about me or how I was playing the character, but the thing is— we’ve been friends for two years. It would have sucked to hear that she didn’t want to play with me anymore, but honest would’ve been preferable to her just... deciding my character’s gone.

I don’t know, my feelings are hurt and I’m honestly angry, but the other player who let me know says he can see “both sides,” so... I don’t know. Am I overreacting? Part of me genuinely doesn’t want to talk to her anymore, at least for a while.

**TLDR**: Played mother/daughter duo with friend of two years in a D&amp;D campaign, had to leave the country for a few weeks, friend basically tossed out my character and started looking for a new player for the daughter without letting me know.",13Apr2019,3

343,"So for context: awkward 16-year-old that has a very hard time of maintaining eye contact.

I sort of knew this was a problem, but I didn’t think it was this bad. That is, until I saw my friend today. My friend, who I’ll call N, is around 19, and I saw her at the supermarket (haven’t seen her in like forever). So we were very surprised and we talked for a little bit. I called my friend, who I’ll call S, and told her about that.

After I left, I got a text back from S and she sent me a screenshot of her conversation with N. I’m gonna try to do my best to translate because I’m not very fluent in Thai, but here goes:
	
N: I met Siegerkranz at the supermarket hahahaha
S: I know, he called me.
S: He said he was very shocked.
N: Really? That’s so funny
N: He talks without eye contact, that’s kinda funny

So I realize now that this is an issue, and I really need advice on how to deal with this.  I can only really have some sort of eye contact when I’m in groups, and I can only hold eye contact with a certain individual for a second or two at a time. Otherwise, I try not to even look at the person directly (this is quite rude, but I can’t help it).

344,"I'm in high school, so this is probably a bigger deal than it would be if we were adults. 

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine has been getting caught up with the wrong crowd, and I think she's been vaping (although I don't have proof). The other kids vape regularly (possibly weed too), but I don't know them and don't particularly care. My friend is especially suspect to peer pressure, and I know the time she's spending with them is, at the very least, not a good influence on her. What worries me is that a) she'll get addicted, and b) that if she doesn't stop, this behavior will get much worse in college, where she won't immediately have someone who cares about her so deeply. I would have no trouble believing she could get sucked way too deeply into sorority culture and the associated negatives (sororities aren't necessarily bad, but she'd get caught up in the bad stuff). 

&amp;#x200B;

The nuclear option is always to go to an adult, but I know it'll steer her the wrong way. On top of that, administration is generally useless when it comes to this type of stuff, so I don't expect them to really help either.

How can I a) steer my friend away from this wrong crowd and b) stop her from falling back into this behavior in the future?

346,"This girl I met in class last semester had a huge crush on me basically from the start. Long story short, she was really weird about shit so we never got into an actual relationship but for a long time, we talked almost every single day exclusively and I think we were actually in love. We had a huge fight and I didn't things would ever be the same, even after we made up, but I got multiple drunk calls from her asking why I don't love her, why I'm ashamed of her, why I cheated on her (even though we were never in a relationship), etc. Each time she'd say she didn't remember what she said and I just left it at that basically

Recently, she's been seeing some other dude, but she still calls and texts me almost as much as before (even though she says that she likes him). She always tells me that we're gonna end up married, that no other girls can have me, that she'd kick any potential boyfriends out if I came around, etc. She said that it ""wouldn't count"" as cheating on him if it was me. She's got really low self-esteem and anytime I tell her that she isn't worthless and isn't a loser, she says that I'm the only one who thinks that about her. I really don't love her anymore (I did once), but this shit is just turning me off completely. I feel literally no ways about her and the other dude, but I have this feeling that she's trying to get me to make a move or something.

Does she still like me or is she just trying to make me jealous and get back at me for ""not liking her""?",13Apr2019,1
347,"I grew up the 'pretty one' in my neighborhood, was always given compliments from shop owners and street food vendors when I bought something, and got scouted by modelling agents in my home country and abroad, which most likely convinced me I was generally good looking. This led me to looking for mirrors and feeling good when I take pictures of myself. Yet, I never really had modelling jobs or had people that were also good looking try to pick me up. I still think I am good looking though, but if I continue this I would be a full-blown narcissist (as if I'm not one already..) and be addicted to instagram and taking pictures like I am now. I wouldn't just 'forget it' because I probably knew I wasn't cute enough to take pictures and focus on my interests more.

Okay, I know it's nice to recieve compliments and be regarded as good looking in my community but judging from the outcomes, what if I'm not as pretty or cute like I thought I was?

Right now I (M18) have been going out with my gf (F18) for a little over six months, but we were friends for over 5 years beforehand.

I know staying in a loveless relationship isn't fair on either of us but I don't think I'm physically able to end things with her as I know she's still really invested in it, as well as it being my first proper relationship and I don't know how to go about ending things with her.

355,"I'm not here to beg for money, I feel like that is important to clear up right away, I'm here to vent and ask for advice from people who have found success even through their own struggles. I'm also not sure why I decided to do this - I woke up at about 5 a.m. after a long and stressful dream, sweating, and at my wits end. I have lurked Reddit for a long time and apologize for not really knowing how to format, but I've heard of strangers helping strangers on this site in the past and am desperate to the point of pathetically begging for help on the internet. I have never really been someone to put myself out there, even with the internet as a ""safety shield"" I still feel really uncomfortable sharing my sob story, or even asking for advice/help in general, so here goes. I'm nearly thirty, depressed, jobless, and not very good at a lot of things. I enjoy the escape video games provide and the feeling of fantasy of writing short stories, but honestly I'm not good enough to earn money doing either. I am lucky enough to be married to the most compassionate, loving, and giving human being on the planet. Without her I would literally be homeless, or dead. Hence why I am here. I've suffered from crippling depression for almost fifteen years, I've sought help, but hate the feeling of depending on pills especially when it isn't an exact science. Anyways, my sisters and I grew up with a physically and sexually abusive meth addict father, we've all watched helplessly as he beat my mother, or our siblings, and had to deal with his tyranny for nearly a decade before my mom fled to her brother across the country. We stabilized for a while, but my sisters were getting into trouble for acting out and I never really learned how to cope with my feelings. I didn't really have trouble in school until I was a teenager, when all of my issues began to gnaw at me and overflow during my early phases of puberty. Unfortunately I dropped out and made the mistake of moving to California, with my dad. He has been in and out of prison most of my life and if I could go back, I never would have moved in with him. Eventually (duh) he tried to get sexual with me while high on meth and I flipped out. Thankfully I was big enough at this point to defend myself and after escaping and a phone call with a long-time friend, he bailed me out and bought me a plane ticket. He let me stay with him until I got up on my feet. While living with him I met a really cool girl who shared a lot of my interests, and eventually we started dating. One day (around July 2012) I found out she was cheating on me when I went to her work to surprise her with lunch (I wasn't even suspicious in the slightest) and found out the hard way that she had been manipulating and lying to me for nearly an entire year. I was suicidal and began to cut myself (thankfully I was too naive on the subject and failed), but the feeling in my heart... the way it actually felt when it broke, I swear there was an audible popping noise, is something I will never forget. We were both young (she was eighteen, me nineteen) and I can't blame her for being adventurous and wanting to explore relationships with other people, but I wish she would have just been more honest about it - it would have saved me a lot of pain. To stop the pain I coped by drinking and letting myself become numb to things. My compassionate and sensitive self became a mean spirited non-caring person. I built a wall around my heart (angsty I know) and lost a lot of friends and family because I alienated them. When I met my wife I really didn't like her, I was mean to her, sometimes bordering cruel.. which I am very ashamed to admit. Eventually she began to chisel away at the wall around my heart and somehow she made her way in, I remember weeping for actually feeling something again, which is pretty pathetic I know. Anyways, I feel like I've vented and shared enough so I'll keep the next part as short as possible. I am a jobless mess of a person and it feels nearly impossible for me to find work. I don't have a license and I will never drive a car out of sheer terror. When I'm in the car I can get really mean and anxious, it's a reflex I can't help. I have actively walked Main Street (we live close to downtown) for months and applied to nearly every shop on Main, gone back in to show interest, called, everything, but since we live in a small college town when something opens it's usually taken within a few days (or so I guess, I think I'm just unemployable). I've put my resume on indeed, scoured craigslist, tried applying for freelance work like transcribing, or customer service, streaming on twitch, writing a novel, washing dishes, cooking, cleaning and I've failed. I don't want to be a failure, and I know not everyone can be a success on our planet, but everything I've done up to this point feels like a waste and more than anything in the world I just want to help support my wife the way she has supported me. How can I support her financially if I'm unemployable? How can I earn money if I'm not even good enough to hold down a dish washing job? Is there any bare minimum things I can do to earn money to help support her? I'm sorry to burden you with my problems, but I would really appreciate your advice Reddit, sincerely.",13Apr2019,1
357,"I have this friend who goes to the same college as I do and we've been friends for quite some time now. During a particularly long conversation about various things, I developed feelings for her. At first, I thought it was just a phase but, when those feelings started to get more intense, I decided to ponder upon them. 

As anyone else, I started to find out how viable this relationship could be if she agrees to it. 

I quickly realized that she probably won't have feelings for me as, she already had a boyfriend then who was living on the other side of the city we live in. More over, I dated one of her friends for 2 months before we understood we weren't right for each other. 

Among all of these intricacies, I decided to confess my feelings for her because I couldn't keep them to myself anymore. I did it a few days after she broke it off with her boyfriend. She turned me down and said that she only thought of me as a best friend and nothing more. 

I was pretty upset and we mutually decided to get through this together because our friendship means a lot to us. So, we started trying out various methods by which I could get over her. Some of them worked, some of them didn't and the very fact that I'm writing this should make it obvious that nothing we did could help me get over her. 

She is now getting closer to her ex-boyfriend again and it feels like someone is stabbing me every time she talks about him. They apparently aren't dating but are just friends for the time being. She continued to tell me that she still loves him and would plan on getting back but, she has a lot of thoughts on her mind. 

We've become extremely close. I cant cut ties with her, she means too much to me. But, every time she talks about him, the pain is just unbearable. I don't know what to do anymore. It's been around 6 months since I confessed my feelings to her. Sometimes, I feel like I'm the bad person in her life and keep messing up when she has given me so many chances. I feel like if I wasn't in her life, things would be so much better for her but, I can't distance myself from her (I know I sound selfish). I haven't had a friend like her. Ever. She's the best thing that happened to me.

It hurts because my dad works 13 hours 6 days a week for her and my siblings. 

All she ever talks about is how she lives in a shithole (a house in good condition that has the nornal weekly cleaning requirements) and screams her head off to wake everyone up to get everyone to clean because ""she shouldn't do it"" 

Anyway, this has been going on for years and I have had enough. I went to go talk to my dad who was sitting in the driveway crying and I started telling him what she just did to me. 

She came out of the house and made my dad roll the window down and she started to yell at me again about if I use a towel it needs to be washed and then she's like you know what don't use my fucking towels buy your own. I'm like okay fine. 

Then she threatens ""You know what you keep this shit up and I'm going to post these pictures of you playing with my feet as a kid on the internet"" I'm 18 now, I stopped that shit at like 8 years old.

Anyway, this happened yesterday. I was on the same trip with his parents and i noticed his dad has this huge oxygen tank with him, he didnt really look good either so it was really apparent that the old man needed some medical assistance. Not long after our eyes locked, just when i started believing he remembered my face (because, like any normal friendship, i used to drop by their residence and sometimes eat dinner with them) people started rushing onto him, surrounding him...i heard a few, weak weeps. Then i looked over and a nurse was doing the 'thing' and his wife was crying... I opened messenger and slid into my 'friend's inbox, prompting him to give his mom a call. Didnt want to be the bearer of such bad news.

Now, we dont talk anymore, not really. We were best buddies since 3rd grade but drifted apart when we got into college despite enrolling in the same school. But the point is, we're practically strangers again and the last time i talked to him was like 7 months ago, on messenger and it wasnt even really a conversation. 

But amidst all that, I still do care about the guy, hes been my closest friend growing up and his family was so kind to me. But I would never guess that I will be the one to hold the door while some personnels bring his father's corpse outside of the room.

366,"I've looked around online for answers, but this one is a little more nuanced and I'm not sure how to handle it.

As a company, we all generally work from home, so we only spend time together as a group a few times a year (our event locations change, but we're US-based) usually for about a week at a time for company retreats or conferences. Because it's an issue so rarely, I think we've all been somewhat reluctant to address it. 

However, I think it's reached a point where something needs to be done. Many people in our close-knit company have stopped making free time plans publicly in favor of backchannels to avoid this person asking to join in or showing up, and it's clear that this person feels sad and disliked without an understanding of why.

Here are the specific challenges:

1. This co-worker is *extremely* sensitive. They have a lot of social anxiety already, and informing them of the issue would absolutely 10/10 devastate them. Without hyperbole, I fear that informing them directly could create a suicide risk.
***


2. I'm not positive that it's a hygene issue. It might be a hormone that this person is releasing, because not everyone can smell it. To some of my coworkers (and my spouse), this person has no discernible scent at all. To others, their smell is absolutely unbearable. To those of us who can smell them, the scent is extremely pungent and urine-like in odor. I personally get a splitting headache if they are anywhere within 5-6 feet of me. 

This person has diabetes and is morbidly obese (400+), and their smell seems to worsen throughout the week. The first day or two of any company gathering, they usually don't smell much, but by the end of the week, the smell has reached an unbearable level, especially when they shift around or sit with their arms on top of their head, which they seem to like to do often. It certainly _could_ be hygene, as other parts of their appearance do suggest that they are unkempt (often food on their clothes, messy hair, unbrushed teeth), but traditional personal body odor is usually obvious and offensive to everyone, and this person's scent isn't.
***


3. On a personal level, I really like this person as a friend. Online, we chat frequently and get along very well. This person doesn't have a lot of work friends and has trouble fitting in due to a few obnoxious habits, so when we are together as a company this person tends to seek me out to sit next to me or hang out with me at every given opportunity. 

Even at large conferences, they will reliably find me like a heat-seeking missile all day. Because their smell gives me a splitting headache, I am torn between trying to make sure they don't feel actively disliked and doing anything I can to avoid being physically near them without it being blatantly obvious that I'm doing so. 

This balancing act gives me constant anxiety at company events and honestly kind of ruins the otherwise wonderful experience for me every time.

368,"Basically the company that hired me misled me about every aspect of this job. I was sent to a town (population 400) in the middle of nowhere. A few locations were mentioned during the interview process. This town was never mentioned and isn’t remotely close to any of the places that were mentioned. The offer letter I received had a different location listed on it as well. I was told I’d be receiving paid trips home and per diem. Just before arriving here I was told that employees with my title would not receive per diem or paid trips home.

I work 13 hours a day and I have to work 18 days straight to get 3 days off. I receive no overtime pay or per diem. The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries. I’m not getting enough sleep and I don’t have enough time to eat. 

I don’t see how these conditions are sustainable for the next year. Would I be stupid to leave this situation after only two months here? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I could find another job without too much difficulty that pays approximately the same salary for half the work hours in a much better location. What should I do?",13Apr2019,1

371,"Bit of context: She's a midwife, and her excuse for not vaccinating her son? 

* The Injections inject viruses into the blood and it's harmful to the baby

I went for the scientific approach and told her that the virus is already ""dead"" and her child's body is gonna learn to defend itself against the bacteria, once it had learnt how to, if the virus were ever to come back, the body will have already learned how to defend itself. 

Her response: I'm only 16 and I don't know anything while she's a midwife so she is more knowledgable

* Vaccines cause Autism

The easiest way to respond? There were several people in the room, all of which were vaccinated, I asked if any of them were autistic, she said no, she said that Andrew Wakefield did his research and said not all people are gonna get autism from vaccinations. I asked her what are the chances and she said she doesn't know, I knew that she was just waffling at this point, she knew I was winning the Argument. 

Her husband is very ignorant, and doesn't really want to be knowledgable in this topic, so I left him out of it

374,"There’s a lot of backstory here but basically I have been through a lot of really bad things in the past five years. Parent died of cancer horribly,
other parent almost died of cancer, ex-fiancé left me.

I am not the type of person who falls in love with every other guy I meet, or who even develops an attraction for people easily. So I’ve been slow to get back into dating, although I’ve had a few tepid relationships that didn’t last since my big breakup. 

So, I started a new job in September and I instantly connected with a coworker.  We make each other laugh any time we talk, to the point where my face hurts from smiling so much and my abs ache from laughing so hard. Whenever we talk it’s like 17 different conversations happening at once because we’re so frantically telling stories and jokes and just connecting on so many levels. Same occupation, same pastimes, same humor, same political views, it’s just crazy.  I never expected to meet someone who I connected with so well.  I’m sure a lot of you have experienced this - it’s just one of those special people in life that get you in every way. It doesn’t happen often.  

I can definitely tell that he also noticed and feels the same way about it. He hasn’t come out directly and said it, but it’s obvious and he’s slipped and said a few things that make it obvious. 

But of course, as I said in the title, he’s married AND he has kids. So this absolutely cannot happen in any way.  

It’s so hard because we work together and we see each other every day. I’ve tried to stop joking around and just be more transactional in our conversations,  but it’s so hard because I’m fighting every emotional instinct all day long. 

I’m so sad and frustrated that I happened to meet someone who I connect with on so many levels but it’s completely impossible. I’m finding it hard to get excited about meeting anyone else. And I try not to let myself fantasize about him while I’m awake, but I have a sex / cuddling / romance dream about him pretty much any time I fall asleep. 

I feel like such a creep for liking someone who is married, and so lame because at this point in my life I really don’t have too much else to be excited about (which I’m working on - I do see a therapist about my grief and all of my difficult life changes, but it doesn’t fix itself overnight). He’s the best part of my day.  Meanwhile, he’s with his family and while I know I’m on his mind at times, and I know he does feel frustrated and suppressed in his life, ultimately he goes home to a wife and kids and I go home to my apartment and feel super pathetic for thinking about him. 

I even feel bad for his wife and kids because he’s mentioned often that she doesn’t get his humor and that he feels like doesn’t get any time to just ”be a human” because he’s constantly working or taking care of his kids. I can’t imagine their marriage is going super amazingly right now.  I’d hate if my husband were flirting with some younger single girl at work, so I feel bad about her perspective too. 

I know all of this logically, but when I see him in person I lose my logic and emotion takes over. 

TL;DR: Huge crush on married coworker with kids, know it can’t happen but struggling with how to get myself to get over it.",13Apr2019,1

377,"I'm sitting at my desk at work writing this and I just feel...dead. Worthless. Confused.

I'm 20F and work as a salesperson at a dealership. I do fairly well for myself, so much so I was able to move out and get my own apartment with a roommate. 

I used to get excited about my job. Selling cars, meeting new people, and getting them out of bad financial situation with their vehicle, or simply getting the vehicle they want. I take pride in my work and making sure my customers leave with a good experience. 

I've been doing this for just under a year, next month will be a year. But due to an employee that was fired and coming back, I'm no longer comfortable in this environment. She constantly talks bad about me, and has managed to turn the staff against me. I no longer talk to one of the other salespeople. The other one still has polite conversation with me, and the other is new and has no idea of the drama going on behind the scenes. 

To add, I'm salary, not commission, but I usually make more in salary than I would in commission. And I have no drive. I feel dead. I can't shake this feeling of ""so what? Nothing matters"". 

I quit school after a semester and a half and I can't find anything I'm passionate about. Everything sounds exhausting. I don't want to go back to school. If I do, I would have to move back in with my parents, but I don't want to lose that freedom. And this job, with no college, is the only place I can work that will afford me the ability to live on my own. 

I don't know what to do. I'm worn out and I'm constantly tired. I hate my work environment, and I kind of just hate myself. I got drunk last night just to help me fall asleep. I have no friends to hang out with, not even my roommate. She's caught up with her boyfriend and her own career. I feel like I have no where else to turn besides internet strangers. 

So here I am, asking for advice or words of encouragement.

Okay so I (F18) work at a pretty run down place in California and I’m not sure if how they’re running is completely legal or moral. I’ve heard that when there is a meeting at your job on your day off you are allowed to clock in if you go until the meeting is over. Not sure if that’s true and google wasn’t much help. Secondly, we close when it rains and usually the owner still makes us come in and we would be 20 minutes into our shift and he will tell us all go clock out and go home. After I have spent 20 on an Uber just to get there! For 20 minutes of work? I’ve heard that we should get a minimum of 2 or 3 hours at least of work if that happens. And this has happened on several occasions. Finally the girls in the kitchen don’t have a food handlers card. I’ve seen how they make the food and let me just tell you. If someone were to get E. coli or food poisoning I would not be surprised. When the health inspector did come the manager did something completely insane and I won’t get into that unless you guys wanna hear it. Next, this place only hires young kids. I’m saying not one person over 21 works here, which is bad on so many levels because the managers are overly emotional and young. I believe it’s partly in fact because they know anyone older would have been reported this place or because they won’t take shit that we young kids do. The managers are also very verbally abusive towards people when they’re not around. I’m not sure if this is a good reason to report this place but I’d appreciate some advice.",13Apr2019,2

- People think I’m great (ok looks, top of the class, good job &amp; salary), but I always feel that I’m a fake and that they’ll find out I’m not as great as they think I am. 
- It always feels like I’m always out there to impress. I’m not sure if it’s also because of my background (i.e. Asian family who try to avoid failure &amp; “face” being very important) that I can’t help but mind what others might think and be too self-conscious.
- I’ve been on a few relationships (that I guess I wasn’t ready for) but they didn’t end too well cause I get too clingy and stuff. 
- It’s hard for me to make friends now that I just moved to an entirely new city for work because I’m scared cause they mostly have existing networks.

He doesn’t like people at all other than me. He won’t let anyone else touch him, and if there’s other people around he clings to me. (Hides behind my legs, wants me to hold him the whole time etc.) despite that he is never mean. He doesn’t show signs of aggression towards them at all. One of my dogs is three and one is four. The four year old loves my cat. They are inseparable. They always share a bed, and both are very protective of each other. My cat likes to sit on his back and purr. It’s very cute. (Sorry that’s not important but its sweet.) my three year old dog is completely fine with him when I’m not there. My roommate has seen them all over top of each other, playing and overall being nice. She (my 3yr old) will lick him and  get all up in his face (not in a mean way, in a playful “hey pay attention to me” way. When I’m home it’s a completely different story. She growls at him, she chases him away if he sits near me, etc. she’s never bit him or hurt him in any way. She doesn’t continue to chase him. She just does until he’s away from me and then stops.

387,"Awhile ago I was in the Queen(British Rock Band) Community/Fandom. I was in this community for around 10 years and made many friends, but after awhile I was dying down in the community, never speaking as much, not participating in many community challenges and such. While I was dying down I found out about the movie ‘The Greatest Showman’ starring Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron to name a few. So I watched the movie and became quite addicted to it, there was something about this movie that Queen didn’t have to me, it was just different which I needed. So after some debating, I finally left the Queen fandom and moved over to The Greatest Showman. While I was gradually moving over, I told many close friends that I was leaving, and they were quite accepting of my decision and told me that I was making a good choice(the part of the community I was in was quite ehh at times.), that was until someone who said I was their best friend(I wasn’t) came along and had a pure flipping go at me for making the decision to leave. At first I was a bit surprised because most had been okay and accepting to me, but this person wasn’t, Which was a first for them. After telling them I was still going, but I would be back and forth between communities(to check in and such) and a few others, they just told me that they didn’t care and left me. After a few weeks, I thought they stopped talking to me, no it wasn’t. While I was in a chatroom with some irl and internet friends, they joined and started accusing me over stupid things, thankfully my irl friends got them kicked out temporarily so they could rethink what they just said(the chat was public btw). Over the next few days, they’d have a go at me whenever, throwing screenshots into an OOC chat we are in, accusing me ect. They continue to do this, and whenever I’m on, they come on, wait a bit to see who I’m talking to then burst in and start it, I’m just absolutely done with their shiz.

390,"Everyone in my office is getting new computers this weekend. The install guys are from our main office which is out of state. They are here for several days including Friday and Saturday nights. I offered to take them on a dive bar tour and dinner on Saturday night, and they quickly accepted. The other people in my office that might go have other plans and/or aren't available to meet up. My plan includes one drink each at three different bars, dinner, one drink at an arcade with games from the 70s, and Uber.

On Thursday, I was talking to the two guys and one of the local employees (she's one who could go but is busy) about what we are doing and where. The employee raised her eyebrows and said to us, ""So you want them to get shot?"" I was shocked and immediately replied that the bars and location are not dangerous. (I live in this area of the city. She knows this.) She walked away with them and said in a loud voice over her shoulder, ""That bar (by name) has been robbed more than any other bar in the city (by name)."" She was in the middle of the office and several other employees were seated right by her, so they could hear her.

When I left the office on Friday, I gave my phone number to the guys, and asked them to call me when they are finished working on Saturday and we will make specific plans. Neither of them said anything about going or not, but they took my number. I didn't ask for theirs, so I am leaving it up to them if they want to go.

I spoke to my colleague about her comments, that they were inappropriate at best. I reminded her that I live in that part of town, it's not dangerous, that bar was robbed once 28 years ago, and I am friends with the owners. She said she told the guys they would have fun with me and she was sorry she can't go. I didn't hear her say that, but to me, that is irrelevant. Suggesting that I'm taking them someplace dangerous and adding the other commentary was wrong and made it appear I'm reckless and uncaring about my coworker's safety.

Advice part: I’m a femboy. Have been for a while and I’ve been dropping hints for a while. My hair has grown really long and I love it like that, though I need to go get it trimmed down soon. My only issue is that I haven’t spilled anything to my parents and I’m scared to ask for a more feminine haircut as I don’t know what the blowback from that would be. I also don’t know how I’d tiptoe about the issue of me being gay. 



Rant: I wasn’t well liked by the guys in my elementary school. I was nerdy and quiet and soft spoken so the girls took me in and let me hang out around them. This continued up until middlenschool. I was well tapped into my feminine side and eventually middle school forced me to shake that off in order to not get bullied quite as much. Towards the end of 8th grade i went ahead and start to tune back into that side. Of course, my school being a lutheran and relatively conservative in a rich, white, conservative and christian neighborhood this came as a culture shock to my fellow class mates. 


During the summer time me and some friends went ahead and had sleep overs. We had lots of fun and one time me and a friend snuggled. It wasn’t just like ‘There’s no more room looks like we have to do it.’ No...it was a passionate and loving snuggle. This kinda of tapped into the gay side of me and I’ve been privately getting in tune with that.

On the other hand, my other best friend was Henry, who I’d known for much much longer than most of the people in my friend group. Anyway, Jen was kinda the alpha male type(but female), and kinda tried to lead the group which I didn’t really have a problem with, and neither did Bea or Lee, so we kinda just didn’t acknowledge it and let it flow like that. Lee is really unproblematic so during the course of this I’m not even sure if she knows the extent of the current situation., and since Jen Bea and I have math class together, it would be expected that we all walk out together right? no. For the last month or so they’ve been walking together and without me, and I often find myself really hurt. Anyway, Jen started dating Henry, and I was really happy for them, until it took a toll on her personality and she became someone much more petty and complicated. Henry and I also distanced a lot. One day after math I finally tell Bea, who is probably my best friend ever, that it really hurts my feelings when they always forget I’m there and walk without me. Bea says she didn’t realize it because she just follows Jen and Jen is the one who probably has something to do with it. So I sit at lunch by myself (take note this doesn’t happen regularly) for a few minutes and people speculate I’m upset but nothing really happens until Jen asks for a comb and Bea says that I have one so I take my comb out my backpack when Jen literally says “uhh you know I’m ok,” and goes to her other friends. 5 minutes later, a girl who ISNT in our friend group (who I’m very close with) is sitting alone but SMILING and Jen says “omg she looks upset we should go cheer her up!!!” And they all (including me) go up to her and see if she’s ok etc. But that’s when I realize how their reaction towards her differs from me. And now people are inviting Jen and not Bea or I or inviting I and not Bea or Jen and stuff like that and Henry is just a mess right now and I have no idea what to do because we were such a stable group of friends but now there’s actual drama and I’m beginning to realize how toxic Jen is but we were so close until like yesterday...

So it's been a few days now and I kind of want to reach out to him, maybe see if he wants to grab a coffee? I'm not one to just go out of my way to message people and usually second guess myself... Could anyone give me any ideas of what I could say to him? 😅

Much appreciated..",13Apr2019,1
401,"My girlfriend says when something bad happens to you, it can either be taken well or badly. If it's taken well, it's strength. If it's taken badly, its weakness. 
As someone who is more sensitive than most other people I know, I'm easily affected by things but instead of taking them well i almost always take them badly. This my girlfriend cannot stand as it is weakness although she loves that i am sensitive.
All my life i never really took too many risks in fear of being humiliated or hurt. I think that's why i never learned to to be strong and take things well. 
Is it okay to ask her to love me as who i am? As someone who is mentally weak? She says its okay to be weak at times but not all the time. But more often than not i take things badly and me being sensitive makes matters worse as the result is me just getting upset very often. Will anybody accept a person like me? Or is it me who needs to change?",13Apr2019,0

403,"So I(19m) and one of my closest friends (18f) sleep in the same bed from time to time because we spend a lot of time together. And I have the biggest crush on her and she knows it but she has a boyfriend that goes to another school. From time to time we hold hands while we fall asleep.  (I know that sounds sketchy but she just likes any sort of affection so I can assure you she’s not doing weird cheating type moves.) Basically what I’m trying to make you understand is that her sleeping in my bed and stuff is normal in our relationship. So I found out today that apparently sometimes she wakes up and I AM CUDDLING HER, HAVE MY ARMS AROUND HER AND SOMETIMES MY LEGS.  And she says this has happened many many times but I’m just finding out about this now. This freaked me out because when I’m falling asleep I’m literally never doing that. So I don’t know what is going on while I’m sleeping to make me do that and I need advice for how to make this not happen anymore because I’m not trying to make her uncomfortable obviously.",13Apr2019,3

406,"Important part: I'm fucking desperate I don't care if you believe me just give me am answer.

Context part: I'm forced to go with some family on some roadtrip they decided on a whim. I'm not unable to say no because my dad's already convinced that the only reason I wanna stay home is that I'll just stay here and face the computer all day. I told him he could bring the laptop with them but he still said no because I'd probably just read some book or some shit, and that I ""need to experience more things"". 

Anyway all of the roadtrips have been this way and its a miracle no one has died yet I still remember that one time the driver was asleep and we had to wake him up and have our cousin take over, and the one time where the driver thought we were asleep so he didn't stop the van to take the call but answered it while driving real fucking fast anyway. Anyway I was really fucking terrified of the last few times but apparently this also wasn't a valid answer because it would be an embarrassment for having such a disobedient child.

408,"I always try to be as honest as possible in anything especially to my employers but i am in a dilemma right now. Before my current job i was still somewhat fresh out of school and lacked experience. I needed a job so during the interview I noted my lack of experience but said I was determined and asked for a low starting wage because of that fact.  Been with the company for a year and 6 months now and I feel im not given anything significant to work on, to the point where I  stopped giving 100% effort. Because of how stagnant I've been at my current job I feel I cant even ask for a raise (Even though im being paid close to minimum wage and probably the lowest paid employee at the company).

I feel the root cause of this was for selling myself short at the interview. I dont want to oversell myself and say I can do something and have it end up blowing up in my face, but if I want to grow as a person, would it be best to say I can do certain tasks to allow myself to work with people more familiar and Learn as I go?

I was hanging out with him and he gives me $10 for my birthday, which was surprising since I don't expect people to get me gifts anyways, and he says ""Sorry, your brothers gift is a little bit better."" . I was like ""ok not that big of a deal."". Later when my twin came over, he gave him his gift, which was a pair of $110 Shoes. ( I'm 16 btw)

my first thought was ""how is that a 'little bit ' better?"" I feel like I shouldn't be mad but it's not the gift that makes me angry, it's the fact that it makes me feel like I was an afterthought , and to top it all off, they just sit there and talk about the shoes and keep bringing up the price of the shoes.

So as it turns out months after we had this conversation with me making it very clear we were just friends, he has moved more than 12 hours away, but he starts saying things suddenly making it very clear that he wants me to be more than just friends again. I approach the situation with all the gentleness and caution I can muster. I tell him in the most considerate way possible that I don't see him the same way, but what ensues after that was unexpected and uncalled for. He is understandably upset, but then he just starts saying terrible things about me. How I'm a terrible person and not being fair. About how he still loves me and can treat me better than any man.

He came over to my house wearing clothes way to big for him, his beard was patchy and untrimmed, with his long unkempt hair and he had the demeanor of a gangster and talks like one too. My mom was actually startled by him and approached me later out of concern. The reason why I hung out with him in the first place is behind all that he is a good person deep down he is fun to talk to and has a lot of fun unique experiences and stories to share.

I think I was 7 and my older brother was 8 when he told me ""take off your pants and if u tell our mother I'll hit u"". I remember being naked from the waist down and lying in bed while he was watching me (he didn’t touch me). This memory never went away and when I was a teen it made me feel afraid of men and I had problems with my sexuality.

When I was 14, I told my mother what happened bc I felt guilty for hiding this from her. She just stared at me looking very disturbed but she didn’t do anything. I felt sort of relieved when I confessed but that feeling didn’t last.

Even though what happened when we were kids never happen again, the relationship that I had with my brother was awful. He hit me until I was 13 and he always criticized me, made me feel small and weak. I felt like I didn’t have a safe space in my own house, bc he was in control of everything, sometimes he decided to be “friendly”, other times he was a bully.

Also I have a little brother (George) who is 5 years younger than me and I was always afraid that Ed would do to him what he did to me. It caused me so much anxiety to keep an eye on them. Ed was always hitting him (as part of a ""game”) sometimes he even touched his butt (he even did that in front of my parents, but they didn’t care at all). One day, when I was 22, my parents were planning a vacation trip, George came to me and told me that he was afraid that Ed would abuse him in the absence of my parents. In that moment I felt so guilty for not being able to protect him, but it was hard and confusing for me bc I always felt that I was overreacting bc my parents saw the same things I did but they didn’t care. But I realized that I wasn’t the one that was fucked up or making things up and that there was a serious issue with Ed so I decided to tell my mom what George told me but not very convinced she said to Ed ""stop touching your brother's butt"". 

Last year (I was 24) my mother got angry with me bc I didn’t hang out with Ed, I said to her: do u want me to spend time with the person who abused me? She started crying, I told her that she didn’t protected me, she told me that she was sorry, that she went to a therapist but he didnt help much and that she was going to fix this. Then this happened:

They took me to a psychologist and a month later, my parents told Ed to leave the house for a while.   
 2 weeks later my parents asked me if Ed could come back but I wasnt ready  
 2 months later they told me Ed and I should start to taking turns to be at home. I decided to stay in my boyfriend's parent’s house. My parents hated that idea, they thought I should stay with a family member like my uncle (Im Latina so family is a big deal). But I was really depressed and I wanted to stay where I felt comfortable, I tried to stay at my uncle's house but I didn’t like it.   
 My mother told me that she needed to know when Ed could definitely come back. I told her that it wasnt ok that she put me a deadline to heal. She insisted so I told to her that at the end of the year.  
 On Dec I moved to my boyfriend's parent's house for 5 months, so my brother could come back for good. My parents were devastated that I left.  
 I was really depressed, I had to quit my job and all I could think of was the hurtful things that my parents had told me (f.ex ""u don’t care about our family”). My parents don’t think that what happened when we were kids was an “abuse” bc Ed was a kid too. My brother started to be more victim than me. 

Now I’m back at my parents’ house bc Ed is travelling. Soon I’ll have to find another place to stay until Sept bc then Im going to study abroad. My parents want to fix this before Im gone, but I dont know how to. They dont understand that Im traumatized. What should I do?",13Apr2019,1

420,"It’s a really long story. Basically, since I’ve been younger I’ve had a slew of health problems. I’ve been to countless doctors and specialists and no one could really figure out what was wrong with me. Until I went to the doctor that changed my life. She was the only doctor to listen to me and has helped me through numerous problems since the 10 years when I first started seeing her. 

Around October of last year I visited her office and was surprised to see a girl who I know working there. This girl is awful. She’s a horrible racist and antisemite, and posts things to support this on her Facebook. I had to block her when her and her husband were very short of threatening me and my family. (My family is one of a handful of Jewish families in my small hometown of about 7,000). I really don’t feel comfortable with this person having access to my medical information so I stopped going to the clinic since then. 

And lo and behold, I’m back to having awful experiences at the couple of clinics in my town. Appointments have been dropped, no one calls me to confirm anything, and I feel like in general the quality of the care I get is worse.

During mine and her relationship, while she lived at my house, she became close with him too. Suddenly she was running his errands and he was buying us food and taking our trash out and doing “boyfriend type” things. I questioned this.  She played it off as if he was just a lonely old man who needed friends. He would make strange sexual innuendos to us, and I just chocked it up to him being an “old dirty man”...

Ok so I am a 22 male in a moderate muslim country, my family considers themselves to be religious, especially my father after suffering two heart attacks, he stopped drinking and he prays 5 times a day, my mother doesn't do her daily prayers or anything, but she claims to be very religious as well. I've had a great childhood as far as I can say but I was always limited by my family, I was never allowed to play outside without my mom, and she would get ultra mad at me if I did something she wouldn't want, she also forced me to play a sports that I was not really interested in for 8 years so I had some rough times as well, I was more afraid of my mom than I loved her and my father, well we don't talk much except for the greetings. I don't even remember the last time we had a casual conversation. Fast forward from my childhood to my late teen years. I am unsure of my sexuality, I am getting introduced to weed which seemed like a relief at that time an escape. I felt like I didn't belong with my family, there was literally no one in my family that understood me or shared my thoughts on the world as a whole.  Around this time I told my mom that I didn't believe in Allah that I didn't know what I believed in, but whenever I tried to believe it just wouldn't happen... She was devastated and said that she would do anything to get me religious again but we never talked about it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was qualified to study college abroad but my family didn't allow me I was forced to take my country's university admission tests and I didn't do very well, I go into some ok ish university and this is where it goes all the way down to the shithole I found myself in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was not content with my life, there was no one I could connect to in my family, I couldn't find a decent girlfriend and at that time I still thought I may not even be straight, even though I lost my virginity at that point. That's when I have started smoking weed every day, for 2 years I wasted my youth with friends who I only hanged out with because we all liked smoking weed together. During this time I got caught by my parents a lot, I am just not careful, and really reckless. But one time when I was caught I actually stopped smoking for 2 and a half months and honestly that was the hardest period of my life, I considered ending my life a few times, I was extremely depressed even though I was doing better at school but nothing would make me happy, so I relapsed, started with a joint a week and now I was smoking several times a week. But in the last few months I met a girl that I fell in love with, we are really into each other and honestly I have never felt so good in my life, I was constantly smiling and always positive, she became the purpose of my life, the reason I got out of bed and everything, she is all I can think of she doesn't like drugs and I want to quit them for good, for her and myself, but I know if I go cold turkey I may relapse again. But my family is quite mad at me for staying at her house and having her over at our house, my father in particular saying that we should be married to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now fast forward to this morning, I get caught smoking weed after my birthday party, and they have every right to be mad at me it just feels so shitty that this is happening at the same time as I genuinely want to stop smoking weed. They argue with me and want to know why I did drugs and I tell them that I felt lonely, that I was depressed, and they mock me, they ask me why I felt lonely, I tell them because I don't feel like I belong with this family, that I don't feel actually loved or understood, that we have different opinions but that is still ok, but they shouldn't be so surprised that I don't like spending time with them. I only asked that I want to be able to see my girlfriend and they told me that under no circumstance I can spend a night with her so I asked them why and they told me it's not appropriate for our muslim family and for the first time in my life I told my father that I didn't believe in islam and Allah, I was expecting him to be sad and all but the reaction he gave... They want me to break up with my girlfriend and stop seeing my friends, go to rehab for weed and of course become a devout muslim, if I don't meet their demands they said they would reject me as their son and leave me to fend for my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what the fuck I will do, I can go to rehab, I can stop seeing my friends but I don't want to break up with my girlfriend, I love her and she's the only thing in this world I care about. Don't know what I expect to get from this post I just needed to get this off my chest.

I move out all my stuff slowly over January and they asked me what i am going to be doing with the rest of the stuff and I tell them I was gonna leave it for them to use (like blankets if they have somebody spend the night, cleaning stuff, and a bunch of minor things) and they all agree that it’s fair and will be their responsibility. So end of January comes around and our bills come in and we had to switch over to M being in charge of them. I pay him my fair share of the utility deposit and when the last bill comes around in my name they are decide to short hand me the actual money by $120 so I bring this up and they all can’t fathom how they short handed me that much but turns out they did the Math wrong. M was being awful about paying me and fighting me saying stuff like, “Your an accountant you should know how to do basic math and understand this stuff!” I just tell him, “Look pay me what you think you owe me. I don’t care at this point. I am done with this whole fight (I was mostly done because he started name calling and getting really angry so I wanted to end the situation before it got out of hand). As time passes I find out they are moving out the apartment and to somewhere else. They decide to text me today (a week before they actually move out) that I needed to get “the crap I left behind” and started listing off everything that they agreed to take and use after I moved out. I told M that he had 2 solid months to tell me to get this so called “crap” and it’s not my fault he waited till now. He then preceded to threaten that I won’t get my utility deposit back if I don’t drive out of my (2 hours) to take out of the dumpster (probably about 30 minutes of work but our dumpster is super close to our house) and I even talked to my landlord and he said if it’s a bunch of small things (like what he listed) then it’s fine and he won’t charge me for it. I even told him some of that crap is from the old tenant that moved out before him. While we arguing he started insulting my manliness and trying to talk smack to me the whole time. I just told him if wants to be petty and take my utility deposit go ahead. I just think it’s kind of pathetic that he 1.) Fails to communicate with me about anything and then tries to say I have all this to do Friday when I have to take an entire trip to Savannah for work this week. And 2.) just insults me and ties to provoke me the entire time. 

C,J and I go way back and they never ever tried to talk to me about any of this. I even told them many times to communicate to me what I need to do or talk to me about it. Should I just not bother worrying about fighting for my utility deposit back and let them have it? Kind of what I want to do. My land lord is gonna walk through the house after they move out but even after I told him what M said I left behind, he told me to not worry about it because if it is minor then it’s not a big deal.",13Apr2019,1
430,"Okay, so, I'm a terrible conversationalist and I don't really have the highest status in popularity at all. I usually hang out with people who usually invite me to lunch and who take an interest in me. Not saying I hate to socialise I'm just an introverted person, but, of late I haven't been emphatic and that's bothering me because I am by nature understanding and empathetic.

Anyway that's enough backstory here's the punchline.

I've been distancing myself from others for months now and I've began to notice more things about myself (and it's not insecurity...for once) but not only that I've began to see how other girls my age act and I just personally don't like it but I don't know what I should do about it. I don't know if I'm jealous because they're prettier or have people who like the stuff they post and notice them/give them such positive responses. I mean does anyone know why exactly they're doing it? I don't want to assume the worst and say attention seeking because that's horrible. But I kinda want a older person's opinion about their experiences and people who are going through this situation right now.

She quickly found another guy. Almost one year passed and I still feel heartbroken, not because of this guy, but because I realised how lonely I am. All my old friends moved far from city, I have noone to meet and have fun.

So, today morning I went to a public garden to relax and maybe study a little bit, and then I sat at a bench, after a while a lady sat next to me, she was  so nice and even offered me some snacks before going. Immediately after that, an old man who looks like he's in his 60 took her place and was like,""hey man what's with the sad look? -(because I kinda was)- did something happen?"" -To clarify things, I'm a really shy guy, I cannot control myself when talking to people I know let alone people I don't know, iow I'm really stupid when talking-.At first he sounded like a guy wanting to help so I kinda felt comfortable with him (and oh do I hate myself for that), the first thing he asked ""where do you live then?"" I almost told him where, instead the place I told him about was still close to where I live,(there's no level of stupidity beyond that), and thankfully, I did something good and did not tell him about which family I come from. So here it starts, out of nowhere he said ""so do you give blowjobs?"",  I was so scared but managed to hold myself for awhile. Now I don't know about other countries but here we have like a million word for the word blowjob, the one he said wasn't now very popular  so I tried to act as if I didn't know what that means, after he kept talking about how you should know this kind of things I said "" I did not sleep very well last night so I want to go home"", That scumbag said ""want me to take you to sleep with me?"" I took off saying that I'm going home.


Right now, I'm really sick and I don't know what to do, I can't bring this subject to my family because of how awkward it is, I tried yet I will keep trying but I don't think it getting there, I only told one friend about it but it seemed like it was too much for him, I don't want to stress more people by asking them for help, please help me

441,"(Tl;DR Background Info is Necessary)

\- The two of them had been dating and living together for about a year and were apparently allowed to hook up with other people as long as they told each other about it in advance

\- Recently my friend told me that they had decided they wanted to break up with their S/O but had to ensure they had another place to live first cause they think they'd be kicked out

\- Prior to this, this friend and I were fwbs on and off maybe like 5 years ago or so, until I started dating someone and slept with my friend around the beginning of this year

\- This friend moved to another town about 3 or 4 years ago and since then still keeps in touch with friends in my town and we talk about once a week to every two weeks

\- Cause I was getting annoyed with stuff in my town and they weren't having a great time in their current situation either (it's not just cause they're breaking up with their S/O soon) I decided to visit my friend 

\- While I was there, we got drunk and ended up having sex and..I was never told anything but kind of had the feeling that his S/O would be mad if he walked in and well he did and I was right, he was pissed

\- I feel conflicted at this part cause I felt at the same time too like my friend was being a bit too cavalier about not getting caught. Like there was a moment where after we got some of my clothes wet in the shower, they just left it up there to dry and was like, ""If ..... asks about that, then we'll just say you got drunk and fucked up."" (I think my friend was also using drunk logic) 

\- About 5-10 mins before S/O got home, I mentioned that maybe should put our clothes back on and start eating, but they said, ""I think 5 mins should be enough to cum."" and like, I was ready to stop at this point, kind of getting turned off over knowing their S/O was coming home, I also thought I should probably let my friend cum but yeah..no we got caught

\- Atm S/O was acting like my friend had just cheated on him even though his S/O also told me, ""you should have let me know way the fuck before, no one told me this was going to happen."" confirming my friend wasn't bullshitting, they really did have this agreement, but their S/O was still telling me they hated me and stuff and never wanted to see me again

\- I actually felt really shitty, cause I was fond of their S/O and considered them a friend even if this had only been my second time seeing them

\- My friend apologized for the trouble and hoped I wasn't mad at them and I wasn't...like I'm really not, I think they were just being careless and while I had moments of proper judgement I didn't speak up and was also pretty careless myself at moments (and also used drunk logic, like I was assuming S/O would knock for some dumb reason) but a part of me still wanted to let them know that? 

\- I was pretty upset by the time I left and I called my friend the day after  and they said that their S/O was literally fine afterward and while S/O had said some pretty intense things, they apparently just had a tendency to overreact to things and was mostly just mad that my friend didn't inform him that we were gonna do something beforehand

\- My friend apologized again for putting me in that situation and said that what happened was mostly their fault and hoped I wasn't mad at them, but for some reason I also deflected it and said, ""It's okay, everyone's careless sometimes, I also wasn't stupid and knew that your S/O would get upset if they walked in.."" and my friend agreed and idk the conversation ended not much longer after

\- I feel like I lost a friend in my friend's S/O and that things ended on a bad note with us

\- I'm not mad at my friend, but I want to let them know I think they screwed up a bit, while also taking responsibility for my own carelessness and not speaking up enough in moments where I had judgement

\- The incident made me feel weird about my fwbs relationship with my friend in general",13Apr2019,1

When I first heard about their relationship it immediately dawned on me that things could end incredibly bitter, they're likely to remain friends or even keep in touch after their relationship since they basically planned for it to end, but something like that will undoubtedly lead to hurt.

466,"I’m 21 years old and from the UK. I’ve had this insecurity for quite some time now. This may be long so please bare with me. 

When I was in primary school (elementary school) I was really good at Maths, it was my specialty and favourite subject. This was my strongest subject up until Year 9. 

In the UK we have “sets” which arranges the students in classes by ability. There were 5 sets in my school, 1st set was where the smartest kids were and 5th set was for the kids with the lowest ability. I was in 3rd set for Maths up until Year 9, then I dropped down to 4th set. I completely bombed that test because there was already answers to that test and I tried to cheat instead of putting my own effort into it. 

For English I was also in 3rd set, I’ve always enjoyed English too for the most part so there’s no issues there. For Science I was in 4th Set in Year 9, then I did to Applied Science in Year 10 (by request I believe) and then I did BTEC Science in Year 11. 

Science has always been my weakest subject so  I didn’t expect much from that. The problem is that BTEC Science is even lower than 5th set, I was in the lowest set possible. If people know that you’re doing BTEC Science then you will be subjected to ridicule. This thought alone was the cause of my social anxiety. 

I ended up doing BTEC Science because I again bombed the exam determining whether I will stay in Applied Science or not. I remember the exam was during the time I had a major depressive episode so I didn’t have any motivation to do well in that exam. I simply didn’t care. I know the teacher in my BTEC Science class even said herself that I shouldn’t be doing BTEC as it is too easy for me. 

Come to GCSEs, I have failed them. It wasn’t because I didn’t put any effort because I actually did this time. I studied as hard as I could and still failed. My method of revising may have been inadequate at the time but it was the method that got me a B in a RE topic test (first time I’ve ever passed a test because I actually studied properly). 

After school finished I went on to retake Maths GCSE, I initially got a D but ended getting an E on the retake. I also failed Level 2 Functional Skills Maths two times. I again do not know how that is possible considering the effort I put into revising but I knew something was not right. 

I have come to realise that my porn addiction during all this time (that I wasn’t aware of) may have played a part in me failing all of these exams. I remember my inability to retain any information after just learning it. I don’t know if I’m making any excuses or if this is the truth since I got a B in the RE test I mentioned. 

I work in a law firm now and I still feel insecure because my close friends are all academically successful and in university while I am not. I can’t stop comparing myself to my former peers and it is torture, this even happens while I’m at work. I don’t know why my intelligence is so important to me but I sometimes get suicidal over this. 

Please tell me how I can get over this insecurity or at least become more intelligent. Your answers are appreciated.",13Apr2019,1
468,"Recently divorced. My wife got to stay in our home. She keeps the kids, I moved in with a friend. We had one vehicle, but she has it to take kids to school ect. , which caused me to loose my job not being able to commute back and forth reliably. I had to place my personal possessions into storage, which I lost due to lack of funds. 

Generally over the last year Lost everuthing I had. I only have a bag of clothes now, and my living situation is tense. They allow me to stay, but the situation is no good for anyone, and everyday that goes by it gets worse. Im an emotional wreck, suck with nothing but this phone to communicate amd try to make moves. I have applied for jobs, but unable to make the commute for them or even interviews..i can not seem to make any move to continue foward. My health is terrible from not eating or eating cheap food. My mental state is worsening from not seeing kids. And since I have been unable to reliably see them , my x does not believe I want to support them and has applied child support onto me. Im behind on that amd soon it will turn into a terrible issue in itself. Which only perpetuates my inability to get on my feet. The few friends i have live far away, as we moved when we got married and I just mainly worked and took care of bills. After the divorce it all just fell apart. 

I feel depressed and have even thought of suicide. If i did not feel the burning desire to be a father and be there for my children who knows...

I just really know If i could get a vehicle of some type. I could live in that while I worked anywhere and saved for my own place. And begin to build again, hopefully. My credit is terrible, fell behind on loans and such after the divorce. Intried to maintain but my savings went quickly and now im at 0. 
.i dont care about material possessions anymore, i dont want anything but to be able to have a car, place to live, and job. Its hard alone and with so much debt%bills growing worse everyday.

Ive tried to research online ways to start to make progress, and I know transportation is first. But for a middle aged single bad credit male. Not much I have found can help. Ive tried working online but thats a joke. Now my emails and calls are all spam and ads and even if i had a real opportunity it gets lost in the spam. 

Im scared. Im lost. Im hurt.

470,"Lately, I’ve been going to bonfires and parties hosted by my friends. Nothing wild, no alcohol or drugs, just us and some other friends hanging out.

My sister, who is a year older than me, has been driving me to these events (because I’ve been putting off getting my license...). She didn’t plan to stay more than ten minutes at the first bonfire, but she ended up staying the entire time.

She is really extroverted and interrupts me constantly, or just changes the conversation topic to something she cares about. I’ll be talking with one of my best friends, and she’ll just suddenly bring something up and take over the conversation. 

Now, she has added some of my friends (who she has never cared about and used to consider annoying) on Snapchat, and it seems like they talk to her more than they talk to me social media. 

At practice, one of my best friends is bringing her up a lot now when he talks to me because she’s talking with them outside of bonfires now. He says stuff like, “You actually looks pretty similar to your sister”, “You guys have the same mannerisms”, or just tells me about some jokes they exchanged when I wasn’t around. My group teases each other a lot, but it’s weird to hear that she knows about the inside jokes about me and is making them herself. 

She’s always been way more popular than me, and I felt like I was living in her shadow a lot when I was younger. People always referred to me and thought of me just as her little sibling. I found my friend group, a bunch of guys she didn’t associate with that I enjoy hanging out with, but now I feel like it’s happening all over again and I’m becoming an extension of her. 

We’re going to another one of my friend’s party tonight and I don’t really know what to do. Should I feel happy that she is being interested in hanging out with me and my friends?  I guess it’s kind of cool that she’s finally hanging out with me and stuff. But, I end up just feeling left out because she tends to do stuff like purposely ignore me if what I’m saying doesn’t interest her, change the topic of conversations when I’m trying to talk to my friends about things, and interrupt my stories and tell them herself. Plus, I’m kind of worried that my friends like her more than me and that I’m going to become “the sibling” again, just tagging along with her.

473,"When I was 11 years old, my father entered my bedroom while drunk and sexually molested me. The next day I told my mother what happened, and she gave my father an ultimatum:

* turn himself in to the police
* or move out immediately, not return to our home or have any contact with my siblings or me without her permission (the other two were 15 and 9 at the time), check in to an inpatient clinic for substance abuse and sexual disorders, grant the clinic permission to discuss his treatment and progress with her, and agree to a divorce depending on the results.

Six months later, having had completed the course of treatment, he visited our house at my mother's invitation and apologized to us for what he had done. Once he had left we had a family discussion about the incident, Dad's treatment, and the possibility of him living with us again -- with the caveat that the decision would be left up to me and my mother and ought to be respected.

Initially, I had some reservations about living with him again. More terrifying than the molestation itself was the fact that my father had so suddenly changed from the Dad I knew and loved to the kind of sick predator I saw on the news, a prospect which caused me anxiety and mood difficulties for which I saw a therapist in my early teens.  And the fact that he was buzzed/drunk when it happened made me wonder if the predator side of him wasn't his ""real"" personality, which would come out again if he were angry or depressed or drank too much.

But I also considered his apology (which seemed genuine); the fact that he had been treated by professionals; and the fact that, if all else failed, he was at least ""on notice,"" and therefore would probably think twice before re-offending (and would go straight to jail if he did). So, I ultimately decided that I could give him another chance. Fortunately, it never happened again (to me or my siblings) and over time things went back to normal.

However, now that I am getting married I am struggling over whether to tell my fiancée about the incident. Since we plan to eventually have children, I can definitely understand her wanting to know about it; even I, who know about it myself and am 99.9999% convinced that he will not re-offend, mentally jump to the 0.0001% possibility when I think about my future children. On the other hand, I really do believe that my Dad is not a pedophile, but that he instead made a horrific and gravely immoral choice one time for which he was severely reprimanded and received professional treatment.

My gut leans toward telling her -- with all context included -- both because ""honesty is the best policy"" and because in dilemmas like these I almost always break the tie in favor of the person who did nothing wrong. My thoughts are that we have early, age-appropriate discussions, not necessarily referencing the incident or my father, with our children about private areas and the importance of going to an adult immediately if those areas are violated -- whether by a family member, teacher, friend, or stranger. If you agree, is there a good way to bring the topic up in a way so that she doesn't treat him like a leper? Or, if you disagree, why so?",13Apr2019,2

476,"**Personal facts:**

My mom can't handle her feelings...since we shift places, she is lonely and now after 10 months have grown some resentments for my dad and her parent's decision! He actually doesn't care about anyone's feeling as long as there's external peace established by someone else(he doesn't even try)

Yesterday, my family went haywire when dad broke her ego! So, she raged irrationally. I can't blame her for she's not mentally okay now.

Now why I explained all this? Cuz there no logic! Dad is a man with no personality whatsoever...he earns normal but behaves irrationally with higher rank people/officers as if they've done bad to him...random! Isn't it? I'd declare it as narcissism! Moms not okay with her life and filled with hella resentments as from long ago.

**My reaction to all this:**

I've spent a good amount of time contemplating this bullshit so much that I got rejected from college. \*cries\*  Now I think what does their problem have to do with me? I wasn't born to solve her problems, give her justice! I wasn't born to make dad realize that life is all about relationships you grow with everyone, love is internal &amp; requires hella understanding and stability.

Why am I subconsciously filled with fear of their separation(if so) and future consequences on parents life and so mine? Why am I worried about her looking at me like she needs help for problems occurred long ago but ignored and healed with time? Why even after all those family dramas, dad finds his way out of it(believe me, he hates office and love sitting around watching TV and reading magazines)? 

My goals are drifting away smacking middle finger on the face!

477,"So as the title says, I’m a 23yr old female. Moved out when I was 18, and have been fully financially independent since graduating college at 22. All through college, I drove a junkyard repair from my grandpa. I didn’t care what it looked like, as long as it got me from point A to point B. As soon as I graduated college, my mom gave me her old car as a graduation gift so I had something a little more dependable. I gladly took it. I’m not the biggest fan of the car by any means, but I wasn’t going to turn it down. 

When I first graduated I was only making about 34k/year entry level in my field. All my money went to savings and paying my bare necessities. Not too long ago I came across a great long term job in my career. I’m making around 60-65k a year to start with a lot of room for promotions. That being said, I saved a decent amount, and am looking to get a car I really like/have always wanted (still used though lol). 

My parents and I have always been pretty close, so I do disclose large decisions or thoughts to them. I am very fortunate to have caring parents. I just recently purchased my first townhouse with my boyfriend, so have a very stable and affordable living situation. I was looking to buy a Mustang as I’ve always wanted one growing up, and I feel now I can actually afford a nice used one. I won’t be driving this car for my entire life because at some point I’ll have kids and need something more practical, but would love to have one while I’m still young.
I’ve done some research and with a 12k downpayment on a lightly used one puts me at very affordable monthly payments. I was also pleased with insurance quotes as well. When I mentioned my decision to my parents they were all up in arms and very upset claiming I was irresponsible. I know it’s not the most dependable car but I really do want to experience having one, especially before kids come into play.

Is it wrong or irresponsible of me to follow through? Should I reconsider?",13Apr2019,1
478,"I live in a house with 3 other students (1 other female and 2 males). The house is falling apart, and as a result I have had problems with a window in my room. 

I text him over a month ago about this, and he didn’t reply. I thought I’d wait it out; he must be busy, right? Fast forward to this week and I got home from a week away to find my blinds completely covered in mould - the house has a serious mould problem in general. I text him again saying that I need to take them down because it is a danger to my house - does he want me to keep them or throw them out? Still, no reply.

So, today we realise we have mice - my male landlord texts him and the landlord replies to him within 5 minutes. 

Am I wrong for seeing this as blatant sexism? The landlord is an old “posh” man. When we first moved in he didn’t trust me to learn how to use the boiler and had my male housemate watch him do it. 

Is there any action I can take? As a result of him ignoring me the window has gotten worse. I’m worried that the reason he has not replied to me is because he wants to charge me for the problems - a waterlogged window-frame which is caused by poor water protection on the outside, and a cracked window pane caused by something hitting it from the the road (possibly a stone).",13Apr2019,3
479,"This is going to be a long post, so I'll try to post a tl;dr at the end. Thank you to those who stick around to read it all, I can answer questions in the comment section.

About three weeks ago my boyfriend had a random hookup with a guy in California a week before coming to see me for the very first time. At that time we were not together but exclusive with each other so I remained abstained from sex with anyone. A week later he comes to visit me states away as I am in the military. That same day I ask him to be my boyfriend and not long after he starts a hypothetical conversation starting with what if I slept with someone before coming here. I already knew it wasn't hypothetical due to the randomness of the discussion. 

A little back story on our relationship, we have been talking through the internet and FaceTiming for about a year with each other before meeting. His older brother who was my roommate at the time introduced us to one another then we slowly built a relationship from there.

Now back to the confession; it came in waves after me digging into him on finding out more information. I am not too mad that he had random sex, but I'm hurt that my trust for him is now significantly lesser for him. I do not want to break up with him because I honestly love the little dude we have all the cute nicknames and what not, and our bickers don't last long because we always end up making each other laugh during a fight/bicker. To me, I can overlook this incident entirely because it was brought up the same day our relationship started. His side of the story is that he didn't think that I was serious in a relationship because he kept asking me for the past 5 weeks the hilarious ""What are we?"" I would tell him to wait until he gets here (so I could ask him to be my boyfriend in person). To him, that meant in his mind that I just wanted to be friends; he had a similar situation in his past where a man came to visit him that when arrived and explicitly stated that they were not dating he was also physically abused by this person. Also, during my finding out he was shaking because he thought I was going to hit him, that made me feel terrible at being angry at him because never in my life would I hurt someone I care intensely for.

That was a gist of what happened, now I just want to find ways to help me build trust with him. We have had very long talks recently about my love and trust being separate entities and how I am beginning to trust him again. But with him being back in California for the next 4 weeks until he comes and moves in with me I keep getting anxiety that it will happen again. I am having scenarios play out in my head! I even downloaded the gay dating app Grindr and uploaded a fake picture and looked around in his area and reached out to people that may go to his campus to ask if he has been up there recently. About an hour after me doing this I called him and confessed what I did on me trying to find him. He was slightly mad, but I guess in a way understanding. I really love this man, and I am really willing to make it work,  never before in my life has someone cared for me the way he has and still have me remain independent of him. Never in my life have I cared for such person and I have been married in the past once before! 

I just really want to unravel why my insecurities are getting the best of me and why I am having such trust issues with him when he has shown time and time again that he is in fact, trustworthy. It bothers me on a profound level.

This man has seen my darkest depths and has decided to stay. While I was deployed in Djibouti he helped talk me through my suicidal thoughts my deepest depressions, and I am not saying that I am only staying because he has seen those parts and decided to stay, I am not dependent on him lifting me back up just that he wanted to help me because he genuinely cares about me and my messed up head.

Bottom line I forgave him but the anxiety gets to me some days, and I need to find a healthy way of dealing with it before it pushes him away. He continually tells me that me forcing it on him won't drive him away and even if that is, in fact, true its most definitely a big exhausting factor emotionally. 

Please help me find coping mechanisms and way to build trust healthily so that when he comes here in four weeks to live with me, I don't destroy a beautiful relationship. Because he is willing to work it out with me and I honestly do appreciate that in a person because in my past, all of my previous romantic partners have given up on me emotionally in some way, and the past relationships did not deal with trust issues per say but other branches of emotion that they did not care to deal with which is totally understandable I am not trying to lay my feelings on someone else, that is wrong. Just when I get in my feelings it tends to want to spill to the person I am closest with, and yeah I need SOS.

TL;DR: Current boyfriend had a random encounter a week before the relationship started, understandable reasoning to which has been forgiven entirely but trust issues still somewhat remain due to my own insecurities and me laying my emotions on him which will eventually push him away if I don't find good/healthy trust-building techniques, please give advice.",13Apr2019,1

482,"I've been reading these threads for months and decided it was time to create an account and throw my hat in the ring in the hopes that one of you might know about something I don't.  Last year I moved my mother out of my dad's house and into mine because of her health. Over the past year, I've become my mom's mom, and it's just a lot harder than I thought it would be.        **Backstory:. Growing up, my mom was super mom.  She raised 4 kids, went to college, had hobbies, danced, laughed, and wouldn't sit still.  She was awesome! My folks have been married for 40 years, and still are.  They live below the poverty level and the kids help out where we can.  My mom has suffered from anxiety, severe depression, and chronic pain (some doctors say fibromyalgia) for about 15 years.  I finally moved her into my home because she was living in a small town without good medical care options and the psychiatrist she was seeing was over medicating her.  When I moved her she could not walk more than a few feet, couldn't breathe well, was dramatically overweight, severely depressed, and both of her parents had died within a month of each other at the beginning of last year.  My dad thought he was gonna lose her in her sleep.  We thought a change, and more medical opportunity would help.  Especially since the new government healthcare program allowed her to have insurance; something she hadn't had for the previous 20 years.  (My dad is a disabled vet and can't work but his VA insurance only covers him). So I brought her into my home for what we thought would be 3-6 months.**.      Fast-forward a few weeks after her arrival, and the doctors find a mass in her neck.  They think it's thyroid cancer but they have to cut it out to be sure.  My mom is a very 'holistic' in her medical approach so she refused.  For the past year she has been treating this 'naturally'.  On the plus side, with me being able to buy her food, pay her medical bills, cook for her, and buy her supplements, she has lost almost 100 LBS since she's been with me.  She walks almost daily. Her overall health has greatly improved and she is off all medications except xanax, which she really only uses to sleep.  Unfortunately, her mental illness seems to have continued to get worse, her depression is spiraling, she has severe insomnia and the mass in her neck has grown.  This is why I'm here.  She refuses to see any traditional doctors that are covered by her insurance.  I'm already paying out of pocket for her to see her therapist weekly, in addition to all of the herbs, kratom, medicinal mj card, etc.  So I can't afford acupuncture, holistic healers, and every other new thing she finds online.  I have to be very careful what I say to her because her depression spirals so easily and she loses hope.  I can't send her home with my dad because they have no money to care for her.  My siblings aren't able to help at all.  My husband and son are amazingly supportive, but I know it's hard on them to have so much of our financial resources going to her, and so much of my time.  I feel guilty for not being stronger and being able to handle this on my own, but it's just been a really hard month.  I did what I set out to do when I brought her here.  But with all of the new stuff, and our differences in opinion on how to treat it, how do I support her without feeling like I'm just enabling her to slowly kill herself?  I know how to separate myself emotionally from her decisions... It's her body and it's her choice. But I'm paying for it.. and my son is watching it.  And because of her mental illness, she's all over the map when it comes to consistency.  She hates doctors and drugs, but has to have Xanax (and would probably take pain killers if she could get them).  She eats crazy healthy, avoiding anything that hurts her liver, but will drink alcohol to sleep when the insomnia is bad.  She picks and chooses what works and when it works and then completely changes her opinions later.  She definitely has some significant addictive personality traits, and I see that, which is why the alcohol scares me.  (She never drank in her life until a few weeks ago and she has a habit of taking medications in excess, not as prescribed.). She just gets so desperate to not hurt... To not feel hopeless... To sleep.. she cries and the thought of just feeling 'normal' again.   I'm just so overwhelmed and I don't want to do the wrong thing.  I don't want to show my son that this is ok.  I don't want to take away her hope.  I don't want to enable her illness.  I don't want to abandon her.  I don't know what to do.  I've been searching for holistic places that take insurance but can't find any.  She really need the Gersom clinic on Mexico, but it's 6k for two weeks?!  How do people do this?  I know that lots of people treat holistically... Are they all rich?  Do people without thousands of excess dollars just die?  I don't want to start a debate over Western medicine vs. Eastern or holistic... I don't have to agree with her approach to know that tons of people share her belief and have been successfully treated that way.  I just don't know how to do it... emotionally or financially.  And I just really miss my mom.  Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.",13Apr2019,1

I almost expected him to kick me out after but we ended but watching a full movie together and cuddled. He also started off a sentence with “when you come over again...” I talked about my availability for the coming week  and he said he had work yesterday and today, but tomorrow he couldn’t remember if he did.

Of course I think about death more often than that, but only sometimes I just for real realize that my life, life of my family members and everything will end.

I’m just scared of dead, I really don’t want it and i think i will never be able to accept it. Life right now seems worthless, I just don’t want to do anything because it doesn’t make sense.

492,"I'm currently a college student and back in 2017 I transferred to this really good school in LA (competitive, ""sexy"") that was better than anywhere I could've ever imagined going to school, because I had a really rough time in high school (mainly personal). I'm from the east coast and experienced a lot of culture shock, encountering a ton of flaky people and not liking the major I'd picked. I went on health leave in the middle of the spring 2018 semester, and then returned to this school last fall.

Because my social life sucked, I lived in a really social house with a bunch of other ""chill"" guys. We threw some parties and I drank probably a few times each weekend, but I ended up becoming miserable because I outdid myself and with drinking and it caused quite a few problems for me, physically, mentally and emotionally. I left that school again before the end of the fall semester and returned to my community college so that I could transfer elsewhere.

I was accepted to another good, well respected school in the Boston area (a seemingly good environment for the typical INTJ), but I've been having a lot of thoughts about returning to the school on the west coast. The west coast school is sexier, ranked higher, has a better alumni network, and better sports (I like football, a lot). However, last time I was at this school, I wasn't just upset about the drinking issues I've had (I've since stopped). I was unhappy with the kinds of people I was meeting (superficial, flaky) but I also didn't put myself in the right position to meet the right people, taking into consideration my housing choice. It was fall and I complained a lot about the warm, sunny, but unchanging weather and lack of festivity as we moved towards the holidays. I complained about the inaccessibility of the city because of bad transport (I had no car), but I feel like if I had the right friends, or even if I'd just gone out alone, I may not have felt this way.

Basically, before the past few weeks, I was set on staying on the east coast. I like the cities in the northeast, love NYC in particular, and was content with moving on from my previous school. As of recent, I've been remembering a lot of the things I enjoyed when I was out west, like my school's football games, walking around Santa Monica, going to a Dodger's game, etc. It makes me think I could totally make LA and that school work if I would just get involved in the right organizations and make more of an effort to find people I click with. I'm content with my major now, so the academics would be fine as long as I keep up with my work.

However, I am really worried about being wrong, again. If it doesn't work out a third time, I'm basically screwed when it comes to my degree, at least at that school. I'm afraid we'll hit November and I'll be miserable about the weather and such (things I maybe wouldn't dwell on if I was actually living?). I'm worried that I might be right about the superficiality of LA, and that it will be incredibly difficult to find the right people.

I really liked the Boston school, but I just like it. I loved some of the experiences I had out west, but maybe that's the difference; I don't actually have experiences at the possible new school, and so there's currently no emotion tied to it.

I’m unbelievably conflicted in making this decision. I change my mind literally every other day, and although it’s just college, I’m a first generation student who needs to get out of their home environment—so it’s important that I find somewhere I can stay. I’d appreciate any advice, thank you!",13Apr2019,1

My friends and I are in a medical modality program and are about to graduate from. This past week we went to a professional conference in a city in North Carolina and I learned some alarming things about my friends who I thought had similar views to me. I knew they were pretty religious with cross tattoos while I am not that religious nor a church goer which is different for someone who lives in the south. But despite that difference we are friends. 

But this weekend while we were exploring the town I was commenting how much I really liked all the solar panels and paper straws and the movement the city took toward going green. I was taken aback when one of them commented how annoying the whole movement was and that is too much and they are tired of it being thrown in their face. I was taken so off guard I didn’t know how to respond since we are college students and I thought it was a logical choice to try to save our planet. But I just let it go and decided to just enjoy our week. 

Well as we were walking around downtown we saw a interracial couple and  they stated how they would never do that and is disgusting how their parents would disown them if they dated someone of a different race of theirs. This floored me. As I have dated people different races other than mine before and when I graduate and settle I want to become a foster mom for any child. But the worst part of it was that they said it loud enough for the interracial couple to hear them. I never wanted to crawl more into a hole in my entire life. I was mortified. I started to hang out with some other classmates of mine to give myself a break from them. But seeing as I was rooming with them I couldn’t avoid them forever. 

So I just pushed it aside and thought hey maybe the since they come from heavily southern traditional families and hadn’t had much interaction with people of other races I had tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and hoped in the future their minds would be changed since we would be working with all differents types of patients and they would realize that their stereotype or for whatever weird logic they had or if they just had adopted their parents view would change.

Well that night as most girls do we were having deep talks at nights sharing trauma. I confessed to them that I had been drugged and raped before and didn’t remember the experience but I remember waking up bleeding and my other friends comforting me. But this happened 5 years ago before I even met them. They told me how sorry that happened to me and how scary it must of been. But then they started asking me if I was drinking, what I was wearing and if I knew the guy. I was flabbergasted. 

The last day came and I could notice they could feel my uncomfortableness around them. I saw them in a new light and it was a new light I didn’t like. I thought they were educated people but apparently they were stuck in the past with their views. But then I sat and thought about it and maybe I was being closed minded and not accepting of their personal views and maybe they had a reason. 

So on the ride home I asked them to clearify and they just stated it was how they were raised and that being where from they are from made them this way and that a lot of people shared their views. I was astounded bc my own mother grew up where they were talking about and is not that way nor did she ever raise me to be that way. 

I began asking more questions on their views on other things trying to understand my friends better that I was friends with for two years. They told me that gays should not get married, nor have kids. That a woman should not run for office and that women were inferior to men physically and mentally. That there was reverse racism and they were tired of being politically correct and giving black people everything. I was astounded and shocked and couldn’t find words to even argue with them. I was more shocked that I had no idea they felt that way. 

After wards they begged me not to tell anyone that we worked with or anyone else in our class and I promised I would. Which is why I am keeping this anonymous

But I am currently having a moral dilemma if I should still be their friends. Or if I am closed minded and an asshole for cutting them out of my life after we graduate. I’m also wondering if I can be someone’s friend if they believe someone doesn’t deserve basic human rights.",13Apr2019,1

503,"I sorry this is so long ...and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and reply.  

Ok so 4 years ago I was on some webpage, don't even know what it was, it wasn't porn or anything, and I see an ad for cam girls, and I see the cutest girl I've ever seen in my life in one of the little boxes.  I thought what are the chances clicking this will lead me to her camsite?  So I clicked it and was shocked it was actually her.  Needless to say I signed up immediately, and messaged her.  I fully admit my only interest was to see her naked. Only problem was she was non-nude.  She barely spoke English, but even through the translator app she was using she was really sweet and funny.  I was hooked.  

I had zero intention of this leading where it has.  I can't even keep a relationship going in my real life longer than a few weeks, let alone a paid cam model.  But she was on during the days while I was working and I would chat with her...she would dance for me. All non nude.  She would dance for 10 minutes, and then we would just bullshit for hours.  I should say she was getting like zero tips from anyone but me.  So she would be spending her whole work time talking to me.  She was only in my life for a month and a half before she told me she was quitting.  

I basically said to her, here is my email address. I would love to keep in touch with you from time to time, just to see how you are doing.  I didn't expect to hear from her again.  

I fully understand that cam girls are working.  I understand they are supposed to be nice and inviting etc... I know she could be nice to me only to get my money.  I am friends with a girl who used to be a cam model, I know how it is from the girls perspective. She would tell me everything she went through. The gross things, the nice things etc... So I'm not blinded by her kindness to think she actually likes me while I'm sending her money to talk to me.  

That being said, I think a few weeks went by and I got an email from her. She sent a photo from the beach, and just said ""Hi, how are you?"".  That started a back and forth for months of us just exchanging niceties.  No money was sent, she never talked about money, it was nothing sexual.  I asked her if she wanted to skype, she said yes.  We skyped a bunch of times.  I should say at this point it wasn't daily it was either a few weeks apart, where we would catch up, or it was once a month.  

Then out of the blue she tells me she's camming again.  So I go to see her, and we start talking and I had been sending her personal photos (not dick pics, nice photos of my life, etc...)and I just decided to say, well here's my instagram, if you wanted to see more photos of me and my life.  She just smiled, and immediately followed me and started liking my photos.  Now at this point I knew her real first name, and where about she lived (not in my same country).  Now I have her personal instagram, and she's dming me all the time.  We would have quick back and forths and then go days with out speaking.  But she was still camming so I would spend hours each day talking to her, and yes I was sending her money, but she never, and still til this day has never asked me for one cent.  She for whatever reason doesn't get a lot of traffic to her site, and she gets paid regardless of how many tips she gets.  So if she sits there for 8 hours she gets a base salary, and she's ok with that.  She has asked me to stop spending my money on her many times.  

Ok this is way too long already...so she quit again for a LONG time, but our chats on instagram became more and more frequent.  Again, she has never asked me for one cent, her friends do not know she is a cam model, and I've now found out her friends know about me, and her mom too.  I have told my friends about her, but they do not know she's a cam model.  

I was in love once before, at least I thought I was.  My feelings for this girl are so much more than the girl I thought I was in love with before.  I've never been able to stay with someone for more than a few weeks IRL, and this girl only gets me more interested after each and every day.  It's been 4 years now, and I would marry her today if she wanted to.  I know how insane that is, because I've never met her in real life, but it's how I feel about her.  

Here's where I get in my head.  I just think she thinks I'm some nice guy from another country, and probably has no feelings like I do.  She has talked about moving out of her country but not to my country, just another country near her.  I've told her that I have strong feelings towards her and she said that I was cute for saying that.  Bottom line, she has made me a better person, she has made me more inspired, and focused. I work harder, I want to impress her, I've never felt this way about anyone in my life. I wish every day I could have just met her in the grocery store, but I met her on a damn cam site.  

I just need some advice.  I have a strong feeling this isn't going to end the way I want.  She's going to get in a relationship with someone and I'll have to stop talking to her.  It'll crush my heart.  If I tell her how I really feel and she rejects me, I'll be crushed too.  Do I just keep going along for the ride? I've pretty much given up all hope on finding someone in my city let alone my country.  Am I delusional? Any perspective from anyone would go a long way.  Thank you if you're still reading.

524,"I'm providing info about my personal story, but if you don't care, the questions will be at the end. (I'm a mobile user, so sorry if my formatting is strange).

INFO:

I love travel. I went on a trip for the first time when I was 19 (24 now) to Japan. I not only rode a plane for the first time for that trip, but also went  alone! During my flights (in total about 16hrs each way) I LOVED it. I absolutely loved being in the air, loved the journey, and couldn't wait to fly again. I took so many pictures and felt 100% comfortable the whole time. I was smiling like an idiot for the first 20 minutes of the flight and thought landing was fun and cool.

Then I went overseas again three years ago. It was a similar plane ride across the Pacific, but to a different country this time, and took about 18 hours each way. I felt the same way as I did when I flew for the first time on the outbound flight, but something changed for me mid-flight on the way back home. I was over the ocean and we got some turbulence (I would say it was moderate). I was not prepared and had never heard of turbulence before, so I was so frightened and thought something was wrong. My boyfriend was spooked too, but he knew what it was and got over it and has no trouble flying. I never got over it.

I recently flew again since that time, which was last November and I was a nervous wreck the entire time I was at the gate and during the flight. I was on the verge of tears with my heart pounding for the entire plane ride. Luckily it was only about an hour each way, but I was so incredibly scared, I felt like I was going to die. 

I hate this so much. I want to go back to loving planes and loving being in the air. I can't imagine my life without travel, and my heart sinks thinking about the fact that I may not be able to bring myself to fly again to my favorite locations. 

Especially now with all of the crashes happening due to pilots not being able to control planes, I feel completely unwilling to fly again. 

Has anyone else been through this? What helped? I'm considering therapy but I have no idea if therapists are even equipped to help with the fear of flying. 

QUESTIONS:

1. How do I stop being scared of every single noise a plane makes?
2. How do I stop being scared of turbulence?
3. How do I stop being scared that I'm going to crash?
4. How do I override my irrational fears with logical facts? I've done SO much research to try to negate my fears and nothing helps... (except watching crash simulation videos, that surprisingly does help a little bit while simultaneously making it worse)

Of course any advice is appreciated, even if you ignore my questions and just say what you think will help. I am looking for coping techniques specifically if anyone has some, as I think I have researched almost everything there is to know on a basic level about why I am safe flying. 

Thank you all!",13Apr2019,1

In preparation for Endgame, I made a plan with my friend to go see Endgame but those plans never materialized. I don't have a lot of friends interested in comic book films so I decided to see Endgame with my mom.

I bought the tickets for both of us in mind, but I feel like I made a huge mistake. The film is three hours long and she has a nasty habit of falling asleep during movies. She falls asleep during everything and I would be very disappointed if she fell asleep during the film seeing that this is something I'm very excited about. I know it will dampen my experience if the person I go with is asleep. 90% of the films we watch together at home or in the theater she falls asleep. I was excited for the Dark Knight 10-year anniversary in August and she fell asleep through that and it disappointed me because that was someone that will probably never happen again. If Beale Street Could Talk she fell alseep half-way through a two hour movie. What will she do for this three hour movie?

To make it even worse she doesn't even want to revisit previous movies (Avengers, Civil War, Infinity War) to be prepared and understand this one so it makes it easier for her to fall asleep. I'm not saying she has to, but she doesn't seem invested and I want to go with someone that is as excited as I am.

I would try to go with someone else her but two things stand in my way:

1) I don't have many friends interested in seeing this so I can't see the film with them

She just doesn't seem invested and I don't want to be preoccupied with whether or not she fell asleep. This is the culmination of 11 years. Whenever I confront her and suggest going with someone else she gets defensive.

WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

I think I will be holding interviews. If anyone is in the Peel region and is 15-19 years old, let me know. I will hold a private interview with this individual and I will select anyone who's interested in seeing it with me instead.

530,"By no means is this “a special case” and a lot of people have anxiety, but all cases are different in their own right.

So basically, since forever I’ve always felt awkward when it comes to anything asking for my hair to be shorter, picking more “fashionable” choices in clothing like a jean jacket or a pink shirt or a flannel as I feel like I’d be judged by my parents for these “odd” choices.

Talking can be difficult for me at moments in public when I’m presenting I start to stutter a bit basic nervousness, and I can live with that. It’s the fact of not like change? Being judged? Hated? I don’t like to be put in embarrassing moments, I feel something as simple as picking out close and wearing them will make me be judged.

Recently I found out she’s been high just a while ago, because a friend of hers pressured her into it. I don’t trust this friend because he’s super shady, but when I confronted her about it, she said it was too late for her to make new friends this late in to high school (we’re juniors).
Another time after she told me about getting high, I caught her going into the boys bathroom with two guys, both are known vapers, and I caught her before and told her not to make any bad choices. I feel like I should’ve tried and taken her away, but I also think I wouldn’t have been able to.
I’m really scared of losing her as a friend, but I also don’t know what to do. We have pretty different friend groups, my friends usually stay at home to study, but her friends are always out and hanging out, like every week. Our schedules also never align, in and out of school.

537,"I keep coming to this because I’m bad at dealing with everything

So, I really REALLY love music. I play the trumpet and I’m only able to because of the school subject, band. I really do love playing the trumpet, but just one instrument isn’t really enough. 
I’ve always wanted to play the violin. It’s such a beautiful instrument, I love everything about. Every time I hear a violin I feel inspired to play one. I’ve been asking my mom for one for a while now. Obviously, it’d be hard to learn without lessons so I asked a friends Mom about it (as she plays the violin). She told me where her kid (my friends sister) got her lesson and I looked it up. It’s $80 a month, starting in September, and you have to register in June. I told Mom about it and asked to get a violin sometime soon (this was a few months ago). She said we probably couldn’t be able to afford it so I suggested that instead of an allowance I would have the violin and lessons and chip in when I can. I also asked if we could rent the violin from the music store and have the payment stretched so that it would cost like $20 or so a month. She acted as if she were going to look into it and every time I asked about it she would use an excuse like “you need to get measured”, as if we would get one right away. I asked her again today and she said “are you doing this instead of trumpet?” (She doesn’t understand shit). 
She keeps getting my hopes up just to say that we “can’t afford it”. I know for a fact we can. Both my parents have jobs with a descent pay and there’s ways to squeeze it in, but she’d rather be lazy and do nothing. I know I sound snotty and spoiled, but for real, the payment for my trumpet is nearly done and so is some other things. 
Everyone else in band was blessed with a musical family so everyone else plays multiple instruments, except me and the slackers. Everyone else has parents that understand how music-related things work. Everyone else’s parents care about their passions. All mine care about is money (and my siblings). They even asked if me doing music was going to get them rich sometime, because to them, if it isn’t, there’s no point (but of course that isn’t how it works with sports and summer camps for some reason). 
I’ve been suggesting as much ways as I can so it’s affordable. I would get a job and pay for it myself but there’s not really any jobs available for anyone my age. They just keep dismissing everything I say. They don’t listen. They don’t care. They seem to think it’s something unimportant I’ll ask for and eventually get over. They also forget, I don’t ask them for random unimportant things, and this certainly is not unimportant. Most people at my age that play violin would have already been playing for years. This is a late age to play the violin. I really don’t want to wait any longer, it’ll be even more embarrassing to get lessons as someone older than this. I’m running out of options and time. What am I suppose to do?",13Apr2019,1
539,"Sorry for the longish post but I am feeling confused and want some advice. I am 28 and after 2 years of being single, about 2 months ago I decided to try online dating. I have worked very hard on myself to feel strong enough to date after leaving a very controlling/abusive relationship. 

So far dating has been fun - met some nice guys but nobody I wanted to see again. Apart from one. To be honest, he wasn't a great communicator via text from the beginning and did let me know this. I don't mind this really. I do need to feel some kind of interest/attention from someone but definitely don't expect to text all day or every day. I would rather meet in person. However, because of his sporadic and fairly blunt texting I wasn't sure if we would get on in person but we had already arranged the date anyway and I decided to go.

I was really surprised to find that we hit it off immediately. He was really attentive, interested and interesting. There was a lot of chemistry and laughter and we had loads of fun. We ended up back at his place and after I left in the a.m I pretty much expected not to see or hear from him again. However, the following day he asked me to come for dinner at his place during the week. He made us a lovely dinner, and again was super attentive and interesting. We also agreed to meet about 2 weeks later during school break to go to an art gallery (both had a busy following week as we work in education). He kept in touch - checking in on me fairly regularly and asking how my day was and asking me what I was up to the weekend before the planned date. All seemed fine.

Didn't hear from him for 2 days and was busy anyway but the night before the date I thought I would check in re. Plans. I did have an odd gut feeling. Strange right? But then woke up the morning of the date to a text telling me the time, and that he would send details through later, and asking for me to stay at his that night. This text was sent at 2am so he had obviously been out.

Got on with my day. But by the afternoon and nearly 2 hours away from suggested meet time I hadnt heard anything. I checked if we should meet later and explained where I was as I had no idea where I would need to go to from that location. He responded almost immediately saying he had to go into work and was running late. I was confused as to why he hadn't let me know this earlier. I had a gut feeling he didn't want to meet. I like people to be upfront so just responded asking if he wanted to meet later or cancel. I wanted to give him the option to end it there. He said lets reschedule (but made no suggestion of when to reschedule) and said he would make it up to me with a wink emoji. So I just replied a while later saying sure with a wink too. I was actually being sarcastic but felt like I didn't want to say anything/ suggest I was pissed as this might give him a reason to legitimise his reasons for not wanting to see me ... E.g. you're overreacting, or taking it too personally etc. I then deleted his number. And assumed he would never contact me again.

I felt pretty confused that he hadn't let me know earlier on that he was going to be late/maybe not make it. Felt it was disrespectful and inconsiderate of my time. Quite honestly, just felt he had no intention to see me. 

After that 'spark' and not having that with anyone else so far, I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed. I realise it was only 2 dates but hopefully someone can relate to that feeling and being excited. I don't want to see it all too idealistically but it felt like we clicked and I just went with it.

Anyway I have continued to date others over the time we had been speaking so have just tried to forget about it. But today he has randomly 4 days later after nothing and sent me a text. All it says is hey how are you? ... My guy friends say if he was truly interested he would have made more effort to reschedule at the time.  Its now been 2 weeks since we even saw eachother. And I am chatting to other people. Do i block him? Respond? Ignore? I haven't always been good at dealing with rejection and for a while I blamed myself but then felt like actually I deserve more. So I guess I am curious to know what other people think. Also, realise I am an overthinker/analyser and would prefer genuine thoughtful responses rather than people bashing me about looking too deeply into it.",13Apr2019,2
540,"Hi i (f15) have this friend (f14), lets call her Bella who i think might be starting to be toxic, but idk if shes just being a bad friend. Basically she's always been a little bit narcissistic but ever since we've started high school it's gotten worse. You see, we had this friend group in the 8th grade, and we hung out together for a bit at the start of grade 9 but, almost all of us found new friends very quickly. Bella did not. All of the girls from our 8th grade group basically stayed together (there were 3 of us plus Bella) but we basically just joined a new group. Now, once me and the other girls were fairly established in this group Bella starts complaining that she has no one to hang out with at breaks, so ofc we invite her to hang with us, and for the past few months shes basically been sitting next to our friend group in the cafeteria and not talking to anyone in the group. She always texts me complaining that she has no one to talk to in the group but literally we've invited her to sit with us and she just ignores everyone, she says she has no friends but never even makes an effort to talk to people. She then invited all the girls from our previous friend group for a sleepover this weekend, and this sleepover has turned out to be one of the worst nights of my life. First, she invites her cousin (m16) over who NONE of us had met before, and he basically made it so none of us could talk to eachother about girl stuff because WE DIDNT KNOW HIM AT ALL(we basically didnt talk the entire time he was there). Second i pulled her aside and told her that he was making us all uncomfortable and when we sat back down with him SHE FUCKING TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS MAKING US UMCOMFORTABLE (this was around 7pm) and then she proceeded to not do anything and her cousin stayed until 10:30pm and we basically all just sat on our phones not talking for 3 and a half hours (we were all so umcomfortable and bored out of our minds). Then when we left my friend (f14) lets call her Tyra asked her why she didnt do anything about it when we were all so clearly uncomfortable (she also said that we had hoped for this to be a girls night and that we had stuff to talk about) Bella then proceeded to just dismiss it, Tyra then tells her thats she's not even acknowledging our feelings and tells her she was being kind of selfish. Bella then yells at the top of her lungs about how we are are terrible friends and about how unselfish she's being, still dismissing our situation. Then after Bella tells us to just do girl talk now, and OFC none of us want to anymore because she just yelled at us for a solid 3 minutes (while her parents could here mind you). We then are forced to talk about girl stuff bc there is nothing else we can do about it bc Bella keeps dismissing us. We then proceed to talk about our sexually abusive families, emotionally abusive families, our self harming tendencies, and our addict parents and i start to cry bc im so sad and the entire time Bella is scrolling on her instagram not even giving a shit as i break down and start to scratch my arm IN FRONT OF HER, and she even says at one point that she doesnt want to talk about this bc she cant relate or contribute to this conversation RIGHT after my breakdown, and she also says that she doesnt even know if she wants to be friends with us anymore because we have nothing in common (keep in mind im a theatre kid, Tyra is emo, and the last girl (lets call her Steph) is a cool kid and that we're still friends) then we awkwardly watch movies for the rest of the night until we fall asleep. Then the next day we basically sit on our phones not talking bc we cant talk without Bella leaving or getting mad at us for ""not including her"" EVEN tho we are just talking about stuff she isnt interested in and arent excluding her. We then decide to go on a walk and while me Tyra and Steph talk she basically just walks behind us on her phone and ignores us for an entire 2 hour walk. We literally dont know what to do for the entire walk bc shes literally just ignoring us the ENTIRE time and apparently ""nothings wrong"" then we got back to her house and now we are just sitting in her basement, not talking, on our phones bc we cant do anything without her getting mad or ignoring us. She also complains all the time about how we dont do anything but shoots down all our suggestions of things to do and also never gives any suggestions. Whenever we ask her for favours (like we are broke and cant afford a $2 drink and ask if she will pay for it (mind you we've been friends for years)) she wont do it, but she always asks us to pay for her stuff even if she has money but she ""doesnt want to waste it"" on that purchase (so shes fine with wasting our money). Anyways thats about all the stuff i can tell you all so i have to ask, is she a toxic friend or just a bad friend? And if she is toxic how do i drop her without being impolite?

543,"I am from Canada age 18. I have spent the last few months living with a girl I met online in her home with her mother in El Salvador. Having not had much relationship experience I said too much too soon. You know, along the lines of “let’s be together forever”. And she really liked the idea. Well, I am already regretting what I said, not so much at her fault (she and her mom have been truly pleasant and although I sometimes doubt the sincerity of her love, she has nonetheless shown me quite a lot.)

We have it planned that I leave in about 2 weeks back to Canada and will continue the relationship on the phone. Lately I have been showing slight signals that I could be a little less sure of our future together but she has not seemed to care/notice in fact, she has increased her talk of coming to the Canada.

549,"Frankly, I’ve been in a rough spot for a few years now in regard to gaming. It’d been a slow decline for a while before that but it wasn’t until I started a game called League of Legends that things really took a turn for the worse.

When I was younger, I was a really avid console gamer. I had all three sixth (?) generation consoles but but my favorite was the Playstation 2. I had myriad games for the thing, I’ve beaten Final Fantasy X and XII about 8.3 million times, and I played plenty of other excellent titles. I had a PS2 nearly from the day it was released until the launch of the Xbox 360. Not the exact same one for the whole time but you get what I mean. 

Anyhow, I eventually got a laptop that could run.. semi-decent games. I was able to check out this game I’d heard of called League of Legends. I picked up the game not long after the SpectateFaker fiasco. Right after the release of Illaoi. Since then, I’ve been muted, suspended, or permanently banned more times than I can remember. My latest account isn’t even fully leveled and it’s currently serving a two week suspension because of a game I played last night where I completely mega-raged. 

So naturally it’s for the betterment of the game and myself to quit. But I’ve been trying to quit for at least two years now. I uninstall, reinstall, uninstall, reinstall. It’s not on my computer now but in two weeks’ time it’ll prolly be right back on my hard drive. 

More to the point, I have to force myself to play single-player games. 

For example, I started Fallout: New Vegas at least three or four years ago. I am just now reaching the Divide. I just this week had the conversation with the main antagonist at the missile silo. So I’m not even in the actual Divide yet. And it took me almost half a decade to get even that far! 

If it isn’t a persistent online game that I can obsess over every day, post on it’s subreddit every day, with some sort of persistent progression that I can show off, I can’t make myself get into it. It’s not just LoL, it’s World of Warcraft, or Path of Exile, or Warframe. 

I do get the urge to go back to games like Fallout or Final Fantasy X but there’s always this voice in the back of my head that asks’s the question: what’s the point? You’ll finish it and then what? It’s done, it’s over. You have nothing to show for it. 

You don’t have to tell me these things are silly but it stands that I can’t shake it. My interest in playing games by myself, for myself, has basically run dry. And it’a not helping that my dinky laptop can’t really play anything good so this idea in my head is compounded by how limited my options are. 

So basically I was wondering if anyone has any insight into why this is and maybe provide some advice on how to reconnect with single-player games?",13Apr2019,1

I'm Having Second Thoughts About Seeing Endgame With My Mom.



It was Monday.



In preparation for Endgame, I made a plan with my friend to go see Endgame but those plans never materialized. I don't have a lot of friends interested in comic book films so I decided to see Endgame with my mom.



I bought the tickets for both of us in mind, but I feel like I made a huge mistake. The film is three hours long and she has a nasty habit of falling asleep during movies. She falls asleep during everything and I would be very disappointed if she fell asleep during the film seeing that this is something I'm very excited about. I know it will dampen my experience if the person I go with is asleep. 90% of the films we watch together at home or in the theater she falls asleep. I was excited for the Dark Knight 10-year anniversary in August and she fell asleep through that and it disappointed me because that was someone that will probably never happen again. If Beale Street Could Talk she fell alseep half-way through a two hour movie. What will she do for this three hour movie?



To make it even worse she doesn't even want to revisit previous movies (Avengers, Civil War, Infinity War) to be prepared and understand this one so it makes it easier for her to fall asleep. I'm not saying she has to, but she doesn't seem invested and I want to go with someone that is as excited as I am.

I would try to go with someone else her but I don't have many friends interested in seeing this so I can't see the film with them.



She just doesn't seem invested and I don't want to be preoccupied with whether or not she fell asleep. This is the culmination of 11 years. Whenever I confront her and suggest going with someone else she gets defensive.



I think I will be holding interviews. If anyone is in the Peel region and is 15-19 years old, let me know. I will hold a private interview with this individual and I will select anyone who's interested in seeing it with me instead.

Fast forward to now and it appears that I’m starting to have similar issues with the couch. One of the sides appears to have an issue where the frame is loose and pushes back and gives you the sensation that you’re going to fall over.

555,"Due to a family emergency, my boss and his girlfriend, who also works with me, had to leave the state. We’ll call my boss Rick and his girlfriend/my coworker Michelle.
So on Thursday, I got a phone call after I got home for the day that there was a devastating accident involving Rick’s kid. Rick and Michelle had to get 4 states over immediately.
Michelle asked if I could stay at their house with her cats. She is in her mid-50s and never had children. She is hardcore about her cats. I didn’t feel like I was in the position to say no, considering the immediate nature of the situation and the fact that she’s in a superior position to me at work.
So they’ve been gone since then, and I’ve had to stay at their house 2 nights so far and will for two more for sure. Most of the year, they live on the same site as our business location, so I’m staying 100 feet from work.

I have a dog, a house, and a fiancé of my own.

I know Michelle trusts me with her cats, the house, and the business. That’s why she asked me. But they have family closer, so I think it may also be that she believes I have nothing better to do because I’m in my early twenties.

So I made the 45 minute trek back to work to stay at my boss’s house. Uncomfortable, for sure. I’d casually taken care of the cats when Michelle went on vacation, as she doesn’t like the way Rick doesn’t do things her way and I’ll just do it whatever way she wants. That time was just going in twice a day during work hours to make sure they were tended to, not staying overnight.

As far as I know, I’m not being paid.

Let’s be clear: I am a complete home body. I don’t like being at other people’s houses. Not even my parents’ house. If I’ve been drinking and can’t drive home, I’ll find a hotel to stay at before sleeping at a friend’s house. It’s weird and I’m aware it sounds rude to people who don’t know me.

So Michelle told me to eat what’s in the fridge, and to take the company credit card and get dinner with my fiancé. Obviously I’m not doing either.

My dilemma is, that if I don’t eat their food and they don’t come back for a week (they still don’t know how long they’ll be out there), it will all be old and they’ll just have to throw it away. It will be wasted. I eat maybe once per day and it’s usually just plain yogurt because I’ve got stomach issues. So I wouldn’t eat the food even if it were in my own fridge. But would it be disrespectful to refuse, only for the food to be wasted?

I’m not comfortable with any of it, but I’m trying to not be fussy as I know my problems are small potatoes compared to what they’re going through right now. I just don’t want to make more work for them when they come back.

And if they’re not home by Monday, I’ve already decided I’m just going to need to let her know I’ll check on them twice or thrice per workday, but I cannot keep staying the night. My fiancé worked late yesterday so I had to drive 45 mins home to let my dog out and make sure he had food and water, then come right back.

Michelle will probably not be pleased and may even get angry when I let her know I can’t stay longer, but I don’t really care at this point. It may or may not be worth a mention that I don’t even like cats, although I am currently diligently taking care of them. I haven’t gotten any sleep because I’m uncomfortable to begin with, plus the cats just walk over me like they don’t even notice I’m there. I tried to get one off my chest last night and he hissed at me. And one needs wet food but I have to stand with him while he eats. They’re running out of litter so I’ll need to buy more. Target and Walmart are both 35 minutes away and not in the direction of my house. I’m overwhelmed.

What’s your opinion on the food thing, and of this weird situation in general?

Please offer me any advice whatsoever. Also, if they ask me to do this again at a different time, how do I say no??",13Apr2019,2

557,"Ok so it’s currently 5:34 pm, yesterday (at like 12 in the morning) him and I were talking, and then decided to go hang out today. So I was obviously excited. 

I ask him again yesterday in the afternoon if were really gonna hang out today and he said yes but first he has something to do, and then he’ll see if we can still go out. I told him not to stress himself bc he was going to the Bronx, and the Bronx from queens is about an hour to and from, with good traffic. I didn’t want him all tired and stuff. So I was ok if we couldn’t hang out today. 

I waited the morning of today because I figured if he was gonna do what he had to do he was gonna do it early bc I suggested going to the city. I sent him a good morning snap and he never opened it, and he started posting that he was currently out. Mind you idc if he went out, I was just here wasting my day waiting for him to say if he’s good to go out today. I didn’t text him again or anything bc I didn’t want to annoy him. He texted me like 10 minutes ago saying he was doing something, which I obviously  saw , and I was like Ik. He asked if I have plans. 

I do have plans. My Cousins are coming to my grandmas house and we’re gonna have a BBQ bc it’s like 70 outside. I told my cousin idk if I’m going out or not and if not I’ll come later tonight. 

I don’t know if I even wanna hang out with him anymore, let alone go to the city bc by train it takes a good hour to get there (depending where of course)

And supposedly he did the same thing to my biological mum. My dad is such a stubborn 'alpha male' and hasn't personally been dumped which means that his self-confidence is extremely high. It was only just this week that I got to know about all of this and it has shaken me. I used to trust him. Now I don't even want to be related to him. The worst part is that he doesn't even realise what he has done wrong and thinks that since none of this has to do with me, that it then shouldn't affect our father-daughter relationship.

560,"I am on a work detail at a new location a very long way from home. It is the same organization I work for at home,  this is just a much different location and a step up in position. The position I am filling in for is vacant and the boss is trying to get it filled before I leave. 
I really thought i wanted to work here and was really hoping I would be offered the position. I realized after a month i did not think the place was for me.
 My wife and 2 kids visited for a week over spring break.  They loved the place and really liked the thought of moving. I tried to explain the down side of what I saw around the area and my wife felt as if I was being negative.  I thought to myself, hey maybe I am just being negative and the place will be a good experience if I gave it a chance.  
 The boss offered me the position 3 days before my family left and i accepted. I accepted because I thought i was just having nerves and anxiety and I would get over it soon enough and it would make everyone happy. It did make everyone happy and made me happy for a couple hours.  After that couple hours my nerves went through the roof. My wife could tell i wasn't happy at this point but she did not say to go ahead and turn it down or rethink my decision.  After 2 days I decided it was a bad move and told the boss no thanks its not for me. He was visibly distressed and agitated because he has had a very hard time filling this position with a qualified candidate. Now me accepting and then withdrawing set him back a month or more in hiring.  I felt bad for my family and the boss (great guy) and i was very regretful myself. 
The last night the family was here I drove them to the airport. My wife was visibly angry but mostly sad. She felt like she was saying bye to a good opportunity and it hurt her. My older son  looked sad too.  When my wife got home she texted me how cold it was at home and she had no motivation now and she was sad. I was regretting the decision too but felt ok.  Me and my wife kept texting and talking and her dissapointment kept coming through. I felt bad for her.   My older son texted me and said  ""it would have been cool to do it and we really only had to commit to 2 years so that time would be over quick and we would have the experience"".  He was regretting my withdraw.
After the regret sadness and text from my son i said to myself I will do it for them, I will do it for this boss, i will do it for the people i will supervise, because they were also wanting me to take the job. I could make a difference in this new position, I can make a difference in this organization....i'll do it!  I met with the Boss he was reluctant but I made a good case about why my feelings changed. 
The reason I gave him for my first withdraw was saying  ""I didn't think my family was ready for it and I worry for my sons having to change schools and being vulnerable"" ""I worry about the strain on my marriage"" It was a legit concern of mine and these things made me nervous.   This time around I told him they are ready they want it, I told him I was trying to over protect them before but now I believe I was wrong, they are ready, I'm ready, please let me have this opportunity back.  He said ok. He was happy my wife was happy.....1 week later I am a wreck. Haven't been eating sleeping and worry constantly. I do not like it here. I still have worries about my family. I also looked into moving costs which were supposed to be paid by the company and it turns out I will have to drop $14,000 out of my money to get the equivalent of what i will be leaving behind.   I do not have that money so on top of not wanting to be here I will have to take a signifigant life style downgrade. 
This boss has already announced to everyone at the company I've taken the job. He has negotiated a start date with my other supervisor.  
I have not agreed in writing to the transfer just i just agreed  verbally, twice. 
If I back out again I am worried about my wife's reaction, I am worried about looking like a lunatic. , I am worried about my reputation in this company. I am worried about hurting this boss and setting him back another couple months.  I know the simple thing is suck it up and just say no again but I'm having trouble coming to terms with that.

564,"Hello all. Apologies for the length, but I’m feeling rather stuck. Tl;dr at the bottom  


Years ago I went back to school for a new industry. I loved it, and did very well. I made friends with my fellow students and professors, and got a job simply because one of my profs recommended me.  


Months later, I got an amazing opportunity to work on a huge project. A well known company, and a huge raise. I decided to leave my small indie company and take this contract. The contract finished and they decided to lay all of us off.  


Instead of looking for a new job in my industry right away, I opted to work from home on my portfolio. To make some money in the meantime I got a job at a start up company.  


It’s been a year at this start up. I hate my boss, and after speaking to an employment lawyer I realized how many human rights laws he’s breaking. It pays decently and I can watch Netflix all day, but there is no room for growth and the people I work for are scumbags. Genuine hostile work environment.  


I’ve tried applying for new jobs, but my portfolio is so out of date and I am getting zero callbacks. I’ve considered switching industries again but even applying for other jobs is getting me nowhere. When I talk to friends who love their jobs, I yearn to get back to doing what I love.  


Another difficulty: I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve been trying to work on my portfolio on my own time at home, but I find it very difficult to get going. I’ve downloaded something like 5TB of tutorials and videos that I still haven’t gotten to.   


However, school worked really well for me. The structure is helpful and I can actually get things done on time. My idea is, work my shitty job until September, then go back for a quick 8 month program to brush up on my skills and make new contacts. I’m a few years out of date anyways. I’ve already been accepted to the colleges I applied to, and one in particular has excellent industry connections and is known for what they do.  


Here is the problem. School costs money. I can deplete my savings to pay for it, but I won’t be earning anything in the meantime. It is more likely I can find a job after this, but not guaranteed.  


Also, this will be the second time I do this. My husband was very supportive and understanding the first time I went back to school, and he knows how much I hate my job, and how hard it is to find a new one. But it’s another financial hurdle. Other friends have said I’d be wasting my time, that I should just learn these things myself in the evenings after work, but they don’t understand that I \*have been\*, and am trying and failing.   


The first time around I was successful. I should have stayed at my happy little company and never left for that cash bonus. But I did learn a LOT and have it on my resume.   


Is it crazy to do it again? Pay tuition for an 8 month program, learn new skills and improve my old ones? Get new industry contacts through professors and school to company relations? Not earn any money while doing so?  


Tl;dr: I hate my current depressing job, and there is no room to grow. Should I go back to school for the second time, and hopefully get back into the industry I love?",13Apr2019,1

I generally respect my parents and their opinions on things. They are very smart and always want the best for me. However, particularly my mom and I have pretty much always disagreed when it came time to make decisions regarding my plans for school/work. I have wanted to go back to school to get a Masters Degree or Law Degree for a long time now  (I'm interested in human rights/immigration/social work). I have worked in nonprofits for quite a while, but find that the pay is so low that it isn't sustainable long-term. Despite my mom being a PhD and my father having a law degree, they both vehemently think that it would be a mistake to go back to school because of the loans that I would have to take out. They think I wouldn't like my job in the end and that I would be tied to it because of the loans. They have dissuaded me from pursuing this for years now.  (BTW I have a paralegal degree and am fluent in Spanish. I also really want something that would allow me to work both in the US and in Mexico, where my husband is from, and where we hope to live again in the future)

 Maybe I shouldn't be taking my parents' opinions so seriously, but I can't tell sometimes if I'm being obstinate or following my instinct.  I'm worried that I will regret not going for it, and I'm also worried that if I don't go back to school I will end up always being broke, or having to take a corporate type of job that I would hate so we can make better money. 

I just want to help people and not be broke forever.

568,"This last year of high school, as is customary, has been a bit... interesting.

For some reason, I am a bit extreme and I forced myself to grind for straight As, stress myself out (most of the problem) etc. all four years. When I applied for college I had no idea what I wanted to be, so I decided I might as well make money and apply for engineering or medicine... a choice I regret now since I don’t even know if I like these things and might be interested in academia.

At this point, I need to choose between two programs: my state flagship, where I was admitted for engineering (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and an easy track to medical school (University of Illinois at Chicago GPPA). 

The GPPA program involves lower grade requirements, no letters of rec, no volunteering, etc although part of my schedule in undergrad will be consumed by medicine classes. I can major in anything.

On the other hand, I’m not sure how I will do socially in GPPA. I’ve had basically no friends in high school, I am quite an anxious/sensitive person, and I might be gay. GPPA is at a school where 85% of people commute. My state flagship might allow me a chance at having a social life.

When I was 16, I went to a house party with a couple of seniors from my school. I had known one of them for over a year and would sit with him at lunch. I got pretty wasted I did six shots then my friend and two of his friends said to come back to their house. They said it was going to be fun. When I got there they told me to get undressed, I did.

I was bewildered they tried to take photos of me, but I told them to stop. They gave me a beer then told me to suck their dicks I did no one else was there. I didn’t know what to do. Then they penetrated me I bleed. They finished. It feels blurry to remember the next day. The next day they tell all their friends, and their friends say I’m disgusting, ugly, stupid, a bitch and gross. They made posts about me online This was six years ago, and I still think it’s my fault.

I said yes to having sex with them right away they said. I had never really gotten that drunk before. They said no one will ever want to date me. One of the guys would continue to hook up with me for years. I did it because I felt lonely, became an outcast, and thought I was ugly. He would say I’m annoying, that he wants me for sex and nothing more. I don’t think anyone will like me

They said it was my fault because there were rumors I did that kind of stuff. I heard this myself. Some guys in my grade would harras me and call me ugly. They also told people I would give them all blow jobs at the same time and slept with the football team. Don't people believe gossip like this? These rumors were before any of this happened, and they thought I was ”fair game.”

Everyone acted like I was gross after that people hated me.

Don’t most guys think girls who do this are gross?

Am I a slut? Will no guy want me? Am I gross? Why did this happen?

I’m a Walmart greeter. I’ve suffered a concussion and mild spinal cord injury since June from a workplace injury while I worked in the garden centre. I managed to get back to work in December but I’ve had accommodations to make it easier, namely, my doctor requested I have a chair. 

A few weeks ago, I got called into my managers  office and she told me that some “concerns” have been brought up to her. She told me that a coworker has come forward and told her that I sit in a wheelchair instead of the provided chair and I often fall asleep in it. Neither of these are true and I was pretty shocked. I’ve held my position for about two years now and my manager knows me well but it was pretty obvious that she didn’t believe me when I told her it was a lie. She took  away my chair because of what was said and I’ve been having migraines much more often because of it. I’ve been getting bad dizzy spells, and in general it feels like I’ve had a regression in my recovery. 

I’m not sure what I can do now. I’ve been considering quitting but that would exclude me from work place injury benefits, but if I stay my migraines and dizzy spells will get worse.

We went to homecoming together and a few weeks after she friend zoned me. I still liked her for awhile until i tried to argue my case of why she should like me (stupid i know). During this time between her friend zoning me and me doing that she was borderline abusive. She called me fat, ugly, and disgusting, and hit me a lot. I let her do this because it didn’t affect me all that much since i have pretty high confidence, and her hitting me didn’t hurt except for a gigantic bruise on my arm. Anyway after the whole incident i distanced myself from her. Now she has a few (understatement of the century) problems of her own and this led her to accuse me of stalking her. This was because i went to my class maybe 10 minutes early after lunch, and she was in there too. This led to a lot of drama, and then she apologized and we ended up being friends. A few weeks later she basically tries to fight me at school, punching me multiple times in the face, and my leaving bruises all over my face because i was teasing her about being better at basketball then her. We make up the same day, and then later we fight again a few weeks later about which of us did worse things.

Anyway she says she’ll stop with all her negativity. She does and has been pretty good ever since. During these months our friendship was really good, and we both helped each other a lot. One thing we did that maybe was not so good was talk about sex. We did this a lot, like a lot, a lot. We’re both teenagers and we were apparently hormonal and needed to air out some of those hormones. Anyway this built up until the grand finale of a few weeks ago. I start asking about her comfortablity with me. Then we get into a really long conversation about sex. We talk about what we want to do, if we want to do if before marriage and that kind of stuff. Then i do probably the most stupid thing possible. I literally ask her if she wants to do those things..... with me. Now i don’t mean have sex but i do mean pretty borderline stuff, like groping her, making out, and fingering. She apparently was thinking about it too. Let me say i in no way like this girl. She is attractive but i wanted to do it with her because i thought we were comfortable enough to do it and remain friends after. Anyway we talked about it and she decided she didn’t want to do it, but said she would if she felt like it sometime. The next day i think our hormones went away and realized how stupid it was. She basically got mad at me, went to our school councilor, which is her best friend’s mom. Skip to a week later and her parents find out what happened after they’ve taken her phone away. Now they’ve found out and a whole bunch of things have happened. What i’m looking advice for is that should i salvage the relationship and how would i. Her parents and the people that know won’t let me near her, and she does still want to be friends. I don’t know if i should tho, but she’s been a pretty good friend for the past couple of months. I also made her feel super bad, since i objectified her and that effects some of her problems. I want to know how i could get her parents (specifically her dad) to let up on me a bit and let us be friends.

587,"I called into work sick today as I have an IBS flare up. I am a graduate and just work part-time retail atm on the weekends.   


Now, the issue: I texted my manager for Sunday off on Friday (yesterday) as my friends' sister died and was told to ask another manager on Saturday. After eating s\*itloads of pasta and cake that evening, I spent the entire night in pain and decided not to go in today (Saturday). I am calling in sick again tomorrow as still unwell but I know two people are off already... but having vomited and still feeling not 100%, it is safer for me, the colleagues and the customers to stay at home.  


I just don't want there to be speculation that I am making excuses to get off work because I didn't get the Sunday (tomorrow) approved off.   


Is there any way to prove this aside from my words? I have been diagnosed with and have had days off last year because of this too... so it is ongoing but still.   


To top it off, a guy at work is telling people that I have asked for it off to go to a family friends wedding this weekend (not true, well there is a wedding but I am not going) and I rarely miss time off work (only when my grandmother was dying at the start of the year and took a month off to grieve, i.e. 8 shifts).

592,"Hi everyone! I've been seeing this guy for a little while, nothing serious right now but it definitely has potential and I really like him. We haven't gotten intimate yet.

I experienced sexual abuse as a child and it has had some lasting effects on me. Namely, I'm very self-conscious about/ashamed of my body, and I also don't like feeling vulnerable (which makes intimacy difficult). I know that if he and I did end up in a position where he was ready for something sexual, I might act differently than other women he's been with, or how a ""normal"" person would act.

I want to be able to provide some explanation for my behaviour in certain situations. I know logically that I don't OWE him an explanation, but it might be beneficial for both of us. However, I'm worried that he might view me differently, as if I'm fragile or something.

I've never told anyone I've been with about that aspect of my past, because it's something I have hardly been comfortable with acknowledging what happened myself, up until recently. Before, I've just sort of pushed through my discomfort the best I could, but it definitely wasn't the best thing I could've done in that situation.

Now that I'm in a better place, one where I'm able to personally face what happened to me, I feel like I may be open to sharing this with the guy I'm seeing. But should I? I've only known him for a few months; is that way too soon to be discussing that kind of thing? I would appreciate a third party's opinion.",13Apr2019,1

595,"Hey everyone. So I'm a 21 yr old guy from Canada. I graduated HighSchool with Honors, went to college, graduated with a DEC in Business, and I'm currently in Uni studying Business Admin. I'll be honest with you, I absolutely hate it. The only thing I actually enjoy about it is the people I'm surrounded with. Hate the school. Hate the program. 

I was thinking of taking some time off and either changing school or going to work full-time. 

If I change school, I was thinking of doing a trade (although not sure which) or perhaps looking into becoming an Engineering Technician (about 2 years college again). 

Thing is, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here. I really feel like I've wasted the last 3-4 years of my life. And taking a step back, changing career path, is terrifying me. What if it's the wrong choice. What if I waste another year or two doing something I end up not liking.

My closest, closest friend is also a friend of hers. The three of us always did everything together. He has taken the stance that “he doesn’t want to get in the middle of it”. I do get that, but this isn’t a mutual argument where we are both mad. She is the aggressor here and it’s eating me alive. It’s really affecting my depression and putting me in a bad spot mentally.

I need some sort of explanation or closure or apology and I don’t know how to get that when no one is standing up for me because she clearly won’t listen to me.

This story is asking for advice if you have any but I’m just trying to get all the backstory and details in so that you guys can better give your opinions. Thanks for bearing with me and reading :)

Anyways I’ll jump right in. 

DETAILED BACKSTORY:
       I’ve had a HUGE crush on a guy a year and a half older than me since i was a sophomore in highschool(15/16), and he was a senior (18). Also minor disclaimer - I’ve always been a pretty sexually comfortable person.. basically I’m very flirtatious. He played the role as my secret admirer because we’d Snapchat and he would never show his face. One time he left a note and a bunch of large chocolate bars in my locker. Sometimes he’d text me things like “you looked nice today” which would kind of freak me out because I didn’t know who he was yet he knew me. 
       Finally, I agreed to go on a date with him and he’d “reveal himself” (Yes, it is dumb that I agreed to go out with someone I’ve never met but keep in mind I was 15/16) When I got to the place of meeting he was waiting there, and I was speechless for a second. My young teenage girl brain couldn’t handle how attractive he was to me. Flash forward past the movie and the mall, and I went home. We went on a couple more dates after that over the next few years, even after he graduated and I became a junior in highschool. 
        Our communication with each other would fluctuate as he was in college and I was busy with my high school life. We’d never sext but we’d talk about random things like what’s going on in our lives. 
       On our dates we never kissed; I think I’ve only gotten a hug once out of all the times we’d dated so I began to think maybe he’s not interested in me, or maybe I’m too young for him. Which- that was the case exactly...

END OF DETAILED BACKSTORY 
       fast forward AGAIN to this current year, about a month or so before my birthday I was 17, we talked about how he wanted to take me to the Aquarium but it was in the city and would be near closing by the time we got there even if we left right then. So I offered the idea of watching a movie... at my house since my parents weren’t home for the night. He agreed a bit reluctantly but still came through. It was about three hours of just platonically watching movies and light conversation. No sexual activity. And he left with only a side hug... 
    Now, I’m 18 and just yesterday I was feeling a little bored, my parents weren’t going to be home for the night once more due to a friend hosting a dinner party (they would be gone for a while) so I texted him. I asked if he wanted to hang out and he told me he was a bit tired, but still wanted to know what I wanted to do. I told him I was going to order a pizza and watch some movies to which he responded that he’ll gladly accompany me. 
      The pizza came and the movies were on, but I wasn’t trying to sit through 3 hours of just doing NOTHING, I mean, according to my logic there was no excuse: He’s hot, we’re alone, and I’m finally of legal age. I, however, as much as I enjoy being sexually pleased, I don’t have enough experience to where i can ask for it explicitly. So we’re watching movies on the couch and he keeps catching me looking over at him. It was awkward because I think he even saw me eyeing his sweatpants and it’s cliche but my face instantly got hot. I’m the type of person who has a resting bitch face whether I’m happy or sad or horny, it’s always the same face i can’t help it. Regardless of that I think he kind of understood what I was thinking because he laughed a bit when he caught me looking at him, he takes my hand in his and goes: “One of the things I hate about you is how I can’t read you..” so in response I don’t say anything, but I guide his hand and put it on my upper thigh. 

- I SHALL SKIP THE DETAILS -
We didn’t have sex, but anything else around it that you can imagine did happen. 

I’ve been sexually active before, but with my boyfriends or someone I knew for years.. so getting intimate with him so suddenly made me feel a bit weird, I almost got cold feet in the middle of it, but I explicitly allowed him to continue. He told me he’s never done anything sexual with another girl before, I almost didn’t believe him i mean he’s really attractive, and he’s been in relationships before me... but I gave him the benefit of doubt. He told me the “sex” if you want to call it that was very good and he could tell I was advanced and knew what I was doing. 

((I don’t know if you guys believe in horoscopes but I’m an Aries, not saying that’s what causes my personality but you can fill in the gaps: I love taking control and seeing guys at my feet. ))

I, on the other hand, I’m not sure if I liked it. I have a FWB which is why I didn’t have penetrative sex with him, we have an agreement to not have sex with anyone else for as long as we’re in this mutual relationship. So a lot of questions and doubts were on my mind: how would my FWB feel about this? Should I tell him? Do I regret this? I mean i had a fun time, but afterwards it was just a little weird — I‘m so used to non-intimate sex with my FWB that maybe I seemed a little insensitive to his first sexual experience? I just don’t know how i‘m supposed to feel about it all, or what is next for us. I’m so used to not speaking to my FWB unless I want something, but he’s different so should I be texting him?

Before I lived in the city I lived in the country with my parents and I'd hear all kinda of animals. This doesn't sound like any of them. It sounds like someone either in distress or on drugs. Idk.

601,"Hello,

I am looking for advice on what I should do, I work in Florida, and have had my job almost two years.

I work for a large Fortune 500 company that has very strict rules. I am an hourly employee that has a salaried employees job. This includes paying employees. I have like 23 employees that report to me, but aren’t my hierarchy, but are on my Managers. 

So this is what happened. The company has a strict call in policy. Everything needs to be planned and paperwork signed for approval. Each employee is allowed 1 unscheduled vacation a quarter. Well, I had employees that would call in and if they had vacation time and wanted to use it then I coded them vacation. I did not know that I could not do it that way as I have been doing it for at least a year and it’s never been mentioned to me as a problem. 

I got pulled in to the HR office yesterday and was told this has been found that I am doing and that I am falsifying documents. She said this is a major deal and is very serious. She asked me to write a statement so I filled out a statement form that basically said “I have been doing this awhile and did not know that it was wrong and I won’t do it again.” HR read it and laughed because i was refusing to take responsibility for my actions and own it. 

They suspended me until At least Tuesday while she finishes her investigation and she said that she will call me and let me know what to do. 

At this moment, I am hoping for the best but planning for the worst, but I truly enjoy my job and don’t want to lose it. 

Additionally, here are a few of my concerns. Hourly employees have a coaching form that is progressive discipline that starts as “coaching,” then moves to a progression of something like verbal warning, written warning, final written warning, suspension, termination.

This entire process was not used as I pulled to the hr office and suspended without seeing any paperwork or signing anything. Does this matter? 

To give more information, we changed HR professionals a little over a year ago, and since then HR has pulled me in the office for payroll related problems and wanted me to get them right. However, the problems they had with payroll were never a problem with the old HR person who trained me. Additionally, I changed my ways and did it the way HR wanted. 

When pulled in to the office yesterday, the HR manager also used my previous problems with Kronos against me. I tried to defend myself by asking why she is digging up old bones and throwing them at me as I have done everything they have asked me to do with Payroll. 

Again, I don’t think there is any written documents that I signed for prior payroll coaching. 

She claims to have more than enough evidence on me in email form to say I am falsifying documentation which has resulted in my suspension and may result in a termination.

Any advice would be great. 
Thanks",13Apr2019,1

606,"I'm a freshman at a college in the east coast. My roommate and I have had a pretty bad relationship throughout the year. He is here to study music. And he constantly plays his music while I'm asleep, is loud and obnoxious, and is extremely rude to me. I respond by being passive aggressive and but still don't react the same way. However, I assumed at the very least we had some basic relationship for each other. His best friend is identical to him, loud and obnoxious. However, I always tried to steer clear of them and spend as little time in the room as possible.   


Anyways, today I check my bank account and start noticing that I have significantly less money that I expected.

I’m worried that in the summer while I’m home for 3 months that I’m gonna be miserable because I won’t be able to hang out with any of my friends or go out because they don’t want me to drink or smoke. They’ve caught me with weed twice before and that was pretty damaging to their trust. But it’s hard to explain to them that I use it for my anxiety and that if you compare it to my friends and the people around me at college then I am an angel compared to most people my age. 

I want to bring this issue up to them but I feel like when I say something they’ll just bring up how they pay for my college and do so much for me. Any advice? 

Tldr - Worried that I cant talk to my parents about them being untrusting of me and don’t know how I’ll be able to talk to them without them shutting me down.",13Apr2019,1

So yesterday I was very sick and I didn't want to go out on my driving lesson when I wasn't well as I wouldn't be able to concentrate on what I was doing so I text my instructor at about 8AM (my lesson was at 11AM) just to give him plenty of time to see my text so he knew my lesson was cancelled, then I went off for a nap. I woke up at about 11:30 with a missed call and missed texts from my instructor wondering where I was as he was waiting outside for me but left about 15 minutes prior as I wasted is him. Confused, I text him to say I had sent him a message that morning to say I wanted to cancel the lesson as I wasn't well. He claimed I didn't (even though the message had been delivered) and now wants me to pay the £45 for a lesson I never had. I really don't want to pay that money as I never even set foot in the car, fair enough they waited outside for me but my message had definitely been delivered and now I'm being forced to pay him for the lesson, what should I do?

620,"Bit of background about me: I moved here to the SF Bay Area for work, about a year ago. For my housing situation, I found a place on Craigslist and had the landlord give me a virtual tour of the place via FaceTime. I understood then that I would share the residence with the landlord. Everything looked ok enough; I signed the lease below and moved in about a week later.

[https://imgur.com/kmSduhs](https://imgur.com/kmSduhs)

However, a bunch of very troubling details started leaking out. I provide these anecdotes below to ask whether any of them would constitute a breach of the lease agreement, and therefore a legal basis for me to walk away. (I don't have voice recordings of these incidents, as California is a two-party consent state on wiretapping.)

When I moved in, I learned that the landlord did *not* own the property, but rented it from someone else and was subleasing it to me (with the owner's knowledge and approval, supposedly). I also discovered, after I moved in, that the landlord's brother (who'd suffered a work accident that disabled him, and had to hang out here) was living in the house. He has been here for about a month longer than I have.

All this was still ok, but the situation quickly began to spiral out of control. My landlord has requested me for technical assistance with her phone and her internet router. (As per the lease agreement, she provided me with the password for the router, so that I'd have access to Wi-Fi). After I examined her phone and router (and found out that most of her problems either stemmed from out of date iOS, which she refused to update despite my repeated advice to do so, as well as from her fiddling around with router settings that she did not understand), she accused me several times of ""hacking her internet,"" ""platforming her phone,"" and ""portraying her identity"" online. I did no such things, and vehemently denied these accusations.

Several months into living here, my landlord requested that I pay an additional $10/month for internet. I asked what this increased charge would buy me; she spent half an hour ducking and dodging the question - thus I refused. Several days afterward, she sent me a text notifying me that I had been kicked off of her internet, and that if I wanted my own, I would have to contact an ISP myself.

Hence, I did so - contacted Comcast, provided them with my name and this address, purchased my own router/modem combo, and set about getting my own plan. When my landlord returned home as I was setting up my own router, we entered a three-way screaming match: me, the landlord, and the Comcast service agent. The landlord repeatedly accused the agent of ""disabling her line."" (Evidently she'd moved her own router to the garage, off-limits to me.) This back and forth went on for the better part of an hour before the agent said that she would send over a technician the next day. The next day comes; the technician arrives and splices a few wires; my internet works - but not before my landlord accuses me again of hacking her router. Her evidence for this was an Ethernet cable attached to *my* router, with *nothing* on the other end. When I pointed the absurdity of this out, she thankfully backed down.

Since then, we've had multiple shouting matches over the internet issue - but those pale compared to other issues. My landlord has fallen upon some financial hard times (she left her job working real estate related stuff; the owner of the house hiked up the rent), and thus had to AirBnb out her own bedroom (while she sleeps on the living room sofa) to make ends meet. This has occurred about half a dozen times since I've moved in here, and raised major security concerns for me. Obviously, it was also not on the lease.

Finally, most concerning of all - I returned home one day on a weekend. As soon as I stepped indoors, my landlord immediately berated me about ""moisture on my windows"" and the risk of mold. I was pretty irritated by this; told her to fuck off - that I didn't want to talk about it. She said that she knew I'd just go ahead and do what I wanted anyway, to which I responded sure, whatever.

My landlord then asked, ""Do you ever get so frustrated that you feel like just loading a bullet into a gun and...doing something?""

I was shocked, then very angry at this - said that I refused to answer that question, and demanded to know whether she was trying to bait me into something that would get me in legal trouble. Fortunately, she fucked off after that.

With all this in mind, it needs not be said that I'll be moving out. I already signed the lease and paid the security deposit for another residence; lease begins there May 1st.

I have notified my landlord that I will not be renewing my lease with her, and have attempted to negotiate an early exit with her. She flip-flopped on this back and forth - said that I could move out May 1st one day, then that I couldn't a few days later, then that I could a while after that. There was one incident where she tried to get me to sign a handwritten note confirming that I'd move out May 1st - but when I asked her about whether I would get my security deposit back May 1st and not be liable for May rent/utilities, she said that ""we could discuss that later."" Detecting that she wasn't negotiating in good faith, I refused to sign this note.

Talking with her brother, I've learned that trying to get money out of my landlord is akin to squeezing blood from a stone. The previous tenant, he told me, only got about $60 back from his $600-$800 security deposit (he couldn't remember which) - as she'd invented a ton of cleaning charges on the room. (My landlord has told me that I'd be responsible for cleaning the entire house upon exit, despite how I have not cooked a single meal in the kitchen and rarely use the bathroom for showers - I mostly shower at work.)

Bottom line - with all these incidents in mind, I have three questions:

1. Should I walk away from here May 1st, without paying my landlord May rent? (I understand that I'd of course forego my security deposit, but it is better to lose just that $800 than to lose a prorated \~$800 for May rent, on top of $700 or so of the deposit itself if my landlord chooses to pull the same tricks as she did on her previous tenant).
2. Would the lease even be enforceable in court? (It seems very sparse and informal compared to the lease of the new place I've signed.)
3. Do any of the above incidents constitute a breach of the lease, and therefore a release of responsibility on my part?",13Apr2019,1

627,"Trying to make this story as short as possible:

I came to England from another country last year. For a year in University. When I arrived, it was all cool. My then-girlfriend and I agreed to stay together and visit each other as often as possible. But the months passed and we came to the realization that we may not need each other as much as we thought we did. Arguments, tears, etc... During Christmas break, we broke up.   
Christmas was over, I came back to England for semester 2. Still very depressed from the breakup, but I knew that I'd get over it eventually. At that time, I often met with a (female) friend that I got to know here (Let's call her Charlotte). We hung out a lot in the first semester already and continued that. Then I had a realization:  


Maybe, I've fallen in love with Charlotte.  
Maybe, I had been for months.  
Maybe, I didn't want to believe it, because I don't see myself as an asshole.  
Maybe, she was a little part of the reason why my relationship broke.

I never meant to replace one girl with another. But maybe falling in love with another girl made me realize that I didn't love my GF anymore.   


Now single, I tried to grab my chance and ask Charlotte out. But she rejected me, crushing all my feelings. I really tried to get over it, but this girl really managed to somehow amaze me so much that I am absolutely devastated. Usually, I'm an emotionally stable person. The end of my 5-year-relationship made me cry for about 2 weeks. But the rejection from this girl makes me absolutely crazy in any way and I've been crying for 3 months now.   


How can I get out of this? How can I lose feelings for a girl? How can I manage to finally be in peace with myself and concentrate on my own life? All I can think about is how amazing she is and what I could have done better to make her love me. I really feel like an idiot for making myself so dependent on a girl.",13Apr2019,1

631,"Hello reddit, I’m using a throwaway for personal reasons. 

I am a 20 year old college student who is studying in a business/finance field. Academically, I don’t really have any complaints. I have a few weeks remaining before summer break, I’m a 3.8 student, I really can’t complain. 

Right now, I just feel stuck. Every morning I wake up and I just feel like it’s another day. I usually am a motivated individual, but as of late, I’ve just felt complacent. 

I recently accepted an internship with a finance company as a representative, and I’m not sure if it was the best decision. Of course, after the summer ends and if I don’t like it, I can leave. I learned last week that my current internship cannot find me any more work and I will be let go near the beginning of May. 

I believe a lot of my stress comes from finances. I currently live in a 1br apartment by myself. In June I’ll be moving to a significantly cheaper house with a couple friends of mine. That’ll free up some rent money. I am a very prideful individual if you would say. I never have asked my family for money as I want to work for what I earn and taking any assistance from my parents would make me feel bad. After doing my taxes and speaking with my dad, he has claimed me on them which does not allow me to claim a student tax break. Because of this, he said he wants to give me around $1600, the amount I would’ve claimed. My biggest fear in life is not having money to fall back on. My current internship offered a steady paycheck, enough for my expenses and enough to save and invest, which I currently do. The position I was just hired for seems like a good opportunity, but I have to start by selling insurance as it’s a financial planning job. I refuse to try and sell to family or friends, it goes against my morals and I don’t want to be “that guy”. It’s a mostly commissioned based position, and it offers a lot of flexibility, I just don’t want to sacrifice relationships for it. 

I am a very financially-responsible person and always make sure things like rent, credit card, etc. are paid off. My relationship with my girlfriend is going well, I can’t complain. 

I used to read and write and have this undying urge to be an entrepreneur. I still think I am deep down. It’s just that right now, I feel lazy and I feel like I should be doing much more. 

What advice can you give to me to help me out of this rut/come to terms that it’s okay to need help every once in awhile? I feel like I’m wasting my life right now by just feeling stuck. 

I apologize for the long read, it helped to get some stuff off my chest.

1) physical exam either monday or tuesday 
2) a couple of overnight stays from Thursday night -Saturday morning

4) blood draws

It’s 800 bucks, so that would be great but I am wondering if anybody else has participated in a clinical research trail, and if its worth it or not.

I get a lot of attention from guys and I just wish that I could like just ONE of them back but I don’t. I hate it I hate it I hate it.

639,"Until recently, I’ve always thought I was good at talking to people. As far as I remember, conversations with people were rarely stale or boring. But in the past few months, I’ve started to notice that when I’m having a one on one conversation with someone that I don’t know really well, I just lose it. After a few minutes, I’m out of things to say. I absolutely hate awkward silence and don’t understand why this is just now becoming an issue. For reference, I’m a freshman in college, about to finish the year off. When I go back home or talk to any of my home friends, I have almost zero problems. They’re people I’ve known for awhile and are really close to. I have quite a few really close friends at college too, but in terms of people I’ve met here that aren’t my close friends, I find conversations to be difficult. For example, I’m in a fraternity, which I really enjoy, but I never joined any of the cliques that came about once I joined. There are several groups of people that hang out consistently and it’s not like they’d ever turn me away if I asked to come chill with them, but I get bummed sometimes that I didn’t fit myself in with any of them. Hopefully that gets better in the fall with our upcoming pledge class. I don’t know if it’s just hard to relate to people on stuff; like music and shit like that. I mean, I relate with most dad’s when it comes to music taste. I don’t know if it’s that or that I just don’t know how to make good small talk. Once I get past that really awkward phase with people, shit is totally awesome, but getting through it seems to be quite the challenge for me.
