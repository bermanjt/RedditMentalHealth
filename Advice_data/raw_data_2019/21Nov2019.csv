2,"okay, so let me just start this post by saying that this is an LGBTQ+ relationship, so if you're queerphobic, please do us all a favor and click off this post now because your hateful and negative comments are unnecessary here. thanks.

so to start off, i am a female and have been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend since august 2018 (however we have met up in person before). everything was great, but then around january of this year, my girlfriend developed a crush on a guy, because she is polyamorous. i was up for trying out a polyamory relationship, so at around april, the three of us were together officially, and i will admit, it was much better than i had imagined. however, this guy, who i will now refer to as alex, decided to break up with my girlfriend and i for unknown reasons in august.

now, my girlfriend and i have both grown up in toxic households; but in her case, her parents neglected her as a child and this causes her to have a much more difficult time letting go than other people would. so when alex broke up with us, i took it much better than she did... and even to this day, she is still acting as if alex broke up with her just earlier today. i have always been trying my best to comfort and support my girlfriend as much as i possibly can because i know how difficult this is for her, but i have no idea what to do at this point. i am at my wit's end.

she constantly gets irritated, starts arguments, and snaps at me although all i try to do is be there for her... and i have no clue what to say or do because everything that i try out just gets met with the same reaction: you don't understand, you don't care, you can't help, just leave me alone, let me die, etc. i feel like alex robbed me of my the girlfriend who i loved so much. i know she is hurting, but it hurts me as well that i am unable to help her and she refuses to even let me try.

 even when i say ""i love you,"" she responds with ""stop,"" which makes me question if i am doing something wrong, or if i am just a burden to her. i know i am all she has left, but she keeps trying to push me away and i feel terrible... this is not who she really is. once in a blue moon she will have a good day so her amazing true colors can shine, and it brings me so much sadness to know that she is lost so deep in this void within herself, buried in her trauma and sadness. as of writing this post, she said that she does not want to talk to me because i lie to her (about what, i'm not sure), and avoid her, both of which are not true. i just want my real girlfriend back, not this sad, angry, aggressive person... but i have no idea what to do. please help.",21Nov2019,1
3,"Let me explain a few things first. I have extremely strict parents that won't allow me to date. Actually I am not allowed to date until I finish med school is what they say. Of course, that is ridiculous and I am not going to follow that so I am in my senior year of highschool and I was asked out by my crush. We have been dating for about 2 months now and everything seems to be going smoothly. Now it shouldn't be that hard to hide my boyfriend. I have many friends with secret SO's (because it seems parents are quite anal about it now a days or it could just be where I live). So ideally, it should be easy, but thats not the advice im asking for.

You see my mom works at my school, and she is kind of an infamous teacher. So everyone knows her and everyone knows me. Now I have no enemies or even people who dislike me, so I honestly am not too concerned about people telling my mom (well a little bit, but not that much). Now I have had many people tell me to just tell my parents I am dating someone but if I did, they would actually kill me and probably the guy too. Its honestly so stressful, and this is where the advice part comes in. Is this relationship worth the risk? I mean he is a great guy and the reason I haven't ended things with him even though I have been so stressed is because I am honestly afraid of losing this one. I have been with people in the past just kinda not serious, but I really like him, and I am afraid of losing him. 

Its not only whether or not if its worth it, but I feel like this is so unfair to him. He doesn't deserve someone who can't even be with him at school without keeping an eye out. He deserves someone that can go on dates (I can rarely go out. Ex: I only get to see my best friend once a year). I am not worth it. I am not worth all the stress or trouble. I just wonder if he would be happier with someone else. Should I end things for his sake?",21Nov2019,1
4,"This year me, my friend, and my best friend went to an anime con. My friend only brought about $30-$50 and my mom said for her to save at lest $10 for when we go eat after we leave. My friend ends up spending all of her money and is still trying to buy stuff. My mom decides to be nice and buy her something. Later on our way out of the dealers room (it was a long walk because we don't know our way around) me and my best friend are buying something else. My friend says how come she can't get anything but we still can. My mom tried explaining that she's all out of her money but we still have some left. Right before we left from that part there was a digital drawing table and my friend pointed it out. Me and my best friend said OK and we kept moving. When we went into the game room she got mad and said: ""you guys have been doing all you want and only trying to find fairy tail! I haven't gotten a chance to do anything that I want! ""
Just to clear things up about fairy tail, my best friend was dressed as Lucy and I female Natsu. My friend was some character from yandere simulator. Also to clear up the main problem, it was our first time going to that con. Hell, our first con period! We didn't know where things were but we were looking around to find other stuff. Me, my best friend, her mom, and my mom tried explaining multiple times that we hadn't done what we wanted either vena use we don't know where things are. In the end when we were walking back to the car my friend realized she left her bag (most likely in the game room). My mom told her just to forget it because it's not gonna be there when we get back because of how many people are  there. She was mad the whole way back. My mom stopped at McDonald's to get her food and took her home and the rest of us went to chili's. My mom told me to never bring her anywhere with us ever again. For Halloween this year she asked to go trick or treating with us. Thankfully I had an excuse because it had snowed out. Buy now she's talking about her costume for next year's con. My mom told me to tell her that she can't come or my mom said that you can't come and stuff like that. I really don't have the heart to tell her that she's not coming. I just don't like telling people that they can't participate in things but she just can't come. How do I tell her that she can't come without feeling like an a**?",21Nov2019,1
5,Ok guys so it’s still fall not officially winter yet but I noticed around this time my nose bleeds. In both holes. It’s worse this year.

6,"Hello Reddit! I am coming to you guys to see if I can fix this problem myself before I seek out professional therapy. As the title says, I am a 21F suffering from severe adult ADHD and possibly depression. I was diagnosed with severe depression at the age of 19, went on medication, and then stopped at the age of 20. I was diagnosed with ADHD several months later at the age of 20. The real problem is that I struggle to function like a regular, adult human being. A normal day in my life goes as follows:

1. Wake up between 2-4pm, too late to take my ADHD medication or I will be up all night long (even though that’s what I already do)
2. Stay in bed surfing the internet/social media for a few hours
3. Maybe eat something (probably unhealthy) around 8pm
4. Watch Netflix for hours upon hours and maybe masturbate at the same time
5. Maybe eat something (again, probably unhealthy) around midnight
6. Go to bed between 4-6am

As you can see, my life is monotonous and pretty devoid of meaning, hard-work, and literally anything that a normal human being would do. I used to be very good at…living. Until college, when my ADHD reared its nasty head, I was the perfect person and student. I took 12 AP classes in high school, swam competitively, was in multiple extracurriculars, held down a steady job working 18 hours/week, had a ton of friends, had a great relationship with my parents, etc. However, once college started I began devolving into the person I am today. I began failing classes, and had to withdraw from this semester due to my inability to do well in school. Here are the things I know I need to work on, but cannot figure out how or where to start:

1. Eat healthy meals and on a normal schedule
2. Exercise, but with my current eating habits I am too fatigued to do so
3. Wake up and go to bed at reasonable times, but every time I try to fix my sleep schedule it always reverts back to the terrible one within a week. I also am an extremely deep sleeper and struggle to wake up to an alarm
4. Get out of the house and my room
5. Make friends
6. Be productive. I am a beginner programmer and am trying to work on a few projects but never seem to have the motivation
7. Get a job
8. Be a normal freaking human being

I could use any advice you all could give me, I am really at a loss right now. TIA!",21Nov2019,1

hello. ive had this best friend for 3 whole years. ive dedicated my entire life to her because she was the only friend i had that actually fully understood me and that i could really talk to. we promised to stay in touch because were both in our last year of middle school (8th) and were going to different high schools. we would video call daily for hours on end. there are these other girls. lets call them A and E. one day she left me alone so i asked her about it the next day. she said  “oh i needed to tell E something then i just decided to stay with them.” this became a daily thing. she would leave me all alone and i would see her with A and E. it kept happening. i was all alone for 2 weeks at this point. often not talking at all unless spoken to. she is irreplaceable in my heart. weve shared so many beautiful memories and it seems like shes completely forgotten about me and having a happier time with them. she just replaced me. did i mean that little to her? she just completely replaced me without saying a word and it left me with the ongoing question. what did i do wrong? i see her happy but with them. the last time she texted me she just talked about A and E. everything in her life is about them now and its left a large gaping hole in my happiness. its gotten too far for me to handle. the other day she told me that her best friend is A. it hurt me. shes the only friend i have that i cant replace. this is so painful for me. this morning i woke up and saw E’s story. it was a video call with A and my used to be best friend. i broke down at that moment. it may sound ridiculous but shes left me all alone with no one to even talk to. i could talk to someone about it but she was the only person i could talk to. she took away a portion of my happiness. a portion that cant ever be replaced. why? what did i do? please let me know if i have a right to be emotional or if im just being a dramatic kid.",21Nov2019,1
9,"FOR CONTEXT- \*my previous post originally posted to r/AITA , deleted for breaking rules\*

\-AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to see his exes that he cheated on me with?

My boyfriend (23M) and I (18F) have been officially together for a few months, though we've been involved for almost a year.

Not long into our relationship, he cheated on me with an ex. I have since been very uncomfortable with him maintaining contact with her. He continued to do so, until about two weeks ago when he finally blocked her. The other day, he unblocked her after a fight we had and insists he is going to see her this week to meet up and 'catch up'.

Same thing with the second girl... though his cheating with her was more recent, maybe a month or two ago. He still maintains lots of contact with her, even though I have expressed my discomfort. He cut down the contact for a while, discussing mostly financial stuff, but the same thing as above, he started talking a lot more casually after our fight. He saw her today and says he wants to spend more time with her.

I know I shouldn't stay with someone who cheated. It's a long story, we talked lots, and I guess I understand why he did what he did... I guess one was my fault.

Now I know that people sometimes are friends with exes. I am not, as the ex I have is someone I don't want in my life at all.

My boyfriend tells me I am overreacting, that I just 'don't get it'. I don't have a problem with him having female friends. It does make me uncomfortable when he hangs around exes in general, I'm not sure if this is normal to be uncomfortable about or if it is a result of what happened. He keeps insisting that I'm immature and pushy for not wanting him to be talking to these girls or seeing them. I really don't know anymore... I thought I knew what was a no-go in most relationships, but he's convinced me that I don't. I feel like I'm being punished for our fight, even though he insists I'm not, (we fought over how much he still talked to his ex, even though it was less than now) even though I apologized so many times and took complete responsibility.

AITA for not wanting him to speak to them or see them? Am I right to be uncomfortable? If so, how do I explain this to him? How do I set my boundaries, and get him to understand?-

&amp;#x200B;

\---UPDATE ON THIS, seeking advice!--- 

I was met with an overwhelming amount of reassurance and support on my original post, and plenty of people advising me to leave him.

I confronted him about the issue last night, which, of course, ended up in a messy fight and him denying that anything he was doing was, in fact, wrong.

We ended up breaking up, and I told him I was done... that I had realized how unhappy I had become, etc. All-day today, I have been receiving long messages from him explaining how every issue that arose from all of this was my fault, that I don't listen, that this wasn't even an issue for me to be upset about...

He spent the day talking to the two above mentioned exes and is spending time with one of them tonight and the other tomorrow or something. 

Interestingly enough, speaking to one of them, one with whom he was together for 3 years, I found out she was having the exact same issues with him, and that's why she eventually left. She clearly decided to remain friends with him, but supported me in everything I was saying, and comforted me by reassuring me it was a pattern...

Talking to people who know me has helped me realize that this relationship was indeed toxic, and damaging to me. People outside of the relationship even saw the toxicity, and the toll it was taking on me mentally and emotionally.

However, for some reason, I still feel terrible. It's probably a combination of his words (I know they're just to hurt me...) and missing him. How do I stop missing someone who was so bad for me? How do I stop myself from wanting to apologize, give in? 

I know I don't want him back. It's the emotions talking. The emotional dependence I had built on him. I don't want to keep missing him, I don't want to keep picturing him with another girl and getting upset. I know he will never change. He's proven that over and over again. I just don't know how to get over my first real heartbreak... I don't know how to get past this feeling of losing part of myself.",21Nov2019,1

11,"So this is going to be a long one.

Me (F17) and my friend (F15, who I will call “Heaven” because it is very close to her real name) have been very close friends for a bit over a year now. We have basically never fought and always have a good time together. The both of us bonded over our experiences being LGBT &amp; multiple pop culture things. We constantly talked, in real life and over text, and we have grown very close. I have an extremely hard time getting close with people due to past experiences ( past unhealthy friendships &amp; abandonment issues) so it made me so happy to finally be able to feel this closeness with someone for the first time in years.

A few weeks ago I mentioned my discomfort with the term “Queer” being used as an umbrella term to describe the entire LGBT community as well as complaining about the sixty thousand letters being added to the acronym every day. I told her that I feel like having a thousand different micro labels really hinders the LGBT movement &amp; that I wish people could stop trying to be unique and special. It was mostly to do with the identities “pansexual” and “bisexual”, of which I think are the same thing + that pan is kind of transphobic because it treats trans people as being a totally different gender, not just male or female. She got upset because of this and told me she felt sort of attacked due to the fact she identified as queer but we just left it at that after I changed the subject.

Little did I know that was a sign that the end would come soon.

Everything seemed to be fine at first, we had two sleepovers in the course of the month and it seemed as if we were growing even closer. I even broke down to her about my trauma ( I am a victim of Childhood Sexual Assault) and she was super supportive and let me cry on her shoulder. We were hanging out constantly, always eating lunch together &amp; even would randomly cuddle whenever we watched television together. I was happy, so fucking content with this friendship I had formed &amp; could not wait for the future.

Then I made the mistake about ranting about my mother's fiance. You are probably thinking “What is wrong ranting about that?” and I will tell you...everything now that I look back on it.

My mothers fiance (M43) and I used to be very close, practically best friends. A few years ago they started to apparently have issues with their gender identity &amp; was very confused . I was very supportive at first, giving makeup tips and whatnot, but I soon found their tumblr blog where they talked about their feminization fetish. It quickly became clear to me that they most likely are not trans but just confusing actual dysphoria with a fetish (I am not kinkshaming, believe me I would not do that.). This combined with the fact that I have known them for almost my entire life as male (since I was five) &amp; and all honestly felt weird about the whole thing made me not want to accept their apparent identity. I am in no way transphobic but something about how they always present as male + only seem to dress like a woman for a fetish makes me raise an eyebrow.

I was ranting to my friend about Kennith and she goes radio silent before telling me I am acting kind of like a TERF ( Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist), which I took an offence to. I changed the subject over text soon after but it was fairly awkward after that.

This was the second to last straw I would soon find out

On Friday, Heaven sends me a flyer for an “LGBTQIA+” support group in the area over Discord. I expressed my feelings towards that acronym once again, telling her that I think that asexuals and intersex people arent LGBT &amp; that I am thankful for the offer to go to this with her but I would rather not go to something like that as I know I would get in a fight. She tells me “thats not right man” and says she is not comfortable with being friends with someone with “such different opinions”. I ramble and send her a bunch of messages trying to explain myself but she was having none of it and blocked me. I was in hysterics. I don’t do well with being rejected so I was completely broken.

After a few days I messaged her on Instagram and she blocked me yet again. I message her on my main account and tell her I feel sorry for what I said and begged for forgiveness. She refused to budge and told me she was “uncomfortable with me invalidating her and so many other people” of which I replied with “They are valid I just don’t think they are LGBT”. We eventually agree to talk with one of the school social workers on Monday &amp; I thought things were finally looking up.

DING DONG I WAS WRONG!

She broke her toe &amp; was not at school until today. I had spent the past few days writing her a letter, a letter (with things redacted/changed for anonymitys sake) of which I will link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lS9x3BH78hniOAhGnYt5PxgMbhPbLpZbqNiBXAYLeoM/edit?usp=sharing). I was very cordial and loving throughout and I thought it would work and make her not as mad at me. Turns out none of the social workers would be here today so I decided to just give her the letter &amp; we could talk about it tomorrow. Today I gave her the letter expecting her to be happy. I texted her apologizing for the length and she retorted with telling me that while the length was fine, the contents made her not want to be close at all. I was heartbroken yet again. I started to do damage control, apologizing even more but she was being stubborn. I finally had it. I told her to stop being “so fucking dense”. It took the conversation a complete 180 turn. We start angrily messaging each other and I ended it (while in complete tears in the middle of class) with a sharp “go choke” and I blocked her. I know that was not the best decision but I was upset. Around ten minutes later I unblocked her and told her I was sorry for what I said, that I said it in the heat of the moment. She ten tells me that she is going to the principal with it and that I threatened her (I didn't mean it as such). I continued to spiral and cry as I texted her, going from saying I am sorry to blaming her or all of this because of her childish behavior. In the end, we both blocked each other and I am completely broken. I feel so empty and angry with myself. This happened in the last few hours and I am still wanting to cry every ten seconds. We went through so much and I ruined everything. I might share the redacted messages between us if anybody wants them but I am not going to go through the trouble if it is not wanted.

While I know that I am in the wrong, how should I go about fixing this, if it can be fixed?",21Nov2019,1
12,"I was walking my maltipoo past my local elementary school, when a 12 year old girl came up to me and started talking to me about my dog. She said she was walking home from school, but her house was directly on my walking path. She told me about her life, school etc. while I tried to keep my space and look disinterested.  In hindsight I should have used a voice recorder on my phone (to free me of any wrongdoing in case something happened), but I wasn't doing anything wrong so at the time I didn't feel the need to. Her house was around a mile away, so once we got there, I said bye and kept walking.

I'm a 22 y/o large brown guy (6'5 205lbs) and she was an average white 12 year old girl, so I could see why people would get the wrong idea. I felt really awkward especially  when cars and other dog walkers were passing by, but I'm  not sure how I could/if I should have handled it any differently. I was also worried for her, because she had no reservations about walking with me and telling me personal details. Of course I had no bad intentions, but I can't say the same about some sexual predator who would take advantage of that.",21Nov2019,1
13,"I \[22M\] basically am about to graduate if I don't screw up.

14,"I currently am in a one-act club, and we compete. This is my second year in it--I wanted to join during fresh year, but didn't have people interested. First of all, last year's 'auditions' went by so smoothly. There were 6 of us, and we all agreed on a script. Additionally, we talked with each other about which parts we wanted (all of us were 'leads' and had our moments). I got the role which I hoped for (rude and blunt character who loses his temper often) because it worked out with my personality (I keep stuff to myself, but when I'm upset, I do a 180). The six of us got last because one of our members (let's call them J) said we didn't need to practice the day we were going to perform. We were also a bit late to the venue. The person who stated that we didn't need practice also yelled and snapped at another member (lets call them F). J accused of F of being too controlling of the team and calling shots. I didn't say anything because I agreed with both sides. To me, F was calling shots and no one wanted to dispute them because they don't want trouble. J was also being dramatic and wanted to call the shots. She called the shots on our last practice (decided we were 'good'), and we got screwed over. F cried when we lost and placed 8 of 8 (meaning last). F kept stating we were better than the first place (they've been in musical and one-act for years almost their whole life). My team kept saying third place was really bad and didn't deserve it (in my humble opinion, I enjoyed their acting. It also seemed like they were having fun on stage and it made me have fun). 4 out of 6 members were upset, pissed and crying about our lost. Personally, I get why we lost. We got cocky and everything. There was tension and etc.

This year, we have 10 students in one-act. Four out of the six last year joined (other 2 graduated). The issue is, J insists about a play that no much people like. The only person who agreed was J's S/O. J wanted to play lead (J is a sophomore now). I personally didn't care who gets lead as long as we have fun. But, I dislike J's  choice of play. The characters had little to no development and only revolved around the lead. The side characters' purpose was to make the lead look good. A lot of people disputed it and J was upset. F strongly disputed it and stated, ""I will quit if we do the play xxxxxx."" Now, we decided on a one-act (FINALLY!), but it doesn't click well with me (whatever, I'll deal with it). The play has all the characters as a 'lead'. But J didn't like it. We could tell, she felt sour about the play. Now, we were deciding on roles and who gets to play who  (director will choose this time). We have to write in our number one pick and least favorite. The issue is, there's a character similar to the character i played last time. However, I don't want to play the same type of character. I enjoy being rude on stage (acting!), but it became bland. I wanted one that resonated with me. I wanted to tell MY  STORY through the character I play. I found the perfect one. I immediately auditioned for it and tried my best to perform with all passion I've got. I also found another back-up option which I resonated with but not as much. I gave it my all and had fun! Great! F wanted to audition for something different, so NICE! J didn't have a passion, but once she realized the character I auditioned for helped make the story roll, she wanted to audition for it (aweeee. competition, but it's okay! may the best win!). There are a lot of monologues, and J doesn't want the newer kids to have a monologue and keeps repeating, ""it should be to us four! We know what we are doing! We're better!"" So, I'm sick of it but don't want to cause trouble. I'm a senior and I DO NOT care for seniority. If someone is good with that role, go ahead. HAve fun. But, J is making a big deal about me wanting to audition for the same character. In my humble opinion, I can easily relay how this character feels, because I went through what the character went through. J is really good too, they can be dramatic and etc. But, I don't want trouble. What should I say to J? Should I just back off and let J have the character? I just want to tell my story through a character, that way it's anonymous. If our director chooses J and not me, I'll be upset. But, I won't really hold it against anyone. I just want a fair and square audition, but I don't want drama and tension.",21Nov2019,1
17,"It all started 4 months ago, when I was invited at a birthday party of a female colleague. At the same party was invited my bestfriend too. There I met one of my colleague friend which I found very attractive (for some reason I still can't quite explain). 



After I had talked with that girl and helped her with a problem she had, my bestfriend showed up. He introduced himself with everyone, and came and talked to me. 



After a while, he told me that this particular girl (which was the same I liked) was really nice. I was a bit shocked, as I didn't expect that my bestfriend would like the same type of girl I liked (our taste is quite different). He caught me of guard and the only thing I said to him was ""yeah, you are right"". Deep inside me I knew that this girl wouldn't be interested in him because they were completely different characters.



After a little thought, I believed that either way we wouldn't see this girl again so it's not a big deal. Bit little did I know that my colleague, her friend(which another friend of mine would date and the girl I liked would invite us to hang out few more times.



After a month or so, my bestfriend went on a date(or as  he believed it was a date with the girl I liked,and she said to him that she didn't like him that way). My friend tried a couple of times after that , but he only managed to make the girl feel uncomfortable hanging out with him  and in result with the rest of us too, as we all changed out together.



A couple of days ago, some of the group came up together again, but this time the girl came because she knew that mu bestfriend would be missing. The result was me falling even more for her.


She hasn't show any sign from her behalf that she likes me (or any that I caught at least. I am reallyt bad at this things). Should I make a move and tell my  bestfriend while I risk to farther make the girl feel uncomfortable? I also have to mention that my friend is still trying to flirt with her.",21Nov2019,1
18,This week I was given a task to create a flashy website for our department. I have the knowledge of doing so and my boss who ordered this task told me that I can take my time in order to deliver a well made website. However the manager of my department is trying to push the deadline to this Saturday! I’m really conflicted whether I should listen to my boss or my manager because I literally can’t make a whole website in 5 days! And if it were to take 5 days I would have to work night and day! I’m not getting paid enough for this shit! What should I do?,21Nov2019,1

Hey guys,

Yesterday I witnessed a kid in class being fat shamed and bullied behind his back. I’m not going to sugar coat it the kid that was being bullied was not the most pleasant to be around. But I sat there and watched the bully mock him and make fun of him. I desperately wanted to help him, but I for some reason couldn’t speak. I was angry and I left that class angry not only at the bully but at myself for not doing something. So last night I laid in bed rehearsing what I was going to say to the bully in class. Now this morning I went into my 5th period (econ) and was filled with rage and anger when I saw that now the bullies were throwing food at the kid. And at that moment I gave him a piece of my mind. And the bully brushed it off and tried to act cool , that’s when I rock it one step further and told the teacher and then I got a thank you from the kid I was standing up for. It feels good to stand up and speak your mind versus not saying anything and beating yourself up for not saying anything. But I don’t want to make people feel like this act was brave or heroic in someway or form because I believe that if we all were to stand up to bullies then, more people could enjoy their lives. Jeremy Epstein didn't kill himself, the jews did 9/11, and the Sandy Hook Shooting was a false flag operation set into motion by members of the CIA and FBI.",21Nov2019,1

24,"Hey guys I don’t know if this is the right sub for this. But I had a previous handle before I made this one that I use on pretty much all my social media sights. I’m pretty lazy and I’ve used the same username since I was 15 so it’s honestly just out of habit at this point. I don’t post things very much and I’m always vigilant to not post anything inappropriate and I keep my political posts to a minimum on twitter and other social media sights. This is actually my first post I’ve ever made on reddit. I normally just scroll and hand out upvotes and maybe the occasional downvote. Well I searched my old handle on google images just to see what comes up, and there are many posts that I have upvoted on reddit that pop up along with a few pictures of me from other social media sights. None of them are really that big of a deal but some of the memes I have upvoted I’d rather not have attached to my face on the internet just because they’d be a little inappropriate (although funny) if a future employer found my handle and googled it (which wouldn’t be too hard because it has my first name in it, and it’s literally the handle for all my other sights) I had no idea upvotes tied your handle to the post. It even looks like I was the one who posted it if you didn’t look carefully. Has anyone else ever noticed this before? Is there anyway I could remove them? Am I worrying over nothing? 

TL;DR: I googled my old handle name and posts I’ve upvoted pop up in google images along with my other social media sights.",21Nov2019,1

31,"Hey guys, 
I’m a 26 year old recent college graduate working towards getting my CPA and working at a small accounting firm in my hometown. Like really small, I’m one of three people. I’m making peanuts right now doing simple bookkeeping stuff, but my pay will increase little by little every few months and jump big when I pass the CPA exam. The people are cool, but honestly, I kinda hate the job itself, as well as living in my hometown; I’m beginning to feel like I made the wrong choice in college major. I studied accounting because I’ve been told it’s a practical and safe way to make a good living, but what’s the point if I’m not happy? 

I’ve always wanted to live in LA be involved in the entertainment industry, but have always thought it was too risky to pursue so chose a more stable path. Now I’m starting to debate whether it would be worth it to drop everything, move out to LA, and work entry level/minimum wage jobs while I pursue my dreams. I’m not too concerned about being broke anymore, as long as I’m pursuing something worthwhile; I’m fine with eating ramen every meal and having tons of roommates to afford LA for the foreseeable future. My happiest memories were being a dirt poor college student working menial jobs then coming home and drinking with my roommates. The only thing holding me back from packing up and moving is debt I’m currently paying off. I just want to escape my city and current situation, I’m very lonely and depressed in my hometown and can’t see myself being happy going down this career path, regardless of the financial security.

33,"The formatting may be horrid due to being on my phone. Sorry for the excessive use of quotes.


I work for a company that employees only 4 employees (+ our new boss) so, 5 total; Accountant/Accounts Payable/Inventory/""HR"", 2 Sales People/Shipping, and a Graphic Designer.


2 months ago, our owner left to take care of a sick family member and left our new ""boss"", let's call him Matt, in charge. 


Matt is the definition of abusive and narcissistic. 


Matt has hired graphic designers outside of our company, because he didn't want our in house designer doing it, despite the fact that the designer has been with the company for over 5 years. 


Matt buys products from other stores all the time, to ""get an idea"" for how to upgrade our products. Aka ripoff other brands. So far, this has accumulated to over $1,000 in only 2 months.


Matt has his own designers mockup the new products he wants to sell, without getting an input from the rest of us, and sends off the product designs to China without any editing. We have already received a prototype that spells our company name wrong.


Matt talks non-stop about how much experience he has, how he helps build brands, and that he is a mentor to all of us... People pick their own mentors, they aren't assigned one, thank you very much!


Matt keeps us out of the loop on sales deals he creates with customers. Thus, the sales people have not honored them, since they never even knew of them. And shipping wise, he has never checked with me (the pricing person) and we have lost over $7,000 just in shipping expenses due to free shipping offers.


We needed help with Accounts Receivable since we are all so overworked. So he hired his girlfriend. Who is making more per hour than all of us, and then some.


He has yelled and had outbursts at employees. He doesn't notice how stressed we all are. We have paperwork all over the office, which he has commented on, and we all have expressed that we don't even have time to look at all the orders not yet processed, let alone the old orders we did. We are all very young as well, 25-31, while he is in his 50s, he makes his dominance known by not calling us by name, instead ""kid"".


Also, he doesn't do the dishes in our TINY sink; he has a buildup of silverware and tubberwaee in the sink, leaving no silverware for the rest of us. (All the silverware is my own that I brought from home for all of us)


Finally, we can't go a day without him talking in 3rd person about how great he is. ""Customers tell me, Matt, you are turning the company around."" ""Matt, if it weren't for you, that company would be out of business."" He also talks about how stressed he is, and that none of us understand ""real stress"".


How do I deal with this? Our graphic designer and 1 of the salespeople has already threatened to quit, and I'm in the same boat. I am doing the job of what is normally 3 or 4 people. Since I am the accountant, I see the money going out the door, and since I am HR, people are coming to me with issues. Who do I go to?! I have nobody above me to get in touch with. I can't contact our owner and any criticism given to Matt returns in great hostility towards me (think Amy from Amy's Baking Company on Kitchen Nnightmares).


At the rate I'm going I will last another month, at most. I don't sleep and I can't even take breaks since I have to be available my whole shift.",21Nov2019,1

38,"Looking for some advice on this situation. A friend of mine was explaining how she doesn’t let her child have a relationship with their absent father’s family but she has considered it in the past. This is due to the family waiting so many years before they reached out about the child. She said it was “their loss” and I told her that I personally would let my child know their paternal side of their family because it’s not for the family, it’s for the child. This seemed to offend her. I explained that I’ve seen how having a relationship with that part of their family could provide healing/closure (as I have personally witnessed). She seemed kind of distant so I clarified that her way isn’t wrong or anything, I just wasn’t sure if I would do the same. I made it a point to let her know that I wasn’t judging her decision or anything and that only she knows her specific situation and what’s best for her child. She still seems super offended and I kind of feel like an asshole. Was I wrong for giving my opinion on such a sensitive topic?  How do I go forward with this.",21Nov2019,1

Usually I’ll text some friends but I spent all of yesterday afternoon sobbing because I decided I was going to do it, I cried myself to sleep and had to wake up and act like I didn’t think any of what I did the night before, I was going to go to school because the office is up my ass now for not going to classes and just running out of school when I’m irritated or overwhelmed. I feel like such a disappointment, I never expected myself to be this person. My grades are slipping so harshly. I failed my spanish class this term. I’ve never failed a class, I don’t know who I am. This isn’t me and I can’t do anything about it. I didn’t go to school, I hate being there. I haven’t seen my friends in weeks because I only go once or twice a week. I’ve fallen off the deep end and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been sort of like this before. I was depressed last year and a lot of teachers noticed and were concerned but I don’t know what to do. I tried getting help last year but my mom got so angry about it. And I don’t want to hurt her feelings again because parents always take these type of things personally, she’s not the type to have a one on one personal conversation about this to try and tell her that it’s best for me so I don’t know. I was hoping I could just suck it up until college but I don’t think I’ll even be getting into college, and I know that if I don’t get into college I will kill myself, I wanna be me again I want to go to school I want to do well but I can’t.

And I can’t drop it to take the extracurriculars I want because they don’t allow juniors to join carpentry 1 or anything. I feel so fucked and so lost and behind. I’m digging myself a deeper hole but I can’t do it I can’t do what everyone else is doing I’m so unhappy.

43,"I’m a woman in my early 20s and this is my 3rd semester. My uni is relatively small and the class for my semester is around 20-30 students. 

I get along with nearly all of them I even considered a lot of them my friends but a few days ago I was called into a meeting with (2 of 3 of) our professors and they told me that multiple students have said that I hit someone, harass students, make them feel unsafe being around me and mostly of threatening with violence and if I don’t stop this behaviour I will be expelled. 

This came completely out of the blue for. I have pretty bad anxiety and this semester I barely even talked to anyone at uni besides my boyfriend and my project team mates with whom I get along with really well. 

Now the only person I truly don’t get along with is another woman in my class whom I used to be friends with and we’ve worked on projects together in the past two semesters. At the end of our second semester we had a falling out after she sent one of our professor a list of reasons why I am a terrible team mate. Her first line was that I was a liar, followed by a bunch of twisted truths and 2 project related issues that I have owned up to (or so I thought). Now back then our professor refused to listen to me when I tried to explain my side. 

Because of this i hadn’t said a single word to her since then but by asking around my class a little I quickly found out that she was in fact the person who when to the professor again and accused me of terrible thing I have never done. And once again the professors refused to listen to me. When I tried to tell them this can’t be true they completely shut me down, even when I asked for what exactly it was that I had done. 

I am really really upset and I have absolutely lost trust in pretty much everyone of my classmates and friends

I’m trying to stay calm but it upsets me to much and I can’t stop thinking about it and making a mental list of who Vouched for this woman. And I do not feel like I’m being treated fairly by my professors. 

I’ve been trying to arrange another meeting but they have just been avoiding me. 

I don’t want to be expelled for something when I don’t even know what it is that I’ve done that triggered people into believing it is threatening behaviour (I repeat, I barely even talk to anyone and my social anxiety is so bad I’m even too afraid to speak up or walk away when being sexually or verbally harassed myself) and these are incredibly serious accusations I don’t just want to ignore this issue. All the drama aside I actually like this uni and my courses but I am afraid that for the next 2 years this woman is going to continue to try and ruin my life. 

Whenever I get angry I avoid talking to people and leave the room until I’ve calmed down. 

I don’t know what to do this is draining my life energy. I want this problem to get resolved asap but I am also incredibly scared. It’s only been a few days but I’m so stressed I’m getting physical pain.

How can I prove that I’m innocent? How can I get my professors to give me a concrete example of what I have done wrong? 

I don’t want to take legal actions unless this really escalated. Also I DO NOT want to get revenge. I’ve been bullied throughout my entire childhood and I absolutely condone any kind of violence or abuse.",21Nov2019,1

53,"I’m a high school student in Virginia. I’m an above average student in terms of my coursework and stats, but since Virginia’s colleges are all semi prestigious, my stats get me very little money in terms of scholarships. In my college research, I found a few colleges in the south that would - due to the low out of state tuition and great scholarships - be FAR cheaper than the majority of my in state options. My favorite school is in Mississippi. At most, I’ll pay about $8,000 - $10,000/yr and I’m pretty competitive for a full ride. Outside of that, it checks all of my boxes: decent sized black population, LGBT orgs, medium sized, lots to do in the area. 

However, I do have some reservations.

* Cost of getting to and from home. There is a small airport nearby. Flights are about $200 for a round trips to get from there to home (Richmond/or a DC airport). Is this reasonable to pay ~3 times a year on a part time, barely above minimum wage job? 

* Both of my parents are concerned that I, a black lesbian from the north, won’t fit in down there. They’re worried that things haven’t changed much for black people (which is why I like that this college is ~35% black). I’m divided on this.

All that aside, I’ve always lived with my mom, and I’ve never been fully independent. I’d be lying if I said I knew how to even pay bills. She never taught me anything, and always does everything for me. 
I constantly give her money, because I don’t know how to tell her no. I will admit, I have a spending problem, which she doesn’t help me with. She feeds it, and tells me I should buy this and that, and will ask me to buy her something, saying she’ll pay me back. Yet she never does.

I eventually tried to make a credit karma account, and found out that she made one in my name.  I made an account on Credit Sesame, and found out my credit was 492. 

I’ve only ever had one credit card that I got when I was 19. It was just a Kohl’s credit card, where the max was 300$. Something easy for me to always pay back since at the time I was working at Amazon for 15.00 an hour, working about 60 hours a week. I always gave my mom the money to pay it when it was due. 
However it says I’ve never paid it back, and I owe 500$, along with owning 2,000$ to other things I’ve never heard of. 

My mom told me that it was wrong, and that I can dispute it. However she has a history of writing bad checks, and she’s done so in my grandparents name. Making them go bankrupt. She has a felony for fraud, and owes so much money to so many places. 
She even used my sister’s social, and ruined her credit when she was underage at that. She’s forged my GED to look like my sister got one. She’s claimed my sisters died so she can get money from people on Facebook. Pawned my belongings off, lied to me about it. So much more. 

I feel trapped, and my dad has helped to the best of his ability. But I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, I don’t want to believe she’d do this to me, but all evidence points to her. 

I love her, she raised me, but how could she do this to me? I’ve never done anything to deserve any of this. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.",21Nov2019,1
55,"I'll try get down the entire story but summarised. I'm turning 18 in a week, she's already 18 just for some context.


I've been crushing on this girl since grade 7, and we both just graduated. I wasn't actually close friends with her until late last year. I asked her out on a date on new years last year, and we went on a date together. After the date she basically rejected me, and I later found out through a mutual that she only went on the date with me because 'she felt bad.' I cut contact for a month because I was extremely hurt by what she said, but I moved on and we became friends again. During this time she's been hooking with one of my really good friends, which in all honesty hurt quite a lot because I was still low-key crushing on her during this time.

Mid-way through this year I started dating someone else, which lasted for around 3 months. It was my first proper relationship, and thus my first break-up which oneitis helped me through. A month or so after my breakup oneitis and I went out and had a few drinks and ended up making out that night. I realised that it probably didn't mean anything because she had already rejected me and I accepted that.

We hooked up only once again around 2 months ago but it wasn't nearly as good as the first time and we both recognised that. However, the past month we've been spending a lot more time together but she has started to pull away from me and I'm only now realising how overly fucking attached I am, and that it's extremely hard for me to stay friends with her while she hooks up with other guys.

How do I get over this girl and stop feeling like shit when she doesn't respond to my texts/hooks up with other guys. I know how overly attached and shitty I am and sound, but I have literally been crushing on this girl for 5 years now. Please help",21Nov2019,1

I live about two hours from her but lately she's been taking jobs on the weekends when I have off and it's been over a month since I've seen her. Usually I have to drive to her and it may only be a single night I can stay since often times she'll be off Saturday and work Sunday. 

It just seems like things are getting harder and harder. On weekends I want to do something other than drive two hours there and two hour back I feel guilty because it's a whole week if not longer till I can see her again. We normally text throughout the day but these passed few weeks I've been bad at reaching out to her and I just often times don't know what to talk to her about. We both just seem pretty depressed and sometimes talking to her just makes me more sad. If we call at night she usually complains about her job till we say goodnight and go to bed. Lately she said she's felt frustrated and neglected. I took that really hard and I'm trying to be more communicative but she really struck a nerve since it's been a while since she's come to see me and I've been trying really hard.

I want to move and get a job closer to her but it's a long and expensive process to move and I've been saving money but it's taking longer than expected. I guess the advice I'm looking for is what are some ways to keep things interesting even if it's over the phone? Should I feel guilty choosing friends or family over driving to see her?

She has a hard time getting along with essentially everyone in our family and has had a revolving door of relationships and friends. I just feel so weird about it. Her last straw was when I accidentally forgot about some plans we made when I was experiencing the deepest, darkest depressive episode in my life. I was barely a person and fucking up everything despite my best efforts. 

I eventually just shut down and isolated. There’s more to my personal back story but it’s not that important. 

She has a habit of criticizing and punishing any mistake (big or small), or anything she takes issue to, a lot of the time really disproportionately. It’s complicated too because she’s my half sister so there’s a lot going on with that that I feel she takes out on me (or in her mind sincerely thinks I’m at fault), and just stacks fault after fault on a person, makes up her mind, and there’s no changing it. This time I elected to pull back and stop trying. Essentially I’d reached out to her several times with no reciprocation, then she moved away so I just stopped. 

The thing is, if I reach out to her again either it will be fine or she’ll lay on a bunch of stuff I couldn’t have possibly known was bothering her. She sincerely just dislikes my existence to its core and there’s nothing I can do about it and I’m absolutely disinterested in being on the receiving end of her hurtfulness from here on out. I’ve just taken too much shit from too many people.",21Nov2019,1
75,"Some context about my school because I may just be overdramatizing everything (as my mom tells me). I go to a college preparatory school, which means that the people here prepare me for college. It is also a charter school may I add.

I, however, am tired of coming here. Before coming here, I went to public school. Public school may not be a great as some say but I personally think it’s a lot better than what I see/go through on a daily basis. I was just barely starting my sophomore year when out of nowhere my mom tells me that I’m transferring and she doesn’t let me have a say in it. Typical, of her. I should have been used to her not letting me have a say, but I wasn’t. I begged and begged and I got nowhere.

My school has rules as all schools generally have such as not wearing you hat/hood inside, not use your phone during class (we actually have pouches to put our phones in; they lock them up, we carry them for the whole day, and at the end of the day use a magnet to unlock it); ect.

My school gives out detention like candy. Every little thing will get you a detention and such examples are: going down the wrong stairwell, having your phone make a noise in the pouch, if you drink juice in class, not having water in a clear bottle, wearing the wrong colored shoes (we have a rule of wearing all black shoes, so this one I understand), wearing outerwear that is not provided by the school inside the building (this includes: hoodies, sweatshirts, light coats, sweaters, maybe more), and so on so forth.

In order to graduate, the requirement is to have 80 or more hours of community service and to have been accepted to a college. We have these state-like tests that are worth 20% of our grades and are required to do an end of year project that is worth 25% of our grades. There’s a new teacher every year and they keep firing teachers for the littlest things. The work is way too much. One time I was up until 11 PM finishing homework (they also give you detention for not completing homework).

The people here are absolutely toxic. I know not everyone is going to like you, but it’s a toxic environment. Let one secret loose and everyone knows what you did. Everyone will spread rumors about you just to see you cry. They’ll ruin friendships just because they don’t like you. Bullies don’t get consequences. One time a girl who I don’t even talk to wanted to fight me because she thought I said something that I didn’t even say. One time, a girl in my grade got beat up just because she was talking to some girl’s ex.

I keep telling my mom I want to transfer back to my old school, but she wants me to stay here because of the 100% college acceptance rate and how this school has such a high reputation where I live. She tells me I’m just being dramatic and that if these things are happening then I should mind my own business. I want to cry and scream because of this school.

Unfortunately, half of the time I do believe I’m just being dramatic.

i got out of a a year and a half long relationship recently. 

we started dating out of high school, when i was 17. im now 20.

the person i was dating was manipulative of me. 

they used guilt tripping to get me to buy them food, clothes, transportation, and gifts - saying things like they wouldn’t eat if i didn’t get them food.

at one point they also owed me 1K that i lent them to cover their impending debts near the start of our relationship, and they didnt pay most of it back until i asked for it six months after we had broken up. 

i had to schedule time with my friends with them beforehand so that they could plan for me to be busy hanging out with people. 
i had to check my phone constantly for fear of getting them upset with me for taking too long to respond. 

i had to ask them beforehand if i wanted to smoke weed, and when they told me not to and i did it anyway they regularly got upset with me. 

among other things. 

i did things wrong too. i lied about my weed use, saying i was gonna quit for them, and smoking behind their back. i broke consent once because i was high. i hide all my feelings as a habit. i exchanged nudes with some random person from the internet for a night while we were “on a break” (real life ross and rachel argument LOL). and probably more things i cant remember or didn’t get to hear from them. 

and so now, this ex has me blocked everywhere. on instagram, snapchat, twitter, and my cell number too. 
we have a lot of mutual friends because we went to high school together. 

some of their close friends that are also my friends have unfollowed me on all the social medias.
ive also seen vague posts from them calling someone (probably me) a “fucking freak and a liar”, and other things that read as them vagueposting their anger with me. 

and i cant stop thinking about what they are saying about me to our friends, if it’s lies or truth....

I constantly begged my parents to get me braces because everyone had them and I guess they were considered “cool” at the time. Boy was I wrong. I finally got my braces in the summer after fifth grade. Oh. My. God. They hurt like a bitch. I remember having instant regret once they put that piece of metal wire in my mouth. The pain was enough to put me on a smoothie/mashed potato/ macaroni and cheese diet for a solid 3 weeks. Eventually, I got used to shifting and was good for about 3 months. And then the rubber bands. When they put those rubber rings in my mouth, I had the same exact pain that I did when I first got braces. I will honestly admit that I didn’t wear the rubber bands all the time, but when I did, they hurt like hell.  For the plan I was on, I was only suppose to have my braces for a total of 18 months, or from fifth grade to the middle of seventh grade. Wrong. Because of me not wearing my rubber bands, I still have my braces on and I’m in tenth grade. I’ve had my braces on for 4.5 years now or 54 months. Three years longer than what I should’ve had. And because of this, almost all my friends I’ve made to this day only know me with braces. Anyways, during 9th grade, I got into a relationship (I was 14 I don’t know if that even counts), but after we broke up, it left me depressed and with no self confidence. Fast travel to this year (tenth grade), I think I am depressed again after almost failing 3 classes within the first two months of school. With this, my parents, who are Asian, flipped shit when my report card came in and now I lose a little bit of what’s left of my happiness.

87,"I work for a small tech company for 5 years now and 1 year ago my boss offered me minor partnership (15% - 25%, he is currently the only owner and plans on having two more partners, one of them is me) that I refused because I work remotely and, if I had accepted it, I would have to start going everyday to the office — which is in the next town over, that I really, really hate (too crowded, crime is high, traffic, trauma, etc) and has a commute time of 4h (2+2) — and because I'm also planning on moving to another country ""in a very near future"".

Some personal background on my work in the company: I'm 27, have been working hard for the past 5 years on this company, specially on the past year, as all the people who were at the company before I entered (besides my boss) have since left so I have ""seniority"" I guess. I really enjoy working hours as I almost never have to work overtime (usually 8 AM to 5 / 6 PM).

Well, back to it...

This week, he offered the partnership again, with the difference being that I can keep working remotely (even when I move to another country). This past year he had his first child, reevaluated his beliefs, the need for being present in the office and for having a physical office at all, etc. I would have more responsibilities (not that much more, since it's a minor partnership) and no need to invest money to start being a partner. Also, I'd have a increased salary as well.

The thing is that, besides being scared as I always am, I'm afraid of being ""tied"" more strongly to a job. I know this sounds stupid because there are a lot of people that would kill for job stability, it's just me being afraid, I guess. I plan on moving to another country next September, so almost an year from now, and I had planned to keep working for this company even for a few months after I moved, and then I'd start looking for jobs in the new country (usually better pay, better work-life balance and also so I wouldn't have to work in two different time zones).

I'm a programmer, I work with websites and apps, but I have this dream of working with games, programming games maybe...this new country would be closer to this dream (my current country doesn't really have gaming jobs).

I'm thinking ""Well, if I plan to keep working for this company for the next 1,5 year (rounding up) anyway, I might as well do it while receiving a better salary and having more autonomy"". However, I'm also thinking ""But if I plan on leaving the company after such little time (or not, things might change, the company can really pick up wind, I don't know) is it worth it? For me, for my boss? Wouldn't it be harder to 'disassociate' myself with the company if I'm partner? Is it fair to leave and get a chunk of it after such little time?""

91,"Throwaway account because I don't want this to be traced. Okay let me provide A LOT of context. My little brother was caught playing on my dad's iPad when he wasn't allowed to and was banned from playing video games and using his laptop for the rest of the week. My dad told me that after I come home from school I should call him in case my brother uses his lap top. I got home from school the next day and lo and behold, he was using his computer. I repeatedly told him to get off his computer and he didn't listen to me, so I got the phone and threatened to call our dad. He just laughed at me and said ""please I know you won't"" and that's when I hit speed dial and told my dad what he was doing, my brother's expression quickly changed to shock and he ended up explaining his way out of it. But as soon as he got off the phone with him my brother blew up at me and started screaming, I was calm and explained why I did it but he just kept yelling. Eventually he stopped and I went up to my room and thought that was the end of it until he came up to my room five minutes later with a knife and threatened to cut me, I somehow managed to talk him out of it and he ended up going into his room. My mom eventually came home but I didn't tell her because I felt that I had handled it properly. I went outside to bike for a bit and came back and at this time my dad was home from work, he called my little brother down from his room to lecture him on why he didn't ask for his computer but we all noticed that he had cuts on his face and arms. We asked him about how he got them and he told us THAT HE WAS CUTTING HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULDN'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES. At that point our parents went ballistic and were screaming at him and hitting him and they are threatening to call social services to have him taken away. My question is, how do I deal with my brother and the insane shit he does and calm my parents so they don't get rid of him? I don't want him to be taken away but I really have no idea what to do.

TL;DR My little brother got banned from video games and cut himself in response to the punishment, parents freaked out and want to send him away.",21Nov2019,1

93,"I know this is a ridiculous thing to think about, but I've been thinking about this for a while and need to get it off my chest. I'm a teenager from a small Maritime Canadian town. My parents are fairly liberal, but the town I live in is conservative (not the Nazi kind so much as the everybody-should-mind-their-own-business kind) and fairly religious. I think I'm a pretty moderate, centrist guy, but just for context, here's how I feel about some issues here in Canada:

- I eat meat, enjoy eating meat, and have no desire to stop. I have vegetarian friends, but dislike anybody who tries to force it on me. I think replacing meat with Beyond Meat is a waste of time.

- I don't like people who demonize farmers and blame them for climate change, etc. Or those who say all farmers abuse their animals/ have no regard for animal rights. I support hunting, and believe that if people want to hunt, they should have that right

- I think that post-secondary education should be free, or at least cost considerably less than it does now

- I dislike double-standards I sometimes see with regards to racism and sexism (straight white male almost seems an insulting epithet in some circles).

- I support gay people (they're no different from straight people, and really fun to hang out with, honestly). I am somewhat uncomfortable with transgenders, and find it hard to believe that gender dysphoria is not a disorder. I honestly cannot comprehend their being more than two genders, as most ""third sexes"" in other cultures just seem to be trans or effeminate men. Either way, I see no reason to jump on the progressive bandwagon with regards to that

- I believe in ""change through evolution, not revolution.""

- I think climate change is a thing, but Greta Thunburg approach bothers me (maybe she comes across as holier-than-thou. I dunno).

- I am religious, believe in God, and interpret the Bible as a collection of divine metaphors, with historical materiel found throughout. New Atheism is extremely distressing to me (à la Richard Dawkins)

My question is: will I be on the wrong side of history? Will me points of view be considered backwards in 50 years? Sometimes, I feel isolated in my convictions: I don't support all the social stuff or censorship that seems so integral to the modern left, while the right is too unregulated capitalist and anti-union for me to really identify with them. Is it just me who feels this way. Will I be that outcast who quietly mourns the values of his youth in his old age? Let me know what you think!",21Nov2019,1

97,"I was never very social, but back in high school I had a few friends I’d talk with daily, mostly to talk shit about other people with.

Since I started college and explored new ideas and heard many kind people speak, I realized I was really judgmental of myself and others. I’ve worked on that and the relationships I do have are more supportive, much less stressful and people seem to be more comfortable around me. It should be easier to socialize right?

But I’m struggling. Due to lack of effort and getting caught up in recent challenges, my old friends have drifted away. I’m trying to reach out to new people, but conversation doesn’t come easy 

I find the most substantive, reliable topics can be the lives and interests of the people talking. Here’s where I run into trouble. I’ve been dealing with personal challenges which have taken up most of my time and attention. I’m not always up to sharing those challenges, and my conversation partner may not be interested in it or able to relate to it. I’m also terribly shy about sharing my interests and haven’t made much time developing them. While I do appreciate talking about the other person’s life and interests, I wish I could bring myself to the conversation. 

To make things worse, the main things my coworkers discuss is talking shit at length about recent minor perceived slights and inadequacies. And sexist generalizations. Observational “humor”. I wonder if I even want to be friends with most of these people. Recently I pointed out a particularly egregious example to them, and all 5 or so people decided to argue that what they said was above question because they were “right”.

But, I know I really do want to have friends at work. I wonder if speaking my mind and sharing things about myself (and listening to others) is enough. It might be. It just feels like crap right now, and it might be a while before any friends come out of the woodwork...

Can anyone relate? Any advice?

98,"hi.

i cannot do math. like, at all. i can barely remember my multiplication tables. i’ve gotten up to this point (11th grade USA) passing math classes with a B average just by cheating my way through and doing what I can.

This year, Algebra 2 is kicking my ass. I barely passed the first trimester class and now I have a 25% grade in my second trimester class now. I’ve given up. I haven’t turned in any assignments and I turned in my quiz half finished. I just feel so lost that I don’t know what to do.

I have a tutor. We only meet once a week, though. I would like to say that she helps but I end up forgetting everything she taught me by the time I get to class the next day. Everything in class just seems to advanced for me, despite being in the average class.

I scored high on the SAT last year with above average scores in everything except math, where I was significantly under average performance. I’m taking the SAT again this spring and I’m hoping to have gotten my shit together at that point.

The point is, I have no idea how to do any math. I’m practically stuck at middle school level in my upperclassmen class. I can’t even go into my math room without crying and shutting down. I feel really childish saying that, but it’s true. I get there and I try to focus but then I get lost on one tiny thing and just shut down for the rest of class.

I don’t know what I’m asking for. I have a tutor but my parents won’t help me. I haven’t tried talking to the teacher because I’m really insecure about this and I also don’t want to stay after school to get stuff done (I only have two classes and both are important so I can’t skip those for math)

I dunno. I’m so lost. I was doing okay at the start of the year but a million shitty things happened (parents forgot my 16th birthday, my dog died, my hedgehog died, all within a month) and I guess that effected me a lot in the long run.

Every conversation I tried to start fizzled out -- ""I like your scarf, what's it made of?"" dismissive response, change the subject. ""Is your team in charge of hiring for the other floors? You must be so busy."" look of mild embarrassment or disapproval (hard to tell). ""How do you like your smart watch?"" it's fine, no follow-up.

111,"I (25m) married my wife (25f) in May. This situation has been ongoing for almost 4 years, but since our wedding the whole situation has come to my attention.

My best friend and groomsman Mike(25m) liked a girl in college. He mysteriously lost contact her but unlike everyone else who ghosts a girl he has never moved on from her. The girl is Amy(25f). 

Amy and I grew up near one another and so several other friends of mine are the ones who are upset at my wife as they like Amy. But Amy is an introvert who has something going on constantly. 

The whole situation is, my wife over the years undermined Mike and Amy's relationship to the point of he was under the impression she knew stuff and lost contact with her over no reason. More or less, my wife lied to break them up. To make matters worse for me, my wife follows Amy on facebook and makes fun/bashes most of her posts and comments. Even post grad life for Amy my wife makes fun of. This causes Mike to be unsure of what is true and false when it comes to Amy.

Its going to happen soon that Mike and Amy are going to work this situation out. But already several friends are trying to set him straight about her.

Mike has slowly started to distance himself away from my wife and I. It kills me to lose a friend over this. Several of his roommates hang out with me (also friends) and they fill in what is going on.

Half of my friends state that my wife wrecked Amy's life and my wife got her (Amy's) happy ending. They want my wife away from Amy complete. But I do not want to lose friends over this.

Help.

117,"My parents were married for ten years when they divorced. Throughout their marriage/relationship, it was very toxic. I was very young when they were together and I remember them yelling and hitting each other. I was four when my Dad left us (2004). He still had half custody of me and my younger siblings however he: 

Wouldn't see/ speak to us when we visited him in the state where he resides when we went to see him in 2006. Would never answer the phone when I called him (under my Mums instruction). Wasn't paying child support, wouldn't let me or my siblings get passports as a way to get back at my Mum,left my Mum to pay for the mortgage and then demand he have half the house  

Basically we had little to no contact when he left. That is until last year when he came to our house to visit (none of us kids asked for this). After that, we again had no contact which I didn't care about because he was never in my life. Throughout all of this, my Mum talked shit about my Dad and said that she doesn't need to get remarried because her kids are more important. Now, in October, my Dad came to visit again and he told me he wants to remarry my Mum. Now by then, I'd already known he wanted to remarry my Mum but I wasn't worried because I knew my Mum didn't want to. 

However since he came in October, my Mum is saying she wants him to come to our house to live with us and she told me yesterday that they are getting married. Needless to say, I am confused and quite frankly very angry. Since my ""Dad"" came to visit me in October, he's trying to force me to stay home until I'm 25, him and my Mum are trying to force me to study something that THEY want me to study and  I asked him why he didn't talk to us kids for over a DECADE and he said he ""never felt the need"" yet now he has been calling me and expecting me to call him because ""he's my father"". These are what I think are their motives for getting remarried: 

For my ""Dad"", it's for financial security, he saw how nice our house was and he lives in an apartment. By marrying my Mum and living with us, he won't have to worry about rent, he will have a house to live in and a wife. If he has a relationship with us kids, it could come in handy for him in the future if he needs help when he's older financially and for other support.  

For my Mum, it's for support. She's tired of going to my siblings school events alone and wants help with ""disciplining"" us. As if all of her years of abuse weren't enough ""discipline"".  I asked my Mum why she wants to get remarried and why she wants him of all the men in the world and she said ""What he did was in the past and he has changed and I want him to live with me.""

What's worse is that they are both just expecting us to act as if this is normal. In my eyes, my Mum is allowing a stranger to come into our home. This man left home when my brother was a baby and now expects him to want a relationship with him, respect him and ""obey"" him as a father. Am I right to be mad? I just think it's ridiculous. My ""Dad"" has multiple families with women, and has left other women as single mothers and now he wasn't to come into our home. I just wish he would leave us alone.",21Nov2019,1

I am in mid 20s and I have decided to volunteer at the animal shelter this upcoming weekend. This will be the orientation, but in their email they said we will have interactions with dogs and cats! I am very excited but as the days get closer I am getting a little nervous cause I have no experience with animals. 

I am sure some of you will ask but there are three main reasons why I want to volunteer there. One reason is cause I never had the opportunity to have pets in my life because of living situations. I would love to get one in the future and I thought this would be a good way to get a feel for how to work with animals. Second, is I want to get out there and meet new people.

122,"So about a year ago, I cheated on my ex-girlfriend of one year. I never saw myself as the cheating type at all, I really shocked myself.

I was at a house party at uni, a far way away from home, and a girl at the party invited me to her room. It's worth noting that I was intoxicated and high (weed), and wouldn't have acted this way sober - that doesn't excuse or dampen what I did however. I followed this girl to her room, and we layed in her bed and made out - it weren't a bit further, but not the whole way. 2nd base if you will. The second it was about to go beyond this, I came to my senses and more or less ran out of the room - I felt awfully guilty. I wanted to tell my girlfriend at the time immediately, but it was her Birthday the following day... I waited until the day after her Birthday, and video called her, and told her everything. I felt extremely guilty and after doing it I couldn't sleep or do anything for days.

She was understandably incredibly upset by this, and she decided not to end things, but a few weeks later I broke up with her as the relationship wasn't working out generally. I broke off contact with her, she wanted to keep talking but I was told that you can't be friends with someone you have history with.

Recently, I've started thinking about this incident again - and while I felt guilty at the time and understood what I did wrong, I had no idea at the time the impact this must have had on her. The thought of having someone you love and care deeply for being unfaithful is incomprehensible, and I can't imagine the full extent of what I put her through. I like to think I realize more than a year ago though.

**Now onto the advice:** I have wanted to reach out to her and apologize for this properly. I apologized at the time, and meant it, but like I said I didn't have the full realization of what I did. I am worried about this though for a few reasons; firstly, I am worried I'll make things worse. Perhaps she has dealt with this issue, and my contacting her would only make things worse and bring up past emotions she has/wanted to move past. Secondly, I don't want to put my current girlfriend in an uncomfortable position. Of course I would never contact my ex without discussing it with her, but her ex cheated on her, and I know she would be uncomfortable with the idea even if she did trust me...

I don't know what to do, any advice/words of wisdom would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance",21Nov2019,1

126,"I help run a support group with a married couple, who I'll call Jill and Bob. When I first started, Jill ran it but since she's been unwell her husband Bob has taken over her place and she's just at home. 

Bob has been a good friend to me, I go there feeling like crap, give him a hug and chat. He and I also go to a hospital to talk, so i see him quite a bit. He came to my birthday last year, i invited his wife too but she wasn't well enough. 

When I can't get to group, he's very understanding. When i end messages to him I say ""love to you and Jill"" and put xoxo and emojis because I appreciate him understanding. He always says ""I love you"" with xoxo's and emojis. 

Recently he came to my house for a coffee to drop off something I left from our excursion and he said he had to talk to me about something. I immediately felt sick in the pit of my stomach and he said that his wife thinks there's something going on between us. I almost burst out laughing and said gross but i realised he was deadly serious. Apparently Jill saw a message he sent me saying ""I love you""
And she went nuts. She had been checking his Facebook messages to me so he started texting instead so he can delete them. He also said he hadn't told her he was coming to see me and he ""doesn't know if I've done the right thing. I don't know"" It was sooo awkward and i just wanted him to leave but he kept talking, saying ""do you remember that i was wearing on our group excursion?"" Obviously i can't remember but he said he had to get needs clothes for it and Jill thought it was to impressed me. She also said does he say he loves James from our group who he spends a lot of time with. 

When we went to the excursion, i said bye to everyone and went to leave and he hugged me and left his hand on my waist for an uncomfortable amount of time, i backed up but couldn't move any further because my car was there and it was really awkward. 

We had a fundraiser for the group after he came over and I didn't even want to look at him, I tried to get out of hugging him but he hugged me anyway. When i left I tried again to get out of it, but he walked quickly up to me, with his hands up and made a sulking sound until i reluctantly hugged him, but i felt gross.

I honestly feel violated. 

When he came over he said that Jill said ""if you want to be with Scattyshern, then go"" 
He is 20something years older than me. I am happily married and was talking about my husband when he came over and that's when he said he needed to tell me something. I admit if he looked like Brad Pitt, I probably wouldn't feel so disgusted and violated, but alas he does not. 

He said he doesn't want our friendship to change but it really is. I feel like if this happened to a friend, I would tell them to say something but since it's me, i don't know Wh at to do. 

There's no one i can complain to, I just want him to back off and not hug me but don't know how to say it. When he was relaying the conversation with his wife (which apparently had been ongoing for a few months) he said ""there's nothing going on between us"" but he seemed to enjoy it. Now I'm wondering if he was trying to put the feelers out there, because when he was talking about it, he moved closer to me and kept creepily staring into my eyes. 

How do i nicely tell him to stop creeping me out please?

127,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize in advance for the rantyness

I always hear the whole: ""when you know, you know"" but my issue is that I always fall hard. Whenever I've had a crush it always lasts awhile, and I like them a lot, they infiltrate my thoughts, etc. I have always been a dreamer, a planner always trying to plan my future life. I have been pretty lonely too, reading a lot of books, I think this has given me unrealistic expectations. I just want to wait for my Rhys to come and sweep me off my feet, but obviously life isn't like that and I'm trying so hard to be more realistic but it's hard to not get swept up in the whimsicality of it. Even so I always seem to picture myself with my crushes for the long run, even when I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy I think I love is my current crush and I've had this question before with other guys but idk. I have always been able to find issues with them, with him there is nothing, things I may have had issues with make more sense because he does them. And just everything he does is crazy to me, he walks in a room and my breath hitches, he smiles at me and I blush, I've known him for 2 years and liked him for 1 and I still feel this way.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of backstory: I was employed as a casual childcare assistant in September. I've been enjoying this job so far and since I'm on a uni break, I'm completely available for work 24/7. However, the maximum hours I've worked per week has only been 9 (which is equivalent to 3 days of work per week). Furthermore, there are even weeks where I literally get no shift at all. And with my current financial situation, I can barely make ends meet with 9 hours per week. 

Therefore, I don't know if I should email my boss to ask if there is any chance I could be given more shifts. Or if I should start looking for another job? Or if I should just sit back and hope for the best. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you guys so much in advance.",21Nov2019,1

Okay so I want to meet up at my schools skate park and play a rock song but if she is. It into rock that’s fine.
I’m Either Metallica, korn, AC/DC, (if she likes rock) or make up a song myself to play while lights are setup and playing the song on a skate ramp. I will be covering my face with my hood and an L.E.D mask.
I will tell you what I’ll do for the performance they will be labeled phases.

Phase 1: she shows up (or not idfk) and I start to play the song with lights flashing and stuff

Phase 2: song ends I ask some questions and then the finally question will be me walking up to her with a bunch of roses and a box of chocolates. Once I give her The box of chocolates and roses with a note on the chocolates that says “wanna be my girlfriend.” Or something like that   I’ll then take of my mask reviling my face and then see if she says yes or no.

What do you think should I stick to the plan or should I do something else to try and ask her out????",21Nov2019,1

144,"I was debating whether or not I should post this for fear of being put on [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys). I met this girl online and we hit it off fairly well. In the two years I’d talked to her, we’d exchanged nudes and talked about moving in with each other once her divorce was finalized. I was really into her, and she seemed to have felt the same way. One day she calls me to tell me that there’s this concert she really wants to go to, and wanted to know if I wanted to go as well. The band wasn’t anyone I was crazy about but they were okay, and I’d finally get to meet her in person so I jumped at the opportunity. The plan was to get a hotel room for the weekend and leave the morning after the concert. I paid for the tickets and hotel while she covered travel expenses. This was all three months in advance and I couldn’t wait to finally meet her. About a month before the concert she started acting differently toward me, so I pretty much knew something was up. She talked about a guy from work that she swore she wasn’t sleeping with, but I suspected she wasn’t being truthful about that. I met up with her and on the car ride there she tells me that she has a boyfriend and that he’s going to be staying there and leaving the day of the concert. And surprise surprise, it was the guy from work she told me the night before she wasn’t sleeping with. I pretty much spent the entire time there bored out of my mind and drinking away my sorrows at the bar in the front lobby. I hate that it bothered me, but I couldn’t help but be depressed by it. I wasn’t mad that she had a boyfriend, I’d accepted that we would never be a couple when she told me, but I can’t help but feel like she only kept talking to me because I had the tickets and she really wanted to go. The concert itself was pretty dope. Discovered two new bands for my iTunes shuffle, and we did have a few laughs between the two of us. It’s been a couple of days since I got home and haven’t talked to her since she dropped me off. What should I do about the whole thing? Should I just stop trying to contact her or try to stay friends?

But my dad instantly shut!me down, literally yelling “NO ITS A LADY’S JACKET!” When he asked why I wanted to wear it, i said it looks nice. He responded by, “your mom has a dress. You want to wear a dress bc it looks nice?” Bullshit like that. He keeps saying the dress has a “figure” (yeah, i have no idea what the fuck it means either) and called me gay. (Yes he is very homophobic, although I am straight)

How do I respond to my dad? If I try to wear it to school he would probably refuse to fucking drive me. He also called me a disobedient son because “*i don’t listen.”* And kept saying “you never realize when you are wrong.” Basically it escalated to the point where our dinner was ruined.

Every single day since then, we've spoken and grown closer and a few months ago, I asked him to marry me and he said yes.
For years prior to this though, I've had severe issues with my family. I had been stuck in an onslaught of depression and self harming, and prone to panic attacks all the time. 
 I've never been close to my family but my mother has always been there for me... Well, somewhat. 
 I have some mental illnesses that make my mother believe I can't be responsible and have the needto baby me. 
Even to this day, my mother does everything for me like pay my bills, control my social security, make my doctor appointments, she's never given me the freedom to learn to be on my own. 
 I've done my best to prove otherwise. I've applied for jobs and done work around the house, I even tried to express my desire to learn by taking an adult class to learn how to pay my own bills, yet she still desires to watch over my shoulder and get involved in everything. 
 It's difficult to try to be mature when you're still treated like a child, you know?
 For years now, the only way I've been able to be around my mother is to feign an innocent and childish act from day to day life, because when I tried to talk like an adult, my ideas are pushed down again. 
 It took two years for me to tell her 'over text' that I was in a relationship, which she later called me out on in front of the family to tease me. 
 I want to move away and I've been saving up the money needed since 2017 but I can't just up and leave the day I reach my goal.
 My fiance lives far, like, very far, and knowing my mother, she doesn't even want me leaving town. 
 It terrifies me to think she'll becoming aggressive and try to cut my contact with him if I tell her plans to leave. While I may be an adult, as I stated before, she controls everything from my income to my appointments, it's like I'm completely under her control and her word is law. 
 But I really feel like I'll have a better life with him. I've studied his country, his language, the schools, the laws and healthcare system, and I know I have a better chance surviving there than I ever could here. I'm just... Not sure what I should do. 
  If I continue staying here, I'll always be wrapped around her finger and never learn to survive on my own, but he's trying to teach me already, even from so far away. I've already made up my mind but how could I possibly even start that conversation?",21Nov2019,1

Well i guess first let me talk about my wight. During high school i was a vary big guy, like almost 400 lbs and so during those years i was bullied at school and online witch lead me to bully myself. now being that big i was also tall (6 foot 3 inches) but i didn't want to stand up for myself because i was not that type of person i hate conflict, so i keep all those negative feelings inside and they made me gain more after high school, and it does not help that i had to drop out of university due to me being extremely depressed because i didn't know how to fit in and not amazing at socializing so i felt like a outcast, and i was so i withdrew and decided to find work. So i started working at a pizza joint. I struggled at first to tell you the truth but i was getting the hang of things. well a few months go buy and i was getting harassed and and find out the owner sold drugs through the joint and i did not think that was ok but i didn't say anything just was disappointed cause he was supposed to be a pillar of the community so even if i said anything no one would believe me anyway. So he found out i knew and started cutting my hours hard core until i didn't have any so i was like ok and then got a call saying that i had left the job and that i didn't like it when obviously i didn't say that or do that it was because you didn't give me hours. so that made me more depressed. so move up a few months later i got a job working at a grocery store and so i was like ok cool and so first day already getting harassed and bullied by my manager and of course he was a model employee...bullshit. So 2 weeks go by and i have had enough and quit. and then i feel into a vary dark place, a place were my own demeans would not go into. 2 years this happened these dark thoughts but i was to much of a coward to do anything.

So i was mentally fucked and weighed 420 lbs so i thought to myself what do i do. i was sick and tired of shit and for 2 years i had to work my ass off and lost a total of 232 lbs witch is amazing and i'm vary proud of that don't get me wrong. Now i look great and i don't think i'm a bad looking guy and now i'm 6 foot 5 inches and 189 lbs and am healthy. Awesome you might think, take on the world now..... 

At this moment right now i live with my parents house, no job cause i'm to afraid to do that and have the same thing happen over and over again. I don't want to go to school atm cause i feel i'm not smart enough on subjects that are required i.e math, science and English. Cant seem to find a relationship in fact I've never been in one my whole life ever and so i wish to change that and find someone that can give me a porpoise in life, someone that we can share each others faults and still love them for who they are. I've tried every dating app and way i can think of and no ones even hinted interest in me. yes i know oh get a job make money blah blah blah but i have a mental wall and feel like if i had someone to support me in the way of telling me everything will be ok and push me to do things i find uncomfortable so i can break those walls i put up because of my past. I am so fucking lonely. i feel like i have no friends. I don't know what to do i really have no clue. I know the answer is not easy for life is not easy and i'm not saying that oh i have it the worse cause i know i don't. I know there are people less fortunate them me but i just wanted to share my story and vent a little so i can sleep tonight. Why is the world so base? why is it insensitive? Why is it so selfish? Why am I?",21Nov2019,1

Well not sure why I did this but i sent an email to the lady from the prep course that taught me for 8 weeks and helped me with countless emails, i sent her an email listing all the questions I could remember after the exam. I didn't think anything of it at the time, just thought that since she helped me this would be a nice way of helping her make her prep course the best it can be. I haven't gotten a response email from her, and I am now having this looming feeling like she may report me to the governing body out of some 'professional sense of duty'. This could result in my exam being thrown out and me being barred. I just thought since she has said that the practice exams her course offers have actual questions from previous exams that she must have gotten answers from people before, and also that about half way through the class i had mentioned that my friend who wrote the exam earlier told me what was on the exam and she i sent it to her in the skype call and she asked me to email it to her instead.

He claims having anorexia is just having a high metabolism is anorexia and thats just blatantly not true. He sais that me not eating is really just me being ignorant and not doing anything when there is a solution right infront of me. Like he isnt even listening to the actual definition no matter what I tell him. Like what should I even do?,21Nov2019,1
157,"Hey guys. 

I am a 19F with controlling parents. I don't think they are too overbearing but they are quite passive agressive when it comes to me disagreeing with them. The main point of conflict is eating me alive.

So I have been going to a summer camp for the past 9 years and for the past 2 years I have worked there as a counselor. I have made some of my closest friends there and I love it. My parents hate it (my parents are pastors) because my friends aren't Christian. And I am also out of the realm of their control for a significant chunk of the summer.

ANYWAY. Since I started college, I have been more vocal about how I think they are too strict and what not. They are attributing this to my camp/""secular"" friends and it's making me go crazy. I told them that I wanted to work there next summer and my mom completely ignores me. She keeps telling me about job opportunities near home. If I defy my parents all they do is question why I care so much. They never let my opinion feel validated. I am TERRIFIED of disappointing my parents but I don't want to let them keep controlling every decision I make. Am I wrong for wanting to go? How do I let my parents realize that I can make my own decision for my summer job? How do I win them over without being too defiant? 

  
I left out a lot of details so if you want to ask questions for context I can answer.  
Thank you for any help",21Nov2019,1
159,"I’ve been at a new job for a while now and am really grateful for it. I have a great manager, coworkers, and pretty chill job. It’s a near-perfect fit. In addition, before this job (and I know this seems over dramatic) I always felt lost in life, and chased after the wrong things because I was unhappy and empty in my prior jobs. 

Yet, I can’t help but feel guilty over the fact that I didn’t do much to deserve this job- sure, I’ve been through college, but I didn’t come up with the business idea, gather the right people to employ, establish a headquarters. I simply was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn about the position. 

These feelings of guilt make me want to set up my own business in future, so that I can provide others with a sense of stability, purpose, and contentment the way this job has provided me with. Yet for various reasons, I don’t know if the CEO/owner role is the right fit for me. I’m more of a low-key person now after a few life experiences and prefer to be on the sidelines/shadows, only coming out as necessary to go to work, interact with my siblings and their friends, and to travel back to my home country and visit family and friends there. Coming to think of it, I feel guilty for having a good and supportive, non-toxic family as well. Which I know a lot of people don’t have. 

What would you do to alleviate these feelings of guilt? How can I improve people’s lives drastically the way this job has for me? Curious to read responses and have a discussion, many thanks for any insights in advance.",21Nov2019,1
160,"Hi everyone, I'm (27F) looking for advice on what to do about a bad new roommate (20F).

So I'm renting the second bedroom in my apartment to a student for the duration of the school year. I was hesitant about living with someone so young but she seemed really mature and we were really on the same page about what kind of living arrangements we wanted so I was willing to take a chance. She was in the process of being kicked out of her apartment because of disagreements with her roommates (which she said was because they were mistreating her and disrespecting her space) and she had previously been asked to leave her last apartment because apparently the couple in the other room wanted to try living alone. Both of these seemed like fair reasons and I wasn't too suspicious.

I'm a very easy going person, I wanted to be able to split groceries and eat meals with my roommate and not have to divide everything up or feel confined to our respective rooms all the time because we couldn't share common space, which she emphatically agreed with. Two rules that I was really strict about (and I made her aware of when she saw the apartment) is that I'm not comfortable with having men I don't know very well in the apartment and if she wanted to have guests over (or vice versa) to ask. The second was that she couldn't be a smoker because it is a strict non-smoking building (not necessarily my rule but it's the landlords and he made it very clear any weed smoking specifically would not be tolerated). She didn't just agree to the rules she said that they were really good and it wouldn't be a problem because she's not dating and she's not a smoker of any kind.

She moved in on the first of the month and the very first day she asked if her male friend could come over to study with her. I said it was definitely okay but then he literally never left. It's been three weeks and he is still here every single night and morning before they leave for class. He lives in residence so it's clear he's using this place as an alternative living situation. I told her I'm uncomfortable with him being over all the time and so now she deliberately sneaks him in when she thinks I will be asleep. He's a nice enough guy but he encourages her to smoke weed in the apartment (which she hasn't done but now it's clear they're both keeping weed here and it smells), he walks around on the weekends half clothed, he is constantly blasting trap music in the mornings, and they eat all the food in the refrigerator and she refuses to replace it because she thinks that I am unaware that her boyfriend has moved in. Also, the first night he came over was also their first time hanging out so she doesn't know him that well either. I'm extremely uncomfortable knowing that a man I don't know is living in my apartment behind my back, and likewise I don't like that she thinks she is tricking me into thinking he's only ever here once a week. It all feels very manipulative.

Besides that there are little things she lied to me about, like how clean she is (she's very messy), how much she would contribute to buying groceries (she will get food once a week but only for herself while I buy large trips for the two of us), how sharing and cooking meals would work (I am the only one who cooks and she will whine until I make her what she wants for dinner), the fact that she is a smoker (she smokes off the property but I still don't like that the apartment smells), and about how she would move her things into the apartment and we could share resources (she owns nothing and is constantly using my things like my desk, all my kitchen equipment and spices, and my laundry detergent). Part of me feels like her mother but I can also tend to be a bit of a doormat and I don't know if I've been clear enough with her that I'm annoyed.

Clearly she isn't who she said she was but I can't help feeling like I am over reacting and that she isn't that bad. The angry part of me wants to tell her to pack her stuff and leave but I feel bad that I would be asking her to move out after one month and that this would be the third time this year she has to suddenly move, though I am starting to think it's a pattern. I am considering asking her to leave for January 1st but that would mean she couldn't fly home for the holiday break and I would feel bad about making her miss that. Part of me wants to make it work out before I do any of this but I've never really had conflicts with a roommate like this before (talking to my old roommates about her they say that they've never seen me so heated about someone I'm living with).

She is really nice to me in person and in the rare moments that she is home and her boyfriend isn't, we get along really well and have a lot of things in common. I can't shake that if I asked her to change a few things that this would be different, but so far she hasn't respected anything that I asked of her so I don't know if she would change. 

PLEASE help me get some perspective on this",21Nov2019,1
161,"Long story short, I’ve transferred from one school. I transferred from my first school because I was sexually assaulted, and I didn’t want to be at the school anymore. When I came back home, my mom forced me to go to a school nearby and that I couldn’t go to any other school. 

The school I attend now doesn’t have a nursing program, and I’ve applied to a couple of colleges and got accepted to a few schools. 

I don’t know how to tell my parents that I got accepted into nursing school and that I’m switching schools. They’re not very supportive, so I don’t know what to say or do. The only reason why I have to tell them is that the military pays for my school.

162,"So, I'm a 19 yr female, full time college student who's studying in mechatronics, and working part time every single day. So, before I jump into work, here's a small background. I currently go to the schools campus in my home town, however, I found out that from now on I'll be have to take my official mechatronics courses at the main campus which is about 20-30 minutes away (excluding traffic). I'm finishing up the simple requirements here at my towns campus, however it's still a struggle because on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have 8 a.m. class and a class that goes till 12:20. Mondays and wednesdays my classes aren't as bad, simply 9:30-10:50 and 12:30-1:50. 

However, everyday straight after school I go to work till 5:30. I remember a few weeks into my new job my boss stated I would be working everyday from then on. I didn't see a problem with it at first, but as projects have come up, and assignments, when I get home I just want to rest, but I know I have no time and need to work on school work. I remember she gave me 2 saturdays off in a row and it was honestly heaven. Though when I brought it up she said she had made a mistake meaning to schedule me for those days, and for me not to expect anymore time off. 

The semester is coming to a close for this winter, but I'm purely exhausted. I have a project due at 11:59 p.m. friday, this thursday she's have me work from 12:30-8:00 p.m. for a wine and look around party she's hosting in her store, and then I have to be up at 12:30-1:00 to take my mother to her church so she can get ready to go to africa for a missions trip. I have to be up at 7 a.m. to be ready for my 9 a.m. which is a 3 hour long class, which right after I go straight back to work that friday. Then on Saturday she has me scheduled for 10-4. But when I was looking through the worm schedule, I saw she had already looked up the days my school had off for winter break this december and scheduled me to work every single day from 9:30-5:30.

My mother tried asking us off for December 18-21 so we could take a small vacation, but my boss refused saying she needed us there (there's 3-4 other workers besides my mother and I) since it's her most busy time of year and supposedly on those days to. The store is small as well, nothing huge, and it's family owned. I honestly feel like I'm going to crash. On thursdays I used go to a christian ministry for service and to spend time with friends, the only thing that I look forward to throughout the week, and I'm have to miss it for this wine and shop event.

Plus, with my schedule it doesn't give me time to hang out with my friends, and it greatly upsets me. I try asking for days off, but she gives me this look of irritation asking if I really need it off, and sadly I'm the person that can't say no. I can't quit since this job pays my bills, but also I know she's going to be pissed when I give her my school schedule for next semester and sees there's going to be two days a week I can't work. 

I'm just exhausted with no clue what to do.",21Nov2019,1

I'm in college but still live at home with my parents. Tonight I discovered that noise from my room (which is right above the kitchen) can be heard very clearly in my kitchen. Most concerning is the fact that you can hear um... vibrating noises, like from my phone or... other things (I'm 21F, I think you can fill in that blank). You can also hear every footstep, every time I shift in my bed, even every time glass clinks together (I may or may not have a couple of bongs that I keep in my headboard cubbies).

My room is carpeted and you usually can't hear much from the hallway right outside, so I was very shocked how much you can hear directly beneath my room. Is there anything I can do to reduce the amount of noise that goes through my floor?

(also for anyone wondering, I discovered the noise level while in my kitchen and listening to my boyfriend up in my room. I texted him and the vibration of his phone literally sounded like it was IN the kitchen. I asked him to move around and make noise and turn on the... vibrating ""things"" and I could hear everything loud and clear)

TL;DR: All noise from my room can be heard in the room below, what can I do to fix that?",21Nov2019,1

173,"So I am 18m and over the past 2 years I’ve had 3 relationships, one 2 years ago, 1 at the beginning of this year, and 1 3 months ago. All of them still quite literally “haunt” me. It’s to the point where I am sick when I think of them and cry myself to sleep every night

Every night when I go to bed I think of all my exs, what we did and where we went, and most importantly how they made me feel, and I literally cry. Each of them matter and I can’t forget or move on at this point. 

It wasn’t till after my last relationship I started feeling this way, and this was the one I felt the strongest about. She was the one I took to my senior prom and got very close too over a 6 month period, someone who I felt was going to be my first love, a cute nerdy girl, who was quit and wasn’t a fan of partying or drinking like me, but she then told me in middle of summer she was moving 3 hours away for university and that we would make it work we’d get visits in and it would be great. After that talk we never hung out again, she’d invite me over, then cancel as i was in my car leaving, she’d make excuses and always have something pop up. I asked her a lot if she didn’t want to see me anymore and she’d always say she didn’t want to break up. But then a week before she was moving away, after a week of her not answering me she sends “I don’t think this is going to work out” and doesn’t talk to me again, until last month, where she sent me a snap of her and another guy, and posts on her snap story her extremely drunk being intimate with another guy. I threw up, I couldn’t handle it. 

These snapchats are still burned into my memory, I still can see them, they make me sick. 

I was upset, I responded saying to never send me anything again, that she was an awful person and did nothing but lie to me. She said “good luck in life” blocked me on everything and never looked back. She changed from the girl I used to talk to. 

The other relationships follow the same narrative, where they move on, and distance, and I get upset and call them names and get upset. Then They block me or never answer again.

I do that because I can’t handle breakups, they hurt me so bad and I know I can’t Handle them. At this point I can’t even work up the courage to even feel interested in someone. Every single night I think of these relationships and get sick to my stomach,especially the last one. I can’t even feel interest in anyone anymore. The thought I trusting someone again is impossible for me. I haven’t talked to anyone, gone on any dates or anything, while I watch all my friends and literally every one get into relationships besides me. 

So I guess the point of this is me asking, how do I stop crying myself to sleep over these every single night, how do I stop feeling sick whenever I think of these, how can I just feel normal and get these away from me to be happy again, Because I can’t handle this anymore. Please",21Nov2019,1

180,"I own my own house and I have a roommate. I am 29 and she is 27. We both have dogs. I have 2 and she has 1. Mine are around 20lbs and hers is 7lbs so a considerable size difference. I work from 11 hours a days 5 days out of the week, sometimes more and I don’t get home until late. She works sporadic hours, sometimes long and sometimes short. I typically get home before her and I walk all three dogs and clean up any messes they may have made. I can’t let poop and pee sit around and stink up the place and I can’t let a dog hold his pee when I’m taking mine out anyway. I also take her dog out with mine on my days off if she isn’t home.

Well I’ve noticed lately that she’s been sleeping in and coming home later which I don’t care about but she doesn’t wake up in time to give her dog a proper walk and she expects me to take him out when I get home. She just takes him right outside the door for a pee when she gets up and then right back in and then leaves for work so everyday I have to clean up his poop when he goes in the house. I have a ring camera so I can see. I am getting tired of cleaning up pee and poop everyday. I can’t tell whose pee it is so I just clean it begrudgingly, but I can tell what my dogs poop looks like and it’s not tiny like her dogs and everyday it’s there. I tried leaving it and she just ignores it or doesn’t see it and goes up to her room when she gets home and I clean it in the morning. Her dog also tries to eat my dogs food unless I watch them so I can’t go about my business after feeding them if I also have to watch him. 

Her dog barks nonstop when she leaves unless I let it hang out with me. I don’t care bc I’m home and with my dogs, but she doesn’t show the same consideration for my dogs. They have to be alone downstairs and they don’t bark so it’s not a bother, but she doesn’t take them out when she brings hers outside when she knows I won’t be home for a while. If I don’t want to have her dog in my room when she leaves it barks nonstop. This also causes me to wake up if she does leave the house before I get up.  

I don’t mind taking care of her dog a little bit, I just feel taken advantage of. I don’t know how to approach her. We get along well besides this one aspect. I don’t want it to be awkward and I want to continue being roommates.

I got accepted to a school far away from home, since my home life was really bad and my parents were pretty emotionally abusive.  She was pretty much in the same boat.  We both are from really conservative religious families.  

Anyway, the *very night* before I left, she and i had been out to coffee, talking about how we'd miss each other, etc.  We got really flirty, and make jokes about making out.  She often would come to my house, and come in through the window since my family was really up tight and wouldn't let her over often.  

That night she came in and we were sitting talking, and after a long while we ended up lying next to each other on my bed.  She was stroking my hair and we were talking/flirting really softly.  I was so exhausted, I was in that weird headspace where bad ideas don't seem so bad and you make really bad ideas.  So I kissed her, and we started making out.  

I don't really remember what happened after that, just that I ended up on top of her while she ground up onto my waist, pulling my hair.  I had never been interested in sex before then, I wasn't really interested in sex, I just went along, not really feeling anything. 

Eventually, I took off her bra and fondled her breasts and sucked all over her body and her neck while she moaned a lot and put her arms around my neck.  It was so surreal and I was just out of it, not sure what I was doing or anything.  

In the end, I ended up kissing her neck while she put on her sweater and holding her breasts.  I remember saying breathlessly, ""dude, we just had sex!"" Then she left, and I cried in the shower while I threw up.  The taste of making out in my mouth made me sick.  I hated every second of it.  

The next day I left for college 2000+ miles away.  I had never really had a phone growing up, so I texted her a little on the way there and once or twice while I was just getting into college.  I called her once, and we both agreed it was a mistake, since she's straight and all, and agreed it was spur-of-the-moment and to forget about it all.  But the thing is, we haven't spoken since.  No calls, only really awkward, short texts, falling out of texts. She's gotten indoctrinated by that weird Girl Defined thing, after going to one of their conferences.  We don't talk, we don't text. 

This keeps me up at night.  I think I just ruined my deepest relationship, just lost my closest friend.  I don't know what to do, I need advice on what to do next.  I don't want to lose my friend over one stupid mistake we made.  Should I try talking to her?  I''m going home soon for Christmas break.  What do I do?",21Nov2019,1
184,"I make fun of my self but I don’t like it when other people repeat what I say. I’m trying to be more confident, but they won’t stop and I don’t know how to tell them to stop without them telling me I’m over sensitive or them laughing at me. Please no find new friends comments they are nice people but sometimes push the limit of making fun of and seems just bullying at this point.",21Nov2019,1
185,"Please see post history for full story.

I haven’t even been home a full hour. My father basically told me to tell the guy I’m dating to stay the hell away from me or else. Asked questions about where he lives. He showed me pictures he took yesterday when he went to my grad school to scope the place out. Said I better hope his family welcomes a black girl if I keep seeing him.

I told my mom and he tried to kick me out of their room. Said she couldn’t stop him from doing anything.

My mom had to stop him from breaking into my room. He said that I can move out the damn house.

I never thought my dad could turn into a monster like this.

I don’t know what to do.

In my program I have one exam per semester and he’s making it hard to focus. 

I don’t want to end things because I like him and I also don’t want him to be emotionally upset during exams since there’s a lot riding on them. 

What should I do for my emotional and physical safety and what should I tell the guy?

Does this constitute a legal threat? What should I do?",21Nov2019,1
186,"Just like the title said. I guess they didn't know I was home. I assumed it was her and her boyfriend like usual until I went out for a glass of water and heard her panicking. When I went to return to my room and saw some random guy in the hallway without any pants. I ended up staying out in the kitchen and cooked some dinner and he ended up leaving. She's in her room quiet right now. How do I even acknowledge it, do I just pretend it didn't happen, how does her and I move forward from it?",21Nov2019,1
187,"Well you see it’s been a rocky relationship for a bit now due to drinking. He’s gotten better but my mother is still pissed at him. He has anxiety so he has gone to the hospital a few times. He said that she has abandoned him because she never came. She always just said it was him overreacting. A bit harsh but she has every reason to be mad and he’s playing the victim. So we are here. 

A week to go until my birthday and welp. I found on his phone a new girlfriend. Pics and texts. They haven’t been divorced officially and I’ve held on to hope they can work it out. But with this, yea not gonna happen. So I don’t know what to do.

Obviously it will come out at some point because I’m gonna be the one to confront him. It’s just going to fuck so many things up because he had to be such a fucking selfish prick who played the victim when HE was the one that drank for YEARS. 

How should I go about it? Especially when it will mess up soo many birthdays and holidays coming up.

TL:DR Found dad with a new woman even though parents haven’t officially broken off. I’m just 15 with a birthday next week and I don’t want to fuck up things for the family.",21Nov2019,1
188,"Well, a dumb teenager writing , I would really appreciate any advice, even harsh ones , thanks. &lt;3. The thing is, I have this one  friend, I'll call him Adam. We , or so I thought , have a really good friendship, he's my first male friend, I live on a small City in Latin America and I've just recently entered college , and thanks to his extroverted self , I have gained soo much ""friends"". I think of him as my brother, but apparently , he doesn't see me that way. Some days ago, a guy , not knowing of my sexual orientation , kissed me on the elevator, I made it clear I don't swing that way, of course. After it happened, I casually mentioned it to my friends, including Adam, he started being really rude , not talking to me , ignoring me, and acting annoyed by my mere presence .This made me sad , I just couldn't comprehend what was wrong. Then, a close friend who had talked to him , told me the reason behind his anger. Seemengly  and I quote, "" I've been trying so hard to make her fall in love with me and she goes and kisses the first guy that is nice to her, I knew  I shouldn't have believed her lesbian bullshit"". I had no words. What's that supposed to mean? He knows I don't like the elevator guy , any guy to be clear. I'm unsure about what to do , I don't want to lose him as a friend, but at his point is it really worth it to keep a friend like him?  The college I attended to is more like a school, I emphasize, REALLY small. The social pressure is too much for me, those couple of days Adam ignored me, classmates stopped greeting me, talking to me, being near me. I was completely alone. I know it sounds immature , but I don't know what to do , my only friend, the one who told me about Adam ,is on other class , but keeps telling me that it's better to be alone that have those kind of friends. Any advice? Thank for reading :)",21Nov2019,1

190,"      So I am currently on unpaid leave for a broken foot.  I absolutely loath the job I currently have. I work for a gas sation. One of the memebers of my company was shot and killed in October not 10 miles away from my store. I'm terrified to keep working there. But it's the best paying job I've ever had. 
       I live with my two boyfriends (yes we are polyamorous). My partner I have been with the longest just got out of school and is struggling to find a job. The other broke his foot a few weeks before me. We have very very little income right now and we are having to beg and plead family to get food, pay my bills, etc. I don't come from money so this is taking a toll on my family.
      We live with my boyfriend's (the one I have been dating the longest) father who is controlling, rude, and doesn't treat his son right. I was the one filling the house with groceries and now that I can't  he doesn't seem to care. We go without food and he rages when we ask. We can't afford to move out until we all get jobs. It's weighing us all down and causing us to fight. It's probably taking a heavy toll on our relationship. I'm depressed as Hell and today is the worst I've felt. 
   I am tired of fighting and feeling this way. I don't really want to hurt myself or anything like that. I just want some advice on how to not fight with my partners so much, but instead to fight the anger and the saddness. I know there is a light a head but it feels so far away.",21Nov2019,1
191,"So last month my mom booked a flight for  herself, me (F17) and my brother(M8) to go to New York in a one week Holiday trip during Christmas break. My dad aren’t able to go due to busy work schedule. Dad refused to pay for the flight and my mom paid the flight for all 3 of us which adds up to $723 and that’s about $226 per person, Holiday flights are very expensive. Now the break are coming up and my Dad suddenly decided to not let my brother go because of the cold weather and not wanting him to get sick. He didn’t mention a single thing about this issue before my mom got the ticket. Now he’s wanting him to not go and omit the expensive ticket. My brother want to go to New York with us too because it’s like a nice little trip to a new place and he want to go to those fun kiddie places there. I heard my mom trying to convince him to just let him go with us, the flight is booked and she wants him to have fun too. I honestly think my dad was being very unreasonable and I told him he should pay my mom back the $226 if he’s going to not let my brother go and he refused to do so. I don’t want my mom’s money to go to waste since she worked really hard for this money and my brother want to go to NY a lot as well. What should I do at this point?",21Nov2019,1

Since a lot of my friends and people my age are communicating digitally more than ever, I honestly think I might be at a disadvantage socially.

I'm graduating college soon and honestly want to figure out what's wrong because I feel like I'll miss opportunities to connect with people in the real world if I can't hold a conversation.

I also know a part of it has to do with whether or not the person is interested with you in the first place, which might be a huge reason for all of this lol.

TL;DR: But anyway, if anyone can give me pointers for holding conversations with girls through texting and maybe in real life, I'd appreciate it! I know it's hard to offer feedback without anything to work off of, so don't hesitate to ask.

And it drives me to tears thinking bout going and watching this all go down but don’t want to let the bride and groom down. And not show up. I just don’t know what to do.

I just don’t know what to do.,21Nov2019,1
200,"I’m an Assistant Manager and Program Coordinator for a local indoor sports arena. Today my employer told me he “can’t justify” how much they pay me. This is just the tip of the iceberg. 

I was put on salary when I first started working there because they didn’t want to pay me for overtime, but I’m still required to hit 40 hours every week. If I even get 39 hours. Yelled at. But if I work 45 hours, it means nothing. It doesn’t roll over. I don’t think that’s technically illegal, but it still sucks. I also don’t get paid time off. I got married this summer and asked if I could have one week paid time off for my honeymoon, and they said no. I then made a deal that if I worked 50 hours every week for 6 weeks before the wedding, then they would pay me for the week. 

Also, guys, it’s not like I’m makin the big bucks. I probably make as much as most fast food managers. But I think they actually get benefits. 

Anyway, yesterday the owner of the arena told me he wanted to do my annual review next week, and I asked if we could reschedule my review because I was going home for Thanksgiving, which I requested off months ago, because I haven’t visited my family since April. Today, he came into my office sat down and told me he can’t justify paying me as much as he is if I’m not even going to be there to do my job. Let me remind you that if I am going to miss a couple days for Thanksgiving, that means I still have to make up the hours that I miss that week by working double on the days I am there...
And when I tried to justify taking the holiday off he yelled (he likes to yell) “you don’t GET time off.” 

I also don’t fully understand why he would say that when I’ve made the business over double my salary in profit and I’ve only worked there a year.. 

Is this an abusive work environment? Or is this adulthood? What do I do?",21Nov2019,1
201,"Let me preface this by saying i’m going to sound like a total naive idiot at times of this story. Still trying to understand this dumb behavior because I’m not that dumb, but bear with me. 

So a little over a month ago I was looking to get rid of two cars and get a new one. One i was selling for around 2k the other for 1k. I live in a shitty part of town in a pretty big city. Mostly Blacks and mexicans in my neighborhood, typical american hood. So I have these neighbors they stay pretty deep, they got alotta people at their house that be in n out. I’ve dealt with them and they always been pretty cool to me. But doesn’t mean i should trust them. Still did cuz i’m an idiot but i will get to that. So he approaches me about the 1k car. I just fixed it and was pretty confident it was a good car and he wanted to drive it around and test drive it. I said that’s fine i have some other things i gotta do anyway. I’ve never known this fool to be broke, matter of fact he had bought a car from my aunt before. anyway i give him the key. First mistake. Comes back about an hour later and he reeks of coolant. so apparently the coolant tank literally exploded in his face while he was looking under the hood and it was parked down the street. I check it out and it did indeed blow up. There were remnants of the coolant resovoir and radiator busted up and it’s something I’ve dealt with on that type of car before (if u know bmws u might have an idea of what going on). Anyway I felt like an asshole because as u will know about me if you haven’t already realized is i try to be a genuinely good person and if coolant exploded on my face id be pissed. so we made a deal , i offered to take him to the auto parts and he will buy the parts, and we’ll take that off of what he owes for the car. So we do this and we take my other car which i’m also selling. So we’re driving and he talks to me about buying this one too. I really did not beleive him but He kept going on and and on and negotiating prices until we reached a price we agreed on. I still was skeptical but the fool was persistent. So i go thru it in my head i’m thinking he and his people stay two houses down. He’s always here, i’m not going to have a problem tracking him down and i don’t think this guy is stupid enough to start a beef with his neighbors. Either way i’m an idiot who feels bad and is trying to give this fool the benefit of the doubt, but also it’s me being lazy, trying  make a quik sale and sell these cars easily. So i ask when he’s going to have the money he says that night. I ask if he has anything at all he can give me and pulled out a few bucks thts was not worth my time, claiming that he had to go abt 45 mins to get it. If you’ve made it this far at this point ur probably thinking u just deserve what ever the hella  happens to u, u idiot but i don’t agree, and remember i asked u to bear with me? we aren’t done. So basically I call the next morning , i get some bullshit about i’ll see him tomorrow. This pattern goes on for two weeks. seeing him occasionally in this time in front of the house which is his moms. whenever i would see him would always approach him and see wtf was up with my cash. More bullshit. eventually started ducking my calls by not answering/declining, just being childish. Told Him i need the cash or i would report it stolen cuz that’s basically what it is. Although i never reported it stolen cuz i just know how pointless that would be. Also I don’t have any confidence in the police to solve my problems nor would i want them to i’m a man not a snitch. i don’t like Snitching and that can be more dangerous than anything sometimes too where i live. so forget that. 

So I’ve been keeping an eye out but he hasn’t been around much, probably at his baby mamas house an hour away. Did see him standing outside about a week and a half ago once pulling up to my house, so i got out and went over there but the fool had already disappeared into his house. some of his ppl said they were there started acting dumb like they didn’t know where he was. So at this point i’m not sure what i want to do. Talking to him won’t do shit, so i’m going to have to motivate him some other way. But at this point also i highly doubt i’ll get my money, but i’m not someone who’s cool with just getting punked like that. I would kick this guys ass but he’s not usually alone and these fools stay strapped so it’s not quite as simple as just kicking this fools ass otherwise i would. They have kids that be around over there and i’ve even considered ransom all though i’ve ruled that out because i know myself and i really couldn’t do that to a kid even for a million dollars. That’s just the logical part of brain reaching for a solution. Many would say why not just accept the loss and move on. The problem with that is I can’t get over this, i feel like it has to be resolved somehow before i can think straight. I’ve been on edge the last month, I can’t show my face around here knowing i got punked. I can barely look at myself in the mirror knowing how this went down. I live with one family member who’s an older woman and right now I don’t have any backup at my house, so that’s been stalling any retaliation I want to carry out. I also don’t want to put anyone like a family member who comes around here or lives here in danger. I’ve considered moving to my moms out of state, but that makes me feel like i’m running from my problem. Another solution i’ve consider is just knocking this fool off, which i’m not a big fan of but at this point i don’t really know what else i can do. If i just do nothing I will stay more depressed and anxious than i already am and a recluse. If i retaliate with violence i could be putting some family in danger considering how outnumbered this household is. Even if I do it and then leave, anybody who’s here could be in trouble. So i’m stuck. This is something that bothers me everyday and I’m playing a long game trying to plot. If you made it this far i truly appreciate you reading and Any suggestions on a resolution would much appreciated. Non violent solutions would be great but I feel like that’s not an option. I was thinking about an attack using information, like hacking related. I’m getting creative i know but i’m not an expert on this stuff. AND PLEASE I KNOW IM AN IDIOT, TRUST ME. u don’t need to remind me.

203,"I am 15 years old and I suffer from clinical depression and anxiety. My parents do not believe in mental disorders and think that when I was diagnosed by my doctor that I was going through a phase. They have refused me therapy or antidepressants because they believe both are a scam to take your money. But I've been struggling. 
A short background of my relevant history, I moved from a dangerous and ghetto city in 6th grade. I experienced a lot of bullying. 7th grade I had two best friends: one that had severe anxiety and one who I was really close with. Then 8th grade hell came around. 
My close friend eventually got a boyfriend, and she became very toxic towards me. I developed anorexia and even went through bouts of bulimia. My friend ended up physically slapping me during my town's tree lighting ceremony and her boyfriend pushed me down a hill when I tried to run away. For a while I didn't speak to them. I self harmed around this time. I never talked to the girl again, but I ended up being friends with her boyfriend. 
Around this time I found out my aunt who hadn't spoken to my family in years was dying. I was a wreck worrying about her because the problem wasn't between me and her, and I was terrified she'd die. But she eventually pulled through. 
The beginning of freshman year I was mentally and emotionally abused by a guy who had been stalking and grooming me, and he became violent at homecoming, causing him to be escorted out. I have a school version of a restraining order against him. I have a post about that under my username called Stalked at a School Dance on r/letsnotmeet if you want more information, but it'a not necessary for this.
I ended up being really good friends with my anxious friend and her crush. She really likes him and is territorial around other girls and me, but refuses to try to date him. However, I think her crush is a pretty cool guy and I want to be friends and nothing more. She's been lashing out at me because of this, however she says that she hates it when I talk about my crush and that she doesn't think she'd hang around me anymore if I ""ditched her for him."" 
My aunt has gotten better, but I discovered why my mom resents her so much, and I frankly hated her for a while, so trying to mend our relationship has been a rough road, and we still have a long way to go. 
Since my sexual harassment, I've also noticed how bad sexual harassment and assault in my school is, and it really hits close to home. I feel powerless to do anything about it though.
I mentioned how I've become friends with my ex best friend's ex boyfriend, and honestly our relationship is nothing but toxic. He got a girlfriend who flirts and tries to touch me constantly, but they broke up and he's been a hot mess since. One of his other friends approached me and warned me about him when he and his ex broke up, saying that before they started dating he had a huge crush on me and he is obsessed with me, showing me creepy text messages between them.
The past two weeks I've been losing all progress I've made with my depression. I relapsed with my anorexia, and even had thoughts of self harm again. I've had no interest in things I used to enjoy for a while now, but I can't even get out of bed anymore. My friends have noticed my quiet exhaustion, and they're whispering about me. I want to disappear. I've tried to get help on my own before by reaching out to my doctor and school counselor, but neither one can do anything to help me without a parent signature and/or money, and my parents won't give up either. I'm spiraling out of control, and I can't cope anymore, much less stay in a class without crying. I need advice, and I need help. What should I do?",21Nov2019,1
204,"I tried posting this on a different sub and it didn't seem to show up, so hopefully this works!

&amp;#x200B;

I work freelance in a relatively volatile industry where your next job is often based on ""who you know."" My last gig prior to my current was from April to September and I ended up really excelling there. My boss for that job -- who runs one of the bigger outfits in town for my line of business -- really liked my work and seemed invested in my success. He actually wanted me to stay on for a few extra weeks beyond my contract, but I ended up taking a different position elsewhere because the terms were better. (This negotiation got kind of awkward so for a while I was worried I was burning a bridge -- but ultimately I think he respects my work and my decision to leave. At least he made it seem before I left that the door was open to return.)

Now, my ex-boss's company has somewhat cyclical work that can be expected to start up again in February, and it would be perfect for me to finish out my current project in January and then jump back over there. Some of his last words to me were that I should keep in touch and let him know what I'm up to. We haven't talked in 2 1/2 months, and I feel like now's the time to reach back out and see whether there might be an opening for me to come back. But...what do I say and how?

Here's the thing... 1. We mostly communicated through text and phone calls when we worked together. Neither of us knows each other's personal email and he has 3 active work emails, so I think a text is best, but it feels weirdly informal to ""check in"" with a former boss via text. 2. I kind of have a crush on him, which I guess is irrelevant except for the fact that I'm seriously overthinking this, don't want to say anything weird, and I believe the anxiety associated with it is the only thing keeping me from reaching out.

Any pointers on how to open up communication in a way that's short and professional? Do I want to be cool or warm in my greetings? How direct should I be about wanting a job if it's available? (I'm sure other job opportunities will present themselves between now and February, but sincerely would prefer to work for him again if presented with options.) Very much appreciate any advice on this!",21Nov2019,1
205,"So over a year ago i reconnected with my old middle school friend, we’re both 19 now and have hung out before. 

He has a cousin a year younger than us that he tried to set me up with and its gone downhill since then. I hung out with the cousin and my friend together a few times and the cousin thought they were “dates” which they weren’t and i told him this multiple times. He’d try to forcefully buy things at stores for me and was always right on top of me when we hung out despite knowing how uncomfortable i was. 

If he thought id show up at a place to see my friends he’d show up too and get upset when i didn’t invite him places. 

Ive since cut contact with the cousin and blocked him on all forms of social media and even on my game consoles. He’s made alternate or old accounts to try and talk to me or about me. He’s even tried to talk about me with my brother and is currently calling me his girlfriend and baiting my brother into going back and forth with him. This isn’t the first time this has happened and probably wont be the last.

206,"I think I have had depression for awhile now. 

I’m a (17m) and I believe I might be depressed, but don’t know how to handle it, but I don’t want this to get worse overtime and just weigh me down more and more each day. 

It used to be a joke to me. Like most, I didn’t believe I had anything wrong with me, but earlier this week in my senior English class, a girl did a presentation on mental illness and a lot of it had to do with depression. She listed off some symptoms and behaviors of someone who’s depressed and it almost seemed like a complete match of how I am, except I’m not suicidal and still love living my life. 

Everyday is stressful including days I’m literally doing nothing and am just relaxing. I keep comparing myself to my piers and legitimately believe i’m not smart enough to be where I am in life, which is in a career campus trying to focus on getting hired in the art industry. I can’t retain most things taught to me, because all I want to do is get home and unwind, but it ends up backfiring on me and plunges me into a pit of work I’m not finishing and takes time away from studying and actually retaining important stuff. I’m constantly pacing the halls of my house all the time listening to music and playing video games for a temporary escape.

There are moments where I am legitimately happy and post dumb stuff all the time in attempts to be funny, but the majority of the time, I feel really awful, like there’s this pit in my stomach that won’t go away. My grades have slipped dramatically this senior year, though I mostly contribute that to “senioritis”.

I haven’t told anyone, besides close friends, who believe me, but don’t know exactly how to help. I don’t know if I should go to my guidance consular, or if I need someone more professional? I’m just all around confused and fell tired and anxious everyday and don’t know how to handle it. I’m implying for work now too, and I’m afraid this will somehow interfere with me more.",21Nov2019,1

Hi everyone,

I don't usually use Reddit, but I came here looking for some advice from some random strangers. You never know who might have a bit of wisdom to share. Perhaps some of you may have been in a similar situation in the past, so you might be able to help me.

The Question: 

I'm trying to figure out what I should do with my life. Should I switch majors? Should I just finish my current degree? Should I chase after my passions or try and find a more practical career?

Some context:

So, as the title states, I am a Computer Science Major. This would be my fourth year in school, but only my third year as a CS Major. I already switched majors once. I originally went to school for one year with the plan of getting a degree in Human Services. Of course, through some life experience and maturing, I realized that degree was not the right choice for me. I then decided I would try a STEM field and I am now going to school as a CS Major. At first, I thought programming seemed interesting enough, so I went on with it. I completed all of the assignments and I have gotten almost straight A’s in all of my classes, but as time has gone on, I've begun to loath programming. 

Today:

I'm currently in classes working on Assembly, JavaScript, and Database Interactions. I've been doing research on what it's really like to be a programmer and I just can't imagine spending my life that way. I don't want a job that absorbs my whole life and If I do get a regular career job, I want it to be a 9-5. I work so that I can enjoy life outside of work. 

The truth is, I'm just not passionate enough about programming to really make it a career. I don't code for fun outside of work and I loathe my programming class assignments. They take me four times as long to complete compared to other class assignments and they have frustrated me to the point of tears in the past, yet I persist.

My passion:

In my free time, if I have free time, now that school has gotten much more time consuming, I play guitar. It's very cliché. If I have the time, I'll spend hours playing. Some days, if I can, I'll spend three hours practicing. One hour is used for building speed, endurance and accuracy, one hour is used for practicing some old material and practicing improvisation. And then I'll spend another hour learning some new material, weather that is a new song, theory, or some technique. If I have more time, then I'll spend it on song writing and maybe even spend more time working on new material. On a good day I'll log 5 hours. If it's a day where I also practice with a group, say at church, or a band that I'm in for fun, I will end up logging even more time into practice. Of course, now of days I'm lucky if I get an hour in and it's eating me up inside. I hate the days where I can’t play my instrument. I love the guitar. I'm not even that good. I'm average at best, but I love it and I wish I could play it for a living. I wouldn't care what kind of guitarist I was; I simply love guitar.

My thoughts, my parent’s thoughts and reality:

When I think about all of this, I realize becoming a professional musician is not realistic career goal. The chance of success is very low, especially when you have no innate talent. I have a very strong drive and work ethic, but I am not naturally gifted. In this same way, I have been able to succeed in college. Thus far, I have succeeded through hard work and effort, nothing more.

I have been considering leaving my degree as a programmer and doing something else, but I've already put so much time in that I'm afraid to waste it all, but I know I won't be happy as a programmer. I have considered finishing the degree and then using the money earned from the job to fund my passion, but I don't know if I will have that kind of energy with a job that drains me like programming does.

When I first got into college, I originally wanted to get a two year degree from my local community college and just get a decent job that would pay me like twenty bucks an hour, so that I could work on music in my free time, but my parents wouldn't allow it. I was pressured into doing something other then what I wanted to do and here I am today, living with the result of that pressure. 

Other Options and Final thoughts:

I have considered other degrees that would give me a creative outlet, like an English major, but I don't know if that is something I would like. I have even considered going to school as a sound engineer and going back to school for music instead, but this all cost money and eats up time. I'm only 21 so I know I have time to make these decisions, but I have drive and I want to get my life going. I have no girlfriend, no friends or anyone who would really care if I disappeared. I just have some family and my own thoughts and passions. I have paid for all of my schooling of my own accord, but my sister has supported me by letting me rent a room from her. I don't want to disappoint her and my parents who have also been as supportive as they can. Of course, my parents are not rich and have not been able to offer me monetary support, but rather emotional support.

At this point I'm not sure what to do. What would you do if you were in my shoes? You're 21 years old and unsure, and afraid to make big decisions about where to go with your life. What do you think? Do I finish my programming degree and ride it out? I’ll be miserable for another year and ¾ or possibly longer depending on how many classes I take. Do I find another more practical major that will allow me to survive and make money while being less miserable or do, I just go for and find some way to follow my passion? Do I go back to my community college and get a 2-year degree with a job that will give me enough pay just to survive?

Never going to be attractive. most of my hobbies are really boring to most people so I doubt that anyone is going to be attracted by stuff like that. I like to feel like I am a pretty upbeat and funny person when I’m out with people, I really save the somber stuff for this reddit account. 

 I really am at a loss for what I need to do to be appealing, it just feels like I am stuck. I haven’t gotten a match on tinder or bumble in like a month, it makes it feel like my weight loss and all my efforts for self improvement are in vain.

209,"My fiancé’s sisters bachelorette is Saturday. My best friend was invited too because she’s become friends with his family. When we got the text she texted me about how surprised she was that there was no dinner planned because typically where I’m from people do dinner and a night out. She then mentioned getting dinner because we’ll be drinking all night. We never set anything in stone and it was brought up only once. 

It turned out that there was a bridesmaid+ my MIL only nail salon trip and dinner I was invited to before we meet to go to the club. 

My group of friends were also planning a friendsgiving event on Sunday and I said yes to it. But because my fiancé’s is flying home his mom decided to have a birthday celebration for his sister. I felt like that was an important thing to be present at. My best friend was very upset basically telling me because we skipped the last one we had to go and that she wants it to be my decision(alluding to the fact that my fiancé’s said we couldn’t go due to his sisters birthday celebration)

Since I’m skipping friendsgiving I need to go to the dinner with her so I’m not totally blowing her off. How do I cancel on the nails/dinner group? I’ve got a bridal appointment for my sister so I’m missing the nail portion. Now that I’m skipping dinner I’ll miss basically all that.",21Nov2019,1

Recently for whatever reason, he’s actually been doing super well in school. He’s been showing up to class and trying to catch up on what he’s missed which is amazing. I have no idea what happened to encourage him to go but he started going.

Unfortunately, he’s missed the last two days of school and his dad has started to ask me to help him get back on track and get him to go to school but I have no idea how to encourage him to go to school. 

He’s not a terrible student, he has potential when he wants to work and I’ve seen it first hand recently but he just doesn’t feel motivated to work I guess?

I hope that all made sense to you but I just need some sort of help, his dad told me that if he doesn’t start going to school and trying, he will be kicked out so any help would be appreciated!!",21Nov2019,1

217,"I hope I am doing this right. 

Last year due to embarrassing circumstances, I lost my car. I'm a single mother without a lot of support from my family or my ex, so I knew it would take a while to save up for something decent. 

My credit is not the best so doing monthly payments for a car wasn't doable. During those months I struggled with taking the bus and sometimes uber to get to and from the babysitter and to work on time. It sucked but I managed. 

I never noticed that my neighbors were watching what I went through. They are a nice couple that lives in my apartment complex and have always been friendly with my son and I. One day they came up to me and told me that they have an extra car that they don't need and they decided they are giving it to me. The husband fixes cars as a hobby and they already had 4 other cars so parking was becoming a problem for them. My initial reactions were shock, skepticism, and finally, immense gratitude. I kept it together in front of them, but afterwards, I was bawling. I thanked them so much and after paying for insurance, registration, and to fix a small electrical problem, the car was finally mine.

Guys, I'm not deserving of this gift at all. I am not the most virtuous person. I'm not one of those people that are just ""good"". I'm irresponsible. I actually lost my previous car due to my being irresponsible. I feel so undeserving yet somehow these two generous souls decided that I should get this car. Other than the many thanks I have given them each time I see them, I still feel like I should have done more. I offered a few times to at least give them a small payment for the car but they declined each time. 

So I'm reaching out to Reddit to get some suggestions on what I may be able to do for them. I would like to show them I really REALLY appreciate what they have done for my son and I. Thank you for any advice or suggestions.",21Nov2019,1

223,"So basically there is this girl(let’s call her S)(16) (yeah ok, dumb high school shit, whatever lol) that I (17) go to school with. It’s a very small school so there are not many girls so naturally a lot of guys have crushes on the same girl. So this started at the beginning of the year when I had a pretty big crush on this girl(let’s call her R) but never said anything or acted on it, which I ended up being happy about since I realized I dodged something lol, but anyways my best friend started dating her. 

Moving forward a little, while he’s still dating R, he talks about how he really actually is into S. This was pretty weird since I was a little upset he started dating the girl I was into at the time, but now he’s talking about the girl I’m into. I have some other friends who I’m not as close too, but one(B) tried to be something with S but got rejected and the other friend has asked her out multiple times and I do t think it will go anywhere. 

I’m pretty chill with both of these friends so I don’t want to hurt them, but They’re also not “valuable” friends I have in my life if you know what I mean. The thing in most worried about is my best friend getting salty about it because I think I have a actually chance with S. We are getting closer and there has been a little flirting and told my best friend that she had something going good with a guy. 

My questions are, would I be an absolute asshole to go after her regardless of the school being really small, 

Is she off limits because my boy told me about his interest before me, despite dating someone else

And if you guys do think it’s cool to go after her, how do I go about telling my friends?

Her father is an old religious type (the whole family is but my gf doesn't think the exact same things) and he thinks he knows what's best for her. She works hard to accomplish everything that is asked of her and it's never enough. They constantly badger her over her virginity and how she better not be doing all these supposed bad things blah blah blah.

Frankly, I'm not the religious type, but I dont mind that she is. I just don't think it's his business trying to enforce further upon his legal adult daughter what she ought to do.

I’d cry during my first day the many times I got put in school and she’d take me out because she felt terrible hearing me cry, but that’s what kids do obviously they cry and get over it, and as did I when she left me in long enough I loved it while I was there but then it the next problem was moving. We moved from house to house and took me out of school and kept me homeschooled instead between moving and feeling bad for my tears I guess. The plan was to obviously homeschool me and keep me on track which I was for awhile but it just slowly faded out and I was going on with life slacking off and doing absolutely nothing with my education and it all stems from my mothers selfishness and as it stands now it’s my biggest regret, because it’s not all her fault I could’ve stepped up and figured it out myself but I developed this horrible laziness cause I was brought up thinking I didn’t have to be schooled or study and I just completely thought it was just normal somehow.

I'm not a stickler about drugs but I've seen a lot of my friends become dependant on it and using it constantly.

We have continue issues with our assigned parking spots, the up stairs neighbor beats his wife every other day. Its 5 adults and a child. They once asked me, what age is ok for marriage for my culture, I have 3 daughters. They are from Syria migrated here 7 years ago. One of these men, older guy. 50's touched my daughters face and told her she is beautiful. My older kids who saw told me this. 

Landlord has been aggressive and reckless in his speech. Once telling my wife he is only giving her enough rope to hang her self. She has had a brother and brother in law die like that.

He harasses my wife by phone, to put her down for not paying the rent and telling her people were right about us. So we told him we are paying no more rent unroll everything gets fixed. He served us with a 3 day notice and a unlawful detainer sue.

Ive responded to his sue, but want to build a strong case to show why I withheld rent, and why I want my deposit back, 6 months of rent and 10,000 dllrs for emotional damage.

Please, help me with resources, ideas, other known cases, pro bono lawyers. Anything. The craiglist add for the unit we got, showed false pictures and made false statements. Like a high end stove, fridge and dishwasher. None of it true, we have video of our first walk through, pictures of all cosmetic issues, the poor landscape, and infestation of lizards.

What can I do, how can I make this concrete, where can I read of other cases. Who can help me organize my case, and present it? 

We are a hard working family, 5 of 6 kids in school, doing very well. My partner and I work fulltime. Well, I just got layed off. I'm a welder. We receive no assistance. AND, when we looked back at the craigslist add, rent was 1995 listed until 3/22/18, we signed lease 3/14/18. And pay 2120.",21Nov2019,1

242,"Background, I am a 17yo male. I had struggled with my mental health since my early teens and had a few suicidal episodes. I never told anyone, until a few years ago, not because I was ashamed but because I thought it was normal and just something I would grow out of. Around this time, I started using cannabis recreationally. My grades suffered, I skipped class, and my relationship with my parents deteriorated after being “caught” a few times. My parents believe that using “pot” (as they call it) turns people into lazy couch potatoes that will never keep a job, or significant other. (Also very religious, not sure if that’s applicable or not)

Since that period of time, my life has taken a turn for the better. I am making A’s and B’s, and attending class every day, giving school my best effort and have kept 2 different jobs over the past 2 years now. My parents and I have a better relationship now, although they are still afraid I will fall back into bad habits. 

Because of this, I don’t think my cannabis usage is as much of a problem as my parents say it is. It doesn’t interfere (if I can at all help it) with my day to day life, and it helps me relieve stress which is extremely helpful to an AP class level student. My question, then, is the following: Are my parents right about cannabis? Is it really causing me great and lasting harm? 

I go to great lengths to ensure the products I source are as safe as possible, and I do not use unregulated THC oil in any way. I would like to conclude by saying that I love and respect my parents no matter their stance on my cannabis use, but I’m also not prepared to stop using just because of what I believe to be an outdated view of a rather mild drug AND my decision.

He proceeds to tell me that A was talking about me earlier that day and was talking about me hugging one of my guy friends at a party but making it seem like I didn’t know it was my friend. A’s ex ( a person who I consider a very close friends with) proceeds to input, “I told you she was a whore.” That hurt me beyond belief. I started to cry almost uncontrollably because this was the first time anyone called me something like that let alone a person who I consider a good friend with. I was comforted by some teachers who said it’s okay that I was sad about this and calmed down. My parents just told me to get a thicker skin. They made me feel as if I was wrong to be sad about this and told me it’s hormones (like every other time I had been sad or stressed out). Because of this idek what to do or think. Do I have any right to be sad at this? Should I confront my so called friend? And how does one grow a thicker skin?",21Nov2019,1
244,"So I’m a 16 year old girl. I work at a grocery store cutting fruit and vegetables for displays. Most the time I work with older women but a lot of the time I close alone or work alone in the evenings. Ever since I started working there this one guy (whose probably in his 30s) has been really friendly to me. Whenever I’m working he’ll always come to my department and say hi to me and talk. For some reason he’s always at work like a half hour early so he just walks around and I assume he talks to other people in different departments cause he’s a friendly guy. The other night I was working alone and he walks into the store over to my department, and preceded to ask me out to go see a movie or get a cup of coffee. I was obviously stunned, as he’s twice my age and I had absolutely no clue he ever thought of me like that. So I just said “I’m in high school” and went to the walk in freezer until he left. I have no idea if he thought I was actually way older, but that doesn’t make sense because I’m 5 ft and look like I’m 12. This whole situation made me super uncomfortable but I don’t want to tell my parents cause I’m afraid they’ll make it a big deal. I’ve avoided him ever since but the other day I was leaving work and he asked if he could speak to me privately, and I said I really had to go. I told one of my coworkers who was alarmed at the news but agreed not to tell my manager. Also, a couple months ago I was clocking out and we were talking, and he commented on the type of car I drove, then immediately 2 minutes after I walked out and got to my car I discovered someone had broken in but never stole anything. Everything in my console was emptied out onto the seat and there was a work file with all my information on it spread out. After that I now park on the other side of the parking lot where there’s cameras. I don’t know if that’s just a coincidence but I’m pretty shaken up by the whole ordeal. Maybe I’m making it bigger than it is and he was just mistaken, but my instincts tell me otherwise. I don’t know what to do.",21Nov2019,1

248,"(A little long)

A few weeks ago, I told one of my closest friends, Jake, that he was acting weird/rude towards me. I didn’t mean it as a bad thing. I just wanted to know what was going on, if he was okay, etc. He strongly claimed everything was fine, and that he was just busy. I talked to a few other people, one of which, Thomas, told me that Jake had been acting really weird/rude to them too, to the point that they didn’t want to be friends with Jake anymore. 
I felt really hurt. One of my closest friends was now barely talking to me and acting like a total stranger, and I didn’t know what to do. At the urging of my therapist, as well as Thomas and a few other friends, I told him how I felt.
Well it exploded.
Jake talked to Thomas, who told him that I had “completely misunderstood what he’d said”. When I talked to Thomas about lying to me, because I had our messages saved, he told me that he just wasn’t comfortable telling Jake yet.
So Jake told me that he essentially didn’t want me around anymore.
That’s when everything kinda came apart. I severely missed having Jake around, and it really hurt to have him gone where people had said it would be better. I felt horrible, and wanted to try to fix the situation. 
I tried to fix it. I apologized, I told Jake that I was wrong, I asked him what I could do to fix it. And all he said was “I don’t have a solution to your problem.”
I don’t know what else to do.

252,"Late April, I decided to quit my career because k was working like a dog for minimum pay without benefits. It was kind of like an internship of sorts. They said they'd give me a raise but we're cutting my hours, so basically I'd be making less with about the Dr amount of work. So I quit, and began to work at my old college job. During the summer, they offered my job back at higher stakes (more work, a little more responsibility) for $14.50 an hour with benefits. I then mentioned this to my boss who I currently work for, which is a franchised food joint, and he counter offered to meet pay with paid days off, but no health benefits, so I stayed. After I rejected the first time to go back to my other job, they said they'd match what I was getting paid at current job, but I declined on principle.
 Earlier this week, I was offered the same job again because the employee they hired had given their two weeks. I've been kind of hoping this would happen, just because I had worked so hard for this career in school and it had been my dream to be a journalist since I was in fifth grade. I've had trouble in the last few months making amends with my decision, especially having a four year degree, and nothing to show for it. I especially hate people treating me like scum, as if I'm incompetent because I work at a high end fast.fppd joint. And it happens often.
I have my reservations going back considering how they had attempted to swindle me before.

265,"Hey guys, I will try to keep this as concise as physically possible. Please bear with me as this is a tad complicated and rather painfully long, but I'd really, really appreciate some unbiased opinions here. Thanks! 

I'm a young female Freshman in college (first semester) who has never dated anyone ever before. A few months ago at my workplace I started having friendly conversations with a guy who is exactly 2 years older than me -- he's nice, intelligent, suffers from some anxiety for which he is seeing a therapist, and is almost done getting his degree in Psychology. 

The weird part about the whole situation is that this guy and I have the same 2 best friends. These friends are dating each other, but oddly enough he and I only hang out with them separately and never at the same time, due to the fact that they became friends with him many months before I did so we just never hung out simultaneously before. So, these 2 friends of ours are naturally very involved in both of our lives, but on a separate basis, if that makes any sense. This will come in to play later on in this story. 

So ultimately this dude and I hung out 3 times, and during those times discussed religion and learned that we do differ significantly, as I am a practicing Christian and he is an agnostic who is still uncertain about his views on faith and god. This is obviously a pretty big deal, so I had some trepidations about the long-term potential of any relationship we might get in to. On our third hang out, I finally got up the guts to ask him where he wanted our relationship to go/whether or not our get-togethers counted as dates or not. He said he wasn't certain exactly but he did like talking to me a lot, and I told him I honestly wasn't certain what I wanted out of this either and I really wanted to have a solid foundation of friendship before anything serious happened between us, and he said that sounded like a good idea. 

Fast forward a bit and we've hung out 2 more times one-on-one, and also held hands at one point. It was at this point I realized I really needed to mention my concerns about our religious differences since it really looked like we were still kind of semi-dating. So we decided to get together again, and during this hang out he actually brings up the fact that he wants to know if we're on the same page, and I said that was a good idea, and I said that if we continued to hang out one-on-one but not call it anything serious we'd essentially be dating but refusing to call it what it is, and he agreed, and then I brought up the fact that since he really wasn't certain what he believes, and I'm very staunch in my beliefs, it would probably only be a bad idea to commit to a relationship unless/until we both are on the same religious page, but we also agreed that he really shouldn't try converting to my faith just for me since that's dishonest, and I said I didn't want to date him to change him because that's not fair to him, so we both agreed to be friends. 

Since that conversation we've seen each other at work and still had our normal playful banter, I gave him a ride home after work because his car had been totaled earlier that day and our other coworkers were unable to give him a ride, we've run into each other on campus randomly and walked together on campus/talked about random stuff (it was his idea for us to walk together), he invited me to a gathering of coworkers at his house after work and I agreed to go, and at said gathering we talked about life and stuff in his living room til I told him I had to go home, and we've hung out on campus again a few times after bumping in to each other. He did compliment me multiple times during our conversations during this time too (he called me pretty, said he enjoyed spending time with me, ect.) and he would give me really long hugs, so it was a weird time because I figured we both knew exactly where we were at with our relationship but it just sorta sucked because we obviously like each other but couldn't be together at the moment, so I just sort of decided to let it be.

He finally ended up talking to me over this weekend (it's been like 3 weeks since we had our decision to be just friends) and while hugging me told me that he really liked me, and that he didn't want to pressure me but he personally thought that we could probably still date each other despite our religious differences, and I told him that as much as I want to date him I legitimately didn't think it would be a good idea for us to date unless we agreed religiously, because dating while disagreeing on that would inevitably cause us way too much pain and ultimately break the relationship/end our friendship completely. He said that he saw my point and then said it was weird because even when we tried not deliberately hanging out one-on-one it still felt like we were dating, and I said it did feel that way. We parted on relatively nice terms that night. 

The next day one of our mutual best friends pulled me aside and told me that I really needed to stop 'Leading him on' because I was giving him false hope for a relationship, and now I'm just not certain how to feel about the whole thing...thinking back on it, yes, we did end up interacting with each other on about the same playful level even after stopping going on actual dates, but each time we hung out he either asked me first or initiated in one way or another, and I tried not to actively be seeking hang out time or flirting with him unless he would flirt with me first...but I'm so biased in this situation I honestly don't know what to think/know if this whole thing was my fault or not...

I'm sorry for how painfully long this one. If anyone survived it, I'd love to hear thoughts and whatnot. Thanks again. :)",21Nov2019,1

I am on birth control and he always wears a condom and pulls out then shoots his load in my mouth or on my stomach. I do not have a regular period so I don't know if I missed any or not. I did have light bleeding for a couple days in September and haven't since. The last time I had a normal period was in early June or July.  Like probably a month ago I started feeling really sick like I had the flu or something. I did take a couple pregnancy tests and two of them came back positive and two came back negative. I took one a couple days ago and it said negative and I threw it in the trash in the bathroom. He came over on Tuesday and I forgot about the test. He went to the bathroom and when he came out he started acting a little weird. I went in there and saw the test in the garbage and I am pretty sure he saw it. I do not know if I'm actually pregnant or not and I really need to go to the doctor. How would you react?  Should I tell him I might be pregnant? If I am, he would be the dad.

Last weekend, I might have even felt like I loved him. Here's my thing though. It's SO soon. My friends think he feels the same way. For example, the other night, he's just laying on my lap. I showed him a picture of a French bulldog puppy and said how cute it was. A couple seconds go by, and he's like ""wait a few years and you can have as many as you'd like."" Or, the other night we went for a drive, and I was  venting about my health and he's like ""I'm with you. I'll support you through it, even if this goes in for the rest of your life."" And he says things like ""if we get married"" and stuff. Am I just over thinking this? Is it unreasonable to think he feels the same way?",21Nov2019,1

275,"For context, I share a bedroom with a lovely human. The two that share the OTHER bedroom in our apartment are another story. You’ve heard it all before — they never clean, when you try to talk to them, they get defensive but never take action, etc. As a (mostly) mature adult, I’ve talked to them, made chore lists, and after it all failed, I, for the past 2 months, just shut up and cleaned after them. Putting away their dishes, cloroxing spills (literally WHAT ANIMAL doesn’t wipe up the kimchi they dropped all over the floor — not even the juice but the ENTIRE cabbage piece), sweeping and mopping...again, you know the drill. 

But tonight, I reached my last straw. I texted our group chat and asked these two monsters if they could buy Swiffer wipes so that I could sweep. One of them comes out, and goes on with a whole monologue about how it’s not fair for me to ask her to buy them because “everyone’s contributed something.” My reply is that since I do all the cleaning, someone else should pay — to which she responds that she DOES clean after herself which is blatantly false.  I provided examples of where I cleaned for the collective good and she argues that her work just goes unseen. She truly believes she is clean.  Then, she goes a step further to say that the floors were perfectly clean as they were, and we didn’t need to buy Swiffer wipes AT ALL. The only times, she claims, it’s necessary is after hosting a party. BRO WHAT! THERE IS KIMCHI ON THE FLOOR AND A BUNCH OF HAIR! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS IS CLEAN? Gross. 

Basically this argument concludes with her believing I am unreasonable, asking her to pay ($5) for cleaning tools we do not need. It also concludes with me having a fucking aneurism and in need of a petty way to moderately make her life worse for 2wks until she goes abroad and leaves forever. 

Clearly she doesn’t notice filth, so letting this place get dirty isn’t a great option since it will just annoy me and no one else. What should I do?",21Nov2019,1

282,"Hi y'all. My pickle is essentially that I've been trying to lose weight for the better part of 9 years now to no avail. There was half a year in highschool when I managed to get to a relatively happy weight and muscle tone for my size. I was motivated by the fact that my school formal was coming up. I was also too tired in the morning to pack my lunch, so I essentially fasted from 7am-4pm every weekday. On top of this, I ran almost everyday, again being fuelled with that motivation for fitness due to a fancy event coming up.
But before that, and after that, it's impossible. Currently I weigh about 15 kilos more than I should. I hate it. I can't use the technique I used back then because I don't have some fancy event coming up that I need to look good for. I need something that will actually motivate me everyday. I have a gym membership that I haven't really used because I don't like working out in front of other people, but going for runs like I used to isn't an option anymore because of where I live. It's simply too traffic heavy. I also am not busy everyday so I don't have something to do to keep me away from the cupboard. 
My question is: To those who were overweight and tried everything, like me, what was the thing that FINALLY helped you kick the food habit? Finally got you into order? I'm sick of feeling gross in my clothes. None of them fit me anymore and I can't afford a new wardrobe. My gut sticks out, and all I've ever wanted is a flat tummy. Please help me! I can't stick to anything! I always, always fall off the wagon.",21Nov2019,1

286,"This is straightforward I think. My child’s new teacher has implemented a new way to discipline students for breaking rules, such speaking out of turn (not putting hands up), not following directions, etc.

If you break a rule, you get a warning and your name is written on the board, if you break the rule again or different rule, you get a check mark next to your name, then you have to sit in silence at the lunch bell for 1 minute while everyone leaves for the lunchroom. The third infraction, a note is sent home and parents have to sign and return that they acknowledge what your child did wrong. 

At first I thought ok, sounds good to me. There is nothing wrong with implementing a system to ensure kids follow rules, as the purpose is to ensure a fair and positive learning environment for all. And, my child has never had a discipline problem that needed to be addressed in the 6 years she’s been there, so I didn’t expect to hear anything about this again.  Basically a normal, good student, with good grades and positive feedback from teachers over the years. 

Well, she came home, stressed, worried we’d be upset, and embarrassed because she got a letter and everyone knew it. Her name along with four others were on board at the end of the day. She explained that her first warning was due to speaking while waiting in line as they left the gym. Someone ask her a question and she felt she couldn’t or shouldn’t just ignore them so she answered. She acknowledges this. By the afternoon, when she returned to her home room there were two check marks next to her name and a letter was sent home. It identified that she spoke without raising her hand. She wasn’t quite sure what the two checkmarks were for as that would’ve indicated breaking rules twice more. 

I am wondering how teachers and parents feel about this approach. I’m leaning towards this being a form of unnecessary shaming and singling out students in front of others for minor things. Being accepted by your peers is stressful enough on a regular day, so being publicly humiliated (am I being over dramatic?) by having your name on display or having to sit in silence and do a walk of shame through the lunchroom seems like it would have a negative impact and not the kind of outcome the teacher is hoping for - I think there would be more resentment rather than appreciation and understanding from the kids. Are there not better or other ways? My child also has some anxiety from a traumatic experience a few years ago and I worry that this kind of stress will cause it to surface again. Therapy is expensive people!

Anyways, I’m looking for honest opinions. Is this how it’s done and do teachers think it’s a good way to discipline? Am I being too sensitive? What do other parents think?",21Nov2019,1
287,"A year from today, I will have completed my BFA in Dance at the University of Minnesota and I would like my next move to be California. I know I may not ever get a job as a dancer there, but I may as well try! I've had amazing training in dance but I'm mostly just looking to expand my horizons and experience something new.

From those who have made a big move like this, what are some steps you took to do it?

291,"The title about says it all, I'm currently dealing with a shitty landlord and not really sure how to deal with the situation. I'm renting out a 3 story town house with a roommate, and let's just say it's been interesting. We've been living here for about 6 months now and every month literally something else has gone wrong with the house. 

The biggest offenders currently being leaky pipes causing water damage in various parts of the house, what I believe to be black mold in the medicine cabinet in one of our bathrooms, and now the sewer pipes outside of our house under our crumbling driveway have begun to seep sewage everywhere. It's very noticeable to the point that when you walk outside you're hit with a week old diaper smell.

Now my roommate and I just yesterday told her that until these issues are fixed we aren't paying any more rent going forward. I'm concerned because this will be the second time shes dealt with the mold, she refuses to call any specialists and tries to DYI everything with varying results. My neighbors have also told me that shes been known to pull shady things to get out of any situation she finds herself in, they were without heat for the entire winter last year apparently and she just never felt like dealing with it.

I dont know what to do going forward, but all I know is I really don't want to continue living here because who knows what else is wrong with the place. Shes a 76 year old woman so I highly doubt shes going to be able to deal with all of this on her own, but I also suspect she may try to evict us for not paying going forward even though weve never missed a payment.

293,"I’m a very sensitive person I’ll admit. I also feel depressed and anxious the majority of the time but I do this thing that might seem kinda stupid. I try to hold on to some of the positive things that happen throughout my day and talk about them out loud to my husband just to relive how I felt at the moment they happened. This gives me some ease for my anxiety and it helps me look on the bright side when I’m not feeling my best. 

This has always been an issue however, that my husband won’t really be listening or be involved in something else (video games, on his phone, watching tv) and since they’re small things to him I guess he doesn’t really think that giving me full attention when I’m saying these things is that important? I don’t want to assume because then it just becomes this constant thought in my head that he doesn’t care, which I know is not true. 

Today, I kind of had it though. I told him that I always try to tell him about my day, he doesn’t tell me almost anything about his, nor does he ask me about mine. He got really defensive and continued playing his video game. Honestly, I felt pretty let down. When he had finally finished playing hours later I didn’t feel like speaking with him. He doesn’t want to fix things in the moment only  until after he finishes what he’s doing. So I’m there to soak up what just happened and deal with it by myself. He then tries to suggest we watch a movie or do something, like nothing ever happened. So when I act cold he gets defensive again and makes me feel like I’m being irrational. I wish he would take more responsibility for the issues we sometimes go through. 

Until then, here I am typing this at 1:30 in the morning, while he’s expecting me to act as if nothing happened.. again, and still be intimate with him.

294,"(Australia) I’m currently halfway through a duel bachelors degree of Nursing and Paramedicine. I’ve got another 2 years left and the further I get into the course the more I want to learn. 

I know I don’t want to do nursing when I finish. I’ve done my placements and it’s not a passion for me. Being in the hospitals and watching the interactions between the patients/nurses/doctors etc is what has made me consider studying medicine.

295,"I work a pretty stressful job and just recently hired an assistant who happens to be female. I got married last year and was a little hesitant to hire a female assistant, partially for fear of potentially upsetting or causing any issues with my wife, and partially because females in my industry tend to be very hit or miss.

I talked to my wife before hiring this assistant and she felt more than comfortable with things, and it turns out that my assistant is pretty awesome so far. She's a quick learner, hard worker, and seems pretty dedicated to things. Already I've felt a really nice shift in my overall mood and energy thanks to having someone to help split my workload with.

I'm in my late twenties and she is a recent college grad (so I'm assuming around 22-23). While I really like working with my assistant in a professional sense she also has a warm and open personality so I've gotten to know her on a level that is bit more personal than my other co-workers, just through us talking to each other, sharing stories, etc.

Here is where I am confused about and am looking for some thoughts/advice on.

On one hand I am extremely cognizant on the importance of keeping a professional distance from my co-workers and especially a subordinate. Yet at the same time, the more we get to know each other the better we seem to work together, and the more trust we both seem to have in one another. I obviously don't plan on talking about anything remotely inappropriate with my assistant nor do I plan to really see her outside of work/a professional environment...but she is beginning to become a friend of sorts and it's just a dynamic I've never had before at work.

Where does one draw the line in maintaining a healthy fruitful working relationship that doesn't somehow get too rooted in friendship, but also doesn't let that friendship element get completely stomped out for the sake of professionalism? I feel like having a strong level of trust is really important in the particular environment that I work in, so the openness really helps to foster that. With her being a pretty open person (and me being one too) I'm just really afraid of one of us accidentally crossing that line.

In working with my assistant, I've also started to look at my marriage a bit differently. I love my wife to death and she's been nothing but spectacular to me ever since I've known her. However, I realized that there's a few things that have dulled or maybe won't happen in my relationship.

My assistant is a bit of a ""go-getter"" and is pretty ambitious. My wife is accomplished in her own right (has a master's degree, great job, etc), but just isn't as intense about her career goals or personal path/direction in life. All things considered, that's probably a good thing considering how busy/intense I can be but I realized that there's a part of me that finds it very alluring to be aligned with someone who is as ambitious about things as I am.

In talking to my assistant and getting to know her, I also realized that since getting married my wife and I have grown a bit more comfortable with each other and don't necessarily connect as deeply or with the ""spark"" that we used to. I've been trying to work on this quite a bit with my wife but the results aren't quite there yet. So it's been a little weird for me to sometimes have great conversations with my assistant at work, then coming home and finding myself not really being able to talk as deeply with my wife.

This isn't to say that I am falling for my assistant or that I don't love my wife anymore or anything like that. Just in working with my assistant I have new perspective on things that I didn't necessarily have before and I am not quite sure what to make of it.

Anyways! This is kind of an odd post for me, so am just looking for any thoughts that can help me sort through some of these things that I have been processing.",21Nov2019,1

300,"So some context, I work for a 3rd party company that works for a certain much larger, very well known company. I work directly with several execs of said larger company as a tier 2 (at my company that is equivalent to a supervisor).
Now my boss has had it out for me from day 1. The guy has blown up on me for so many ridiculous reasons and I've only even been here 6 months. He's even gotten on me for not saying good morning to him (there are 2 different people who share my position and several others who share a similar leadership position to me).
He regularly threatens my job, he regularly puts me down and makes me feel stupid and he's sent several of my employees home crying.
Now I recently met with some execs of said larger company and had a standard meeting about bugs and potential improvements. Rapport seemed great, we were both cracking jokes.
Then after it ended, I asked one of the execs who is in a position similar to mine ""what kind of skills do you need to do your job?"" they laughed and asked if I was interested, I said maaaybe, but don't tell my boss! (intended as a joke but I'm aware how that looks. To make matters worse I forgot I said that last bit). 
They laughed it off and answered me. Everything was good. Then one of the two people who share my position went to my boss and told him that I asked for information on how to get a job with the execs. Apparently he had said it as a joke not realizing I'd get in trouble.
Boss comes and has a meeting with me and other tier 2. Yells at me profusely, repeatedly calls me synonyms if the word stupid when I said I didn't really consider how it would look at the time was just curious. I should probably preface this that my boss likes to be sneaky and give us a chance to volunteer other information we did wrong by asking us to tell him what we think this meeting is about. Then when you have no answer he always says ""the fact that you don't even know why you're here, IS A PROBLEM"".
he goes off and speaks to the guy who originally got me in trouble so then mentioned that he heard me say ""don't tell boss"". Boss comes back absolutely livid.
Now first off, that comment and the fact that I didn't remember to admit it which made me look like a liar, made my boss livid. I understand that and while it was intended as a joke, there's no way my boss will take it that way out of context (even if he were there he's the type to always get angry over something).
I've apologized profusely. But here's the thing. I've been taught from past jobs that networking is good. So while the way I handled it was inappropriate, being curious if other jobs shouldn't get me fired. I'm aware of that. (I should that this major company occasionally grabs interested employees from my company and brings them on board). So I don't think my curiosity was wrong. I think I could have asked better though. The execs seemed to not mind one bit.
My boss on the other hand is threatening my job. Threatening to tell other people whom he says will threaten my job.
He sent me home and asked me to write a report of everything that was said in the meeting, and why I'm sorry.

Now quite frankly, this guy has been a jerk to me from day 1. I'm well aware my career here is over. I'm only hoping I can survive long enough to get a new job because I have a brand new house and haven't saved up an emergency fund yet after buying this house. I'm currently in debt about 2k at the moment which isn't a lot but on my 55k salary it's not the best if you factor in my bills.

Most of my job history is working in technical support as a tier 2/3 or supervisor (mostly tier 2/3).

I don't even know what I want to do anymore with my life. I hate call centers but don't know how to get out of them. I look into other things but they require skills I don't have or can't do. I don't have a college degree, just attended some college programming classes. (python). My teacher was awful so while I passed I didn't really learn much and don't know if I can make a career out of it because I lack the motivation and drive to learn it. I'm at a loss. My boss treats me terrible and I can't go to hr cause I know that will get me fired as it got one of my coworkers fired.

301,"I work in an office environment with desks very close to each other. I have one co-worker, that brings along every day four meals, all with strong odors, that he eats at random times during the day.

The problem is that he eats really loudly. The whole office hears it. What I usually do is I sigh loudly, passively aggressive in a failing attempt to make him aware of what going on, after that not working, I wear my headphones and I listen to music. 

I don't feel like doing that anymore, and I'm really uncomfortable to approach him.

302,"I have a friend who will venmo charge me for short rideshares we go on and small grocery items when we cook together. They tend to be small amounts (less than $5). This would be somewhat fine if she also does the same when I'm the one paying for those things (venmo send me half the cost) but she will forget to and I don't feel comfortable bringing it up or charging her because it's a small amount. I think this really bothers me because she just doesn't think about all the times when I cover everything and didn't ask her to pay me back, and she'll send me a $1.62 request for ice cream we eat together the next day. 

I come from a cultural background where it's rude to ask friends and family to pay you back because it's perceived as distance in a relationship, particularly when it's a small amount so this is bringing me a lot of personal stress.

yesterday i got a notification on my finsta (private instagram) that she requested to follow me. when i saw it i was confused and asked my friend why she would possibly do that, my friend said maybe she was creeping but my account is private, so she wouldn’t see anything anyways. she then said maybe she wants to talk, but the more i think about it i get stressed out because we haven’t talked in months, and if she wanted to talk she could’ve texted me, dmed my regular insta which is not private, dmed me on twitter, or snapchatted me. and my name is on my finsta so it’s obvious it’s my account. 

my friend then pointed out that i recently changed my insta and deactivated my twitter so maybe she couldn’t find me but she still could’ve texted. she said i should text her and ask what’s up but if my number is blocked then she won’t see it anyways.

308,"I’ve lived with my dad and his family (his partner and my two younger half siblings) for about a year and a half now, I decided to move in with him so I could finish high school in the U.S. (I lived in Mexico for most of my life though I was born in the U.S, my mom and him separated when I was very young and he moved on and built his own life in America w/o acknowledging my existence for almost a decade). I’ve found it to be a very toxic environment for me; my father has neglected me emotionally for the past year and a half, and it has taken a big toll on me psychologically and academically.

Last year (junior year) I met my favorite teacher and we developed a very good friendship, he wasn’t aware of my struggles at home at the time (I mostly kept my troubles to myself last year, which proved to be very unhealthy in the long run) and I just recently expressed my concerns about how I’ll probably won’t have a place to stay after I graduate. I want to go to community college and create my own life in America, but as a young Hispanic woman it’s extremely unrealistic to do it on my own. I don’t see myself going back to Mexico with it’s current political state, so that’s not even an option for me at this point. 

He told me that’d he’d be willing to take me into his home, he believes that I have a lot of potential and that it would be tragic if I didn’t continue my education. He’d help me with my tuition (after financial aid ofc) and books if I needed it. I know it sounds cheesy but this person is the only one (besides my mom) who has believed and supported me for the past year. He also lives with his younger son so it wouldn’t just be the two of us. 

At this point I’m really considering moving in with him but I still have many doubts. Any sort of advice or thoughts on my situation is appreciated. X",21Nov2019,1

We both get out of the car and start running towards the barn when the arm suddenly pops out of the ground, smashes my brother, and pulls him underground. i finally make it to the barn and hide, but then i hear the sound of like something really heavy on all fours running really fast, and turn around to find that im in the open field again and the arm is shooting out at me from the forest, right before it gets me, i wake up.

321,"My girlfriend (22) and I (25) have been together for a year now. Throughout the relationship it’s been fairly full of ups and downs. She has borderline personality disorder so it hasn’t been so easy. She’s been through childhood trauma and has been in a few abusive and bad relationships in the past which makes her react to people and issues in a different way. So we bicker and argue often. 

Just 3 months ago we found out that she was pregnant, Her past relationship, her ex-boyfriend made her get an abortion, I couldn’t put her through that again. I was surprised and nervous at first but I’ve accepted it and have started to embrace this blessing. She didn’t like the fact that I was iffy about the pregnancy. We are constantly fighting and it’s driven me to the point where go into a blind rage and start breaking or hurt myself in a fit and I’m ashamed that I’m like this. Sometimes I’ll have a suicidal flash. Or I’ll say something immature in an argument or I’d leave the house for a few hours to calm down.

She will say that there many bad habits that’ll piss her off, that I am not ready to take care of a child if I can’t take care of myself because I dont eat much or rarely cook. That communication isn’t good and that I’m not up to her standards. I’m not big or muscular to her liking. I’m never home (because I work a full time job with erratic hours) even though I’m always home with her when I’m not at work. When we fight and I leave, she’ll sit and starve in the room. She makes it feel like I can’t take care of her. That I’m always tired or sleepy and sleep too much. She is tired of me.

But there are things on my side of this relationship that’s driving me up the wall. She is 15 months pregnant but she still smokes yachts (weed mixed with tobacco in a bong) because she has been an avid smoker for years and has trying to quit for the pregnancy. She says I piss her off so she’ll smoke. We have 4 cats (hers) and 1 bunny (mine) in this household so she expects to have the house clean almost all the time. The upkeep to keep the house tidy is exhausting due to all these pets. I’m working all the time and I’m paying mostly all the bills here and my money and energy is strained. We’re living paycheque to paycheque. As she doesn’t work. She doesn’t drive so I take her to do things as well as help her with her business. I am feeling really strained and helpless because I try and try to no avail, that nothing is good enough for her.

My boss's mother also works there.                    ( always watching...) We have about 2 hours alone every day, and we talk constantly, sometimes about deep subjects, and always have each other's back. I make him coffee in the morning ( fix it up for him too), bring him food I cooked at home, and he brings me lunch.  We help each other with tasks. He knows my moods and even knows me well enough that he knows when it's my time of the month! We just started texting ( not often, though) and I can tell him pretty much anything. He told me he misses me when I have a day off. He has seen me angry and listened to me cry. My own marriage is kind of blah right now, so I think maybe his attention is something I am missing from my husband.  From what he tells me, his marriage is kind of blah as well, and I think my praise and attention are what he is craving too.  The friendship has turned flirtatious the last couple months and when he passes by, he touches my back or shoulder. Today, I had to brush past to get by and he backed up a little so we touched and it was electric. I saw his face and I see he felt it too.  The problem is, I love my husband but  I know I am treading dangerous water now. I think I am starting to fall for him!!! I  think about him when I am not at work. Pretty sure I would get fired if anything happened. He's married to my boss's sister for God's sake. He has to take his mother-in-law home every night after work, so it's impossible to even go out for a few drinks, which we both have talked about. I respect and care about him and the feeling is mutual and would never hurt his wife or my husband by doing anything with him, but damn, this sucks...

I’m actually best friends with his girlfriend now and here’s when the problem begins.

His girlfriend who we’ll call TB wants to break up with him but can’t.

The next day when we were all out he was a dick to all his friends (more than usual) and kept kicking one of our friends in the shins incredibly hard.

TB and I have never allowed ourselves to cheat because even though I don’t like him it feels wrong to do him like that. However, we have talked of how we obviously have feelings for eachother and literally everyone tells us to get together.

325,"I started working at Chipotle roughly 2 years ago and it was a good gig but I wanted a promotion that my store wasn’t offering me. So I transferred to another chipotle for a promotion about 30 minutes away. This chipotle is going through a transition period since it had a bunch of bad GM’s and management, the reason I decided to take on the challenge of being a manager and helping fix the store was that the New GM of that store use to be my old GM at my first store and I knew we could turn the store around.  

My first shift at the new store my GM brings me into the office to tell me that she plans on leaving January 1st to accept a promotion, this literally shattered me because I discuss transferring down with this GM prior to actually doing it and she had all these plans for the store but didn’t actually mention that she was leaving until I officially transferred. So, with her departure one of the last remaining bad managers that stuck around is the only person able to take over the store as GM since the rest of us are in college and can’t take on a full time commitment and all the work we want to push towards fixing the store will mean nothing under her leadership.

Now, the store I started in is actually in need of managers apparently and it would help me immensely to transfer back over as management but I kind of left that store in bad spirits with drama and co-workers blah blah blah, so I’m not even sure if I’ll be welcome back at all. 

So finally, I just got a lease for an apartment and need to pay rent so I kind of need this job or at least a job paying over $12 an hour. My question is what do I do?

I am 40 and single, and straight off the bat I know my fertility could be crap and this will not be a possibility anyway. 

However I am constantly thinking these days if I should have a baby. 
I was in a relationship that ended 2 years ago and haven’t met anyone since I’m even interested in having a second date with let alone a baby. Unfortunately due to being a 40 yr old female time is running out and that makes me angry and resentful and panicky. 
I guess I’d presumed having a baby would happen at some point in life, but I have mostly been single (not by choice) my adult life and then my longer relationship ended (again not by choice)  and as I got older I wasn’t dying to have kids or 100% “I definitely want them no matter what”. 
So I find myself in the middle - on one hand I adore babies, have cared for many children of varying ages (I’m also a teacher) and feel I’m very good at that. I don’t doubt my ability to parent. I feel jealous sometimes when I see my brother with his kids and would like that relationship but I also know reality. 
I live in another state to my family for a start and friends here have their own lives and children to deal with. My father would not be a reliable help/carer for an infant and we don’t get along too well and my mum has Alzheimers. I fear the loneliness and constant-ness of being a single parent, and being a teacher means I see how many kids have varying issues and disabilities and know it is hard for 2 parent families let alone singles. The worries outweigh the positives often but then I still have this terrible sadness at the idea that I won’t get pregnant, have a baby and experience that. 
Has anyone been in this grey area and made a choice? How? 
All the people I know are either partnered and having/had kids or single (or partnered) and know for sure they don’t want them. I have no one to relate to currently. I’m interested in stories of people who were on the fence and made the conscious choice to have or not have a baby. 
Am I over doing the worry or is it realistic?

I’m just a dumb college student (18F) being dumb, what more can you expect ig.

334,"Hello Everybody,

I'm a college student now 3 years in and I've just come across the realization that I don't know what I'm doing. I'm currently undeclared and have spent the last 3 years moving towards a computer science degree that I am now being told may be out of reach for me due to my struggling in the required Math courses and with the undeclared window diminishing . I like programming and am pretty skilled at it getting high marks in almost every programming class I've taken. But now I'm at doubts whether if this is the right path for me as I've spent all this time struggling through. I'm afraid to ask my parents for advice as they've sponsored me all this time and 3 years in is not really a good time for the ""I don't know what I'm doing"" speech. I've thought about changing my major but I don't know whether I'm just not in love with the computer science / tech field anymore or am just giving up because its getting very difficult. I've spent the last few months meditating on this question and whether I could be happy majoring and eventually working in an environment such as programming / tech.

I guess I'm really just seeking advice from people who have been the same boat as me and how should I approach this.

I definitely don't want to deal with kids and school, and I do really want a higher degree, but at the same time I worry that I'm being stupid for not even considering his argument. 

My problem is that his insistence makes me feel like...I don't know, like he thinks \*my\* Master's is a waste of time, or that he doesn't want to wait another 3 years to have kids, and my own career wishes just aren't as important. I know he loves me and wants me to be happy, but I also know that he loves being the smartest person in a room and that if we were financially stable, he'd have no problem having kids right now.

Am I being oversensitive or selfish? Should I consider just working or forgoing the degree altogether? Or should I stand by what I want, even if it's potentially inconvenient to my SO?",21Nov2019,1

347,"am a 25yo male. If that matters. 

After a few sexual assaults and years of emotional and mental abuse, divorced parents, toxic relationships, I reached out for professional help. My reason, medical diagnosis. Why? Because I have possible symptoms of Bipolar disorder and/or Borderline personality disorder. 

I am coming down from a peak of confidence and slight increase in self esteem to a very depressive state of mind to the point where I am back to wondering what would it be like if i didnt exist. And my mood swings are extremely drastic. I would go from sad, to being triggered and getting very angry to just random spurs of energy and randomness where I don't even feel sad and just be playful then back to sad within the same day sometimes. I also get these moments where I just want to punch everything (not because of anger, but because I just feel the need to). My sexual taste has dramarically changed over the years. Have a history of cheating and going on a binge of online, picture sending, few meetups. Etc. And I have self destructive tendencies. 

Anyways. I went in. He started asking the (I assume) normal questions. Then asked about my drinking and drug use. Told him about my sleep patterns. A little background on what's causing me some anxiety. He asked if anyone in my family as a history of mental illness. Told him I didnt know because I dont talk to my family anymore. He said ""oh"" but we never even touched on that. Breifly touched on the divorce and how both of my parents directed everything towards me. But nothing in depth. Didnt even go into my past relationship,  current fling, and I didnt even get a chance to talk about my sexual trauma. And overall he was just very..idk..""cry me a river."" I got the impression that he thought ""oh just another kid who thinks he is xyz"". 

I asked him what his speciality is, what did he focus on. It was very general. He was a bit confused and shocked that I asked, I noticed his facial impression. I asked him if there anything to be concerned about. He said no, sounds like this is just a ""single episode of depression. Just stop drinking and exercise more. And dont smoke. You'll be fine."" Asked if I had anything else to talk about or wanted to go over. So I just gave him this blank stare and said no and walked out.

Am I going crazy or is this how therapy is? Are woman better therapists? 

I thought it was going to be more in depth. It was such a waste of damn time and money and I came out of that meeting extremely pissed off. Bought a bottle of whiskey and raced home.

This has left me with 0 hope that I can find out if something is wrong with me if I am getting dismissed. And made me feel like I am normal and went through normal things. I felt crazy and delusional. Like if I was just imagining everything or making things up in my head.",21Nov2019,1

351,"Hi all. First time poster here. Bear with me, this one's a bit bumpy.

I'll start out with a little background information. I'm a 19 year old college student. The school I attend is a very small,  private college with a very tight-knit community. It's a good school, and a lot of the people who have graduated from here (speaking from personal experience) have made a lot of themselves. My parents were absolutely ecstatic when I was accepted, even moreso when I visited and told them this is where I wanted to be. They were very supportive of my decision and it seemed like they believed I was making the right choice.

I was fortunate enough to attend a preparatory boarding school far from home for my upperclassmen years of high school. It was tough, but I made the best friends of my life and am ultimately very glad I went. Coming into college, I felt prepared and confident in my decision to attend the college I chose.

My freshman (previous) year started out great, I made a lot of friends right out of the gates, met tons of people through Greek life, my grades were good, so on. Everything was going just as I had hoped it would, maybe even better.

But since then, I've lost my desire to be here. Everyone in my friend group went their separate ways, one of my best friends dropped out and the others I don't really hear from anymore. My support system was gone, and in turn, this year has been really rough. My grades have plummeted. I have next to no friends anymore. I feel like I'm missing out on life. These should be some of the most enjoyable years of my entire life, yet some days I can't will myself out of bed, further feeding into the cycle of my grades falling, me feeling worse about it, having no external support, etc. I feel like I'm wasting my time and my family's money, and I don't think I should be feeling the way that I am at this point in my life. I thought college was going to be rewarding and something I'd reflect upon fondly, but so far it's been neither of those two things. I feel completely ostracized from my community, my former friends, and my family. My mental health and self esteem have gone right down the drain. Honestly, I don't even feel like myself anymore.

One of my best friends from high school went through a similar spell as soon as he went to college, and transferred after his first semester. The college he attends now (which another one of my best friends from high school also attends) has treated him very well, and he can't recommend it enough.

Upon voicing my displeasure with my current predicament to said friends, they've been pushing for me to transfer, and while I usually pride myself on going against the grain and blazing my own trail, I think they're right. I think I would be a lot happier there. I have people there that I know care about me, it's in a great location where I've lived before, and they have the exact major I need to pursue my desired career, which isn't offered at the college I currently attend. I believe that transferring there would be beneficial for myself, in both the short- and long-term. I am wholeheartedly prepared to drop everything here and transfer. The issue is, I don't know if my parents will be supportive of my decision (this is important as they're paying for my schooling). They're not very involved in my life, and have next to no idea anything is wrong outside of emails from my current college expressing concern over my drop in grades.

I'm planning on speaking to them about it the next time I see them, which will be next week, Thanksgiving break. The problem is, I have no idea how to go about it. I've never talked to them extensively about my mental health or my potential future outside of short conversations (IE *""What are you going to major in?""*, *""Are you still depressed?""*), despite them knowing full well of my struggles (I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, among others early in high school). I want to express my frustration and desire for change to them, but I'm not sure if they respect me enough to listen, much less help me do anything about it. What should I do / say, if anything?",21Nov2019,1

354,"Hello and greetings.
I graduated from college this April and found a job as a software developer at a start-up immediately after. This is a company with a good pay and benefits but no proper structure. Now I'm a shy person so it took me a good month before I could properly interact with my coworkers, but after that I'd say I became really open and friendly with everyone. Everyone on my team is at least 4 years older than me. 
Anyways after some time, I'd dare say I became the center of the group, making everyone laugh and stuff. I'm pretty straightforward and honest as well so I would straight up say it when I was being less productive, or was not able to figure something out. My humor also tends to be self deprecating. A few months working at this place and I was already thinking how terrible I was at doing my work because eventually my coworkers also started speaking negatively of my work (as a joke, which I ignored on the surface but it still had its impact on me). 
So when a month or so later I received the top performer award (we have these appreciation meetings twice a year), I was really surprised. Even during my feedback my manager had only extremely positive things to say for me. This raised my self esteem a bit. 
Since then, 3 months have passed and not much has changed except once again my self esteem started to go down due to the negative joking remarks. I was somewhat okay with it too, until this week, when I had to take a leave due to an unconventional reason which isn't as straightforward as ""I'm sick"" (does not being able to sleep because I couldn't breath count?). Since then my teammates have been saying stuff like how I'm obviously lying, and how that was a terrible excuse. They say it to make it look like they're joking, but they say it straight to the manager's face. On top of that, I had another teammate earlier today trying to take credit of the work I did yesterday, making it seem like I did nothing. I am seriously upset about this right now, and it looks like they've got into the manager's head as well. He telling me how he's losing trust in me because of this stuff (again, in a joking manner, and it wouldn't be clear to me until the next feedback session or the next time I have to take a leave because he said he'll reject any future leaves I apply for)
I'm considering quitting. Am I bring reasonable or paranoid? 
Thanks",21Nov2019,1
355,"Just turned 22 a month ago and don't have any direction in life right now. I graduated high school back in 2015 and went to university for biomedical engineering same year. I got sick with stomach flu and was unable to attend class for 3 weeks. Long story short had to drop all my courses and I owe the government money for the first semster courses and the school money for living on residence the fall and winter semesters. Managed to pay the school back but still owe the government money which I have to pay back to be able to get fresh loan for school. I'm not kicked out of school or anything, if I have money I can preregister for classes. Just one simple thing of being sick and I'm still paying for the repercussions. No parental support because of really bad family issues, having social services come to my house every other month because of abuse back when I was living at home.

First job since leaving school was 4 months at a Tim Hortons as a night baker. I hated it. Taking the bus watching everyone go home or go to the bars when I'm heading to work for minimum wage and doing more work than anyone else in the store. It was soul draining and later on I started calling in more often. Then I left for a higher paying rotating shift factory job making car parts, lasted a month and half there because I hated it. The people were nice but the hours were simply soul draining. Either you wake up at an ungodly hour or you stay up at an ungodly hour. The afternoon shift was the best because it was the only bearable shift. Ever since that job I have been basically going from job to job with temp agencies lasting no longer than a week to month at any place. I respect the people that have to do it because they have families to feed, but that life is simply not for me.

I really want to finish school so I can get on with life. I thought about joining the army and really do want to do it but with my work history they wouldn't even accept me. I haven't finished university so I'd only just qualify for  the basic things people without a post secondary education qualify for and I'm not exactly the best candidate. Don't even have a driver's license because never got the money or opportunity to learn and need my passport etc for ID which I don't have. If I could join the army I would for the discipline and some physical body building.

I've been reading things about passive income like investing in companies, stock market, real estate, making YouTube videos and building a website with popular content to generate traffic etc. I realized what I actually want in life: To be able to eat when I want to and sleep when I want to. To be able to live a humble comfortable minimalist life and do that without anyone disturbing me or having to depend on someone for a paycheque. I don't believe in working for a company day in and day out, get up in the morning, shower and force feed and go to work. However I do much want to finish my engineering degree because I believe a good education in the STEM fields is very important should I have need of any of that knowledge.

So how do I build a passive income? How do I get out of this horrible factory job life and finish my school?

I misunderstand what people say and sometimes go on my own tangent of understanding when people had said something totally different.. causing lots of confusion,I have difficulty to convey my thoughts I'm proper sequence especially when I'm nervous..not difficulty in speaking but sequence,I can either switch to a complete blank mind to complete over thinking.i should also mention that I have anxiety and depression but don't all?and people seem to be functioning properly with it, except me..I have actually wasted a whole year literally achieving nothing nor wanting to..I became very unmotivated not atall like in my undergraduate days..like everything seems tiering, though I have a pretty bad family situation I still think all people push it aside and move on,many have called me naive,my mother also complaints that I have a blank wide stare which I think unnerves people.then comes the issue of my observation skills I can have an unicorn stand in front of me and still not notice but when I see they signs of a patient (I'm a doctor) I can spot or diagnose or relate instantly or during the spot the difference games I can easily spot and observe...I feel like a horse with blinders 
but saying all this I was a pretty good student in my college..I have a very good memory and can learn stuff easily(though focus is a problem),when I learn things I grasp concepts fast  and liked to go out in college..I always knew I was a loner since kindergarten,but never thought it would get sucha negative reaction from people,I don't want people to suffer if I actually am a fool,so I can try some changes in my life and behavior

360,"My parents are cool and great. But, they are incredibly paranoid. And when I say paranoid I don't mean they're just worried about me and all that, I mean they're actually paranoid as In they believe that the government and other people have it out for them.

My mom and dad are basically conspiracy nuts that believe in all kinds of nonsense. My dad believes that the entire world is run by Jews, while my mom believes that the moon landing was faked. And whenever something goes wrong they believe someone else is to blame. It's always the doctors, officers and the internet. It's never their own fault. They've gotten in trouble many times for arguing with people and making scenes.

The thing is that I live with them. So unfortunately I have to be exposed to their nonsense all the day. For example recently thing happened:

My laptops speakers got busted for some reason. So I took it to the shop to get repaired (It was under warranty) so I didn't have to pay for anything. 

4 days later I get a call from the shop telling me that the laptop has been repaired and I can come to pick it up. However this week I'm pretty busy with school and my job, and the shop works only from 8:30-16:30, so I can't really come to pick it up because of this small time window. 

The day I can come pick it up is Friday, because that day I don't have work and I'm only in school for 4 periods. So I'll be done by 13:10. Meaning I got plenty of time to come and get the laptop. 

But my dad is going crazy and bugging to go pick it up today, the reason?

He believes that the people at the shop will intentionally take the news speakers and put some old crappy ones in my laptop.

I understand that we all need to be careful and a but skeptical around companies, but this sounds ridiculous. My dad has been annoying me for 2 days now. He keeps going on how the people that work there are Jews and all other kinds of crazy stuff.

18-21: got a 75% scholarship covering diploma and medical school. Push through diploma. Didn't date at all. Had a close knit friends.

  Got into a university abroad. Hid out in my room most time. Even went crazy n shaved my head. Noone cared. I had good grades.

23-25: most of my friends left. Went to see a doctor. Told her I've been crying myself to sleep since 15. Instant antidepressants prescription. I took a year off college. 
Met a guy. Went on a bender. 
Met with more guys. 
Back to college. Didn't have motivation. Told then bf i was depressed. He dumped me. Tried committing suicide with anti depressants.

Woke up the next day, called up college office and asked for a transfer. Maybe a change will fix me.

Feel like a failure. Six months of just crying and a few attempted suicide in between. 

I know i can't quit medicine because after all those leave of absences n transferring, i broke one rule: ""to graduate in time""... Now i have 50% to pay back. That's about £100k...depending on how long until i graduate and cgpa at graduation, the scholarship turns into debts.

So i kinda feel trapped. I don't like any aspect of my life. My depression is never going to get better. I tried a lot of things like relationship and friends and family and none of it helped. 

Because i know too many depressed physician, I don't even look forward to my career so i truly feel i have nothing to look forward too. 

I don't believe in marriage because my parents. And i don't see myself as a wife/mother. I even lived with a guy three months then and just like everything else, depression crept back in. And i think I'll be a shit mother or just unable to handle it if i go down the settle down route. 

I'm not looking for sympathy... I'm just a bit lost because i think I've tried everything n i feel like it's pointless to go forward now...

There are times i just wake up in the middle of the night, start crying and hating myself for not committing suicide because that's the most logical thing to do at this point, according to my brain. 

Any advice?",21Nov2019,1
365,"So just earlier my Step Dad woke up, he works night shift so he usually wakes up, gets us dinner before going back to sleep. Just earlier he woke up, and was trying to find his shoes so he could go down to the shops, but couldn't find them. Immediately he started lashing out towards my siblings, I was in my bedroom so i didn't really know what was going on.

 I could hear him yelling at them, saying things like ""If you guys kept the house clean for once!"" and was just telling my siblings how they were idiots and such. Next thing I hear is my sister screaming and the back door slamming before he drove off to (supposedly) get dinner.

I go down stairs (It's only like 3 steps) and my sister is bawling her eyes out. I asked my brother what happened and he told me that when my step dad was walking to the backdoor he shoved my sister out of the way and she fell down the steps. 

I've managed to stop her crying and she doesn't seem to have any bad sores or anything, I just don't know what to do when he gets back. It's been like 15 minutes so I think he might've went somewhere else considering the shops are like 2 minutes away from our house.",21Nov2019,1

369,"We're supposed to do a 10 minute long presentation of some type. Everyone does podcasts, I've done them before and I just don't think they're interesting. Also I'm not very good at coming up with helpful comments. I like making videos and have all the equipment so told my group we could do a short video.

It's about animal shelters so we could interview people, film the animals, etc. They seemed to like the idea and we were already coming up with a plan when they kind of suddenly got concerned that it would sound like I did all the work and they'd get bad feedback from the class. I can see why they'd feel that way because I would do most of the technical stuff (film and edit) but they were going to help interview and write scripts, I could let them film too so we could all say we worked with the camera.

With a video I think we would have a better chance at getting a really good grade. It would be much more effective than a podcast for this subject. Plus they still want to interview people, and they want visuals, but they don't want a video. So they basically plan on doing the same thing but without a camera.

Is there anything I can say that will convince them to reconsider the video? If it doesn't sound like a good idea, any tips for a podcast?",21Nov2019,1

372,"Hope I can explain myself clearly enough:

I am fairly new at my current job, have been here for 1.5 months. My fellow newbies and I did some work together, and at the end of the day after my colleagues have gone home my manager discovered that we did a mistake and told me to fix it. It actually was not my call, my colleague was adamant it should be done that way as that was what they did previously. I didn’t want to rat out my colleague so I just mumbled quickly “they said it was ok” - probably low enough not to be heard - then I fixed it.

And then today I made another small blunder (a bit of a grey area as instruction was unclear) and my manager was like “I told you this so many times!” And now I’m thinking I should have just defended myself every chance that I get, before my manager’s negative impression of me pile up any further.

Normally, I don’t want to be seen as stubborn or too proud to take in constructive criticism so I don’t defend myself too much (especially pointing the blame at someone else which may be seen as unprofessional), but I fear letting things slide too much can cause unnecessary misunderstandings. But now I’m thinking of saying something along the lines of “I’ve been debating whether to say this but I don’t want you to think I’m completely useless so I’m going to tell you. The other day when you found a mistake we did, it was X’s suggestion as they did it that way before”. 

Do you guys think that’s escalating things too much or even asshole-ish? My manager isn’t X’s manager so it would affect X all that much.

Also, generally how much do you explain yourself when make a blunder at work? Do you make sure there are no misunderstandings, or do you just suck it up?

I’m 14, but I frequently worry about the future a lot. Even though I’m still young, one of my biggest dreams in life is to go to an art school and get a job in doing art. Drawing is one of my biggest passions, and it makes me extremely happy to be doing something I love to do. I know there’s still time to ‘decide’ what I want to do with my life, I already am kinda firm with my dream haha.

The biggest worry with this though is my parents. I grew up an only child, so I’ve always been super close with my parents, and am terrified of letting them down. My mum in particular is the problem here, because since forever she’s been talking to me about getting a successful job that earns a lot of money so that I won’t have any problems with money in the future. When I was younger, my parents both had to work very hard to keep us afloat, and my mum’s job requires her to work hard (she’s a beautician). because of this, I feel guilty every time I think about getting a job in art, because they don’t pay the best and I’m scared that my mum will be disappointed in me, but every time I think about becoming something like a teacher like she wants me to, I get all miserable. I’ve done a lot of research, and although it’s tough, drawing is really important to me and I want to keep it in my life forever

I know it’s selfish, but getting a job Im going to be unhappy with in the future just makes me feel anxious, and it’s worse now since I have to start thinking about my electives which will impact my future. I just need some advice on what to do, I dont know if I’m just worrying over stupid things and if I should just ignore this or not. Sorry if I sound ungrateful, I’m really just asking for help!!

382,"I'm 22 years old next week and feel like I've failed before even starting my career.

I went to the University of Michigan and earned a 3.5 in Communications while gaining experience as the editor of the campus' first mental health magazine, as a customer service person at a library type building, and a diversity/inclusion advocate. I didn't get any significant internships but I have a generally decent amount of experience to fill up the page and talk about.

Problem is, I ran into a ton of legal problems right when I graduated, and I'm feeling utterly hopeless, like I want to give up on life. I poured my heart and soul into my schooling and it feels like it was a waste of time now.

I'll explain my issues. I started dating a sweet but troubled kid from my high school just after I graduated HS at 17, who despite being a solidly middle class, intelligent guy, became a heroin addict. Naturally, I had rose tinted glasses and naturally as a drug addict he stole things. Long story short he OD'd and passed away Dec 2017. His family gives me all of his belongings since we were a close couple, including a laptop. July 2018, I finally use said laptop on school wifi and police come knocking a week later, claiming its stolen. I insist on going to trial, using the free lawyer UofM offers, who was a total kook. May 2019, trial starts. Jury selection strikes intense fear in me, even the freaking president of the university was a potential juror on my case (wtf?). I had an interview that week in San Francisco for a dream job that paid well and had a $12k signing bonus. My dumbass says, I'll stop the trial and take the plea deal so that I can stop stressing about the case and just go on the interview. Plea deal is just 6mo probation and a 2k fine, with the crime being private and off the record. Never had any plans of gov work so I was like whatever. Oh, any further charges result in the charge being public and on the record. The charge is ""possession of stolen property"" and is a misdemeanor.

Problem is, condition of probation is to abstain from drugs and alcohol. Unfortunately I had become a stoner in college and found it extremely difficult to stop after four years of heavy smoking. I turned to the drink instead, because of its quicker elimination from the body. So, I end up getting drunk at a party Sunday night in July and blow a .045 at probation the next morning. This probation violation puts me in a drinking craze to drown my emotions. 2 weeks later, I get a DUI, because my dumbass thought it was okay to drive after sleeping 6 hours, despite having drank a lot. Having never been pulled over, and an easily panicked person, I went into panic and did not immediately stop for the police. My brain chose the ""flight"" of the fight or flight response. Fleeing the police is a felony, which I am now charged with, and headed to circuit court in a few weeks to hopefully take a plea deal that makes that specific charge go away or be a misdemeanor. 

I'm several months sober, my dad dies unexpectedly, and AGAIN I have criminal traffic problems. (btw I did not start driving until the end of May 2019, I've never had a car before). Tired and alone one night, I accidentally rear end someone at 12:30am going literally 10mph. My dumbass again goes into a complete panic and flees despite the fact that a rear end isn't illegal. I just felt like I had done something illegally wrong... so I got scared and left. My car had very little damage so I didn't think much of it and did not go to the police after. Yes I know not to do this now... and NOW I have a hit and run charge. My judge on the stolen property case was very lenient the first time and let me keep my charge off the public record, despite the fact that losing that privilege is standard procedure for probation violations. The hit and run charge has yet to be fought by my lawyer, and we have a letter from my doc about my PTSD contributing to my frenzied thought and fear at the scene. 

So, at the very worst, I'll have possession of stolen property, DUI, fleeing the police, and hit and run on my record. It's unlikely I'll have all four, given that 3 of them haven't been litigated yet and I have an excellent lawyer that will hopefully make things better, and the judge may be understanding again and keep the stolen property off of my record. If the judge were to put that on my record, I could get it expunged in 5 years. None of the others can be expunged. But it's safe to say I'll probably have 2 charges +.

ALL OF THIS TO SAY, I am terrified and hopeless about my future career. I am a pretty meek but bright girl who tries to be a ray of sunshine everywhere I go. I want some advice as to how I should approach this situation in a career context. I'm sober now and feel great, but feel like no legitimate employer is going to give me a chance now. I was consistently getting contacted about positions for $60k+ throughout my senior year of college, yet my substance issues caused me to lose sight of my career. Now I'm sober and just want a good job. The thought of working retail or food makes me want to up and die, quite honestly. Not to knock anyone who does that, I'm interviewing for a supermarket position this weekend, but I worked so hard in school to be employable and earn a high salary.

Should I focus on framing my charges well in a job interview? Should I focus on creating my own business? I am quite business savvy, did a lot around entrepreneurship in college and owning my own business has always been a dream of mine, but I know that's sometimes unrealistic. But I think, maybe that's my only choice? Maybe I HAVE to make that work?

384,"The only two spheres I've had any interest in have been education and psychology. Due to parental pressure and the fact that studying straight-up clinical psychology in my country is a recipe for unemployment and going into education means I'll be miserable all my life like my mother who is a teacher or my uncle who is a professor, I chose an economics university and after 2 years of basic economics shit I chose Marketing as my specialization for the last 2 (that's how it's done in the unis in the European capital I live in).

I chose marketing because I find Neuromarketing and Consumer Behavior to be very interesting. Despite that, this degree won't give me squat in terms of satisfaction, as my options will be to work in one of the many marketing agencies here and do social media crap or create strategies, or organize events and I've done all these things for the past 2 years due to being in a high position on a national level in an NGO and I hate it, I'm sorry, but Marketing is a load of crap, not enjoyable for me at all.

Psychology here is very underdeveloped, while the educational system is straight trash. I will be miserable because I will want to reform it, rather than being even more miserable teaching anywhere in this country. With psychology - I have many friends who are struggling with it and will be moving abroad.

Moving abroad is an option as well, but I don't want to study clinical psychology, I just love doing research and delving into the numerous habits, issues and the unique, endless world of our brains.

I was feeling directionless, and I was practically in a depressed hell for a long time, especially the most recent few months. I thought this relationship between us was going a certain way and I started getting sucked into that idea. But I knew that saying anything would ruin our long relationship. For the longest time I didn't say anything, and I felt like I was really going insane. I needed to say it, and I finally told her a couple days ago that I might be starting to like her.

My answer wasn't definite, I didn't know if I truly liked her or not. I wasn't hoping for a relationship, I just wanted an answer. At this moment I would have been thrilled with either a yes or a no, because then I would have found my footing and I would have understood where to go. But instead her answer was to get out of my car and walk the rest of the way home. I followed along and tried to talk to her, and also to make sure that she made it home safe, but she refused to speak to me.

I heard from many people that when they told their friends that they liked them that it felt like a weight was taken off them. I didn't want to do it, but I had to. I needed that weight off. But instead that weight got twenty times heavier. I have never felt this terrible before.

I regret even mentioning this topic, and I want to make things right somehow. I just want to remain friends. Just friends. No gimmicks. No tricks. No maybes. Just friends.

So this rush of fear and disturbing image of demonic person comes rushing through my mind and I ran to the elevator and when lights turn on I still feel somewhat agitated. 

I have always been afraid of dark but these thoughts like “what if right not a demonic dead person appeared in this dark corner” are fucking messing me up.

She kept having negative thoughts and in a way, vilianizing me for doing something for myself. Things got worst when I refused to do certain things her way and I called her out, but even then she kept complaining to me about I am the one who made her feel this way, and even if she acknowledge that I'm not the guilty one, she kept guilt tripping me in a way that almost everytime we hang out, there would be session where she would get mad and in a way, she is dragging my mood down into this negative hole again, and I really disliked it.

416," So, this is my first time talking publicly about this and I’m very nervous to even write about it so please forgive me if it goes on too long or I start to ramble.   All my life has been traumatic, my dad is an alcoholic, mum a drug addict as they have both played a part in destroying every part of me. I witnessed so many things as a child that I only now realise was so fucked up. We were a seemingly normal family from the outside and we genuinely did have great times together at some points.  

 At 16 I met my ex partner and at 19, my ex partner and I fell pregnant and we had a beautiful little girl together, she was and remains the absolute apple of my eye. For 8 years we were together and spent the first four years of our daughters life putting on a brave front and desperately trying to create a normal family environment for her. Her dad was naive and immature but he loved that girl and she, him.  

 Last year, my parents marriage ended when it came to light that my mum was addicted to cocaine, had stolen every penny of my dads pension money, had over £60,000 of debt in my dads name and all whilst having an affair. My dad ended up in prison for the actions he took that night. My mum mentally and physically abused myself and my dad my entire life, she honestly destroyed me and I cannot condone my dads actions but it was the result of years of torture and torment. My dad went away for 6 months and my mum ran off with her boyfriend whilst continuing to do everything in her power to destroy me.   

Meanwhile, my daughter is suffering through all of this because regardless of the issues, she adored her nanna and grandad.   

In January this year, my daughters father and I split up, very amicably, we co-patented amazingly for months and things were starting to really look up. It then came to light that whilst her dad was caring for her on weekends, my daughter was being sexually abused by her 10 year old cousin. When all of this came out, her dad instantly denied it, called our daughter a liar and did everything in his power to ignore it all. I took the appropriate actions, contacted social services, the police, her school and I did everything I could to support her through it all but it broke me, watching her turn from this amazingly positive little girl to a shell of herself broke my heart.  

I became very distant from her, I was physically there but not mentally and I will forever hate myself for not being there when she needed me the most. Something snapped after a couple of weeks and I started to get us back on track, my daughter and I are now closer than ever, we are being supported by her school and doctor dealing with the abuse and things are really looking up. Her dad has not contacted us in months, doesn’t pay anything and still holds true that my daughter is a liar.  

 I feel incredible guilt for everything that has happened to her and I’m feeling overwhelmingly suffocated by everything. I honestly don’t know what to do next, I put on a great show for the outside world but I’m not coping with life at all, I have absolutely no money, I’m too scared to pick the phone up and ask for help, I have no gas or heating until next week and even though my daughter thinks having the extra blankets and sleeping in mummy’s bed is fun, I know it’s because i’ve failed.   I don’t have anybody to talk to, no family and I lost all my friends because throughout this, I isolated myself to badly, never returned calls, etc.. so it’s my own fault really, I’m so lonely and sad and scared. If anybody can offer any kind words, I’d be wholeheartedly grateful, it’s been so long since I last had somebody to talk to/hug",21Nov2019,1
417,"I was living with my boyfriend (T) and his older brother (M) in a house his mom handed down to M. We lived there for three months before paying rent as we were in between jobs. In the meantime I cleaned house and tried to keep the peace between T &amp; M’s already strained relationship. 
We came up with a plan to split bills and rent finally but that never got a chance to happen because M got a girlfriend (F)  and started staying over pretty much the day after they started dating. 

I was sick for two days and our room stayed sweltering hot in the summer. I was on medicine that made me not all there and woke up in the middle of the night to turn the air up because I was too uncomfortable to sleep. I then wake up again to someone choking me saying “Don’t fucking touch the air.” In my haze I got up fighting and punched F in the face multiple times before I could get to the light to see what was going on. By the time I turn the light on, she was coming at me again for hitting her AND M came into the room while I was naked from the waste down and started fighting me too!
At this point they say they’re calling the cops because M thinks F didn’t attack me. He wasn’t in the room to know what I woke up to. 
The police come, ask me if I wanna press charges after hearing my side, I say no but I want her out of the house. They tell her since she doesn’t pay rent nor does she have permission from the owner of the house to stay, she had to go. 

His mom shows up and accuses me of starting everything and said “Well, you look fine for being attacked in your sleep.”

So my question, she hasn’t flat out apologized but she did have a big Christmas for us last year. Spent a lot of $ on me. I just can’t get over the fact she automatically took M and L’s side and me and T are considered the black sheep now. I always get mad going around them as I feel as if they still don’t believe me on what happened because it’s not something that has been brought up again. 

Am I a bad persons for not letting that go and developing a close relationship with T’s family 2 and a half years later? He’s mad at them as well for it but I also feel like I’m holding him back from his family as he won’t go around them unless I suggest it.",21Nov2019,1
419,"This story is not original and we have seen many similar stories appearing in social media, the news, in our own social groups. When the stories come to light it always seems easy to say ""why bring it up now and not then?"" 

This story is about sexual assault. 

My girlfriend lived with me for part of the summer three years ago. I lived with three other flatmates. Two boys (boy a and boy b) who I went to school and college with who I have known for the almost 12 years, and another guy (boy c) who I had met through boy A.

Three summers ago, we were all partying and having fun. One of my housemates was particularly in the partying mood. One day whilst I was at work boy A got into my bed whilst my girlfriend was sleeping, she awoke to him in our bed and they spoke about his night out. She told him she was gonna go back to sleep. She then awoke to him cuddling her and his hand up her pajama top and around her bare breast. She froze and panicked. She managed to get herself out of the situation before it got worse. 

After that he went to his room and they never spoke about it. 

She told me when I got home from work. I didn't say anything to him. I was scared I didn't know what to do.

Boy A did not only do what was said above but he and boy C accused her of trying to sleep with boy C. She confronted them and they admitted that they had speculated it and twisted her words (she made a bad joke.) Boy C admitted that he thought my girlfriend fancied him, ( we had been together for 4 years at this point.) 

My girlfriend suffers from PTSD, about a month ago after a night out  and an encounter with a creepy stranger ( I was in a queue for a gig t-shirt) she had a flashback of the night. We started to argue and she said "" it's your fault you left me with a stranger at a gig!, Just like you left me with your friend(boy A)."" 

Since that night we have been arguing over what to do. She feels that because of the way he has treated her; secually assaulting her, accusing her trying to sleep with our housemate, constantly leaving her out of plans that involve all our friends, when she had no where live over the summer he refused to let her live with us, she feels likes he's now trying to push her out, she's done with him. She's blocked him on every platform. She wants me to do the same. That he abused my trust as well and our friendship. I said that if I asked him about it and he accepted it and apologised I could forgive him. 

My girlfriend asked if she were to kiss another man would I forgive her I said no I wouldn't, that is different. Although in all honesty she had a male friend who kissed her and when she told me I told her she couldn't see him anymore. To this day she hasn't.

In any case I spoke to my friend recently and asked him he said "" well I don't remember doing it but if I did I'm sorry I don't remember much from that night as I was f***ed on drugs and alcohol, but I am sorry"" 

To me he sounded sorry and I forgive him. But I told him I needed my girlfriend to make amends before we can get back to normal. 

I think forgiving him completely will have a massive impact on our relationship. 

I don't think my girlfriend will ever make amends with him. But what does that mean for me and boy A? 

I just don't know what to do. 

Should I abandon years of friendship? 
Should I let go of the 7 year relationship? 

Am I wrong for wanting that friendship?

If I lose friendship with boy A I could lose friendship with boy B and alot of other mutual friends. 

But I love my girlfriend. 

I know I should have done this years ago but I didn't. What do I do?",21Nov2019,1
420,"I’m a college freshman applying for a scholarship to help pay for tuition. One of the essay questions is about disappointing outcomes/frustrations and what they taught us. The one thing that I feel would make an essay that is very meaningful and true to me is about my attempt to come out to my parents as bi and how there reactions to even the hypothetical of it were so brutal that it completely shut me down.

The problem is that I’m still in the closet, and real people are going to be reading these applications, and the scholarship requires an in person interview after the initial application if you’re considered. So I’d essentially be coming out to some random people on the review committee, and I’d have to talk to them in person.

424,"Growing up I had a very toxic home life, mostly involving isolation and lots of psychological trauma, so throughout grade school my grades were abysmal. There was no chance for me to get into a good school let alone do well in a community college but from 18 to 21 years old I attempted to do my best at a local community college but the most I could muster was C’s and F’s. Because of the plethora of mental illness I had developed from my life it made keeping up with lectures and homework very difficult. I’ve always loved learning and I found every class fascinating but my brain was too jumbled.

Fast forward to today. I’m 27 years old and I picked up a job as a repair tech and I’ve been doing that since I dropped out. Life has grown stale and my dream has always been to work in the medical field. To be specific I just watched a video of a spinal cord surgery and my heart ached that *this* is what I wish I could be doing.  I’m fascinated by psychology and anatomy.

I’ve started taking a different medication for my mental illness and I’m the most level and clear headed I’ve ever been. Also within the 6 years of me being out on my own I’ve become a lot more mature and focused. My coping skills for mental illness have also advanced. Not only that but I recently took a legitimate IQ test and it’s 129~135 so it seems like if I actually find a way to focus and apply myself I could actually do something worthwhile! 

So my question is, would starting college all over again at 27 in a community college be worth it if I actually did well? Would I be able to get a good job or would I be stuck doing something basic? Are there questions I could ask college counselors that could help me understand the appropriate course of action? I really want to go into the medical field, either psychology or neuroscience. I’m fascinated by the mind, but I realize it’s a lot of time and effort and I’d want to make it worth it if I do it. 

Tl;dr : I’m old af and want to go into the medical field via community college, is it worth it?",21Nov2019,1

Anyway I met this girl a few months ago, she works at the local bar. She was really awesome, really good looking and for some reason seemed to like me?

I've been looking for a job since August and haven't had any interviews. It wasn't until recently that I finally got some feed back and that despite the jobs being similar to what I do now a big reason it seems companies don't want me is because I don't have an accounting degree.

430,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask or not since it's not specifically medical (it's partially that, but I also would like to know if I should be persistent with my boss about it and/or if I should talk to the higher ups), so if you guys think it's better to go to a different sub, I'll do so.

So I work for a security company, and I'm currently stationed at an apartment building on the 5th (top) floor, which is being renovated due to there being a ton of black mold – that's all I've been told about the details other than what I'm required to do to get the job done. At first everything was fine because the construction was just inside rooms/units with the doors closed, and I would get up to walk around for a few seconds in each room to make sure there isn't an electrical fire (they had to take out the fire paneling, hence why they need someone on fire watch duty).
A couple of months ago, I was moved to the opposite side of the buildong, from originally being on the east side and moving to the west side, since they were supposed to keep all construction to the east side and have it quarantined. The quarantining ""barrier"" for several weeks was literally a tarp taped to the doorframe that didn't even cover the entire entrance. They have since put up a proper barrier, at least as far as I can tell with my limited knowledge of that kind of stuff; it's got 2-3 tarps on a wire frame from what I can see, and a sign saying that protective clothing and respirators are required in that area... except most of the time they have it taped open. 
About 2 weeks ago, they started taping plastic sheets over everything, including the room we're supposed to use for the bathroom, fridge, and microwave, and have put plastic over the doorways as well. Multiple times I've seen workers walk past me wearing protective clothing (the one-piece kind) and respirator masks, and I've gotta say, I don't get a warm fuzzy feeling about all of those signs together when I'm sitting here in a short sleeve shirt, slacks, and no protective gear whatsoever. Should I be concerned/should I do or say something? (Note: my boss is always ""busy"" whenever I call about anything and doesn't respond to texts/emails.)

TLDR: I'm being exposed to black mold in my work environment and haven't been given any protective gear/told anything about any health risks even though there are multiple signs that it's not safe to be exposed for long periods of time.",21Nov2019,1
431,"I'm just going to get straight to the thick of it. There's a lot of backstory but I will try to include what ever's relevant. 

My brother is currently in his 30's and for most of his adult life he has been struggling with Heroin addiction, let's call him B. Our mum has done a lot to try and provide and help for B throughout his many stints in rehabilitation. Through out the years he has stolen from the family and from friends who have come to visit. These stolen items varying from expensive sunglasses, digital cameras, debit cards, cash etc. A year ago, he was released from prison after serving 4 months for theft and other things. Mum decided to allow him back into the house to stay temporarily. During this time, I tried to help him apply for jobs and wrote him a resume and took him around whenever he needed as he had his license revoked.  Mum had organised TWICE for him travel interstate to stay with a friend and work in the country side. Both times she took time off her and paid for flights. Both times he decided last minute to come home with her. 

While he was in prison, he became clean and put on weight working out. So we assumed that he enjoyed being active and didn't think too much of it when he said would go jogging. These jogs would last an hour or so until we noticed that he would disappear for anywhere between 3 to 5 hours at a time. Then we learned that mum's boyfriend had seen him at our local store meeting someone for what he assumed was a drug deal. Anytime he was pressed about it, he would get hot tempered and deny any use. It was clear to us that he was using, we could see it in the way he looked and behaved. Prior to him moving in again, my mother made it clear that if he was to use again, he would be kicked out. My mother being the person she is, instead helped him to secure a bungalow that was relatively cheap. 

Months pass and the landlord contacts us saying that B is behind 7 weeks of rent and has been visiting less and less frequently, only seeming to come back to get clothes or whatever he needs. I should mention that anytime B needs anything, my mum will pick up the phone with no hesitation. But if we want to talk to him, good luck. 

The landlord became sick of it and asked us to take his stuff so that they could arrange the space for someone else. So we come to clean up and its a mess. His belongings included; clothes, various backpacks, a 4k TV, a hi-fi system, a PS4, a DLSR camera, drug paraphernalia (mostly needles), a box of stolen car keys, a box of stolen wallets some including I.D and debit cards, a box of what I assume are stolen sunglasses and perfumes and just other shit. 

Considering mum's financial position, I was the person that could pay it off, so I did. 

We've moved all his belongings back to the garage but I'm still out of pocket for the rent money. We are unsure of which items he acquired legitimately or if he has stolen them. Should I sell items like the TV, camera and ps4 to recoup the rent? Would it also be wrong to sell the other items so that I have extra spending money for my trip at the end of the year? My moral crossroads is that I will be making money from things that were potentially stolen from others and I'm now ""stealing"" from him for my own benefit.

439,"I posted here a couple weeks ago with the story, but now I'm over the fact that my mom ran out on me.

However, she took my dad's updated will (after saying that there wasn't one)

So basically the entire inheritance, car, and everything else would have gone to me.

Whatever, I can't fuss over that the money has been spent (wasn't much, only about $6000) 

The issue im facing is that I have a nice car that has no insurance and is not in my name and it's wrapping up tickets for expired plates and city stickers.

I found an old well from 2011 that gives the car to my sister and she said she would transfer it to me. It's going to be extremely hard to get her to the DMV (she's busy and wants nothing of this situation) I don't have enough money to pay a lawyer let alone I don't even know if I can cover a transfer fee right now. Does anyone know if there are attorneys that work like public defenders? Any advice on how to handle this messy situation? Thank you in advance",21Nov2019,1

441,"Okay i know you're thinking here goes another bullshit made up story, but this happens to me a lot and anything you guys can say would help me. 

So it all started when i was little a lot of paranormal things would happen in my family so i guess nobody thought it was weird when id disappear for a bit and then suddenly come back. This happened a lot me randomly going from one place to another having no memory and rarely anyone seeing it. One time when i was about 2 i was apparently sitting in the living room and then just appeared in the road almost getting hit by a car. Our family dog was sitting outside and she stopped me from getting hit by dragging me out of the road. Everyone in my family chalked it up to me wandering out of the house. But the door was locked and i was just 2 i couldn't reach the door knob nevertheless the lock.

 This happened again when i was about 5 we had another dog named Buddy he liked to wander around outside and i was sitting on the porch with him, this house was in the middle of neighborhood a good 3 houses and long stretches of sidewalk on either side of it. My mom had been outside watching me and ran inside for maybe less then 2 minutes to grab a drink when i was just gone. They say i walked around the block just following Buddy but if she was back in so little of time wouldnt she have seen me wandering down the side walk to the corner? Everyone in my family brushed it off and forgot it. 

A few years later and i was in 5th grade so happy at my new school, i would just notice things that others wouldn't. Id have to introduce myself to the same person multiple times and youre probably thinking thats not weird people just forget. No im talking about reintroducing myself to people ive known and been friends with for a couple days to weeks, yet no one seemed to remember me. 

7th grade rolled around and i finally made friends who would remember me, except now something weird would happen. Sometimes id go robotic (as my friend well lets call him Jack would say) for a few hours. My walk would be super stiff and if someone talked to me id act super strange, they ask me a question and id answer it with complete facts with knowledge i didnt know, when id snap out of it id have no memory of what had happened. This happened a few times and people brushed it off as me being tired but slowly a couple hours turned into days and days turned into weeks and suddenly i would go through months without remembering anything. Everyone thought it was just stress from the dramatic divorce and believed this was my way of copping with the divorce and the mental abuse. They dropped it all except one friend who was with me when this next incident happened. 

There was a new class at the highschool for 8th graders and me and my friend,lets call her May, were walking back from class. We were on this huge sidewalk with me walking in the middle of it, no one was with us and it was kinda weird how everyone seemed to disappear. When all of a sudden i went from the middle of the sidewalk to walking off the curb nearly getting hit by a car, i thought it was just me being careless until May said something after we got back to the school safely. ""When you were on the sidewalk back there it looked like you got pushed by something not pushed but like 'glitched'. You were standing in front of me singing and all of sudden you were just in the road."" 

When we got back to the school we told Jack what had happened seemed weirded out at first and then he said that he remembered seeing me 'glitch' before. I would get these full body twitches i couldnt control they were super random and kinda violent and its made me sit up super straight and have this shiver or switch, jack said he's seen me 'glitch' before when that happens. I always kinda shook it off and soon i forgot i became used to not remembering parts of my life that people say happened and i learned how to make it seem like i remembered.

 I got to where i could control part of being robotic making my steps go silent without changing how i walked, having someone talk to me and then having a small glazed look in their eyes and walk away. Little things to keep people from noticing me. The only reason im posting this is because things keep happening i dont know how to control it. I finally told my boyfriend everything i just wrote he's said he's had similar experiences to the robotic thing and the shivers but never any 'glitches'. Ill probably make a part 2 telling you guys other creepy things that kinda go along with this later. If you guys know whats going on or something like this has happened to you before or even if you have any advice please tell me i just want this to stop. Anytime i tell someone they think I'm crazy if they werent there to see it or experienced something similar. If they don't they soon forget anything I told them of  it and i get a horrible headache and dizziness when i try to tell someone. What's happening??",21Nov2019,1

451,"I am going to try to give details but be brief as well. So my ex-boyfriend, which I have No contact with, has a very weird relationship with his mother. When he was an actual child (birth-18) he said his parents left him to his own devices, and that they did not do much with him. A few examples I can recall was a lot of times in the summer they would just up and leave and he would home hop between his friends, because he did not want to be alone. He also expressed one time will mildly drunk he missed his dad and his dog, but said nothing about his mom which kind of concerned me. 

I do know that she tracks his phone through the Life 360 app, and she checks its very frequently. I could understand the app if it was once in awhile but it seems like every 20 minutes this lady checks in. He has also made a statement where he expressed that she calls too much and if he doesn't answer, ""She goes into def con 1"". Here comes the better part of this whole situation. She hates me. I think it is because I started teaching this guy how to grow up and she became scared of loosing her son (which I had no intention of separating them). Because of this she decided to separate us. 

You're about to say he has a choice but in all honesty not really. She threatened to stop paying for his phone, among other things like his college, if he didn't break up with me. Which when this happened he secretly stayed with me. However there was an incident where he tried to tell his mom about us and in his words ""shut me down"", ""she said she didn't want to talk about it,"" and ""walked away"". A few days later when she found out, through my ex's best friend, everything went down hill and fast. She turned his phone off, contacted our school and filed a no contact order against me (pretending to be my ex). I tried to show the school proof of where he said his mom contacted them not him but they didn't listen. That week she took him back home to GA and I feel like the whole time he was up there she sat there and filled his head with lies about me. 

She is so manipulative and toxic he is scared of her, I have a text from him where he was saying he loves me and wants to be with me but he is so scared of his mom. Unfortunately down at our University he shares an apt with his elder sister, who is very much like mom. I understand that he should be mature enough to not be so easily persuaded and be able to makes his own decision but his mom pulled the ""her or us"" card on him. That is really unfair to him and me in a way. 

I do love this boy but I think I am at the point where even if he did grow up I dont think I could be with him because of his family. Which sucks to say because we were talking about our future plans together and we had so much stuff in common it is ridiculous. Sorry this became a rant but I would like some advice on if there is something that can be done about his mom being emotional abusive.

I got out of school 2 years later than usual cause i never really studied just doing the bare minimun and obviusly often that wasnt enought,never liked the atmosphere there,always felt like an outcast, and even though i think that helped me to just ignore school i know that it wasnt the main reason for me to not study,

After school i went to university (obviously) to study biology since i always dreamt to work with animals, but i discovered that i didnt really like biology that much and the same cycle started and i just dropped out altogether without considering changing course because i feel too stupid for university or for life tbh always had a hard time grasping concpet that others seems to understand on the spot. Decision i regret to be honest but at the same time i don't know what to do with my life and in my life,so how could i choose what degree should i take

457,"The rough outline of what happened:
He got into a relationship just over 2 years ago.
We just finished secondary school (I’m 16 he’s just turned 17) and he got into an apprenticeship in his girlfriends aunts business (currently too late to transfer to a 6th form). 
Girlfriend broke up with him (not sure on the date as he didn’t mention it at the time but potentially up to 2 months ago) and he seemed to not mind at the time.

I’m not too sure how long after his girlfriend broke up with him but he tried to commit suicide by strangling himself and ended up getting paramedics involved, he called a lifeline and got set up with a counsellor who, after a couple of sessions said she couldn’t help him the way he wanted and has been referred to a therapist waiting’s list which he has been told will last for at least a month. 

He says he no longer feels happy about anything and he can’t make other people happy anymore, that at work he’s reminded of her due to the family business (she has to go over there every now and then due to family, not totally sure why) so he can’t distance himself from her, he told me that he messes up at work, getting shouted at by his boss and his mum at home.

Recently his dad (separate from his mum) tried committing suicide after separating from his second wife and my friends mindset is stuck as, if he can do it why can’t I?

He says that he views everything as a tool to commit suicide, knives, windows etc and that these thoughts have been growing while on the waiting list for the therapist, saying that they just keep getting stronger and stronger.

He’s more often than not singling himself out and has stopped talking to me and my friends almost altogether and will consistently ignore messages from people.

I am currently facing this problem. In 2014 I graduated from uni with a Bsc in chemistry (Scotland), tbf my grades were very bad and i scrapped a pass I have since worked in various industrial chemistry jobs. In 2017-2018 I studied 1 year of podiatry and got virtually all As however didn't sit two modules due to working away from home. I left this course as I didn't like the limited scope of work as a podiatrist. 

I would now like to go into infectious diseases and do research. Currently standing I feel my grades are too bad to get into a masters so I feel I would be better to go back and get a stronger undergrad degree. Im just unsure if my chemistry degree will hold me back. Do I have to tell the unis I'm applying to I have a degree already (I'll be paying my own tuition fees anyways) and if i do is there anything I can to make myself a stronger candidate?

460,"Hi! I need advice whether I should confront or just leave my friend group bc i feel like a third wheel. First, I’ve been friends with these two girls for a long time, but I’ve been really close for 2 years. They were close before I came into the group but we knew each other for a long time. I know that I mean to them as a friend (or at least I hope) but I just feel really left out.
Some examples of third wheeling are that when one of them needs advice, I and the other friend always go in depth and help them as best as we can, but when I need advice or help, one of them is like I don’t know, and starts shifting the theme, and the other gives half-ass advice. 
When they have something interesting to tell, they always call each other immediately, and I always find out later, or even never. One doesn’t even call me, she just tells me if she remembers. Also, when I start my interesting story, one of them just listens to it and starts her own story and doesn’t let me finish it.
When they talk there are always cutsie names and nicknames, with me they are almost non-existent. They always hug, cuddle and stuff. 
One lives in the same city as me and sometimes we don’t see each other for a month. 
They talk almost every day, but we sometimes don’t hear from each other for 2 weeks. I made plans with one of them, and we set up a date, and when it came to it she blew me up. 
When I tell them I miss them or that I’m glad that we had seen each other, they are either like aw, or a half-ass me too. They never tell me that they miss me.

474,"As the title states, I’m in a complicated situation. My aunt owns and lives in a house where she let her parents live for the past 8 years. My grandfather has always had a drinking problem and would be emotionally abusive to his wife (her mom) when he would get very drunk. EMT’s and cops have been called before. There was a family tragedy 8 years ago that he never really recovered from, so his drinking got worse. We tried for years to get him help or at least bring him to AA meetings in an effort to correct his behavior. But he was so depressed that he didn’t have any desire to seek help.

Everything finally reached a breaking point last week when my aunt, who was in the hospital for life-long medical issues, decided that she couldn’t take his behavior anymore and said he had better be gone by the time she gets back home. Which legally, is within her right since she owns the property and nothing is in my grandfathers name. My grandmother is distraught and does not agree with this decision, but does not have a say either. She is also not able to take care of herself is reliant on him to do basic daily functions and routines. I hate the fact that he treats her the way he does and have tried to correct that too to no avail, but they both probably only going to live another 5 years or so and still appear to love each other. It’s a fucked up relationship I don’t agree with, but they need each other regardless. My aunt said she’ll call the cops if he comes back.

So now he moved to the city where his friends and family are, but after years of not seeing them and basically burning bridges, no one will let him live with them. He has close to no money, and is relying on the help of old friends to let him stay with them temporarily. He also has been struggling to remember simple things like my name and becomes confused very easily. I think he is mentally deteriorating. So now I have to find a permanent solution.

Although I see her side of the argument, I still can’t believe she kicked out an 85-year-old man with early signs of dementia and no plan whatsoever for where he could go. I have no idea where to start. He would be living on my couch before I let him become homeless. But at this point I’m not able to support him financially and don’t really have any room for him to live with me. So I’ve been researching retirement communities and possible homes for him to live in. But I don’t know what we need to pay for and what can be covered by his social security checks ($1,000 a month) or even be provided by the state of FL to help him find a home. 

It’s a complicated fucked up situation where everyone basically sucks. Now I am the only person who can do something about it. Can someone please give some ideas or websites I can research to help him find a place to live?

If there is a more appropriate sub to post this in, please let me know. 

TLDR: Trying to find a retirement home or community for grandpa to live in so he’s not homeless. What are my options? We live in FL if there is anything the state might be able to do to help.",21Nov2019,1

477,"Using a throwaway account as my fiance knows my main account.
My fiance and I have been together for about 7 years, and I'm at a loss as to what to do regarding his family.
His family is super toxic. A few examples include..
-he recently joined to police force. This is his dream job, has been ever since he was younger. Instead of being happy for him..his mother regularly hits him up with ""job openings"".
-his brother chose drugs over his own 2 kids, so my fiance's mother got custody while my fiance was in high school. My fiance was forced to take care of them so often, they started calling him dad. (They were both 3 and 4.)
-his aunt (who hardly contacts him) recently called to ask if he could come pick up a couch. He told her no, as the only vehicle he had to do so was not insured..he got cussed out.
- his 2 older siblings are currently drug users.

Theres plenty more reasons..but I assume any reader would get the hit. They're all assholes to him and push him down whenever they get the chance. Theres tons of drama in that whole family. I honestly think it would be best if he just stopped talking to them all. Hes distanced himself over the years but he has trouble with this, because they're his blood, and because he was a father figure for so long in his nieces and nephews eyes.
What should we do at this point? I don't want to push him but he doesn't deserve the way they treat him. Is there a good way for him to slowly kick them out of his life?",21Nov2019,1
478,"So, long story short I met a girl... 300 km away, basically in another country.  
And we talked, we exchanged phones numbers and we basically talked for two days straight. We connected (at least from my side) and it seems we have similar moral compasses and same convictions on various debatable topics. Needless to say I felt really attracted to her. Even want to meet her in person sometime soon.

And now all of a sudden it stopped. The last night's conversation ended pleasantly, no reason to believe I f\*\*ked up in some way. 

And I know these feeling I have, these butterflies, is just a form of anxiety.  And I know multiple things could happen, from her getting bored to her data plan having expired.   
What I'm asking of you is to give me some advice of calming this anxiety, because I know this feeling is irrational, but can't get my mind off it and it's stressful! How do I convince my brain it is irrational and it should calm the f\*\*k down?",21Nov2019,1

480,"For the past few years I've been struggling with my identity, but the main thing I'm wrestling with right now is the fact that I am the reason why my life sucks right now.  On paper things are fine (steady job, grad school, etc.), but I feel awful about myself as a person.  It's led to depression and anger, and part of it is me trying to grapple with the fact that I'm the reason why I feel so awful about myself.  Ever since I was a little kid, I've been really into video games.  So much so that I had literally NO interest in anything else hobby-wise, and I did good enough at school that I felt like my life was pretty balanced.  Flash forward to 2019 and I feel like I'm the immature manchild surrounded by people with diverse hobbies interests and passions.  My #1 obstacle in overcoming this is accepting the fact that , while I do still enjoy video games, there are times when they become a crutch.  I want so badly to enjoy video games like I did as a kid that I tend to neglect other things (playing video games to relax instead of practicing guitar for example).  It's hard because it makes me think that instead of just adding new hobbies to my plate, I also need to make an active effort to start leaving video games behind, which is frustrating because I don't want to admit that I have any kind of problem with it.  Gaming doesn't get in the way of my basic functionality (work, school, etc.), but its my only real hobby/joy when I have free time, which makes me a boring person, which makes me frustrated and envious of other more attractive people, but the idea of giving up video games frustrates me to no end, leaving me where I already am and the cycle repeats.

481,"I’ve been in a committed relationship for over 2 years at this point. I love her very much and we’ve even talked about possibly being engaged by Christmas of next year about 3 or so months ago. However recently I haven’t been feeling the love as strongly as I was before the about two months ago. We recently moved into a new apartment together, our second together, and it’s cause a lot of strain on our relationship. Her workplace has also become very toxic to her and she would leave already if it wasn’t full time but the stress of trying to find someplace else before leaving has made her almost unbearable to deal with as she takes out her stress in being easily angered and frustrated at the tiniest things. Granted I have my own issues to work through and have the occasional bad mood day but for her it’s almost something new everyday and I do my best to make the day better for her but she tends to push me away and find things to blame me for then to accept my attempts. She’s not abusive and she apologizes profusely once she realizes she’s been taking her anger out on others but it’s almost everyday at this rate. She herself has anxiety dealing with some things and I try my best to be there and uplift her but it seems more days than not that I’m not helping.

What makes my issues a little more difficult is with the issues at home I’ve found myself somewhat... falling for a coworker. I’ve been at my current job for several months and my coworker a little less than I but any day we share the same shift are probably my better days. She’s a lot of fun to talk to and I think about her a lot. We’ve got more in common than I ever had with most people and (I hate to admit this) but she fits my “type” more than my current girlfriend. (I don’t really believe personally that having a type should dictate who you pursue but I have acknowledged their is a “look” I find more attractive than others.) She also has been pretty helpful st taking my
Mind off the job (retail work is hell this time of year). She’s about to take a leave for a month or so so I won’t see her through the holidays and I’m afraid if these feelings I think I’m developing are more than a crush it will just add to the depression being brought on by my issues at home. I know there’s also been no real expression of anything she has toward me but idk if it’s because I’ve mentioned my gf or my gf will visit to see me most days, but that doesn’t really keep me from having thoughts of her throughout the day even with my S/O around.

So generally I guess I’m asking, what should I do? I’m already in a committed relationship but acknowledge that there have been fewer good days than bad and I’m afraid my feelings are going from my girlfriend to coworker.",21Nov2019,1

483,"So I had been friends with this girl for three years, the first year we met, there was established interest between us but it never went furthing than kissing. This year we had a stronger thing where we were basically dating. We go in this cycle where we are a thing for a week or two then she says we need to slow down or stop as she’s not ready for a relationship because of her last relationship where the guy cheated on her and always blamed her for their problems.


She tells me about it and he did some awful things to her. As her friend I told her she should see a therapist about it as she mentioned it to me. Every time she gets drunk she always texts me saying “she needs me” or wants to cuddle and talk about why she is sad. It hurts to see her this sad over her ex and also hurts to not be dating her as we get along so well but I know the time isn’t right. We talked everyday but she says we should spend time less 1 on 1. Still she texts me whenever she is feeling sad about her ex and is worried about anything. I don’t what to do as every time our relationship is looking up she gets upset over her ex and tells me more about what happened with that. 

On my birthday we went to the bars together, she talked to him for the first time since they broke up earlier that time, and then started crying in line and then when I tried to cheer her up she got angry at me. Later that night she came to my room crying looking to talk to me about it. She later apologized for both things as she said she was drunk.


I really like this girl but she has lead me on three times now and I want to be a good friend here and help get over her past relationship but it’s also hard because I want to start a relationship with her so it’s a conflicted interest in me saying things like she should see a therapist.",21Nov2019,1
484,"Hello everyone, hope that I’m posting this in the right place! 

Long story short, for this month, I created a self imposed fitness challenge similar to Sober October to coincide with the “No Nut November” trend that has been popular the last couple of years. Both of those challenges have been going great, and I feel great! But... there’s one part which I’m conflicted on. 

I chose that as a part of this challenge that I would cut off all alcohol consumption - as someone who does not really ever drink, this has also been really easy and great for my diet. With that said, some of my best friends invited me to a party to watch one of my favourite sporting events on my recommendation. And, they are going to  have and provide drinks. This is huge because in my friend group, I am really the only sporty guy, so I often try to plan events such as this to no avail as they generally aren’t interested. Obviously I’m super stoked about this, and I would LOVE to enjoy some drinks with the guys, but it would violate my rules for my challenge. 

So what I’m asking is..... should I break my own self imposed rules to enjoy this event with some drinks? The rest of the challenge I of course am going to continue, that part hasn’t changed. But... as much as I want to do this, I also feel like I would be disappointed in myself for making a challenge just to fail it when I’m SO CLOSE to being done. I also have already on multiple occasions this month gone to parties and been the sober guy (which is great for the others cause I drive everybody’s drunk asses home lol) and I’ve still had lots of fun.

I'm 22 years old and graduated from college in August. I've been living at home with my parents, but due to a situation I would rather not discuss, I can't live under the same roof as my parents any longer. I'm currently employed, though looking for another job because my current one isn't the best. I'm currently making roughly $14.90 an hour after taxes.

I have a girlfriend who's appartment I'm planning to move into. I would be splitting rent with her. In a worst case scenario I could move into my sister's house in a city roughly an hour away which would likely be free or very cheap.

In terms of transportation I've been driving a car owned by my parents. It's been stated that I would be paying to have the car retitled in my name soon, which still may happen, though I wouldn't count on at the moment. Unfortunately, given where I would potentially be living and working I would need a car as public transportation would be out of the question.

In terms of health insurance, I'm currently on my parents policy. I will be kicked off at the end of the year due to complications with my father's retirement insurance policy and was planning to move to my mother's, but I doubt this will be the case now. My job offers health benefits, though they aren't the best.

I'm currently on my parent's phone plan which it was expected for me to start paying for. I don't want to stay connected to them financially and would like to start paying for myself. I currently own outright a Samsung galaxy s7 edge and have Verizon as a provider. What would my options be? Would I be able to take over this phone and my phone number to another service?

My girlfriend and I will be going to my parents house tonight to get some of my stuff. I'm planning on getting clothing including all of my professional clothes, stuff that's important to me including books, as well as documentation including my passport and passport card. I've been told that with my passport I can get a replacement birth certificate and social security card. Is there anything else? At some point I will have to go back, I dont believe I can get everything in as brief of a trip this will wind up being.

I appreciate you reading this far and apologize if there's any potentially useful information I've excluded. I'm trying to be somewhat vague so no one can determine exactly who I am, but will try to answer some questions that I've overlooked in the comments.

Thank you and I wish you all the best.",21Nov2019,1

Right now I have my hair cut boy short and dyed a very light blonde. My natural color is a dirty blonde, and I have a lot of roots coming in.

However, I really want my hair to be purple/pink/orange or all the fun colors. I used to do it all the time before I worked here, and I’m starting to really miss it.

I’d be using Overtone to color it, which is a semipermanent color depositing conditioner. 

My plan is to buy a normal wig to wear to work every day so I can do what I want with my hair. I’m just worried that after wearing a wig all day, my hair will be greasy and matted when I take it off, which would defeat the purpose of the whole thing.

The email starts by revealing a password that I know I’ve used in the past, and states that if I don’t pay 1,200 in bitcoin that they will post my personal info or pictures or whatever on social media accounts, dark net, etc. 

Honestly, I wasn’t too concerned about it initially, because I don’t really use many forms of social media besides Reddit and instagram occasionally and I kind of thought it was a scare tactic scam. I barely have 1,200 to my name so I couldn’t pay it even if I was naive enough to do so, but now I keep getting security emails from different accounts I have, such as my Microsoft account, play station account, and most recently, my ICloud was locked because someone tried to log in from Ontario, and I’m starting to get concerned. 

I kinda hoped ignoring this would make it disappear, but now I’m wondering if there’s something I should be doing or somewhere I should report this. I’m kind of at a loss of what to do. I don’t even remember most of my passwords to go in and change accounts I’m no longer active.

493,"Throwaway because my friends know my other profile.

So, I am a pretty opinionated person. I'm generally very kind, and my opinions are generally always positive and to me they don't seem controversial or ""bad"". For example, one of my most valued opinions are about that I don't want to judge others and treat everyone fairly as long as they don't do me or someone else any harm. 

So it's not like I am an asshole in my values, but I have to admit that I can be a bit of an asshole in regards to how I express my opinions. I ALWAYS talk about my opinions, any opportunity I am given. I always have to have something to say about everything, and I am decently educated and like learning and reading articles so I feel like I also always actually do have something to say in any situation and when I don't say it, I feel awful.

Recently I have noticed that my friends are always quick to change the subject once I start really getting into an opinion. I don't know if they have always done this and I am just noticing it or if they have just started doing it now. But they cut me off, stop responding to anything I say regarding my opinion and start talking about something else completely. From this I think it is clear that constantly hearing about my detailed opinions is not something they appreciate, otherwise they would not change the subject.

So here is my question: how do I stop being so opinionated? It bothers my friends, and it bothers me that I am doing something that bothers them. But I don't know how to change this in myself. How do I respond to questions or news articles they bring up without writing a short essay on how I feel? I just want to be enjoyable company.",21Nov2019,1

495,"I’m currently a freshman in college and majoring in computer science. Outside of school, I work part time at a retail store (typically 17-21 hours depending how the hours line up) Lately, I’ve been considering this paid program that my local police department has geared towards college students that also grants tuition assistance (it would cover my entire four years). Essentially I’d be doing administrative work for them part-time and physical training once a month, while they work it around my class schedule. The only trade off here is that I’d have to stay with the program the entire four years of college (as they will be paying) and after I graduate college, I’d have to take a promotional exam to become a police officer in which I’ll be required to serve for at least two years. Cops in my city are paid pretty decently, even starting. 

The problem here though lies that I wouldn’t be able to do internships for my major while in this program (as that is usually an important component before going into the field) because I’d be working at this program. Though, my ultimate goal/dream job is not even in the tech field but rather a specific job in the public sector that I’ve been wanting since I was a kid. I’ve been starting to seriously think about going into this program because

So, I’m wrapping up my third semester at university. It’s really melancholic, and, honestly, I’m a bit sad right now. I’ve really loved some of my courses and professors. 

This kind of ties into a worry I have right now. So, I have three professors who I would say are really my favorites. They also seem to get along very well with students. 

I know that networking is important in college, and in general I’d kind of just like to be able to converse with them and talk about topics in general, which they’re open to from what I’ve seen and which other students do.

So I guess I’m just asking, how do these other students wind up forming such positive relationships with their professors? Mine seem to like me, and I do well, but I rarely find that I’m really talking to them or like I’m comfortable naturally forming those sorts of connections?

I hope that that makes sense. These kinds of problems are always persistent for me; I have autism, and am in general just socially awkward and don’t always have the right words; I never really formed positive relationships with my teachers in high school either, even though a lot of my friends and classmates naturally seemed to, and in general I just — I want to be one of those students?",21Nov2019,1

We've talked for 7 days (not consecutively) and we've already discussed about all the the possible arguments (music, life goals, travels, hobbies, passions, etcetera...). I really can't think about something else to talk about, she even seems a pretty shy girl so she doesn't talk that much even tho she said she likes to talk with me.

I already asked her out and she agreed but not now since she is studying for the driving license and she is pretty busy.

I would really like to talk with her as much as possible, but we talked about most of the things and apart of asking her how life is going and what did she do during her day I don't have any other arguments, can someone help me?

Thanks in advance!

506,"    I will apologize ahead of time because this post is extremely long. 
     I am now almost done with my first semester of my junior year in college. It is definitely the time to decide “what do I want to do after graduation?” To answer some of y’all’s questions. I want to be a medical examiner (forensic pathologist). I know I have to go to medical school, but I want to go to graduate school to work as a medical examiner assistant or an autopsy technician. Either way, when I do get my medical degree, I have some kind of experience working with autopsies. 
     This lies the problem...to be a medical examiner assistant (pathologist assistant), you have to be ASCP certified (at least in my state). To do that, you have to go specific school (none are in my state, so I have to go out of state) to even be able to apply for the job. The thing is I found a school near family which is good, but the school is a Christian school. I’m an atheist...how am I gonna get accepted?! The other schools, I have no family. But there were two schools in Canada. Their interview questions are based on faith...something I don’t have. 
     However, to be a autopsy technician, I don’t necessarily have to go to graduate school, but there are NO jobs available in my state. All of the jobs available in my state are medical examiner assistant jobs. And the thing is if I move out of my state I might have more and better  opportunities. The problem is I can barely afford to take care of myself now. How will I do that out of the state?!
     My question really is what should I do? I’m running into a lot of problems with this. I know that this path would be hard but not this hard. Should I just move out of my state (with a job of course!)? Should I even go to grad school if I get the job as an autopsy technician? What should I do?",21Nov2019,1

510,"Last week she took her staring to the max and was holding eye contact with me for a very long time, without breaking eye contact and also smilling. She did this repeatedly. Her friend also acts weird and whispers something to her when I look at her. If instead she herself notices it, she looks down and smiles to herself. Later that day in class (college) she was sitting few rows ahead of me and she'd turn completely back to face me and stare while smilling. She'd stare for a long time, that is until I noticed her and looked back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the bad part. She's not very consistent with this and seems to fully ignore me and close up other times. She's very shy but also a severe attention-seeker. Would an attention-seeker do these things just for the sake of attention? She usually chooses to sit behind or in front of me. She also takes flirty glances to a lot of people and that hurts a lot. I might give up on her, even if she's really cute and sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

 I found her going very slow after class, buried in her phone with nobody else around. I talked to her and I don't know. She was talkative, it was very positive. The first time I talked to her, her eyes actually widened and got quite large, as if surprised. She had some of that wideness on her eyes on our second talk as well. She's just extremely closed off and goes complete ignore mode when I'm close but didn't seem bothered that I went up to talk to her. She couldn't keep much of eye contact, despite full on staring other times and keeping it while smilling. I can't be sure if she's using me for attention. We talked briefly for 2 times, should I just straight out ask her to get drinks after class and be certain for sure? Is it odd to ask that since we talked very little?",21Nov2019,1

I have a friend that I've been friends with for about 5 or 6 years now. We used to hang out at the very least weekly, if not every couple of days. We would always do Christmas together, always go to the movies, hang out, go shopping, go on adventures together. We were best friends, you know? In the middle of last year, however, my friend got a new DND group together which I wasn't invited to that he hangs out withmy friend got a new d&amp;d group together which I wasn't invited to that he hangs out with weekly. We hang out maybe once every few months, if that. Every time we try to hang out with this friend, they are doing something fun, just not with us. For example we invited them over to go and get some food at the local brewery and this friend told us that they're actually going out to the movies to see a brand new movie with some coworkers... like just telling us about something fun they are doing without inviting me at all

517,"I feel abandoned by my best friend. We'll call her ""A"".

I am 22F, she is 22F. 

We grew up together in southern NH (next door neighbors). We've known &amp; been BFF's with each other since I was 3. When I was 10, my parents divorced and I chose to move to MA with my mom. My dad stayed in my childhood home for several years after divorce, so I still saw A frequently. Eventually, he moved about 30 minutes away, so I only got to see her about once or twice a year. I was fine with this because we kept in touch when we had something to talk about. We did fun stuff together every summer (like Six Flags or Funspot). We were happy with this and got along great. 

This was consistent until about two years ago. A called me to tell me she was pregnant. I was the first one she told. I hate kids myself, so I asked if she was going to keep it, and when she said yes, I was disappointed, but didn't tell her. I did say that I was worried for her career goals though, but she assured me the father was very supportive and there wasn't a chance he'd leave her, and that she was still going to pursue her career. A gave birth to a baby girl last April. I've met her BF once at her baby shower. He seemed like a great guy, and A seems genuinely happy with him and her daughter, and I'm happy for her. I'm glad she found a loving man and has a healthy family. She is still pursuing her career and all-in-all doing great for herself. I couldn't be more happy for her.

However, A doesn't talk to me anymore. We're still friends on FB, and I keep up with her infrequent posts and chat with her in passing in the comments sometimes. The last time I saw her was shortly after her daughter was born. It's been probably about a year and a half. Her daughter is walking now. When I last saw her, she couldn't move her head on her own yet. I've tried calling her multiple times, but I always get voicemail. I've left several, but never get callbacks. I've messaged her both over FB and text, and I almost always get left on read. I've asked to hang out (me going there or her coming to me (I still live in Boston, she lives in Derry)) more times than I can count, but she either doesn't answer or something comes up on my end. My mom (who A has known her whole life and gets along with great) loves kids and would more than happily watch A's daughter if A came down here.

IMO, kids aren't an excuse to have your whole life and friendships come grinding to a halt. I miss A. I've told her that, many times. I have been nothing but gracious and understanding about A being busy. I've never been rude about it, and we've never fought about it. In A's defense, she works full-time, and when she isn't working, she's taking care of her daughter. I understand that she has her hands full, but I can't help feeling ignored and ghosted. I work two F/T jobs and am a F/T college student, and I ALWAYS return calls and texts from my friends, and I still do my best to make time for them. If I can, in my mind, so can she. I don't know how to approach her about how I feel abandoned, ignored, and like I never mattered to her. She has said she misses me too, but the words feel empty and hallow when there's no action on her part to follow up on those sentiments. I don't need to talk to her every day, or even every month. I would just appreciate it if she would have the courtesy of at least calling or texting me back when I reach out. I would appreciate it if she would try to spend SOME time together with me, even if it's once a year (which is fine! we know each other pretty well and if we were to hang out too often we'd have nothing to talk about).

Does anyone have any advice on how I should approach this situation?

Thank you.

519,"I got into a deal and I'm struggling to figure out if I'm being ripped off, or if I'm doing the ripping off. Since the deal was with a family member it's vital I know. I'm okay at math and logic but maybe I'm being biased and not seeing the full picture. I need a logically minded person to help me and be honest with me. 

In 2014 I bought a house for $92,000 that was valued at $128,000. The reason I got a discount was the deal allowed for the person living in the house to keep living in the house indefinitely. Let's get into the math:

Original discount (128k - 92k) of $36,000.

I pay property tax and home insurance which totals $200/month. Over 6 years the total I've paid is $14,400.

I pay rent while i wait for the house to become mine. $1050/month x 72 months = $75,600.

The family member pays me $300/month as part of the deal.  $300 x 72 months = $21,600

It seems to me that I'm getting ripped off. My total expenses are $90,000 while the payments and discount only total to $57,600. 

The house is now valued at $152,000. Should I be considering the discount as $60,000 or should I consider the value of the house at the time of purchase? Is there any flaw in my logic of how much I'm losing?

There’s a really cute picture of us and I want to recreate it. But my uncle is also really picky with presents. In previous years it was safe to just get him a sweater and he was happy but this year he said he had too many clothes. He also has been known to re-gift or put a gift in his garage if he doesn’t like it. My boyfriend called me out because I said “I’m working on a painting that will match the aesthetic of his garage” and that made me think I’m putting a lot more weight on this then I wanted to.

522,"My girlfriend, and I have been dating for around a year and a half. One of her bestfriends, which is a guy, doesn't like me. 

He is very eccentric, outgoing, and loud. He is a bit of an awkward person to be around since he doesn't seem to understand social cues the best. Everyone just lets him be himself, even though it may be a struggle to be around him sometimes. I'm quieter and introverted, so I definitely don't enjoy his personality too much. I'm nice to him and try to joke around, but when I go home at the end of the night, it's a breath of fresh air. 

Overall, I would say that he tries really hard to be cool, to the point where I get put off from him. If he is around anyone that he deems cool, he'll immediately adopt their mannerisms and start picking up their hobbies. For example, he moved to California where he met some ""surfer"" talking people. He immediately adopted their partying habits, slang, mannerisms. It's almost like he has no self and just bounces off other people's personalities. 

Anyways. We've both always been nice to each other in person. It's the little things that my girlfriends tells me that he said that pisses me off.  For example:

-He calls me a basic whiteboy. This is because I'm not obsessed with star wars or some shit. And that I'm not some eccentric, outgoing dude.

- He says that I try to be Alpha, and that next time I do it, he is going to try turn it on me or something. This one makes me laugh. I don't care about being alpha in the least. I'm a quiet dude who happened to be blessed with good height, appearance, and an athletic body- I do workout, too. He's always saying that I look like a frat dude, act like a frat dude, but hate other frats dudes. Again, it's like hes hung up about on how I look or some arbitrary group that I fit into based on some of my personality and appearance. Only frat thing I do is drink lol. 

 He is a shorter dude who has body issues (mentally), but he is stockier. I won't lie, he's a good looking dude with a built body, but he's just short. I think part of his issue is that he has never had a gf, and no matter how hard he tries, he can't get one...which is most likely due to his eccentric personality. 

Beyond that, he is the one who is always trying to seem alpha. For example, he's coming back for Christmas, and we are all getting together. My girlfriend mentioned to him that he can't break anything at her house when he comes over. He replied by saying he can promise that, but he can't promise he won't break anyone. I don't know. That just sounds funny to me. He was also bragging about how he wanted to bring some drugs to really liven up the place. 


Anyways. The dudes a good dude; however, I'm starting to get very irritated. I talk to my girlfriend on the phone everyday (out of state for college) and I'll ask her how her day was. On days where she talked to this dude, I'll get super irritated. It's always her saying that he said ""this"" about me or ""this"". I'm frustrated that he says that shit about me. I'm frustrated that my girlfriend keeps telling me things without having a reason behind it. It's like she just tells me to see how I react. And I'm frustrated the she doesn't get frustrated with her friend or defend me.

530,"I previously posted this on r/legaladvice but I realized the bulk of my worries are not legal but perhaps just in need of general advice. Here is my post: 

I need all the advice I can get on this because I am scared and panicking slightly.

Background: My parents are incredibly emotionally and mentally manipulative/abusive. I spent years of high school in extremely poor mental health and was constantly depressed. They have also physically abused me for years, using things like riding crops and hangers to punish me as young as 8-10. The physical abuse continued into middle school/high school where my mother had beat me a few times, to say the least. This, in turn, spawned pathologies within me that can be related to the many abusive relationships I have been in, where I was subservient and saw that as normal. Fast forward, this year my partner struck me and I had to remove him from our lease, which my father is the guarantor of. After I was struck I took a solid two months to genuinely consider my position in my relationship with my family, and I knew I needed to demand better treatment for myself. Today, I demanded better treatment for myself. I told them that their constant hostility/berating me does nothing for my mental health, especially when I am living healthily and doing well in school.

Here is where I need legal advice. I am 19, a sophomore in college, and I need to get away from these people. They are telling me that they will pull me out of my school ASAP, and send me to a college in California instead (where they live now) simply because I demanded they stop the constant harassment. I simply **cannot mentally take it anymore.** Not only that, but they are threatening to call the police if I go to my partner's home in Brooklyn, because they track my location. I am going home to Thanksgiving on Tuesday, and I am worried that they will freeze my bank account and cancel my plane ticket home, trapping me there effectively. Here are the ways in which they control me still, I need help on how to make these my own and independent legally:

1. **Bank account** \-- my bank account is under my father's name. It has literally $9 in it (they don't give me much to work with anyways) so I am not too worried about them seizing my very few assets. What I am worried about is how I can pursue my own bank account, without a credit score or previously independent account.
2. **Apartment** \-- my dad is the guarantor on my apartment. I am worried he will simply stop paying rent and I will be blacklisted in NYC for not paying rent, and I'll never be able to rent again. I do have an option if I truly become homeless, but it will be temporary and I will eventually be able to split rent with a ridiculous amount of roommates and 2 jobs (well, that's the goal, at least). My question is, how do I break lease on my own and avoid my dad from completely fucking me?
3. **Tuition** \-- they pay my tuition. I am ready to accept the fact that they are retracting support of my education in NYC and I am fully ready to invest in a CUNY here on my own time.
4. **Phone bill** \-- any suggestions on an affordable phone bill with a small monthly limit would be good. I don't use my phone very often so I won't need something extravagant. I'll be researching this on my own time but if anyone has suggestions I couldn't be more thankful
5. **Plane tickets** \-- I am supposed to fly home on Tuesday for Thanksgiving. I am worried that once I am there they will freeze my bank account and cancel my 2nd ticket home. I am planning on not getting on that plane because I will be trapped in California.

I have endured serious mental and emotional abuse for nearly a decade, and suffered the effects of it in full. I need to get away from these people and secure my own future before I don't have one at all. I will be speaking to the resources at my university ASAP on this.

If anyone else has advice on this or has also endured something similar, I am begging you to offer anything you can. I am fully prepared to go the distance and completely sever myself from my family, and I need to know how to go about it. I am slightly freaking out but I will take all considerations into account.

Her mom is usually around to help her and has this stuff that she needs to eat and heart rate monitors. She tells us that her mother is mean to her and says all these rude things to her and makes her hate herself. 
Recently we went on a school overnight trip for 3 days and her mom was our chaperone. Throughout the whole trip she was crying about how mean her mom is. I was there. Her mom never said anything out of context or anything. I know I wasn’t next to her all the time or anything and I couldn’t possibly know everything, but it just seems like she’s making up part of it. We’re all in band together and she plays the bassoon. No offense to bassoon’s out there, but your music is not hard compared to what flutes and clarinets and trumpets gotta play. And this is all high school level. If you’re in band, its level AA pieces here. Every time we talk about band and how our parts (me and our other friend) are hard, she starts complaining about reading the damn bass clef. I’ve played piano for years, it’s really not that hard and when I say that she moves on to other parts of the bassoon she says is hard. I offered to learn once and she shot me down quick. As if it weren’t true and it would be easy to learn. She acted like she was hiding something. She tells us how much anxiety she has all the time and if we don’t acknowledge it, she’ll make sure we don’t forget. But that’s not the main problem. She told us a while ago that she has dissociative personality disorder. That she hears other people in her head and basically that she has multiple personalities. She had 3 voices at the time.
Our friend group is 3 people. It’s a close knit friend group, and she recently started to date this other friend. After they started dating and K just so happens to find out that there are three more personalities and one of the original ones died off. So now, there’s a grand total of 5. We’ve never ever seen these personalities in action. She claims it’s because she never lets them “front” or take control, because she’s afraid of what they’ll do. Though once she claims one of the voices named “Vader” (Hes an angry personality and doesn’t take crap from anyone) fronted before over text. It just seemed like her. There’s no proof or anyone that what she’s saying is true. She hasn’t told her mom because she’s afraid of her mom. And she won’t get it confirmed by a doctor. I think it’s all fake. At this point, I’ve put up with so much of her crap, and she keeps adding more onto it. It can’t be real. There’s no evidence. I mentioned this to her once and she broke down and cried and our other friend (her gf) told me I was out of line and to stop accusing her, that I was becoming her mother. Ever since I suspected her, a week since that confrontation, I feel like she senses that I know she’s faking it. K only talks to our other friend (her gf) now and pretends like I’m not here. She doesn’t say anything to me anymore because she knows if I say anything that’s too true, she’ll lose all the attention she’s currently receiving. I know for a fact that K is obsessed with attention. She doesn’t outrightly say it, but all her actions lead to me to assume so.

I feel like maybe I’m overreacting to this, but I also feel like this is too much to be real. I don’t really know what to do anymore. They’re my friends, but it seems like K has brainwashed my other friend into believing all this crap. Everything’s always about K, and when it’s not, she makes sure it is again.
Please help me, I want to know if I’m right or wrong in this situation.",21Nov2019,1

535,"I made a post on r/Tinder for a conversation that I thought was funny. In a nutshell, the message thread was about how the person was far from me, and they meant to type ""You're extremely far tho"", but instead typed ""You're extremely fat tho"". I laughed it off at the end, and decided to post it on Reddit, despite the fact that they told me they didn't want me to (which, yes, I realize now was a giant breach of trust on my part).

And I was inconsiderate and did not cross out their info. Because of this, they then got harassing messages from so many people, and basically had their identity released to the general public. They had messaged me shortly after, and was blowing up my phone saying how I had betrayed her trust (which, I will fess up to the fact that I did). They had received hurtful messages from people.

They were extremely upset at me, and justifiably so. And now, I feel guilty for it (as I should). I repeatedly apologized to this person, took the post down, and all the others where I had made this mistake.

So my question is: how do I get over this guilt? I very, very badly want to, need to, and will eventually have to, but right now, I don't know if I deserve to. I know I did a bad thing, and have learned from it, and will apply these lessons I learned to future interactions. I just want Reddit's advice on how to move on and not feel guilty anymore.

Thanks to you all in advance :)",21Nov2019,1
536,"Okay so the backstory is I've known my old friend, lets call her Sammy, for over a decade. We grew really close due to similar health issues and confided in each other about everything going on in our lives. We were supporting each other through extremely difficult times. Then cut to earlier this year, she did some things that were very hurtful that made me question our entire friendship. I came to the conclusion that I needed a break from her and she agreed it would be a good idea to have a 'time out' so to speak. We saw each other in August and I was gentle but clear that I still needed time and she hadn't really respected that as she had continued to contact me and even sent chocolates as a peace offering and apology. Of course I appreciated this but didn't feel she understood that I wanted space.

I have found that I **don't** miss our friendship for the most part and its now been a long time of not having her around me which I feel has given me room to breathe. I do feel loyalty towards her though and I still care about her wellbeing as I have know her a long time. I hadn't been the one to contact her since the initial incident between us so I felt I needed to let her know that I do still care about her. I emailed her asking how she was doing and we had a brief, casual chat via email. A few days later she sends me a long email about wanting to heal the friendship and open the doors of communication again as she feels that we can 'get through this'. I don't particularly want her close to me again and I can't picture us being friends anytime soon. 

I can't tell if I am being cold and closed off or just certain of how I *don't* want to be treated. Sammy has made it clear that the incident affected her a lot and so has the distance between us (whereas I have found the space to be refreshing). 

I have no idea how to convey this to her without repeating myself and my need for time away from the friendship. I don't want to hurt her at all but everything that's happened between us has highlighted how suffocated I felt in the friendship and other issues that I don't need in my life especially when its coming from someone I'm close to. I don't know if I will want to come back at some point and rebuild a connection at some point or not. 

**Any advice would be appreciated on how to handle the situation**. Sammy has been through a lot and I of course want to be as compassionate as possible here.",21Nov2019,1
537,"I’m trying to get advice on if I will later regret leaving the cushy job, with good benefits, solid job security, that I really just sit at my desk and play on my phone or computer for 5-6 hours most days. For a job that would pay $15-20k more, but wouldn’t have the benefits, the job security, and the stress/workload would be, well existent. I’d hate to leave the cushy job for a higher paying one, just to resize my mistake later and regret it. 

Basically I have an Associates, a Bachelors, and a minor in engineering. I’ve worked at my job for 2.5 years, have 3 weeks paid vacation, company pays full Heath insurance, offer an IRA, and I am the only one in the office most of the time, I learned my job from the guy who was here for 50+yrs so if I get fired they wouldn’t have anyone to bring the new guy up to speed as the owner doesn’t fully know the ins and outs of my job. I make roughly the national average and I live comfortably right AT my means, but everything I make goes out. 

Now, I could find a job that makes $15k-20k more a year, but it would be much more structured, more pressure with less benefits and it would be 5+years before I got my paid vacation back to where it is now. Not to mention that if the economy changes or my performance isn’t up to snuff that I could find my self without a job at all. 

For the amount of schooling I’ve done, and the loans I have I’m slightly frustrated that I have a job and paycheck that I could’ve had without any of the schooling or loans. But I also don’t really do much most days besides browse reddit and collect a paycheck. I know that this could just be the grass is always greener kinda thing.

544,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively.

545,"In February I adopted two barn cats. They were friendly enough but still scared of people. My goal was to acclimate them to being house cats, and it was working. I only had them for a week. 

Well in March I was admitted to the hospital and my niece, who was watching my cats, let them out. I haven't seen them since, that was in March. Until today. A girl about 17 years old. Posted on Facebook saying that she's had an all black male cat all summer. She had him neutered and ""adopted"" him. And just now, is looking for his home. And although she's made it VERY VERY clear that she really doesn't want to get rid of him, she's just now trying to find his original home. 


I know that that is my cat, I've sent video after video but after every video she still says she needs more ""proof"".  I don't know what other proof I can give her. The vet wouldnt give him a microchip until he was in better shape. When we got him he was very skinny and it was the middle of winter, his coat then was so much bigger than it would be now.  He was fairly young when we got him. I sent her a video where he was meowing in it, and she said that it's still not him. Then she would say, he has a high pitched meow. That's exactly what he was doing. And she's sent back videos and I know, I just know that it's him. But I don't know how to prove it to her like she wants me to. She's made it clear that she doesn't want to get rid of him and has jumped through every hoop imaginable to make it her who has to decide wether it is my cat or not. 

I don't feel like fighting a 17 year old. But my whole day has been emotionally draining. I went from being so excited that he was my cat, to so mad because Everytime I try to ""prove it"" she would say ""nope, that's not him"".

547,"I don’t want to elaborate too much because my work situation takes up way too much of my energy as it is. Basically, per some of my previous posts in other subs, I was struggling a little bit with learning fast in my new role. I think in the meantime I’ve caught up rapidly and I’m very proud of my progress. 

The downside is that the atmosphere with my colleagues keeps getting worse. I am feeling ostracized and it’s not getting better. I tried to give everyone the benefit of the doubt since I’m brand new and entering a place everyone has an established bond, but I can see lately it’s not improving. If anything, it’s just getting more difficult and I’m finding myself becoming withdrawn because they completely ignore me, or make me feel like an idiot. 

I rarely ask any questions anymore - only occasionally when really needed, and when I do, the smiles disappear off my coworkers faces and their tone becomes darker. Of they exchange a long glance with each other before replying to me. I’m not asking dumb questions, I know because usually they have to think hard about what the proper answer is too before they can tell me. If they’re conversing happily, and I try to gently join in, I get COMPLETELY ignored, so I’ve overall stopped trying...what’s the point if they blow me off and don’t want to listen? 

For example also, today I ran a little late to work because I got something in my eye as I was leaving the house - I was only about fifteen minutes late (I did text a coworker to inform them I was running a bit behind) and it got treated like I neglected to tell my boss I was intending on being very late? Someone texted her to tell her I wasn’t at work, when I was already at my desk and clocked in? I just don’t know. I’ve also been criticized for my introverted nature which blows my mind, because I don’t see how that has anything to do with my job performance (if anything it’s helped because they get distracted socializing while I actively assist customers...)

I acknowledge I am a sensitive person, but I have been working SO hard to develop a tougher skin and overlook all of this. It’s becoming very difficult. I can’t just leave this place and look for another because overall I love the job, and I need the benefits. But I can’t accept the way my team treats me. I’ve tried to be nice and friendly and I get shut down. I’m amazed because generally, in my life, I haven’t had trouble getting along with others, and I’m pretty easygoing.

I've been trying to change things and read all these books on how to turn your life around and for a moment I believed that I was in power to change it but there's only so much i can do. The only thing holding me back is my mom and I know she loves me. We lost dad and it's extremely hurtful to realize how bad she's gonna suffer if I do this but deep down I already know I'm going to.

552,"I’m a 15 year old girl. I’m Arab and my parents are immigrants. I was born and raised in America. Theyre both Muslim. I’m an atheist. 

I’m homeschooled. I haven’t spoken to someone that wasn’t my parents in months. Not even a cashier. Nobody. I’m barred from the outside world. My home is a prison. 

I have 4 friends I can text. I might have a short conversation with them once every few weeks. One of them I talk to weekly though. (She just talks about her problems to me). So I don’t have anybody I can talk to. Nobody is there for me.

I’m in 10th grade right now. I’ve maintained a 4.0 GPA all throughout my highschool life. My grades are pretty good, my lowest being a 94. Studying is all I can occupy myself with. 

I normally don’t argue with my dad because he’s about as conservative as you can get. He turns every single word about Allah and Islam. I don’t fucking care. Even when I talked about how dumb it was to believe the earth is flat, he told me “it doesn’t matter, the earth being flat won’t affect your ability to worship Allah”

I asked my dad to let me go to a real school during my junior year. He got really mad. He told me “people date in public schools. dating is a sin.”

So that means I should be barred from ever seeing another human being? I’m not going to date. I don’t care if other people do it. I’m not even Muslim. I just want to see people. I want to have a friend. 

He told me “girls even have girlfriends”. Oh no. Gay people exist. How could this be. I’m not allowed to breathe near a gay person. Jokes on him. I like girls and boys.

I’ll be 16-17 next year. But apparently I’m “too young” to be in that environment. I’m too young to go to highschool. I’m too young to be near people my age. I’m so lonely. He always tells me how I don’t need friends. It’s his fucking fault for raising me in America. I have American ideals. I believe in marriage equality, religious freedom, women’s rights, etc,.

He thinks Americans are all evil and I need to be an ADULT to be around American teenagers. He’s robbing me of my teenage years. I’m so fucking lonely. 

We argued about highschool. I’m going to be 16-17. I’m old enough to be around people my age. He told me in a fit of rage “get out of my house. i don’t want you to live with me anymore.”

I responded with “I’m old enough to get kicked out but not old enough to go to highschool”

He got so mad and told me I have an attitude problem. My attitude. That’s the real problem. It’s not the fact I haven’t spoken to a human being in months and months. It’s been 6 months. I can’t live with him. I wish he’d kick me out. 

All I want is to go to a good highschool. I want to strive to get straight As. I want to go to MIT. I want to become an engineer. I really am trying my best to make my dreams come true. 

I have to wear the hijab. As in a full on black dress. I’m not allowed to wear pants or knee length dresses. I can’t wear ankle length socks. I can’t video call my friends because I’m a girl. I was willing to go to a school wearing a full hijab. It took me so long to even CONSIDER going out dressed like a trash bag. I was proud of myself for mustering the courage to think of going to a school. But i should’ve known how my dad is. He doesn’t care. 

I can’t live on my own. I can’t go to a college I want. My dad doesn’t want to even allow me to apply to Harvard. I’ll never escape. My only solution is marriage. But Arab marriages are backwards. You meet a stranger and marry them after one conversation. That’s why my parents marriage is so broken. 

My mom hates my dad. She always tells me how she wishes he died. He never gave her a wedding or gold (arab tradition). He never bought her a house. My dad complains to me about my mom for hours on end. And my mom complains to me about him. 

After our argument about school, my dad sold my phone. That’s what he always does when he’s mad. He breaks my stuff or gets rid of it. Is asking for at least a little social interaction too much to ask? He thinks I’m old enough to get MARRIED to an old man but I’m not old enough to go to a highschool in 11th grade. He even offered to marry me off when I was 14. 

My dad is the root of all my family’s problems. He’s the reason I’m so lonely. He’s the reason I attempted suicide at eight years old (I’ve never attempted again). He’s the reason we’re broken. I hate him so much. I hate him. I hate him. He doesn’t beat me anymore because i’m 15. But I would get beat daily at 8-10 years old. I wanted to die because of him. Death was an escape. 

He threatened to beat me after we argued. I’m a lot stronger than I was when I was eight. “Knock yourself out” I said. He’s too much of a pussy to touch me. 

My dad isn’t bothering me. I dont care how strict he is or if he puts his hands on me. What’s bothering me is the loneliness and no freedom. I really am a good kid. But my dad doesn’t care. He was disappointed I got a B in one quarter despite my GPA still being a 4.0. I’m always a disappointment. 

I can’t have social interaction until I turn 18. Just a little over two more years and I’ll be free. I’ll move out and go far away from him. 

I can’t improve my situation now so I’m gonna have to sit there and take it. I wonder if I can handle another two years in isolation. (not even going to the store)

What should I do when I’m 18? Should I legally disown him? Should I just play along with his wacky Islamic lifestyle? Then when I’m 18 I move out and cut him out of my life? He’s made my life really difficult. He won’t let me move out until I get married. 

It’s not illegal to leave him at 18. I know I can get a scholarship, maybe even a full ride to a smaller public college if I keep trying my best in school. It’s my only hope. 

What should I do when I’m 18?",21Nov2019,1
553,"My mom's been setting a bad example to my sister (13) recently. My mom's love life admittedly had taken a turn for worse since my dad died in 2002, aside from my dad, she's only had one positively relationship since I was born. I've already suffered through my mom's abusive ex-husband (my sister's dad) and have anxiety as a result and I don't want my sister ending up in a similar situation.

My mom's recently been dating someone (about a week now) and since then our lives have gotten worse slowly, mostly my sister. My mom's been manipulating my sister, lying to her and that’s lead my sister to develop some symptoms of anxiety and depression. My mom and her boyfriend have been telling us that ""we don't have enough money"" for things when she's asked for simple things like money for school clothes, all the while they've been buying copious amounts of alcohol, cigarettes and eating out more (without us). They also manipulate us to do our chores, we had an agreement that we get pocket money for every chore that we do at the end of each month...however, we haven't been paid since April. 

They've been threatening us that they'd stop paying the monthly wifi since my sister's been watching YouTube a lot more, instead of doing chores, since it's one of the few things that make her happy. Claiming that they ""don't use the WiFi"" and thus ""have no problem not paying for it,"" which isn't true as my mom uses the WiFi to download pirated movies and shows. 

They also talk behind our backs and others' backs aswell, often making homophobic and racist remarks that piss me off and set a bad example to my sister, I'm still trying to get my sister to stop hating lesbians (she's fine with gay males though). 

They teases us about how we never talk to them about serious stuff but when we do they either ignore us completely or blow things out of proportions and try to make us do things that we feel are immoral. It's become so bad that I refused to tell them that I entered the talent contest at my school, instead claiming that I was just helping out with the sound team and also asking my friend to keep my 1st place trophy just so that they wouldn't make such a fuss about it. 

Today, my mom threatened to deny my sister from doing high jump in her school just because my mom asked her to put away a glass that she was still using three times in a single minute and also complained that she didn't clean the cupboards, even though she did and the only reason it wasn't clean was because her boyfriend made a mess when he made himself coffee and a sandwich and didn't even own up to it. 

I need advice on what I can do because anything I try to do, they just won't see reason. My mom's boyfriend even got pissed because I ""interrupted"" him when he scolded me for asking about our pocket money and just stopped and said ""Ok, fine, whatever"" at which point he got pissed off, stomped off to the kitchen, tripped over the cat's food bowl and got even more pissef and then went talking behind my back about how I'm arrogant and my generation not respecting older people and all that typical narcissistic Christian, 70s beliefs shit. I'm really worried about my sister's psychological well being, I'd appreciate any advice that could help.",21Nov2019,1

I know it was accredited because I have other classmates that went on to further their education but STUPID ME got an office job at 19 and I’ve been working ever since. Now, 16 years after graduating high school I decided to try to go back to school and get a degree but when I submitted my transcript request to the school district, it came back “no info found”. I emailed them and they asked to see my diploma so they can try to search again. I have been searching my parents house from top to bottom and I cannot find it ANYWHERE! My mom (bless her heart) has a horrible habit of throwing bundles of papers away. Once she threw away the pink slip to my 1966 mustang so it WOULD NOT surprise me if it was in a box sitting in some landfill. 

(Reason for graduation from a charter school rather than a regular school was because I missed a lot of school after my brother tragically passed away, my family of 4 was now a family of 3 and we all took it REALLY hard. I didn’t want to face his friends and mine and the overwhelming sympathetic looks so my mom fast tracked me through it by putting me in this Charter school my high school recommended) 

I’m soooo heartbroken for so many reasons. I’m a really hard worker so it pains me to think I’ve reached my limit of success. I’ve been promoted in EVERY position I’ve ever had and I take pride in my work but this isn’t enough to get me a better job. I get it from my Dad. He immigrated to the US from Mexico when he was a kid, he worked as a custodian at his high school and now he has a prominent position at an unnamed Aerospace corporation without a college degree because in his day that was actually possible. Not today though, and not for me. Everyone overlooks my resume because i don’t have a degree. In fact Ive had American Express withdraw a job offer because they thought I had a degree! 


I’m feeling REALLY hopeless right now and I just need some guidance. Do I need to get a high school diploma all over again??? Do I give up and accept this as my limit? Is there another industry or job I can do without any of this?? Help 😢

555,"I'm (M)22, and since getting out of highschool and living alone I've come to the realization that I do not know how to make decisions for myself (or at least not well). My father raised me almost alone, my mother was around but she got into drugs and alcohol and after the age of around 15 it made it too hard to see her, my father raised me the way his father raised him... He would tell me what to do and how to behave and if I stepped out of line he'd beat me back into it. This started when I was around 7 and continued until I was 17. After I stopped reacting to what was physical about my punishments my father started using his words more, and in awful ways, he would say that unless I did as he said and followed his instructions I would end up dead on the streets doing drugs like my mother, he made me feel worthless for what I was.... I finished high school 4 years ago and moved out the year after. I got decent grades, honors at least, but I wanted to take music, I love guitar, I love to sing everything about making and hearing other people's art is what motivates me to live... I ended up going to a technical college for petroleum engineering technologies, to make my family happy. I dropped out my second year. I started working full time while going to school because I had to support myself and it just became too much I couldn't take it I couldn't do something that I hated so much when I wasn't even doing it for myself. Fast forward three years and I never graduated but I told my family I did and I owe my father money I owe the government money and I owe my bank money and I have nothing to show for it. I want to make music but I love my family and I want their support. If anyone could share their advice right now I feel completely lost, Thank you.",21Nov2019,1
556,"Hello everyone, first of all, I know I might sound like a psycho to some of you. I am not, but I guess that's what those people say.

\- My ex cheated on me with another guy, this one beautiful day she decided to block me everywhere and gave no explanation, I saw her with another guy a couple of days later. 

\- He cheated on her a week after they started their relationship, I'm like ""Okay, karma doing it's thing.""

\- She called me yesterday, told me we should meet somewhere so she can explain what happened, tells me she did a mistake and that she will give me another chance with her. Yes, you read it right. Give ME another chance. I told her I will think about it.

\- I know she is obsessed with me, it can't be love, it's an addiction of some sort. About the psycho part, I now want to ruin her life, after she told me she will give ME another chance my anger was through the roof but I didn't say a thing, I played a desperate victim. I really wanna ruin her life and I have the connections and financial power to do so. Most of her family members work for my uncle, her brother works for my father, some cousins of hers work for me and most of them are in debt.

\- Am I taking this too far? Should I not do this and just let her be? It's been bothering me for a while, my gut says revenge is good. Crossroad...",21Nov2019,1
557,"so at my job in retail, there's this woman in a different department whom I've been acquainted with all year..

we don't talk much, I keep to myself in general but I'm attracted to her and am not sure if she is as well.. 

over the summer I found her on facebook and began messaging her... 
we had good conversations early on, actually related in surprising ways that we mutually appreciated.. and she enjoyed the conversations, we even met up on break at work to talk...

long story short, I kinda came on too strong with sharing a lot about my life and trials etc until one day she politely asked to stop messaging her in addition to blocking me.

that was about 6 weeks ago and I've been super respectful at work regardless, never showed any frustration or confrontation.. 
it's been normal and recently something unexpected happened:

So I recently bought this new pink hoodie and wore it to work on a day that she was working... and then the next time we worked together, a few days later, this happened....

the literal second I walked into work, on the other end of the store at least 100 feet away from where she is, she instantly noticed and looked over at me.. and sure enough, she was wearing a pink hoodie very similar to the one I wore a few days ago..
The thing is, I have never seen her wear this hoodie in the year I've been working here.. 

I mean to notice me within like literally two seconds of walking in a busy store from about 100 feet away, and her wearing this hoodie.. it's like she was hoping/expecting to see me walk through that door..

and then one other time at work a few days later, i was helping a customer and glanced over and saw her just smiling while looking at me from afar.. then she looked away as she saw me noticing her... it appeared like she was admiring me.

what do you think?

558,"I had a phone conversation with a friend on Tuesday where she asked to hang out. She asked me when I was available and I told her Saturday she told me that she would let me now if she would be in the area and be able to get lunch that Saturday. She told me she would let me know later on that night (Tuesday). 

She didn’t let me know and I texted her today (Thursday) at 11 AM. She explained to me that she wouldn’t be able to meet up in that specific area until Monday. 

My question is how can I respond to her to let her know that I would’ve appreciated her telling me Tuesday night like she would or at the very least informing me when sh
e knew for sure what her plans were. 

I’d like to confront the situation in the healthiest way possible. For me I’m in a journey of setting boundaries for myself I’m trying to become a better person I have a history of being passive aggressive, mean, and avoidant of confrontation. 

The situation really bothers me because I feel like it’s taking my time for granted.

559,"The other day my friend was feeling down and unwanted because he feels like no one wants to date him and only see him as friend material. 

I admit I am part of the problem. We met through a r4r subreddit, but shortly after we met I realized that I wasn’t looking for a romantic partner and told him about it candidly. And that I didn’t want him to wait around.

He said he that he likes talking to me because he thinks I’m a cool person and genuinely enjoy spending time with me. 

Now, he is telling me he is depressed and that nobody wants him. He said he keeps seeing this cycle. He wasn’t explicit that it was about me, but I could tell it was. I didn’t know what to say him. 

I tried telling him that he is dateable and loveable and pointed out all the positive things about him. I tried giving perspective when it comes to dating, etc. but he didn’t respond to anything I said.

I don’t know what to do. I know it’s not my job to fix anything or anyone, but I don’t want him feeling like he is unlovable because I’m not looking for anything. It’s not even him or anyone, I just have no desire for any romantic relationship and I’m going through a lot right now.

560,"Hi. I (15F) don’t know what to do. I’m terrified. I’m in a real pickle. Why did I do  this to myself? I’m not sure. I didn’t finish my big essay that’s due today even though I’ve told my teacher and my parents and my friends that I would start trying to work harder and be more responsible. But that was a lie. We also had reading due today. Didn’t do that either.

I hate my English class. I always feel miserable and stressed there. I dread it every day anyway, so I guess I reached my tipping point. And the teacher is super passive aggressive and always seems grumpy and gives withering, judgemental looks. And two boys whom I really dislike sit right behind me so I always hear them talking during class and they always say really stupid things but they think they’re soo smart and they act so smug but they’re both dicks and they make me want to scream.

As I walked to class today, I felt the knots in my stomach grow worse. I felt tears in my eyes. When I arrived, my ex-friend was waiting outside (I still care about her but she kinda hates me so it feels awful because I always miss her even though she’s right there). Yeah, a bunch of teenage drama, I know. 

Anyway, I was determined not to go to class today. I considered going to the office and seeing the counselor— I meet with her about once a month. But then I got scared that I wouldn’t be able to meet with her or that I would just ended up getting sent back to class regardless. I was also too scared to leave campus. Way too risky, and where would I even go anyway? 

So I did the only thing I could think of: I locked myself in a bathroom stall.

I’m so scared. People keep coming in and out of the bathroom. What if someone finds me in here with my backpack and without a hall pass? I won’t be able to pretend I’m just going to the bathroom during class. I’ll get detention for sure! But the embarrassment will be so much worse. 

I plan to talk to my counselor about this eventually. Maybe I’ll even be able to transfer classes if that turns out to be the best option. I don’t know.

I started writing this at 8:25 and it’s 8:50 now. The period ends at 9:35 and then it will be break and I’ll probably avoid my friends. I dunno. I just wanna go home. I don’t know what I’m asking for and I doubt anyone will respond but just writing all this down has made me feel a little better so that’s nice I guess.

The guy leaves her alone when the kids born and her parents send her on her own pretty much and she gives the kid to a family she knew really well. Family raise him and she meets my dad. She works really hard now working extremely long hours saving lives (work) and every once and a while, she’ll become devastated remembering this and feeling super bad. She sent letters a lot and eventually the family got annoyed and I believe they sent one that wanted her to stop sending a bunch of letters.

Problem is, I don’t know if he knows they aren’t his parents. I’m sure he might now but I wouldn’t want to cause a big issue, however she becomes devastated knowing her son is somewhere else and she’s sad she couldn’t do more for him.

563,"So last night for the 4th or so time, my wife was crying over this guy. 

We experimented with polyamory about 3 months ago. She found a guy in her game that she liked but arguably is a total douche. 

They set up weird rules for their poly style which included him having no other partners... yea right. He lives in Canada and we live in the USA, 24 hours away. 

They take it EXTREMELY fast off the getgo, within a month talking about him moving down here and how time would be allocated between myself and her new bf, talking about having a KID within 2 months, FUCK!

All this time there are red flags galore, this dude gets jealous of every person she meets in the game that she talks to, acts possessively toxic in party chat with the other dudes present by asking my wife “Hey wanna have phone sex later like we did last night” all in an obvious power play to the other guys. He even goes as far as asking her who she’d live with if he moved down here, him or me?!? BRUH! STOP TALKING TO THIS GUY!

This guy is your textbook alpha douche. 

He loses at the game, he rages. He wins at the game, he gloats. 

I have no idea what my wife sees in him but to me he’s an obvious mental case. 

However I am trying to be open and respect my wife and not be a judgmental person. 

Their first major fight was about him. Talking to another girl, he denied it but she had proof. Drama drama drama and I’m left to sweep up the actual mess that is my wife, in real life. 

Another fight, he doesn’t like her talking to another friend she’s made... JFC are you kidding me she’s OPENLY FUCKING MARRIED. Yet again, I’m here with the broom and dustpan. 

[DJ KHALED](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/another-one) This time it’s their actual “break up” or so I thought. 

She finds out he’s been talking to multiple other girls besides her (idk why it would matter, she’s married, but none of my business how they make their stupid rules) and the end happens. 

I’m left literally picking my wife up on some days over this motherfucker. 

I cannot take it anymore and propose we both fucking end this. 

She agrees and stops talking to him altogether and promises to stop forever. 

NOW SHES BACK TALKING TO THIS MOTHERFUCKER AGAIN AFTER TWO MONTHS! 

They’ve only been talking for 3 days again and last night I had to console her out of a fucking breakdown because guess what HES TALKING TO OTHER FUCKING GIRLS, [WOW!!1!!](https://youtu.be/KlLMlJ2tDkg)

So here we are. I’m ready to fucking leave because she won’t stop talking to this guy and it’s ruining my life.

 I didn't even wanted to spend that much time with my girlfriend,but because I felt bad for her , I started spending more and more time with her.  But as the time passed by. I wasn't motivated anymore. I quitted work , my goals just wasn't interesting anymore. Everything changed and I started losing my confidence . I got attached to that relationship too much. And then she cheated on me multiple times and I was losing all of my confidence. But I realised that  I have to changed. I finally broke up with her . But she s still on my mind.

My ADHD so bad that taking and up/change, levels/amoumt of tablets for from grade 2 to second year, first time at bcad 1 though at varsity that only my assignments between 60 to 100% not my exams. So had to try to ask if not to put emphasis/requirement on exams.

One of the them cut holes of spots on my back at varsity bathroom 1 hour before exams started. Came and rape me, kidnapped my parents. Left me brain damaged.

So I've got a friend (female) who has been dating this guy. At first it all seemed pretty cool. I knew for a while now that they both liked each other a lot and they have been together for 2 months now I believe. The issue is her boyfriend seems to be physically and emotionally abusing her. 

I have witnessed many incidents where he has called her ""a bitch"", tripped her in front of everyone, and even randomly turning around in his chair and pushing her off of her stool violently, her crashing against the ground, and him just simply watching her get up herself. There have been a few times where she has cried about these problems to him and to her friends (including me), but it just repeats itself. They seem fine, he does some shit, she cries (and generally seems sad and unhappy), we talk to both parties, they make up, and repeat and repeat.

My dad on the other hand asked his boss and he said sure, but the owner of the company overrode that decision and said no. He was going to be joining us late, so he would only miss 4 days of work..but he works for a heating company and it's their prime heating season so I completely understand why he would be denied the time off.

My mom suffers from severe SAD and this is putting her over the edge. My brother doesn't really want to go without my dad, and they were going to be traveling together.

Let me (21M) start by saying this, I have talked to all my friends about my problems and can’t get any reasonable advice about the next step I need to take in life.

I lost my mom to lung cancer at 8, my father to prison at 13 (still incarcerated), my grandma at 14 to cancer, my aunt to a kidnapping/murder at 18, and my adopted guardians due to them failing to believe that I am depressed. I have never been to therapy (obviously would love to go but can’t afford it). I left home at 18 to live with my friend matt and never looked back. Currently we share an apartment with another roommate and none of us have cars. We live less than a mile from our restaraunt jobs, and pretty much just work, smoke, and drink every day away. I have been cutting back my intake as it has really fucked me financially and mentally. No drivers license currently, no savings, and no back up plan. I really have no idea wtf I am doing with my life right now so I guess this is my epiphany. So the real question here is, what is the next step?

577,"A little backstory, I’m 24M, and about 2 years ago I had to move back in with my mom after my landlord sold the house I was living in. I was there for about a year and honestly I hit a major bout of depression while I was there. I worked a shitty job for 10$/hr and had no way of saving money.

Eventually, with my mom tired of having me live with her, called my sister for help. My sister called me and basically pressured me into living with her and her husband, in which my rent would be $550 a month and 40 miles from my job. The plan we made was that I’d look for a new job once I moved in. Don’t worry, I thought it was a bad idea too.

So, with no savings I ended up taking out a loan for $2700, and was going through it very quickly. Things quickly deteriorated with my living situation and relationship with my sister, so in 2 months I found a new place to live closer to home.

I wasn’t able to keep up with the payments at all, and I did the stupid thing and just ignored all the calls, voicemails, I was lost. About 2 months ago, I finally found a good paying job. About $38,000 a year. But it’s too late. My mom called and said that a sheriff has come to her house 2 nights in a row looking for me to serve me some papers. I know that I am getting sued.

583,"I live in Anniston, Alabama in a not so great part of town. This all happened about three months ago. I was laid off and got behind on my bills and my power was cut off. Me and our two daughters went and stayed with my mother for a month. During the stay I was on Facebook scrolling through Marketplace and saw a house for sale or rent. I was thinking to myself that this house looks familiar and then I realized it's very familiar because IT IS MY HOUSE. It's my house but my stepfather and mother own the property. My mother and I rushed over to my house and my back door is wide open, I walk into the house and I'm in shock literally everything I own is gone my TVs, appliances, computers(gaming pc and my oldest daughters laptop),furniture. This scumbag even stole daughter's toys. She's bawling and wondering where all of our stuff is, I feel terrible and get all the info from the post and call the police. An officer shows up and comes in the house and looks at everything and I show him the Facebook post. He then asked me whose house is it and I told him that my stepdad and mother own it but they're letting me and my family stay here. I showed him who the guy was and he knew who he was. and he tells me the scumbag has a very long rap sheet . The officer then tells me that the owner of the house will have to come down to the police station and talk to the investigator they go down to the police station and talk to the investigator. They go to the police station and talk to the investigator and hetells them that they need the deed to the house and had to prove they were the owners. My stepfather's dad left him the house in the will but they haven't done the paperwork to put the house in his name. They're doing that now and the guy is still free and trying to sell the house to this day.. He scammed some lady and her kid out of 500 bucks a month or so ago. Now theyre teying to get that back from my parents. thinking they had something to do with it. I cant believe the cops aren't doing shit for us. My entire livelihood is gone and I feel like I've failed my kids. how can I get this guy charged if the local police don't seen to give a shit? Sorry for the wall of text and bad grammar .  I'm trying to get help so I can give my daughters a Christmas. Ive haven't tried this before. This is very embarrassing but I'm  extremely desperate and worried sick. My question is what are some sub reddits to post in for the possibility of some help? Thank you",21Nov2019,1
584,"Background. 25, been living with my parents since I dropped out of college with a full ride (at my mother's suggestion) because I was having trouble adapting to it and dealing with the stress. That was at the end of 2013. Didn't make it but 3 months. Worked at UPS soon after. Took a welding course and got a job at a weld shop at my mother's insistence, got fired because of fuckery I'll explain later. Worked a job at a place that does custom closets for a year and a half(?) I think, then at my mother's insistence applied for and started a sheet metal apprenticeship and worked a construction job until union politics fucked me out of the apprenticeship. Bit of a relief really since I had never 'fit in' which I'm sure was part of my being kicked from the apprenticeship. Went back to the closets place, been there since. The timelines are fuzzy cause the years since I've been out of college are all kind of a haze to me. 

I'm finally at the point where I've realized I'm never gonna get anywhere in life until I can get the fuck out of this house, because it's a horribly toxic environment that's led to me being the fucking dismal failure that I am today. 

My mother's suggestions and attempts to ""help"" have always done the opposite now that I look back on them. I shouldn't have dropped out but I was under extreme stress and I felt lost, confused, and like I couldn't succeed. Instead of encouragement to continue, I was told maybe it was better if I just quit. Welding I ended up loving, and it remains the sole exception to the statement at the start of this paragraph. However, the fuckery that led to my firing? I'd had 2 attendance strikes in the first 2 weeks of the 90 day probationary period at the weld shop. I was late twice while trying to adjust to a new schedule. No further issues until the last week of it. I slept in my parents bed because they went on some trip and wanted me there with the dogs. Dogs scratched the alarm clock off the table before I woke up, unplugging it. I woke up a full hour and a half or something late for work, and in a panic called my mother cause I didn't know how to react. ""Just go in you shouldn't ever miss work"" was her response. So I got fired for being late. Had I called in sick, I would have been fine and I'm absolutely certain I'd still be working there. Listening to her had again, only dragged me down. 

Sorry for the rant. Anyways. I feel like a failure at this point in my life and I don't know where the fuck to go from here but I know I can't stay. My mother continues to try and drag me down, intentionally or not, and my dad has always been a piece of shit. In his own way he cares about me I guess but that means fuckall when he never shows it, and his solution to my having an autistic fit has always been scream me into submission, and then say shit like ""If people saw you shaking your head like that in public you'd get sent to a mental asylum."" 

So. Can't fucking stay here but I don't know what to do or how. Even thinking about it causes severe anxiety, the nausea and cold, shivery kind. It's difficult enough typing all this. Sorry for the rambling/ranting tone. I'm gonna need years of therapy I'm sure to be any sort of functional but first I need to get out and find some way to support myself so I can start that.

I don't know what to do and thinking about any of it absolutely terrifies me.",21Nov2019,1
586,"So a little background info: I'm currently in college studying for graduation in India. My parents have worked really really hard for me to get into this institution and they are concerned enough to call me (even a text won't do) daily.
I'd say I'm an above average student with an 8.7/10 gpa which is considered good in branch of Information technology. But got really lazy and careless in my final year and now I'm debarred from giving exam 1 out of my 6 subjects. Just so you know the job scenario in IT is not very good and while I'll get a job, it won't be nearly as good as I'd gotten if not for this. This will be a massive disappointment for my family and myself as I'd been in top 10% all my life. I will miss almost 80% of companies until my backlog (exam for which I'm debarred is cleared). Talked and begged to the Director and he won't budge. At this point of time I'm feeling completely helpless and desolate. Don't know what to do. I don't have courage to tell at home that I fucked it up after all their hardwork. And not getting a good career is a BIG deal here in India. It's not as if I fail then I can work at some McD or something, here you fail, you become shit, no one cares no one gives a fuck about you even if you die. I'll become a black sheep in my whole family where my cousins are becoming doctor and getting promotion to foreign countries and I'll be stuck with a very low level job.
This may not seem like a big life crisis but it's a really big deal for me.
Don't know what to do and how to cope up with this. Thinking of getting medical help dunno. What do you suggest?",21Nov2019,1

589,"To cut a long long story short, my partner of 7 years and I broke up, by my choice. We had an amazing but heavily co-dependant relationship and he was my first love and the love of my life, but apparently this was not enough to keep me from lying to him and hurting him. (We had tried to make our relationship open but I kept breaking the rules we had laid out, effectively cheating on him.) 

Despite this, a month or so down the line when I was in trouble and had nobody, he drove across Canada to come and help me, completely re-routing a roadtrip he was taking, and he never asked for a damn thing in return, he just wanted me to be ok.

We tried to stay friends but he eventually cut contact when he started a new relationship. I miss him every day but I understand and respect his choice, however I can't help but feel he deserves a proper apology (and thank you) from me.

I am hesitant to contact him because I don't want it to come across as my doing it for my own benefit to assuage my own guilt etc (I have therapy for that) and I certainly don't want to dredge bad feelings up or cause issues for him, but I have received apologies from other people who hurt me and I found that it helped, even if I wasn't going to let them back in my life. I can't bear the thought that he might believe I abandoned him and felt no remorse; that he wasn't valuable enough for me to miss or to realise or care how badly I treated him.

If I go ahead with it, it would purely be an apology and acknowledgement of how shitty I was and how well he treated me in response to that. I wouldn't be asking to get back in contact, or for forgiveness. I am not harbouring secret hopes that it will bring him back into my life, I have a new relationship and am very happy in it, and don't believe I deserve my ex as a friend.

I'm stuck, and everyone I've asked is divided. Do you think an apology would bring him peace, or is it more likely to just re-open a healed wound? Is it a selfish act on my part; have I convinced myself it's for him when really it's for me?",21Nov2019,1
590,"I got into my dream college and it's a really great place. There's a lot of awesome organizations that aren't anywhere else. But, during my sophomore year, I ran into a group of very unfortunate people. They seemed like great friends at first but they were all actually very toxic and manipulative and I'm mentally weak and easy to manipulate. They ended up driving me to the point of suicidal ideations. People were telling me I should take a break from college and get treatment but I wanted to persevere. My grades were bad but I was passing. My suicidal ideations continued for a long time even after I got away from that group and made new friends. I struggled a lot with various mental health issues. I went to counseling through school but didn't take a break from classes. I hated those people and blamed them for ruining my life. Everyone talks about how college is the best time of their life, but I was depressed/suicidal for most of college. I did something stupid (don't want to go into details) to retaliate against the bullies, and I had the campus police called on me for harassment, at the beginning of my senior year. I didn't think what I did was that horrible but I'm suspended from my college for two years. I did everything I could to try to shorten it but they said now their decision is final. 

These are my options:

1. Work for two years, then come back to the same college. Part of me feels really attached to this specific school; despite all that's happened, I've met some great people, been part of some great organizations, and had some great times there. But also I'm scared I won't be mentally strong enough to handle being back on the same campus. Same way a good song gets ruined by bad memories, this school is great but feels kind of ruined for me. I'm scared that my second attempt at my senior year will not go well.
2. Try to transfer to a different college and graduate from there. I'm scared to do this too. Part of it is kind of a pride thing; like I think I'd feel like a failure if I didn't get my degree from my dream college. But part of it is that it will take a while to graduate because my credits won't all transfer. And part of me is scared to go to a new place, and repeat the anxiety I went through after graduating high school. 
3. People have told me that you can get good jobs without a college degree, but I really want a college degree. I don't want the past three years of my life to have been a waste.

I feel awkward using slang and intentionally messing up grammar that I worked hard to learn. It’s also very important to me to be able to express exactly how I feel using certain words that aren’t always colloquial. 

But I feel like I can come off condescending when I use certain words or speaking in a way in settings or with people who don’t necessarily know the meaning. I know that this takes a lot of skill to have a wider vocabulary and to be able to expertly use language to the appropriate setting (which I’m working on), but it’s hard to do that at this point now after working so hard to be able to expand my vocabulary to this level.

593,"Hi everyone! This is probably not going to be a big deal to some but I’m really at war with myself right now. 
I started seeing Z about five months ago and ever since then we’ve become really close. So close in fact, that I pretty much live with him now. 
This would all be really great, except for the fact that my cat is still living with my mom. She’s expressed to me that she doesn’t mind taking care of him especially since she has a cat that’s young and my cat keeps him entertained. The thing is, I’ve had my cat since he was 8 weeks old (he’s 7 months now) and he’s bonded to me as an emotional support animal. He cries when he hears me coming through the door and doesn’t leave my side until I have to go again. It breaks my heart a little each time. 
Z has told me he’d be okay if I brought my cat over. I’m just scared of confusing him if I take him back and forth or him not liking his new place if the both of us just end up living with Z. There’s also the matter of my moms cat going apeshit without my baby there.

599,"I'm a 15-year-old girl and I attend grammar school. We weren't in a normal classroom. We were in a small classroom with a huge table in the middle. We sat around it. We had a history class and the teacher asked if anyone forgot their homework. Most people raised their hands. The teacher got mad and told us that this school isn't a place to behave like this and to transfer school or work. This is pretty common in our school (and in most grammar schools) but i don't like it and a parent had already complained about it in the google+ group before this incident. She got even angrier because she thought that one girl shrugged but she continued. After about five minutes the teacher yelled at the same girl. 

She said that she would ""kick her the fuck out if she dares to turn to her again."" No one understood what she meant. The girl asked her who she wasn't supposed to turn to. The teacher yelled the thing multiple times again. The girl told her she didn't understand why she was getting yelled at. She started to mock the girl by repeating what she (the girl) said, in a high-pitched voice (It isn't the first time this had happened and she only does this to girls which is kinda sexist., and told her she was good at acting.

 After that, another teacher came in asked for our teacher's assistance. She stepped out of the classroom, and the girl started crying. Around three minutes later she came back and saw that the girl was crying. She told her that. This was an s a sign of weakness and that her anger was justified (in an angry tone). She told her to wash her face and go home, but she told her she didn't want to. The teacher said she had to and that she didn't want her here. (still in a very angry tone).

The girl left the classroom and came back after 15 minutes. Teacher kept on mocking her  a few times during the class. She said used her as warning: she told us we would end up like the girl. She bragged to another teacher about putting a disrespectful kid to her place.

After class ended we all went home and told our parents about what happened. The parents have a google+ group to communicate with the teacher and toher parents. 4 parents (including the girls mom) sent the teacher an email about how they found her behavior unnaccaptable.

Today, the girls mom posted the response of the thacher in the group. The teacher brought up previous small incidents with the girl (she even brought up one that happened after this incident.) these were things like not paying attention and talking in class.) she lied about what happened . In her version of the story she was polite and she told the girl exacttly what she did wrong. She said that after she came back the girl was still being disrespectful (she was crying) and thats when she told her to she would kick her the fuck out, and thats when she started crying. She said that she ""offered"" to let her home and didn't send her away. The email was full of mean comments. For example, everytime after she told the girls mom about her ""bad"" behavior she asked her ""did your daughter tell you this too?""

 Her mother unfortunately belived her and said that she hoped this wouldn't happen again.

I want to show this to my classmates as they an't see this because it's in the parents group. all the girls mom told her is that the teache ""apologized"". i could see it because my mom showed me but she said i coulddn't tell this anyone .",21Nov2019,1

601,"I found out my son’s father hung himself this weekend. 

My son is 8. We separated when he was 3 and our relationship wasn’t the greatest even when we were together. For lack of a nicer way to put it...his dad was a real douche nozzle. When we did separate, he never really paid child support and was in and out of my son’s life as it was convenient for him. You know the type - sometimes he’d play Father of the Year for a couple weeks, then he’d disappear for months. He was an alcoholic; when he was sober he was great...but when he needed a drink on the other hand...he was like a different guy.

My son hasn’t seen or spoken to his father in over a year. So his death isn’t really going to affect my son’s day to day life. Also, his family is from a thousand + miles away and I know his funeral (if he has one) will be held there, so with work and everything else I won’t be making the time to go. 

My plan was to wait until January to say anything to my son. I’m not going to let that asshole ruin my sweet son’s holiday season. He rarely ever mentions his dad, so it’s not like he’ll say “so when do I get to see my dad again?” between now and when I tell him. Also, my husband is wonderful with him and my son actually calls my husband “dad” nowadays. So it’s not like he doesn’t have a father figure that’s there for him.

I guess my questions revolve around...how? How do I tell an 8 year old their dad is dead? I mean, he knows he’s never around already and that he may never see him again...but this is different. He did love his dad, obviously. And I’m afraid this may absolutely devastate him, even with our support. I also planned on telling his school and having him see a counselor at school once a week or more. 

I just have never had to do this before and I don’t personally know anyone who has ever had to have this conversation either. Do I tell him on a Friday so he has all weekend to be sad? Or do I tell him during the week so he has school to keep his mind off of it? Do I tell him he killed himself?? Or just say “I’m not sure”? I just don’t know where to begin. 

And advice or insight would be so appreciated, thank you! And I apologize if this was a jumbled mess of information, I’m on mobile and also have so much on my mind right now.",21Nov2019,1

609,"Ok so here's my situation. I'm in a group chat with 3 of my closest friends. 

* One of them I'm classmates with at uni (we have known each other for over 2 years and are almost the only friend both of us have at uni). We'll call her H. 
* Another one I got to know through H and we bonded over our mutual taste in music. We'll call her C. I know C a little over a year. 
* The last friend I got to know through another, separate group of friends, we also had the same taste in music. We've bonded over our shared taste of music, OTPs and dislike for a few people we both know. Let's call her R. I know R a little bit over a year but I've bonded with her the most and felt we had the most genuine connection I've had in a long time with anyone. Everything just clicked, so to speak.

Anyways sometime in May is when our group came together and became a 'squad' or whatever you like to call it. First we mostly just studied together and chatted during the time we took breaks (we don't all study the same thing, just H and I). I had a gc with H and C because we hung out together for the better part of the year after I got to know C. I hung out with R either separately (just R and me) or with the group of friends who introduced us. So when the 4 of us came together, I still PM'd with most of them or PM'd with R and groupchatted with H and C.

Around a month of studying together we create a gc and it was all nice to arrange our studying and going out to eat together but I guess I unknowingly stopped talking to them in PM's a while after that. I mostly used the gc or sometimes PM'd R. I didn't know they all PM'd each other and didn't mind it for other than it made me realize I very rarely PM'd any of them or that any of them PM'd me. So I guess that this is my problem: I talk to my friends only in gc but not PM and idk if it's bc of me or them? 

Another thing is we have mutual taste in music, though my taste in said genre steers more toward one direction (I prefer girl group music) than theirs (R likes strictly boy group music, while H and C are in-between) and since summer I've told them I don't feel as strongly as I did about a certain group (I used to be a huge fan, spent hours listening to the group and checking variety shows they attended, even went to their concert and bought fake merch and bought their albums). They all are still huge fans of their group and my sort-of-leaving the fandom makes me feel a bit isolated, on top of the fact that most of them don't listen to the groups I like. We all have a few common groups we all like though.

I'm also quite opinionated and I've stopped hesitating to say my opinion out loud, even though I think I express myself nicely. R is opinionated as well and won't back down from sticking to her ground as I won't either. H usually doesn't have strong opinions but C is ALWAYS in the middle and never says anything remotely biased (which can get on my nerves but not hugely). On top of that, they bond over many things I don't care about so I often can feel left out.

So my question is, is it weird I don't (usually) PM with any of them?",21Nov2019,1

I have always been keen on being like Buffett, Gates, Dalio, Bezos, etc. The super successful, super wealthy group of individuals that have risen above the rest in their respective fields.

I often get ideas for solving different problems through engineering that I think are novel but I rarely act on them because I think they will be too hard, or I think I will end up wasting my time, or because I look online and find that someone (typically a billionaire or some guy/gal with a lot of money) is already working on that problem. 

With that large preface out of the way: how can I begin to achieve these goals that I have set forth for myself? Is stuff like is unattainable for someone like me, who has self-esteem issues and depression? 

(Note: I don't care about the money for money's sake, nor do I care about the power I would get as an icon by being a powerful millionaire/ billionaire. We all die in the end and time returns all things to dust so I think it is futile to chase power/money/status if it is only spent on ones self and not for the greater good.)",21Nov2019,1

621,"Like the title says, my BIL \[M36\] is depressed and works as a pilot. He has been flying for the Air Force and was recently hired by a large airline. Over the last year he has gone through some significant mental breakdowns. He will lay in bed in the fetal position all day crying because his life is terrible if he isn't flying. He has run away from his family multiple times and has been saying that his life is terrible and flying is the only thing that makes him complete. He has been straight up hiding from everyone except for my sister. If anyone goes his house to visit he will stay in a hotel and text my sister that he is crying all day until the visitors leave. He refuses to get help because apparently pilots cannot take any medication, so he will not go to therapy for more than one session because he doesn't want anyone to have a record of him suggesting he needs anti-depressants. 

I'm not entirely sure how me made it through the screening process for the airline, but now that he has, I am very concerned about him flying a plane in his current mental state. I know there are checks and balances for pilots, but at the end of the day a mentally unstable person should not be flying planes. My sister says he would never hurt people, but he constantly hurts her and his children, so that argument doesn't hold much weight with me.

My sister and their kids depend on his income, so I've really been struggling with whether or not to report my concerns, but after a lot of thought I know it is the right thing to do. He has a BS in engineering, so he can find employment doing something else other than flying.

What is the best way to report my concerns over his mental state? Will the airline take me seriously? He is supposed to start training with them in January and I want them to be aware of his issues before they let him fly a plane full of people. 

TLDR: BIL is depressed and is about to work for a major airline. I want to make the airline aware of his mental state.",21Nov2019,1

Now this isnt really  the point  because I can get over him eventually...but why does he always disappear when Im around? Am i THAT annoying?
Thing is, we have a mutual friend called Ali i was first talking with after school and Ali was the last friend left to talk to so I chose to do so.The guy lets call him 'tom' called him over to talk and they started having this whole convo and they seemed to be having fun.Now keep in mind I didnt intend on flirting only talking, so I come up and ask Whats up to Ali and Ali tells him to explain to me this crazy math formula he came up with. ..He stopped laughing and having fun.He wouldnt look me in the eye and barely even looked at Ali.The formula barely left his mouth as he muttered it and he instantly walked away.

627,"so recently i talked to my mom about highschool and my old highschool came up, she asked if i was going back to my old school, i said ""i cant?"" because iwas told once i left i wouldnt be able to come back but she said i could if she paid money. ( had to pay 500$ in elementary school to go to it, im a transfer student )
ok cons 
- i teased all of my crushes or embarrassed myself in front of them all the way till 7th grade so if they remember me it'll probably be awkward or at least give me cringe attacks
- that girl i ""beat up"" in 4th grade i guess told all her friends (she was popular) so in middle school in some of my classes it was isolating cause they'd just stare at me like i was literal vomit
- uhhhhhh old people i cut off that i would most likely have to see again
- id probably third wheel friend groups cause i doubt I'd make any friends
- oh and it'll cost money
pros: 
- public highschool experience before its over 
- i could make friends or rekindle old good friendships
- a lot of ex online school students say public school is less overwhelming cause more of the weight goes on the teacher rather than you teaching yourself on your own. 
- I'll have a reason to leave the house :0.
ok now smaller highschool pros and cons.
pros:
- doesnt cost money
- graduating class of 30 students
- not far from my house
- more teacher one on one time
cons -
- probably wont be that interesting of a highschool experience but is a safer bet that i wont wanna kill myself two weeks in
- probably wont make friends cause theres not that many students and im more on the introverted side
- will have to start all over in meeting people",21Nov2019,1
628,"Hi everyone! Super duper sorry if this isn’t the right place for this, but google searches haven’t quite turned up useful information and I don’t know where else to go.

We recently captured a mole in the basement of our house. We thought it was a mouse, but it’s actually a baby mole that must have gotten into our basement through cracks in our foundation or something.

He’s currently sitting in a live trap because we don’t know where to release him. We don’t want him back in our house so we’re hesitant to release him in our backyard, and the only other suitable place for him would be a forest about 700 metres from our home. It’s currently very cold and snowy in Canada, though, and I’m afraid that he won’t be able to burrow any new tunnels or find food if we release him in an environment that he’s unfamiliar with.

Does anyone have any advice or information about the best way to release this poor little guy? I’ve learned that moles only eat insects so I haven’t been able to feed him and I’m worried that he’ll start getting hungry if we don’t find a home for him soon. I really want to make sure he doesn’t die out there.

632,"So some background, my (22f) bf(25) has definitely had some trauma in his life that left him with some pretty heavy emotional damage and anger issues. Hes been trying to work on them but the last couple months have been pretty rough to say the least. We have a 1 year old together, not sure it's really relevant but just to give more context. I've stayed by him no matter how bad the rage and fights have gotten and eventually got to the point of learning how to be there for him the way he needs me to be. That being said, I'm currently going through a really rough time mentally. It comes in waves I guess, it has my whole life. Everytime I try to vocalize to him how I'm feeling I just end up pissing him off. Im not the best at putting how I feel into words so it kinda comes out as a disheveled rant and I end up saying something a wrong way and it makes him mad and that's all he wants to focus on. Forget about how i just told you I'm burnt out with existence and feeling disassociated lately and focus on what I said that makes you mad. Makes sense right? I feel I always put my emotions aside, I had intense post partum depression and kept that to myself because I didnt want to deal with him getting angry at me for trying to vocalize myself and doing a poor job at it I guess. I feel completely disconnected from him anymore especially with my depression and anxiety hitting me hard lately. I just wish I could find a way to express myself to him in a way he'll listen to me, and not worry about how I say something. Half the time I do figure out a way to get it out he just totally blows it off. I just dont know how to get him to realize I need him to be there for me, and I cant do everything on my own.

645,My wife and I have been together for 4 years. Married for two. Close to the year mark in our relationship while on vacation my wife had over hear my sister and mom talking. They were not saying very nice things about my wife and our son. She heard this and we left the vacation destination which was multiple states away from where we live the next day. From there they went no contact for awhile and I had told my mom she needed to apologize. They did get together and  talk but my mother did not apologize. Some how everything was kind of just swept under the rug an we moved on. Which is not good. Over the next two years we had always kind have been put on the back burner. It never seemed like we were priority. We feel we were put in this situation due to my younger sister having a child and being a single parent so my mom had to always watch or be with her kid. My son began to take notice to this and had asked things like why doesn't nana like me? Or spend time with me? Or other things you don't want to hear from your child. So I talked to my mom about it and it got better for a few weeks and then it fell off again which is why I am here writing. The most recent even that happened in all of this was they made plans with my son and then canceled. Which didn't sit well with my wife and I. They were exchanging messages and then my mom sent me a text saying something along the line that she didn't feel welcome to come to my kids upcoming birthday party because of what was going on. My wife told her that if she didn't come that we would be cutting contact with her all together. My mom then sends a pretty long winded message bashing my wife. Which non of this sits well with me. I ignored the message from my mom. So she doesn't come to the party. It has been 3 months since this has happened. I talked to my mom twice since this has happened. My dad continues to act like nothing happened and over the last 3 months it has caused a strain on my marriage with my wife. Now with the holidays are rolling around everything just sucks.

647,"For quite a while, my 18-year-old brother hasn't been himself. He's been skipping school, laying in bed all day. Today was a breaking point.

My brother (M18) failed his last year of high school so he had to redo it this year. He plays Fortnite a lot, and that is not an understatement. His school results suffered from it. I even think that his failure last year can be blamed (at least partly) on Fortnite. During the summer vacation after he got his results, he went on a small vacation, but apart from that, he didn't really do anything all vacation. The school year started again in September. He didn't pay attention at all because all of his courses are exactly the same as last year, so he just plays Fortnite all the time. Fast forward a month. It's October and he still doesn't do much. My parents call him lazy and tell him to get off his ass and start working because his school results were already starting to drop significantly. 

From this point on, things start getting worse. When my parents ask him why he's messing up, he just doesn't reply and avoids eye contact. He skipped class because he had a test he didn't study for. My dad always gets angry at him, and I can't really blame him. He just wants the best for my little bro. Sadly enough, my dads' strategy didn't work very well for my brother. He started skipping class more often and since three weeks ago he completely ditched school. We started getting concerned. When we try to get him out of bed he just refuses and doesn't answer when you ask him something. My parents contacted some sort of psychiatric institution and he had to go talk to a psychiatrist. They decided that it would be best for him to come every day, as they concluded that he's suffering from depression. They put him on SSRI's. Which seems a pretty good decision imo. I've been depressed during my first year at uni, and I'm all better. 

Time skip to today. I come home from my class (I stayed at a friend's place so I hadn't slept at my parents' place the night before) and my mom is acting all weird. She takes me to the kitchen and informs me that she caught my brother at 4 am in the night smoking weed with the neighbours' kid. They were really noisy and my mom woke up because they were playing really wildly with our dog. Weed is illegal here and my parents aren't really pro-drugs. So they were pretty angry. 

My mom took a big suitcase and told my brother to put his laptop and his Xbox in there as a punishment. He said that he's contemplating suicide and has been for quite a while. Smoking weed with the neighbors' kid and playing games were, according to him, the only things keeping him alive. He doesn't realize what an impact those words have. My whole family is suffering because of him. I've been in a similar situation, where I messed up my first year at uni. My dad's solution was to force me to get a job. It worked unbelievably well for me, but I'm not sure if it'll work for him. 

My parents are downstairs right now trying to talk some sense in him. My mom told me they're thinking of taking him to the hospital because they don't want to take any risks. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to deal with this situation? Thanks in advance.",21Nov2019,1

649,"

I'm pretty bored with life, everything is just so boring. I have a constant need for excitement and danger, sometimes I play with knives, pretending I'm in a fight or even throwing and catching them. Scary or messed up stuff doesn't bother me at all. I've been thinking about joining the military, but I don't wanna be deployed somewhere I wouldn't wanna be, like someplace hot or whatever. I do have extremely fast reflexes and I constantly act on impulse. I do not have any problems with anger or controlling people etc, my mother tells me I have autism, I am a VERY laid back person and I am always calm regardless of the amount of pressure I am under, I never really expressed any of my emotion even as a kid. I guess I'm a thrill seeker or daredevil or something, I did look at stuff on google but it was mostly just looking for exciting jobs, I don't want a job where I sit all day, and I don't wanna do paperwork. I gave some info about myself because I guess it might be useful? I also have no problem doing what people tell me to do and I genuinely don't care, for example a project in school the teacher might ask what topic would I like to do, and I'd just tell them to pick for me or whatever they want, or when I'm with my father he'll ask my brothers and I where we want to eat, and I always say whatever you want or my brothers want.

I look around at people and see nobody that would ever be better than her. I couldn’t start a relationship with somebody I don’t think compares to my ex. I really do love her more than anything and all I want is her. I don’t think I’ll ever be fully over her.

I have not contacted her since two days after our breakup because I knew she was getting with another guy. She seems to be in love with him. It is incredibly painful. I don’t know how I’ll ever move on from this, even with time. She really is incredibly special to me and I’ve never seen somebody more gorgeous than her.

He was making conversation like asking what he should get and stuff like that which is fine I don't mind that but then he asked ""did you just start work?"" I said no I've been here since 9am and he said ""Oh you must of just been on break."" What does this mean? Does it mean he was in before and noticed I wasn't there.

654,"The title basically says it all. I hate my friend’s boyfriend. They’ve been dating a little over a year now, and from the moment I met him like 11 months ago he just gave me a bad feeling. He’s rude, he’s inconsiderate, he’s immature, so many negative qualities. The first thing he did was tell my friend he didn’t want her hanging out with me because I’m bisexual and I might “steal her” from him. Which kind of pissed me off, but whatever.

The most recent thing that really drew the line for me was he went out to lunch with a girl from work he insists is “just a friend” and when my friend calmly and politely explained that the situation made her a bit uneasy, he cussed her out and told her to quit being so sensitive. 

Beyond that, he gives her money so she can buy vapes and cigarettes. He leads her into dangerous/illegal situations involving drugs and alcohol (neither of them are 21). She’s in college, he’s a junior in high school. 

Basically, he’s an asshole. My friend comes from a family of immigrants, she’s the first generation of her family to be born in the US. And this dude always shits on immigrants and talks about how they’re ruining the country. He’s a very edgy kind of dude who makes degrading/offensive jokes basically to be edgy.

659,"AITA for not caring about my(18F) BF(19M)’s Ex’s feelings?


I met my boyfriend about 3 years ago in high school. We hit it off, and started dating weeks after meeting each other. When I found out about his Ex still being really close to him, I was..not super happy. They dated for about a month but she was his first kiss, the first girl he brought home..it made me feel odd that she still told him her  biggest family drama and secrets. I told him I wasn’t comfortable and for a while he talked me into letting them stay friends..and because I was at that point in time trying to stop being such a jealous gf, I let it happen..then they started to have late night video chats, talking until who knows what time, and so on.so I told him I wasn’t gonna deal with it. Something didn’t feel right about their friendship and it made me upset..so supposedly he stopped talking to her. 
Months pass and he talks to me. So I let them stay friends. and every time they hung out, my stomach dropped..I put on a smile and let it happen. But oh man..at the time I didn’t know what they were but I was having anxiety attacks. My stomach hurt to the point of my crying, my head was spinning, I felt like I couldn’t breathe just thinking about them. Something never felt right and no matter how much I trusted him, or tried to let this be ok it just..wasn’t. I told my bf about this but he told me I was being too controlling .Months pass. He starts hanging out with her without me knowing and when I found out I told him that that was my final straw. I couldn’t keep feeling that way, it wasn’t good for my mental health and no matter how much I loved him, I couldn’t do it anymore. He got scared. He stopped being friends with her. 
Now fast forward 9 months. I find out he’s been texting her. For months, behind my back. He completely betrayed my trust, he lied to me, hid messages from me. And the worst part is that when I asked why they were texting again the first time he told me that she messaged him just that one time and it was a one time thing. And later that same day a friend tells me that he’s been seeing them snapping each other for MONTHS. He confessed the whole thing. He then blocked her in everything, deleted her number, and told me to forgive him...I legit forgave him that same night. But I told him my trust was broken and it wouldn’t be easy to be gained back. It’s been 6 months almost and it’s better but it’s not the same.. but it’s okay. We are happy. I’m relieved I didn’t have those attacks anymore, and I’ve never told him to stay away from any other girl except her. She randomly text him the other day.She told him that he has emotionally hurt her. That she had never had a closer friend and that by leaving her that he had made her fall into a deep depression. Then went in to say that this “him not being able to talk to her” thing was just childish of me. He felt terrible but..I don’t feel bad for her. I just don’t. For months she knew how I was feeling about their friendship, that it constantly made me feel uncomfortable and that I didn’t trust her. All she ever did was tell me I was being childish and dramatic. Too controlling of my boyfriend but look..I tried to be okay with it. I tried for years but the mentality it gave me wasn’t healthy. Now here she is blaming my boyfriend for her mental health. He’s not her friend like that my more, he shouldn’t have to take care for her.
She is a grown woman, and she needs to know how to take care of herself. She should’ve known (just like I told my boyfriend because it was mainly his fault too) that sneaking around behind my back wasn’t okay?",21Nov2019,1
660,"(Using a throwaway for obvious reasons)

Okay, so I know that what I'm doing is awful and I feel terrible about it so I just need some help with how to handle this situation the right way.

I went to my doctor a couple of months ago to get a referral to a therapist for my depression. Along side this, she prescribed me some Lexapro. Now here's where my issue is, I get extreme anxiety about being sick and I've never gotten an allergy test so I'm super anxious that I'm gonna be allergic to it and be sick, and also that I will experience side effects similar to being sick. So I explained to her my dilemma and she reassures me that I will be fine and that it rarely happens to people, and that she would really like me to take it as she says it will help me out quite well. She looked a little upset about the whole thing and I really just didn't want to argue, so I told her I would give it a try. 

I however still pick up the prescription thinking maybe I might have a change of thought. So my next appointment comes around for two weeks later so she can see how the Lexapro is working out for me. Only problem being, I never took it. So she asks me if it's doing me any good and I tell her it does help a little with my energy levels and getting up in the morning, and she tells me that as I keep taking it I should start to feel a little better. So now I have another appointment very soon with her and I am completely dreading it because I know I will have to lie to her again.

I don't know what to do because I don't want to have to fake feeling better because I actually want to get the help I need and I feel like I won't be getting as much as I need if she thinks I'm already doing better when I'm actually getting worse. I want to be honest with her and tell her how I actually feel but I can't because then she'll probably think 'oh I've got to bump the dosage up then because it's not working well enough' 

Please help me. I don't want to lie to my doctor anymore, but I don't want to come clean because then she will be very upset that I was dishonest with her. I haven't got a clue on what I should do in the situation because I've talked to some people I know irl about it and they haven't got a clue either. If anyone on here could help me out with this mess I would appreciate that a lot, thanks.",21Nov2019,1

665,"I am in my 30's, I have three sons, two in middle school and one in preK. One day a CPS worker shows up at my house and told me that she was called for a silly reason and everything could be cleared up quickly. Apparently someone at my son's preK school had complained that I showed up one day with powder on my nose, so they thought I was a crack addict. I happen to be 230+ Lbs, I am addicted to cake not coke. Never have I ever dated anyone who drinks, smokes, or does drugs. I haven't even tried weed before, so my pee is as clean as the day I was born. I told that CPS lady that my house stays spotless and my kids stay bruisless, and that I am so clean they can take a hair follicle test because from root to tip I am drugless. They have had me pee in a cup twice, and they still haven't closed the case. I forgot to mention, the only way I even knew she was coming to my house is because she texted my man and not me. For a month and a half my boyfriend would call me saying that the CPS lady had texted him and that we needed to go pee in a cup before 3pm that day, she never texted me about that. So the two times we had house visits and had to pee in a cup, I had to hear it from my man and not her. Then, ontop of that, she texts him one day and wants to do a meeting with just him and not me. Next day I started my period, and OMG, it hit me hard, I caved under all the stress and back stabbing and just cried. I knew I had to stop crying before my kids got out of school so I called CPS to get the name of a councilor, no answer from them, straight to voicemail. Then I called my son's school, they have a family advocate there that has a list of cheap or sometimes free councilors, straight to voicemail again. Then I called the MHMR (mental health place) to see if they had a list of cheap or free councilors, they gave me a number of this place that charges 10$ per hour. I called them up, told them about how this CPS chick was ghosting me, and just texting my man. Also how this all got started on a lie from a drama queen, who sees a fat chick with powder on her nose, mouth, and shirt and thinks ""ohhh she must be a crack addict !"", naw, I'm just messy with my food. I will tell you about this little powdered doughnut that started all of this, it was a Wal-Mart doughnut, they come in a six pack, and they are HUGE. They are filled with raspberry jelly, and not found in the bakery section, they are over by the snack cakes and the name brand is Great Value.  I happen to eat around the jelly part, then eat the jelly last, kind of like when I eat a 3  Musketeer bar, I eat the chocolate first then the nougat last, so yeah my fat butt got messy. Everytime I go shopping with my man now, and we go to the snack cake isle, he points to the powdered doughnuts and says ""look hun, your nose sugar !"". Anyways, this nice lady at the councilors office talked me down from crying, and asked me to confront the CPS lady or contact her supervisor since this issue was causing me stress. So I called up her manager and asked why my CPS case worker was ghosting me and just texting my man and having private meetings with him. So my case worker calls me back, she sent me tons of screenshots saying that this was proof that she didn't ghost me, IT WASN'T MY NUMBER ! I was horrified and embarrassed that she had texted some random person all of my personal information, where to meet, drug test details, my name, OMG it was super cringy to see all the text that some rando got instead of me. I got real depressed after that, I didn't feel like going out in public, I felt like all my privacy had been taken away from me and now someone out there knows all this CPS drama. Here I can hide under a fake name, but this random person she texted has my name, address, knows that i have an open CPS case UGH, it's just too much. After we told them that I started counseling, they sent a text saying they wanted me to get a psychiatric evaluation, and she also wanted to get two of my sons tested too. She said my oldest is violent, and my middle son is scared of him. This is untrue. My oldest son is in special ed, has been his whole life. During the CPS investigation, one of the teacher's aids came up to me after school, said that my son admitted to hitting another student, and that both of them had turns swinging at eachother in the gym. I asked to see the video tape, they told me I could not view it due to privacy, they would have to send it down to the police department, and they would blur out other the children's faces. So when the video was finally watched, it showed my kid doing a Fortnight dance, and this other kid said something to him and was laughing at him, so my kid starts getting close and yelling at him, then this dude just fake-out punches my boy (a fake out punch is when you pretend to punch someone but no physical contact is made) , so to conclude, the video proved that my son hit no one, and that other kid didn't hit my son, just fake-out air-punched him. It seems to me that my kid was taken aside and coached into saying that he hit this other kid first, but that might just be my paranoia speaking. I call it motherly instincts, my man call it paranoia, but whatever. People lie, video don't. My boy might have been coached into saying he hit this boy, or maybe they both said they hit eachother to act cool, like badboys, IDK. Either way my son is not violent. And my middle son isn't afraid of his big brother, but he is highly annoyed by him. My middle son is in gifted and talented, chess club, robotics club, and already knows what he wants to do for college. My middle son is annoyed when his brother taps his feet or makes noises with his mouth. I have to remind him to use words and not sounds. My oldest son recently got strep throat because he licked the classroom floor,(possibly for attention),which was non-hygienic because the janitor hadn't mopped yet, and there were still dead crickets near the edges of the walls. I told them my son isn't violent, then the next day the principle called me to take my son home because he assaulted a student. Apparently he was tapping his pencil on the desk, the pencil flew and hit the wall, bounced off the wall and hit this girl on the arm. I highly doubt that girl got hit hard enough to notice, much less cry. I do agree that he shouldn't be doing that, he has tons of immature behaviors, but to send him home and call it an assault, come on ! It's like they are reaching for something that isn't there. Ever since CPS got into my life this principle has been sending my son home for stupid stuff, like one time he sneezed, tried to wipe the snot off of his desk, and started putting his lunch money in his mouth and showing it to people, basically being a distraction. My oldest boy has autism, He is in physical therapy because he still has accidents where he poops and pees himself. I send him to school with an extra pair of undies, he doesn't have accidents every day, more like twice a week, sometimes less. He is a sweet boy, he helps me with laundry and dishes, I pay him 1$ per chore. Every week I take him to the store, and he buys things. One day, I was sick, I usually take my own groceries to my car, but this day I needed help because I was drowning on my own snot, I had a cold or something. So this lady helps me to the car, and my son offers to help her, she refuses and tells him its her job, and he told her that they don't pay her enough and gave her a tip out of his own money. Later, it broke my heart when he went to another store with me and came out with a blue necklace and earring and said it was for his teacher. Poor little boy doesn't realize that his teacher is the one who told CPS that he was violent and shouldn't be alone with his brothers, but to a little autistic boy, everyone who smiles to your face is your friend. My oldest son plays with tinker toys and wooden train tracks, and those wooden magnetic trains with his little brother who is in preK. My oldest is 13, but he is best friends with my 5yr old, they play with the same toys. He is mentally and emotionally delayed, but he is super sweet. Everytime I get him a haircut, he tips the lady who does his hair. I'm telling you, I could not have asked for any better, sweeter, kinder little boys, all three of them are good, well-behaved little guys. Now CPS wants to get my sons a psyche evaluation. This is too much. How do I get rid of CPS? All I want for Christmas is my CPS case closed. I need prayers and advise please! God bless!",21Nov2019,1

668,"I am about to turn 32 years old, and I really want to start a family.  I have student loans and debt and am the youngest child in a large family -- most of my older siblings seem to view me as immature, although I've been a manager and was independent all through my 20s.  

I moved in with one of my sisters recently to save money and do a certificate program, so that I can change careers into a more profitable one (I was a teacher and just not making enough money to save or pay off my debts).  

Outwardly I'm really gungho about this new career (and I am truly super excited about it -- I love it!) but privately I really just want to be a Mom.  I strongly believe that one parent at least should stay home full-time while a child is young... so this has distracted me from really throwing myself 100 % into my career.   I recently started dating someone who I am totally in love with and who also wants to start a family, but I know we should a) probably date at least a couple years before we get married and b) aren't in the best position financially to start a family.  Worse, my sister doesn't believe that I'm really in love with this person, but thinks that I'm acting rashly because I just want to have kids.  She also keeps telling me that I have plenty of time, even a decade to have kids, and that I absolutely have to be in a way better financial situation before I should even consider it, AND she doesn't want me to be dependent on a guy at all, especially not one that I've only known a little while. 

Honestly I think because I'm older and also worked with this person, (so I got to see them in lots of different contexts) I am a pretty good judge of what I want in a relationship and a good judge of character.  Ideally we'd date for a few years before having kids but I feel like that ship has sailed.  I'd be down to get engaged 6 months or a year from now and start having kids right away.

674,"I am a college student trying to make a little extra money on the side and figured a part time job would be great. My major is quite difficult and to me school always comes first because it's the door way to achieve my goals. When I applied for this job and also when I attended orientation I was assured they understood that school comes first since many of their employees are part time students. The problem came a few days ago when I had to choose between a rock and a hard place. I had a important meeting about a bad group project grade that resulted from a huge lack of effort and communication on the parts of two other group members. I didn't feel this should reflect my grade because I worked hard to finish my part on time and made sure to reach out to group members about helping with any lacking sections. Our group had to meet with our professor but the only day and time available was  30 minutes before my shift began. An important detail to add is that they did not post my shift until sunday night two days before this meeting. As I said before my education always comes first and unfortunetly I was a few minutes late to my shift. My employer then decided to write me up, which I understand and took with a grain of salt. Keep in mind this was my first offence and week on the job. When going through the write up I politely explained my stance on how school will come first and I apologized for my mistake. They then decided to cut my pay and hours. To be honest this makes having the job less beneficial to me especially with the short notice of scheduling. I'm a little reluctant to quit since it's only been one week but if my employers don't understand that this isn't my priority then I don't think this is a good fit for me. Should I continue with this job or leave it now?",21Nov2019,1
675,this guy is really in love with me and kind of obsessive.  he won’t drop it no matter what I do or say. We used to be really good friends but a couple weeks ago he tried to commit suicide and was very manipulative towards me during that whole situation. And we haven’t been the same since. I don’t have the balls to block him but I also don’t want to talk to him anymore (or at least for a while.) how do I get him to let go of me?,21Nov2019,1

678,"So around 2 weeks ago, my girlfriend was driving to work in the morning and somebody was apparently very agitated and kept on aggressively honking at her for no reason. He then zoomed past her, cut her off, and slammed on his breaks. He kept on beeping her and doing this cut off/break/beeping. She got away somehow and was very shaken up, but brushed it off. 

This week she returned to work after being OOO and was driving to work when the EXACT SAME GUY &amp; car started beeping her from a mile away. He zoomed all the way to catch up to her, did the same thing. Cut her off, slammed on breaks, beeped her non-stop for around 10 minutes. Everywhere she turned, he followed. He was screaming at her at the top of his lungs. At one point he did an illegal U-turn and appeared ready to slam into her car. She panicked, &amp; drove into her work parking garage. Probably a bad move as now he knows where she works, but forgivable in such a stressful situation.

Is there anything she can do? I'm really scared for her and I feel helpless. She has a photo of his face from the side mirror and has a photo of his license plate and car. 1st time being road-rage was okay to brush off. But the fact that he recognized her car TWO weeks later and did the same aggressive craziness is very scary. I'm just not sure what we can do besides worry constantly about her.",21Nov2019,1

680,"My parents have hosted X mas at their suburban house for at least 30 yrs. I think i might have even been the one that suggested it over my grandparents tiny house in the middle of Boston. My great grandmother in particular was a huge gift giver and literally the gifts alone would take up 2/3 of the living room, people couldn’t fit, plus the parking nightmare, my parents house is much better on both counts.

So my parents have been hosting all these years and my mom has always gone all out, decorating, cleaning and of course making a huge dinner for anywhere between 12-30 people.  It’s a ton of work for both my mom and my dad.

As i’ve gotten older i have made whatever my mom wanted, usually an appetizer or side dish or both to take some of the pressure off, and helped with hosting,  taking coats, drink orders, running extra chairs up and down the stairs, given how much work it was, and bc i’m an only child, there was no one else.

The problem was after my great grandmother, our family matriarch, died in 2003, the holiday spirit just dwindled. my mom is also an only child, and my dads side usually does something else, so basically all the people have been coming are my grandmothers sisters kids and their kids, and their kids, cousins, you get the picture. 

I have no love lost for any of these people, and am pretty open about that fact. for reasons that don’t matter, i’m neutral on perhaps 3 of them, the rest, of i never see them again it’ll be too soon. 

For the reasons that DO matter it’s bc of how they’ve treated this event (and therefore my parents) over the years, from not rsvping either way (so my mother makes sit down dinner for 25 and 12 show up) to showing up late, to showing up high, to never offering to help, let alone bring something, or even a hostess gift for my parents, to letting their brats run wild in my parents nice house breaking things, it’s just disgusting. 

They show up once a year for a free meal and free booze, then aren’t to be seen or heard from beyond grapevine gossip (which i also abhor) until the next year rolls around. 

Yet still my parents did it every year, the one exception to this was the year my grandfather (my moms father) was in hospice care. My mom STILL felt obligated to host these assholes, and she was extremely torn about it until i told her she could do what she wanted but I would be with her dad regardless. I guess faced with their only child not attending got through and she canceled and we were with him that year. He died the next day. So as you can see, she felt very obligated to host. 

My mom was diagnosed with multiple myeloma last January and has been having weekly chemo treatments ever since. She is 72, and a frail lady to begin with, so this has taken a great deal out of her. Last spring she already was talking about not hosting again, as it was too much for her. I of course agreed, and we planned a trip, tough to host if you’re out of the country right?

But we canceled that trip months ago, bc she’s so frail, and instead I planned to host my parents at my condo, myself them and my boyfriend only. Usually i host a holiday party for my friends and parents of course some time in December, so this wasn’t a big deal for me and i still intend to do it. My parents decided to host my boyfriend and me for Thanksgiving, so end of story. 

The advice piece (and i’m sorry it took so long to get to it) is that while i know it would mean a lot to my mom for me to do the full meal, tree, decorations etc, I just can’t connect with it. Last year I got very ill, and ended up having to have 4 GI surgeries between August and April, with an ileostomy for most of that time. It was reversed, so you’d think i’d be happy, but I still have a lot of issues, and eating isn’t really my friend anymore. 

Also i got the green light to go back to work in July, only to get let go bc of all my health problems 2 weeks later from a job that had changed my life financially, and now i’m unemployed, and entitled to collect but it’s far less than i used to make, and bc i got a settlement the state is holding up actually paying me my benefits so despite having to file every week which is very humiliating , i haven’t gotten any money yet. 

Bc of my job loss, we had to move and while our place now has some advantages, it’s very bittersweet for me.  My boyfriend has struggled to find work, and depression and anxiety have been a huge burden for me.  We fight a lot too, like most people struggling financially. 

I don’t take care of myself anymore (hair, nails, eating etc) and rarely leave the house in part bc of my ongoing health issues, in part bc of my depression. Yes i do go to counseling but the copay is a lot and i can’t really afford it.

Despite having an ostomy bag last year at this time and being so sick, my overall prospects still looked bright. Last year I was in the hospital on Thanksgiving and still hosted my holiday party 2 weeks later, and i took a lot of pride in giving nice gifts i could never afford to give before to people i love in my beautiful home. 

Now everything is different, and it breaks my heart i can’t meet the bar I myself raised. My fridge is pretty empty most of the time, and i don’t know how i can afford gifts for my parents at all so how can i spend money on a christmas tree? I suggested i could make a lasagna type meal instead of the traditional turkey and a million sides bc do people really need to eat the same big meal 2x in a month? but my dad pitched a fit, so turkey mashed potatoes stuffing etc will all be present somehow.

Aside from the money, due to all of this I just do not feel like celebrating anything. I know it would mean a lot to my mom, ironically i took her to a major medical appt recently and she was told she was responding extremely well to her treatments and her cancer is being managed, but in that same appt found out since i have the autoimmune issues that caused all my health issues in the last yr, I am predisposed to the same and other cancer problems she has so i have to go for testing, so even good news for her was bad news for me. 

I’m just struggling every day to do the bare minimum, but no matter how i try to explain this to my mom, she keeps asking about things like holiday tablecloths, etc and it takes all of me not to snap at her, and sometimes i fail and feel even worse.

My grandmother is dead now too, so it really is just the three of us and my boyfriend. I absolutely will host my family (oh and did i mention we have to move again 12/1?) but am i truly the monster she implies i am for doing just that, hosting a dinner for parents rather than throwing the festive party she wants? How can i help her find compassion for me if i even deserve it?

681,"Here's some context: 
My landlords are a sweet and active older couple (around 65-70 yrs old) and they have three children of adult age. Their daughter who lives with them is about my age and has the exact same name as me so their family and me were immediately on good terms. Especially since their family is really similar to mine (similar interests, nice family, friendly etc). 

I've been living in the bachelor (basement) they rent for about a year and we always have a nice chat whenever I go give them the rent money. 

However yesterday, my landlord texts me asking if I wanted to eat lunch with him. He is often alone upstairs because his wife often goes out and their daughter is working during the day. We ate and it was relaxed and a nice chat while I also brought some of my leftover food to share. 

However, my parents became immediately suspicious that an older man invited me (alone) to share lunch with him. Which made me scared in turn (i'm scared easily since I know that anybody can be an aggressor...).

So am I too suspicious or is it ok to just relax and consider this as a friendly invitation?",21Nov2019,1
682,"Hi all. The title explains the gist of my situation. Right now I am in the middle of an application process for a new position in my company, and my chances are looking pretty positive. It is a role that would give better pay, better career opportunities, and would give me the opportunity to work on projects I genuinely care about. All around, it feels like the right move for my career.

The role would require me to relocate to a different city. This would come with the drawback of leaving a volunteering position with the YMCA I committed to, where I have been tutoring and building a mentoring relationship with a child. 

I feel that I would be committing a huge wrongdoing if I leave this kid in the middle of a commitment I made to him. I also feel that losing out on this job would be a huge missed opportunity for my career.

What do you all think? Should I try and put off a start date for a new job until I have finished my volunteering commitment or would that be too big a risk? Should I prioritize the volunteering since I committed to it first? If I had to back out on the volunteering, what would be an appropriate way to soften the blow (donation, find a replacement, etc.)?

I appreciate any thoughts.",21Nov2019,1

691,"Hello everyone,

In case anyone is wondering, yes I'm in high school, so this bullshit drama shouldn't even be happening. However, since my brain is the size of a pea I would like some advice regarding a situation I'm horrible at explaining myself, so I apologize for any misunderstandings

To set the situation, I would like to get some back story going. The problem revolves around L (using anonymous names to be safe). L has been my best friend since 3rd grade, and is one of my favorite people. L is a weird dude, but that's okay because that's what makes him special. However, L is also awkward in his own weird way, meaning he sometimes says things that sound cruel or rude. Me and him were best friends, then we went to different middle schools. This is where I met the rest of my friends

I'm not gonna list off my everyone of my friends, but one that is significant to this story is P. P was the first friend I met in middle school, and was one of the kindest, charming, and funniest people I met. It was really hard to make him angry, but when he was he would be pissed off at you for a long time. 

Eventually when we all entered high school, me, Z, and all the other friends I met in middle school (including P) all became one friend group. It was great freshman year, and we all got along and hung out all the time. However, sophomore year this changed. P found this girl, the girl led him on, and P was upset, but doesn't really show it that much. P at some point addressed this issue to Z, and which he responded ""oh, you still like her?"" P was already annoyed at Z fro past things (as stated before, he's a weird dude), but this pissed him off over the tipping point. P blocked him on every social media and just started ignoring him (silent treatment style and all). Since P is so kind of a ""cool dude"", all of my other friends followed the ""yeah fuck Z he's annoying"" band wagon, and cut off all contact with him as well. I'm gonna admit, I did it as well, and we all made a separate group chat and didn't talk to him for the rest of sophomore year and summer.

 This year during September (I'm not a junior), I realized how horrible of a person I am (for this reason and others), and tried to make it all up. Obviously, I started by apologizing to Z. Looking back, I still don't understand why I did Z like that, ignoring someone who would take a bullet for me just because he was different. I'm fully aware of how horrible this is, and I addressed this to him. Z was somehow not mad at me at all, and was just happy I was friends with him again. I talked to my other friends about him and they've came to the conclusion of ""Yeah, I agree that was bad, lets be friends with him again"". However, almost none of them  are doing any of this (actually, only 2/6 of my other friends are actually doing it). They're still talking in a separate group chat, not talking to him, and avoid talking about him in general. We made a new one with him in it, but no ones talking. I tried to address this, and they come up with excuses on why they aren't talking with things like ""oh, well we can't just pretend that nothing happened"". This doesn't make sense to me. So are we just gonna continue to act like its happening?

Sorry for the long read, I just want everyone to be friends again, and I don't understand what to do. My other friends (including P somewhat) are kinda being assholes, but I don't want to hurt their or Z's feelings. What can I do just to get everyone back together?",21Nov2019,1
692,"Weird question but does anyone else feel like their body over compensates for winter and feels way hotter then in the summer? I feel rather regular tempature in the summer, but winter I could wear the same clothes outside and my body starts heating up",21Nov2019,1
693,"Hey r/Advice, I tried posting this in r/relationship_advice but nobody responded to it. This is going to be a long read, I want to be as descriptive as possible because I am in a situation I've never encountered and I want to do it justice. Thank you in advance to whoever takes the time to read this. 

During college, I (22M) became very close with a friend (24F) and we have been best friends for a little over 2 years now. This is a strictly platonic relationship, but it was also very emotional. I have never had a long term girlfriend, so from an emotional standpoint she is probably the closest i have ever to been to a person not related to me. For the better part of the last 2 years we have talked to each other just about every day and we hung out around once a week, but there were stretches where we would hang out multiple times a week. 

My problem right now is that she recently started dating a guy and for the last couple months she has become very distant. I want to be clear that I have no problem with her dating someone, I am 100% happy for her but this situation has really taken a toll on me. Over the last couple years I have really loved having someone who texts me just to see how I am doing, comes to me for emotional support, and who takes an interest in my life while telling me about theirs. I guess now her boyfriend is that person to her so she doesn't need to come to me for that stuff anymore, but now that is a glaring hole in my life. 

For the last couple of weeks I have been angry with her, and i finally decided that i need to look at the situation less emotionally. I can completely understand why she is talking to me less, because she has every right to prioritize her boyfriend over me. She used to tell me all the time how I am such a great friend and shes so happy I came into her life, so it baffles me that she could throw me aside so easily the second something more fulfilling comes around. Now whenever I think of her or see her Instagram stories i just become really sad, because i feel like our friendship is on the decline. She also started dating a guy for a few months about a year ago, and the same thing happened. When they broke up, I convinced myself this would not happen again, and now I am feeling like a fool. This situation makes me feel really shitty, because it makes me feel like I am just a placeholder. I feel like when she is happy in a relationship I am not needed in her life, but when she is single and feeling lonely she showers me with attention and tries to spend as much time as possible with me. 

Maybe I am overreacting, but is this fair? I care about her and I am happy that she is happy, but the realization i am coming to is that the happiest version of her life has a very small role for me apparently. About 6 months ago she sat me down and had a conversation with me telling me that I better not forget about her and still find time for her when i get a girlfriend. But she is doing exactly what she felt like she needed to warn me about.

Please do not take this as me being possessive over her, I completely respect that she needs to go with what makes her happiest. I am at peace with the fact that maybe she wants me as a regular friend now, who she hangs out with only every once in awhile, and does not feel the need to talk to often. The problem with that is that i do not know if I can just be regular friends with her, a big reason I liked spending time with her so much was because it felt different from my regular friendships. There was something special to it, and now its gone. The gap between what we were and what we are now feels so large, that i do not know if I can get over it. 

I am going to see her (for the first time this month) on Saturday, and I am planning on talking about all this with her. I am not going to be judgmental, I want to let her know that i understand why she has less time for me while also sharing with her that its making me feel unappreciated. I do not want to lose this friendship, but I also feel like if this is how its going to be from now on I cant ignore my own feelings just to salvage it.

If any of you have advice on about this situation, please share. My goal is to let her know how i am feeling and hopefully talk it out and find a solution with her. I hope I am not out of line feeling this way, everyone has a right to pursue their own happiness.

Through some good ol childhood trauma I wrote off the idea of kids, but as an adult I started to see more how i’m not a reflection of my parents and warmed up to the idea. On her end, her whole life she’s always wanted children and to be a mother. 

The main issue is this: I want to be able to live my own life before i devote it to my children. I still want kids, but she want some them sooner than I do and with the upbringing I had, i wasn’t allowed to be my own person and I want that as an adult before my life becomes just being a mother. 

She says she understand, but i know it’s hard on her to have to wait longer on this And in my eyes we aren’t financially or mentally stable enough now anyway to have children. All in all i want her to be happy, but i know i will be unhappy if we have children before I get my chance to travel, explore, etc. Any advice is helpful

706,"I started dating a guy online, I considered online relationships a joke but I just ended a nasty long relationship and I thought this would be a safe way to kinda get a feel for it again. Originally it wasn’t supposed to be serious and I told him that.. in fact I actually pursued one of his friends first but when he showed no interest I backed off out of respect and just nabbed someone already throwing themself at me. We both were coming out of toxic relationships and both had a drinking problem.. so together we quit drinking and would talk constantly. It was nice at first because I was never able to be this open with someone.. I literally spilled my guts to this guy. I don’t know why, I was just being stupid I guess. He would always buy me stuff, pay my bills and etc. and said he was doing it out of kindness because I was struggling so much with mental stuff but then he started asking for favors and as his online gf I thought “sure why not, I mean I do it for free anyway” but when I would be too tired from work (working a full time job that still barely afford my bills) he would become abusive. 

I’m telling you all that to say this

At some point in time I forgot that this was supposed to not be serious for us both.. but then he started saying I love you and at first he said it was okay if I didn’t love him but after a week he started crying and saying it made him feel worthless when I wouldn’t. I felt horrible because at the end of the day this person was to me still someone I cared very much for so I started saying it.

Anyway one things leads to another after about a year of this I decide “I should end it now. This has gone too far and too long”

He started saying things, in so many words, saying he would seriously hurt or kill himself or someone else if I ever left. He KNEW about the friend I originally had a hella crush on..and even went as far to say he might do something to him in spite of me. After awhile of this he stopped, and was a good guy again..I decided maybe I should give him a chance (dumb duuuuumb duuuumb) and move to his area ( holy shit dumb)

He’s like dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.. I feel so embarrassed cause at my age I should be more aware and know better but honestly I put myself in this position so it’s all on me to fix I just don’t know how to

We have been now dating for a couple years and I’m terrified to leave him. I live in his state, he knows where I live. I got a gun (the legal way) without telling him because there have been a few times he became physical in a non obviously abusive way. I have told him how uncomfortable that behavior makes me, he says sorry but does it again and says “it’s my emotions, sometimes I can’t control them” (red fucking flag, childhood trauma, flashbacks of shit)

I know this is all a train wreck.. but what should I do. I’m going to move cities but not tell him where I live and then try to do it. I’m not sure how effective it is. I tried going to the cops but they said I could maybe put a restraining order on him unless I can get physical evidence he is dangerous to me or somebody else.

It’s pathetic I know. I pretty much cry most nights cause I realize I’m the dumbass who put myself in this position.

Also sorry, I suck at writing anything.

Tl;dr dumbass stays in an obvious toxic relationship but is too scared to leave due to threats on his own life or others. He has also threatened blackmail of x rated pics, saying he’d share them and hide any evidence of it so I couldn’t do anything about it.",21Nov2019,1

I tried to not smoke a joint one night last week, and after the time I usually smoke a joint I felt like I was having a panic attack that lasted for hours until i called my dealer at like 9pm because I knew I would not be able to fall asleep. just knowing that the weed was on the way made the anxiety stop completely. 

I hate living like this, I get nothing done. my marks in college have gone from high 90s to below 50 since the start of the semester, because I can't do homework at night because I'm too high. Its destroyed my friendships and relationships, it takes all my money, I don't have dreams when i sleep anymore, i go to sleep too late because i have to smoke another joint just to sleep, and when i wake up it usually takes about an hour to become conscious enough to move. I'ts caused me so many problems that i just want to smoke more weed to forget about them and escape the stress.

I can't live like this anymore, I need to stop but dont know how and I need advice. I have no friends left in my life to ask and my parents are completely clueless. I still want to smoke weed once in a while, i just need to stop smoking two joints every day just to cope with the fact that i exist. My insurance covers a psychiatrist so I am probably going to book an appointment with one, but any advice you guys can give me on this would be immensely appreciated as i feel genuinely lost for the first time in my life.

TL;DR  My reliance on cannabis is ruining every aspect of my life and I don't know how to stop.",21Nov2019,1
710,"So I am a 13 year old girl and let me tell you, I am NOT a nice person and it’s hard acting like one. So I recently moved to a new school and this dude kept on saying hi and bye and stuff but then he started sitting down and talking to me. I tried giving him hints in my rude way by just keeping my eyes on my book and acting like I can’t hear him but he still sticks around AND he asked me if I want to go out sometime and I was shocked because, I really dislike him. I know he’s trying to be nice but I moved to a new school in a new continent. Germany. If you know any phrases of rejection that work really well, (in German) that would be appreciated. I tried typing rejections into google translate but it just doesn’t sound right. I can speak and read and write a bit of German so if you have any phrases please please please write them done.

711,"Growing up I always wanted to have either a cat or a dog but never had one because of my allergies and my parents not wanting to take on the responsibility. Now I'm 24, in college, I've been moved out for about 3 years and I really want to get a cat. My allergies have gotten better with age and I've found a few hypoallergenic cats at my local animal shelter. I've already spoken to my roommates who are all okay with me getting one. 

But there are some obstacles,

1. My apartment doesn't allow pets so I would have to register the cat as an ESA. I'm on anxiety medication but I'm not sure if that enough to qualify me for one.
2. I don't have a ton of money or free time, I think I have enough for the cat but I'm not entirely sure.
3. My parents really don't want me to get one.

The last issue seems to be the main one despite me being grown and out of the house. My dad is still paying my rent so I'm not going to go against his wishes and get a cat anyway. Here are the reasons they're giving me not to get one, They are stressed out, they are losing money on their condo, my allergies, the holidays coming up, my apartment being too small, and my apartment not allowing pets.

Some of these reasons don't seem to be related in my opinion. My parents have been telling me for the past year that I should wait until I graduate but I'm worried that's just their way of putting off the conversation until then and then they'll come up with other reasons why I shouldn't get a cat. They themselves have a pet cat now that I like to spend time with when I visit. I've considered taking on the responsibilities of caring for it (food, litter box, ect.) while I'm there for Thanksgiving to show that it's no big deal and I can easily keep up with it.

Should I just give up and wait until I can afford to move out and pay for my own place to get a cat? Or should I keep trying to convince my parents?

Part of me wants to just get the cat anyway since they can't technically stop me but, like I said, they pay my rent and phone bill so I don't feel right doing that.",21Nov2019,1

TL,DR at the bottom :)

I really want my relationship to work out, we have the same values, I love talking to him, I am really attracted to him phisically and we have the same goals for the future, but when it comes to the bedroom he only thinks about himself. I feel like I have tried everything in these 10 months that we are together. I am afraid if this does not work itself out, all the other great things we have will not be enough to sustain the realtionship. We have talked about marriage, having kids, and we already live together. So far I have tried: - going to a psichologist and sexologist, we did several sessions of couple´s therapy and she said we cannot force him to do anything.-giving both subtle and very direct directions on what I want him to do - asking him why he is not thinking about my pleasure in bed,( because it feels degrading to have to ask everytime) and he says it´s because he gets too excited and in the moment and forgets to think about me - I have tried controling and telling him what to do and slowing down the situation -I have tried bringing toys - suggesting him to masturbate, you name it, I have tried it. I have had only two orgasms in 10 months and I am usually very easy to orgasm. When he does do something to give me pleasure it´s for a very short period of time and rushes to go back to receiving pleasure. He is horny all the time and me too, I just don´t feel excited to have sex with him because he is the only one that enjoys it. A couple of days ago I was in bed with him and he wanted to go straight to penetration like always and I asked: are you thinking about my pleasure, at all? he said: no. And that really hurt my feelings, we just stopped and I just went to bed. He knows exactly what I like and don´t like, which is basically doing caressing and hand and mouth stuff before we go into sex, but he just wants me to do it to him and go straight to sex and then be done. He seems in a hurry. He gives me all the excuses, it´s because I´m too sexy and hot, it´s because he has to work the next day, It´s because he wants to go out on the weekends, because he is sleepy, there is just never a convenient time for him to take the time to care for me sexually, in bed. He apologizes everytime, recognizes it is not fair and he should be reciprocating. He sais he thinks he could eventually become better at giving me pleasure, but in ten months he is just giving excuses after excuses. I am really torn, any advice or opinion is welcome, Thank you for reading.

TL,DR: he apologizes and gives excuses and promises next time will be better. but after 10 months I feel fooled.",21Nov2019,1

Hi all. I am a 17 y/o and the person this post about is 16 and has diagnosed anxiety and (?) maybe depression. 

So, we are currently in secondary school during a somewhat stressful school year. I had noticed that my friend had been acting up lately in the recent week or two; staring off into the distance, not saying a word to anyone in the friendgroup, and so on. I thought this was weird but decided not to ask as her text messages to me outside of school were fine, and she never acted this way when it was just her and I.. Though, after a while, her texts were slightly more complacent and etc. At this point, I was having slight suspicions though I didn’t want to assume anything.. 

Then she told her maths teacher about her anxiety issues coming back (note that he was her teacher from previous years and had known about her anxiety..) so he began to take her out of class, talk to her after class, and etc. A few of my friends thought it was super inappropriate and weird for a 16 y/o girl to be alone with a 40+ year old man who was skipping his own classes to talk to her and help her with her anxiety; but we all stayed quiet. 

One day at school, she left early and texted me; she wanted to commit suicide (not her first time apparently) and of course, I was shocked, hurt, confused, etc. In fact, I was in such a state of shock that I had to share the news onto ONE trustworthy friend and he helped me message her to convince her to not take her life.. Since then, she’s been missing a lot of class.. The teacher who helps her with her anxiety has sent her to in-school counselling (He does NOT know about the suicidal urge she had) and she often leans on this weird line between me telling him and me not telling him? As in, she’d text me something similar to, “By the way, if you want to tell Mr (teacher) about my suicidal thoughts, you can but just say it’s a theory.. You don’t have to if you don’t want to.” 

I want to tell our designated liaison person about this and she isn’t actually aware of that.. It’s getting too stressing and she keeps talking about how she has no motivation to do anything, go to school, etc. The only problem is that I wont be in much next week due to appointments so I’m scared I won’t be there if something happens. Also, when someone is at a risk of killing themselves or hurting others/etc where I’m from, they are basically banned from going to school until provided with a doctors’ note saying that they are safe to come back (I dunno if this is different in other places). My biggest fear is that if I report her issue to the designated liaison person, she will be banned and well, it’s way safer for her to be at school than home alone…

She won’t listen to me when I talk to her about getting help; she claims that it won’t work and that she can’t find any reason to live even though she’s so young and impressionable! I’m really trying not to be naive but in general, I’m really bad at dealing with other people’s problems. This whole thing was sort of forced onto me and I’m starting to genuinely lose my mind.. 

What should I do? Should I tell the designated liaison person and risk her being home alone? Should I just suffer in silence? What can I genuinely do?",21Nov2019,1

717,"I don't like using the term trigger warning, but some of it might be disturbing for sensitive readers. 

So to explain the situation:

My cousin is three years younger than me. When we were kids, our families would get together at my grandma's and we would spend some time together there. It took place pretty frequently, I'd say maybe five times a year. I have two younger cousins and two older cousins. All of them girls, now women. I'm a guy. I've always had a great relationship with all of them, even to this day and even with the one mentioned in the title. I still sometimes see them but but as often as I used to. I get along best with her older sister, the 2nd youngest cousin. She spent some time at my parent's house during the summer while I was there too, we played PC games, went out etc. 

Anyway, back to the point. When I was 11 and she was 8, we played at my grandma's house. What started as an innocent game took a weird (and unfortunate) turn not much later. We played this game called ""digging"", where we would jump in beds and then cover each other with as many blankets as possible. We would do it all together, me, my older brother and my two younger cousins. But then, me and the youngest cousin would do it alone, just the two of us. And we would kiss. Not actually only kiss, but full blown make out sessions. I don't remember it well but I'm hundred percent sure I was the one to initiate it. This happened on several other occasions and as much as I hate to admit, it didn't stay at only that. The following thing might've happened once or twice. I pulled down her panties and I would kiss above the area of her private parts. I think I was 12 and she was 9 the last time it happened and then it just stopped, we might have kissed a few times more, I really don't remember, since it was a pretty long time ago. 
She never resisted, she never told me to stop, she never told me she didn't like it. But that means nothing. Maybe she was scared of me, maybe she felt like she couldn't have said anything... I really don't know. There's also a possibility she felt the same way I did and was curious. I don't know her stance at all. For some reason, I feel like I messed up and I think it wasn't just us being curious, I think I was at fault. But I'll never know unless I ask her and try to deal with the past. It's been eating me alive for the past couple of years. I really want to close this part of our lives and deal with it. If I hurt her I want to apologize as well as I can, try to show compassion and do what's necessary. If I didn't, I still want to make sure so I that I could be at peace. 

She's 18 now and I'm 21. I used to go to therapy and I mentioned it during one of our sessions, but we never really got far. I told him that I thought I hurt her and needed to sort it out with her. He proposed the idea of her being just as curios as I was. I really don't know. 

How should I approach her about it and talk about the issue? It might be possibly a really sensitive topic and I don't want to trigger any bad memories. It will be tough to talk about either way (whether it was hurtful for her or not). Any help will be appreciated. 

TL;DR: I did sexual things with my cousin when we were kids, I don't know if it hurt her, I'm really sorry about it and don't know how to bring it up.",21Nov2019,1

720,"Hey, first of all excuse all the mistakes I'll make during writing this, I'm not a native speaker.
Now to the story: a friend of mine (He is in my class, we're about to finish school (germany)) came talking to me about  himself, telling me that he wasn't feeling well since a while. He did this a couple of times allready and it alsways turned out to be not as serious as it looked like when He described it to me (it was usually things like him not being satisfied with his grades or his position in the friend group (we're in a really small class so there basically only is ONE friend group)). But this time he started making jokes about suicide, or at least at first I took it as a joke cause this kinda goes with his sense of humor but as all the others left he got really serious and told me that he had totally lost his perspective in life and that he really didn't believe in feeling happy or satisfied with his options after finishing school. As far as I can tell he doesn't really have problemes with his parents apart from the casual parents-teenager-fights. He is quite unstable socially (he never hangs out with the same people for more than a few days and never really gets into their ""shit"" like he clearly acts as an outsider to the group. I've been friends with him for now nearly five years and I now that he enjoys people eventhough he can't really manage to fit it. So what he is telling me now is that he doesn't feel like the class is accepting him the way he is (compared to others he seems quite unorganized and ""lost"", also smokes weed on a regular base and I now that he tried a couple of way garder drugs) and I recognized that people wouldn't alsways invite to their parties anymore since like a few months. Personally I don't really have a problem with him but I guess I get their point, He can be quite annoying sometimes.
Allright so what he has been telling me recently is that he really doesn't know how go on with his life, that whatever he does it won't really make sense to him or make him feel good/happy/satisfied. And the way he described thinking of suicide really shocked me, there was nothing in his voice that would have made it possible for me to judge wether he was joking or not and no matter what I said he kept on telling me that he couldn't help but totally lose his perspective on life.
I'm not a pro psychologist so I can't really figure out how to react. I'm afraid of making it worse by taking it to seriously and stressing him out by talking to him about it, but I also don't to want to end up by not taking it as serious as I should.
As far as he told me I'm the only one who knows about this (He usually tells more people about his problems so I'd consider this a rather serious case)

I would just be happy to know if you guys have maybe witnessed similar things or if you just have any advices on how to react

721,"So I'm legally an adult but just barely. Up until recently my dad and I had no issues. I do have a mom who was as abusive as she could get away with, luckily I never got hit.

728,"First things first. Obligatory statements: first post in this sub, on mobile, English is my first language but I’m still human etc. This is long so I apologize in advance, but it just happened and I want to be sure to include enough info. 

So let’s get into it:

For a little back story, I quit my job about 6 months ago and have been living off savings while teaching myself programming to make a career switch. About a month ago I moved in with my girlfriend (GF) to save money. She was living with a roommate (Kim) for about a year at that point. Throughout the time they have lived together her roommate was seeing a guy we’ll call Mac. Mac spent a lot of time with Kim at the apartment, and would often stay the night. Over time he spent more and more time at the apartment, to the point he was basically living there. This was fine, although GF wasn’t always thrilled that he wasn’t contributing to rent/bills considering how often he was there. But it wasn’t a huge problem and she never pushed the issue. 

Over the summer it was decided that Mac would move in when his own lease ended, and a couple of weeks later we agreed I would move in as well. Kim gave some pushback to me moving in because of space, but ultimately it was decided that if Mac could move in, then I could as well. 

During those discussions GF also asked that they reevaluate the division of rent. Kim has the master bedroom which is larger, has a larger closet, and a private bathroom. They had been splitting the rent 50/50, but with more people, more space is a luxury, so she asked to split the rent 60/40 instead. This ruffled Kim’s feathers and she agreed begrudgingly, but proceeded to be very cold/give GF the silent treatment, or be downright rude, for several months. 

Mac and I moved in around the same time and things have mostly been fine. I have known Kim and Mac for just as long as I’ve known GF because we all used to work together, and we always had a friendly relationship. So I decided to do my best to try and make everyone comfortable, and act as a buffer between my GF and Kim/Mac since I still have a decent relationship with both of them. I’ve been doing extra cleaning around the house, as well as just being an especially conscientious roommate. 

So that brings us to today. I’ve been under the weather and not sleeping well so I let myself sleep in this morning. At around 10:20 I received a message from Mac accusing me of going into his and Kim’s room. I didn’t respond since I was sleeping, so he called me in a rage about 5 minutes later saying he knew I went in their room, he has “proof,” I have violated their space, and they can’t live with someone they don’t trust. He told me we have to have a sit down and talk with all the roommates to hash this out and to leave them both alone until we all talk (fine by me). He also made threatening statements to the effect that I’m lucky he’s not home or we wouldn’t just be talking but that’s beside the point. This came as a shock to me because I have never gone anywhere near their room, let alone going inside it without permission. 

Through a lot of back and forth in our group text, Kim and Mac say they have heard someone open the door to their room while they have been inside sleeping on several occasions, so to confirm it, before jumping to conclusions, they set a trap. It came out that their “trap” was taping a strand of hair across the door so it would break if someone opened it. Kim returned home early since she’s sick as well, and found that the trap was disturbed. Queue her calling Mac upset, and him calling to flip out on me. 

I told them I was happy to talk, but I have categorically never gone in their room. The closest I have come to being in their room is when I’ve stepped just inside the doorway to chat with them while they are in the room. 

After about two hours Mac called back and apologized for how he spoke to me during the first call and we were able to hash things out a bit, but he also said their trap being disturbed still doesn’t add up and we all need to talk. I continued to assert my innocence and even offered to help them set up a camera in their room if it will make them more comfortable. 

I’ve been hiding out in our room all day, trying to avoid Kim who is home sick, and generally trying to figure out what the heck is happening. GF thinks Kim is just trying to stir up issues because she has no grounds to be upset with my conduct as a roommate, and Mac and I have been friends, so he tends to give me the benefit of the doubt. Kim is the one who found the trap disturbed so it is feasible that she simply stated she found it disturbed to upset Mac and gain support to cause problems, but it strains credulity for me to think this is all a calculated setup. I always tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. 

If you made it through all that and have any thoughts I would really appreciate some input. How do I handle this? I can’t prove I was asleep, or that I DIDN’T go in their room (no way to prove the absence of that action). Am I being naive to think Kim didn’t set me up to cause drama?

740,"I’m in college right now. My sister is a freshman in high school, roughly 2 hours from where I live. She’s super academically inclined, does a lot of extracurriculars, and generally has a lot of friends. We have usual sibling spats, but I take her out to eat when I’m home and we generally have a good time together.

Last night, one of her friends attempted suicide. I won’t go into specifics, but my sister was the one to receive a final text, and she then notified authorities. 
Her friend is physically ok, thank god, but I’m worried. My sister doesn’t show much emotion; our dad died two years ago, and she refused to get help or open up to us. My mom has noticed my sister talks to me much more than her, and asked me to look out for her. I talk with her over text, but it’s hard to tell what she’s feeling there.

\*fat loss: I have been skipping breackfast and tea,is this enough or should I start skipping dessert and eating less in general? I have some fat under my neck/chin,flabby skin there.

\*Mewing and nose breathing:hard to do after so many years of incorrect breathing;will it really work,or am I suffering in vain if I do this?

It’s the same thing with books, I was never an avid reader growing up but I would read maybe 2 decent sized novels a year... I can’t even bring myself to finish books I am in the middle of and still need to finish, let alone open a new book. I have a pile of new books I have bought but not even glanced at after owning them for months.

I have mild anxiety but that shouldn’t be the reason I don’t enjoy these hobbies anymore. I’ve even tried audiobooks because I figured I might just be lazy but I got through one chapter and can’t even be bother to listen to a book as I’m doing chores or something.

Even the life feels like a chore most days, I do the basics eg. Go to work, walk the dog, basic hygiene etc... it’s only when it comes to hobbies and stuff that I just don’t get any enjoyment out of the things I used to love.

747,"Throwaway because reasons. Still going to dance around the topic though because even internet anonymity can't douse the white hot burning shame.

I have this fetish. It doesn't hurt anyone else, but I absolutely hate it. I hate that I'm into it and I feel shitty about myself every time I indulge in it. Which is constantly. I opened up to my girlfriend about it and she's either mildly enjoying it or going along for my sake. My junk doesn't work right anymore. When we try to have normal sex my dude either ends it like immediately or not at all. I essentially can't have regular sex anymore.

Things aren't looking awesome with my GF. Possibly partly because of this. What happens if I'm dating again? This SIGNIFICANTLY narrows the dating pool. ""Oh by the way, we can't have regular sex ever, you cool with that?"" And if someone else found out I'd need to take my death and move to another continent. I don't want to hear about I shouldn't care what people think. I _do_ care and that's normal.

My therapist keeps pushing acceptance. Really? This is like a disease. I do not fucking want this. It's not who I am day to day. Why do I have to accept this terrible fucking thing? But I'm like a moth to flame and it's so hard to stop.

748,"I am a 24 year old guy and my ex girlfriend told me today that she is pregnant and that it is mine. I have never wanted children and i never thought i would have any until possibly today,. Two months ago things ended badly with us and now that we're not together she still wants to have what she thinks is my child but we only had sex twice in our whole short relationship. The first time i had no condom on in the beginning and shes not on any birth control at all i should add. I was only inside of her for about 15 seconds and stopped because i wasn't wearing a condom and did not climax at all and the sex ended after that. Later in the night i bought a plan B pill and had to beg her the next morning to take it but she eventually did, she left right after taking it so she may have spit it out after she left i should have made her open her mouth but i just didn't unfortunately (you can probably already tell by the nature of this post i am not a sharp person). The second time was in the shower and she was on top. I only was inside her for about 10 seconds and did not climax either. I wasn't even fully erect at the time as well and the sex ended after that as well. Now shes saying she's pregnant and that i finished in her without saying i did even though i never did at all. Now she's saying we could get a paternity test and it's scaring me because she is very confident it's mine. Hopefully she was pregnant before we met and she's just looking to blame me or she may have been with another person who did climax in her but i really have no idea.  I do realize having even a small amount of sex even for a second could conceive a child and you don't need to climax to get a girl pregnant but it just seems so unlikely.  I'll also note that she frequently mentioned her distaste for condoms and said that she always had sex without condoms and no birth control in previous relationships and never got pregnant once and i have sex with her for a grand total of 25 second and she's pregnant. It just seems unlikely it's my child but i just wanted some outside opinions.  She sent me a picture of her report at a medical center and it said she was discharged for pregnancy, vomiting and had an OB/GYN follow up so she's not lying about the pregnancy.

749,"i’m usually not quick to assume things but this has never happened before so i’m kind of scared. there’s this guy who comes into the shop where i work a lot and i think he might be stalking me or at the very least overly interested/obsessed. a while ago he called my coworker hot to her face and tried to get her number. he asked me what i do outside of work and talked to me for a while as i was working before he left. strangely enough i saw him on tinder last week and was like huh, weird coincidence. i thought it would be okay to give him a chance since it was pretty obvious he wanted to ask me out so i agreed to a date this weekend.
the thing that worries me is that a few days ago he started showing up at my workplace when i’m working. i work two jobs and have a weird schedule but i’ve seen him three days in a row now, twice at my first job and once at my other job (i told him the name of the place i work but not location of it or when my shift is). i have no idea how he knew i would be there then so my only guess is that he just went hoping i would be there (i hid when i saw him lol). he asks me questions like what i do outside of work, do you just work, it feels like you just work all the time, etc. my friend told me he might be trying to figure out my schedule which is freaking me out and idk if he’s like a stalker or just a nice guy who happens to enjoy frequenting the places where i work (even though he lives and goes to school like an hour and a half away).
my gut/intuition tells me to be creeped out but maybe i’m just paranoid and don’t know him well enough yet. it could just be coincidence. i feel a bit crazy/hysterical rn. any advice or tales of similar experiences would be much appreciated",21Nov2019,1
750,"I've been having a hard time because of a friend that I knew since the start of elementary school. (Im a freshman at high school now) Though around 2 or 3 years ago I valued her more than my own life, I think that these days, being friends with her is more of a burden than a good thing.
To start off, whenever we have an argument or something, she calls me the worst names. We mostly talk in english but it includes horrible slurs from our native language. It leads me to feeling awful, and me having to apologise in the end because I just wanted it to end. 

Once when she did something where she WAS in the wrong, she said sorry but said it was all a coincidence. She was talking to a bunch of online friends in a group chat, and they got into an argument about who was cuter. (It was extremely stupid, looking back on it). A few minutes after the argument, the friends suddenly says that she saw the cutest photo of us together back in elementary, and sent it on the group chat WITH STRANGERS IN IT. A minute after, she deleted it and said ""I meant to send it privately, sorry) I immediately knew it was to prove that she was cute, but she had absolutely NO REASON to insert ME in it. And i was FUMING. Because I really do not like sending photos of myself on the internet. But I said nothing about it then and accepted her apology

Three months after that, we got into a huge argument and I blurted out that I knew it was to prove she was cuter. She went crazy over it and said that it was just a coincidence and she shouldve come forward to me if I had doubts. But the reason I didn't was because I was scared of her, and didn't want her to call me retard and shit like that.

She has a friend that is mildly autistic. While she was over at my place, scrolling through her phone she goes like ""ugh, I don't want to talk to (autistic friend) right now, hes telling me that the best thing ever happened to him"" I asked her why, because though she didn't like him at first, she became close to him afterwards. And helped him with a few of his problems. ""He always thinks that I can fix everything, im just gonna fake reply to him LOLLLLLL even though I don't think it was funny"". I don't think it was that big of a deal, but It just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Another time, while we were playing Mario Kart, we were just casually chatting and somehow manipulation comes up in the topic. She goes like ""hahaha yeah I manipulate a lot of people"" I don't think it was a joke. ""Even me..?"" I asked. ""Ah, no. I dont think I remember a time I manipulated you"" At this point I didn't really trust her, but just hearing her say that made me question my every interaction with her.

Afterwards, I began to distance myself from her. She didn't message me much. But I messaged her once in a while. We didn't meet up at all. And overall, we were drifting apart quickly.
A few weeks ago in another argument, she told me she missed me and wanted the ""old me"" back. I think she was lying, because all the conversations from the last month were initiated by me. If you miss someone, you would text them or try to reconnect with them right? Actions speak louder than words, or am I just nitpicking..

I could say even more questionable things that happened between us, but it would take hours. I just wrote down the things that came up in my head first. You can ask me more questions, ill try to answer them. I might be vague because I am...paranoid and afraid of someone finding out that its me

Sorry if my english is bad, english is not my first language, and im not the smartest cookie. I know that theres a fault with me because I didn't really confront her about these, i was too much of a pussy to. I'm going to drift away from her, but I just need validation that she is, infact a manipulator and that I'm not just paranoid. I'm generally a very anxious person so its possible that I'm just being stupid.. so yeah.

752,"my bf expects me to show him what my coworker  says if he texts me (he texted me after work something harmless about a video he was looking for from twitter). 

he does not like this person bc he thinks he is interested in me which i have told him many times is not true. the one incident my bf always goes back to is when he noticed i had a pen mark on my hand that was from this coworker. he had walked by me and swiped the pen on my hand leaving the mark. such a non issue in my opinion especially when he's done that to other coworkers and when all my coworkers mess around like this.  

additionally, this person texts and hangs out with many of my coworkers and is just a naturally social person, which is why this became an issue. he's texted me in the past about non work related things but its less than once a month and he's never once said anything inappropriate or that made me believe he was interested in me beyond friendship.

i mentioned to my bf that he texted me to be open but i told him i dont like tht he expects me to show him bc its controlling. now bf is mad and is probably gonna break up with me if i dont show him the text. i dont find it necessary to show him when he claims to ""trust me"" and when i know i am not doing anything wrong by engaging in friendly convo that lasts 1-2 texts. 

i would not feel the need to text back this person just to avoid problems with my bf but i seem him 
every time i work. the awkward and unnecessary tension it would (and has) made me feel is stressful and i dont want to be in that environment at work. also, i never enjoy ignoring someones text... especially someone i know and have friendly in person interactions with.

753,"I have a very dead tree right next to my house and I can tell from the way it's leaning that it's going to fall diagonally across my house longways, completely destroying my house. I live in a very run down trailor so I know that it's just going to completely crumble when it happens. I'm worried I'm going to be inside when it happens and I'm going to die. 

I made a deal with someone and they dumped 7 trailors full of wood in my yard from trees they cut down and in exchange they were going to cut down the tree for me. Well they dumped all the wood in my yard but they didn't keep up on their end of the bargain.

I can't afford to get it cut down because everyone that gives me an estimate says it will be about $500. I don't know if I will even be able to afford over $100. 

Does anyone know of any tree services or anything that cut down trees for cheap in Texas? Or maybe have any advice on how to cut it down myself?

756,"Hey guys, 

This post is about finding people who can challenge me intellectually in the world and I was wondering if anyone had any  ideas about how to go about this. Let me start off by saying I love my friends, but I've been noticing recently that when I try to have a conversation with my them about very interesting ideas to me, for example stuff like fermi paradox solutions, Dyson spheres, how the human mind works and the best ways to utilize it, or even stuff like climate change or the history of the world and how we got this point now. As well as predicting the future and learning about different theories for how the world should work... My point is that when I talk to my friends about this kinda stuff it usually just ends with my trying to explain something and them not understanding me at all. Or they might try to put fourth some ideas about it, but their ideas are usually kinda misinformed or just not very thoughtful. I'm not blaming them for not being able to challenge me, but I am realizing that for me to grow as a person having deep conversations about fascinating ideas is only going to help me. Being unable to do it is making me rather upset/depressed about the situation. My question is, has anyone else dealt with this before and does anyone have any ideas about how to solve this? I'm super introverted and I do get social anxiety when meeting new people, but I've been trying to work on that in order to meet new people and not be stuck in this bubble.

757,"So i dated this girl about a year back (were going to call her ex 1) and although it was only a few months i still fell in love with her and grew a strong connection with her since i was around her for so long. After we broke up i was in a constant state of anxiety and i couldnt eat or sleep. So lets just say the break up hit me hard. I couldnt look at her or even be around her because her scent was so intoxicating. About a month later she left my school and we never talked again until 6 months later where i added her on instagram and apoligized for everything. Now after this me and my girlfriend (ex 2)broke up about a month later out of a 7 month relationship. That didnt hit me nearly as hard since she cheated on me a couple weeks prior and honestly , I dont think i ever really loved her. 

Anyways back to the other girl(ex 1). Me and her started flirting again almost immediately but she had a boyfriend and i was talking with another girl. Ex 1 eventually came back to my school after a year and we were going to get together until i fell for the girl im with now. 

Now im happily taken and im over my ex but recently she texted me saying she really like my best friend. I didnt really know how to respond to this so i said ""cool"" and left it at that. she told my best friend and now hes giving her rides to school for the past 2 days and theyve been spending more time together and i really dont know how to feel about it.

I’m in a friendship group of nine people counting myself and it was always a nine and only became one quite recently. My oldest friend in the group got a girlfriend and things just felt different and weird and I started to not enjoy hanging out with them as much. So I just started spending time apart. 
Anyway one on the group chat my friend’s girlfriend (let’s call her A) said you guys shouldn’t insult each other it’s not a good friendship. And I’m like yeah it’s not but she’s the person we’ve known for the least amount of time and she’s criticising our friendship so I try to explain to her it’s what we do and the conversation fades away. 
The next my oldest friend in the group (let’s call her Z) says she’s quite sad about it cause now the issues been raised that we don’t have a real friendship. So Z searched what a friendship should be made from or something like that. And the first thing that comes up is trust 
So she turns to me and says you’re the main problem for that.. so I’m like slightly pissed but it’s fine 
Then she goes on to call me judgemental and the other friend there at the time (let’s call her Y) says yeah you’re the most judgemental in our group 
I know I’m not perfect but I’m trying 
So I ask for an example 
And the other friend says I have one but I’m not gonna say it 
I wanna know so I can avoid making the same mistakes but she won’t give me an answer so that annoys me even more 
Anyway fast forward an hour and Y is with her best friends talking about me. I go up to her and say answer the question and she refuses. So I try to explain to them the  concept of best friends and how I don’t have one. 
So Y says to me why are you trying to single yourself out
One again very irritating 
I try again to explain again that’s it’s not me trying to single myself out it’s me trying to explain them I’ve lost my best friend and I’m still sad about it because they stabbed me in the back and I’m not gonna trust anyone again overnight
Anyway Y then says your trust issues are the only reason our friendship doesn’t work 
So yeah we sad about that

This was a very long winded explanation which your probably shouldn’t read as it’s very confusing basically my friends blamed our failed friendship on my trust issues and I’m sick of it, it’s not the first time they’ve done that and I think I should just move on but like idk",21Nov2019,1

761,"So,

I just got out of a very intense and long relationship with a guy who I was certain I'd spend the rest of my life with.
This being said, we didn't live together or anything but we spent most of our spare time with each other and done everything together.

My mental health plummeted around this time last year and I began to realise how heavily I was relying on himto keep it in balance, so on both our calls, we agreed it would be a good idea to take a break.
This lasted a few weeks before we realised we couldn't do it and decided to get back together and try again.
However after a month, he realised that it wasn't working and I again could feel myself slowly starting to rely on him to keep me in balance, so we ended things again.

This time, we both agreed to go for a few months on our own  him to learn to be by himself and know he can do things on his own but for me it's to learn to deal with my mental health by myself and not constantly rely on him for that..

So yeah, I guess what I'm really asking here is how to I get better at being OK with being on my own? I'm finding it really hard at the moment and honestly get I'm on the verge of a panic attack everytime I think about him or the relationship ending or anything like that.

when beginning my educational leave, my HR person and i had discussed my return for part of the holiday season. i just called (four times over the course of three-ish weeks) and was just able to reach my HR person to confirm the dates i would return for. i think she has been avoiding my calls. on the phone she noted that the company may not need my help over the holiday season due to all the seasonal workers they have hired. i don’t know if i should be offended, but i am really effected by this. 

will this mean i can no longer return to this job even in the summer? i am going to college this fall, and could really use the extra money when i’m able to work the hours.  

many people have come and gone during my time with the store, but financially this is the best job opportunity local to me (they pay the best in town for retail). i have always had a lot of anxiety around this job since starting it, with constantly hearing negative stories about HR and other managers.

My brother from that point on HATED anything to do with military and full on despised everything about it. I hated the military too to an extent but idk I was always infatuated with all of that. When I was 18 and he was 19 I told my family that once I'm out of HS I would be going into the army (same branch as my dad and grandpa). My brother LOST HIS SHIT at me calling me all sorts of names and hurtful shit I basically said its my life and I can do what I want. He called me selfish and I said the most hurtful thing I could ""Its my fucking life, its not my fault your not over dad's death that was 6 years ago, if you don't like my life choices then you can just say out of it."" I didn't mean a word of that I was just pissed, he looked at me blankly for a few seconds then punched me in the face, I did the same and after a few seconds of fighting my uncle and mom were able to separate us.  He stormed out of the house back to his place, when he was originally gonna stay the night at home.  

The day later I found out he was in an accident and was in terrible condition. When I went to the hospital he was awake but barely. I told him I'm sorry and didn't mean it and we made up (I am so glad I put aside whatever issues we had in that moment). He died later that night. I always miss him, he was my best friend and my worst enemy. I miss the trouble we got into and all the times he mentored me. It has been 22 years now and I still miss him dearly and wish we were nicer to each other for the time he had.

I always thought he was just mean to me and didn't care for me but that was so far from the truth, he pushed me to be better and he was kinda mean about it sure but he just wanted to make me the best me I could be, he also never excluded me from hanging out with him and invited me places with him all the time.

My neighbor who I am really close with told me that it’s not healthy to keep on thinking about him and what if’s but I don’t know how to.",21Nov2019,1
773,"Hi, I'm 19 and this is the first time in my life I ask for advice on the internet, I'm kinda nervous and also embarassed about what I'm going to tell you guys, so ya. 
 
Ever since I was 16, my friends(same age as me) were putting pressure on me regarding sex, making jokes that I'm a virgin, that I never had a gf in my life, that I don't talk to girls or anything related. Meanwhile all of them were and still are having sex and girlfriends and all that stuff. I never cared about it tho, and I always acted as if I didn't even hear what they're saying about me. 

The thing is, I turned 19 about half a year ago and I became very interested in this thing ever since. I really wanted to have a girlfriend, to see what sex truly is, and also to make my friends finally shut up. 

One day I was walking alone (about a month and a half ago) and while browsing the internet on my phone I ended up on a prostitutes website. I was looking at pictures out of curiosity and I had this thought to call one of them. So I did, went to her house not far away from where I was at that time, and had sex for the first time. I didn't get to experience much, since everything lasted about 5 min and after that I left her place. On my way back home I felt so disgusted and ashamed, swearing I won't do it again(going to prostitutes).

Same day at night, I went out for a walk around the house and this thought came to my mind, I realised I didn't get to satisfy my curiosity regarding sex so I decided to give it one more try and not go to prostitutes ever again. So I went to another one at night. Same feeling of guilt hit me while leaving her place.

About a week later I went again, this being the third time, and after one more week I went one last time. So long story short, I went 4 times to prostitutes, didn't enjoy it that much, and I decided I won't do it again. I didn't even tell my friends or family about it, so literally everyone thinks I'm still a virgin and I don't find a problem with that. 
 
The thing is that I started experiencing some weird things about my penis. Before I went to prostitues, I bought a lube out of curiosity and tried it at home alone, I noticed that when I finished ""playing"", my penis started itching a little, for about 10 minutes even tho I washed it with water and soap. I didn't pay much attention to it, I kept using it for a while and then I stopped. Then I went to prostitutes. The first time I went I wore a condom and when I finished she gave me some wet wipes to clean myself. While leaving her house I noticed the same itching that I got from the lube I used at home. I ran home, washed myself and everything was ok. The second time at night (same day) same thing repeated, wore a condom, she gave me wet wipes to clean myself, noticed my penis is itching. Went home and showered, but this time the itchiness didn't stop. When I woke up in the morning the next day, I noticed 2 areas on my penis that were red and itchy, and my penis also felt more sensitive to touch than usual. After a few days these symptoms stopped and I was back to normal. The next week, I went to prostitutes for the 3rd time, only that this time the oral sex was unprotected but after that I wore a condom. She too gave me wet wipes to clean myself before leaving her house, but this time the symptoms not only came back, but they were worse than ever. My penis was itching, the 2 red areas came back, the tips of my penis felt cold and I felt pain on the tip of my penis when masturbating for about 1 week. I started freaking out and bought a clotrimazole cream that I used twice a day for about 5 days and everything was back to normal again. The 4th time I went to prostitutes I wore a condom, this time she put extra lube on the condom, and when I finished she gave me wet wipes to clean myself. Only that this time I was very close to my house so I went home immediately and took a shower asap, I didn't experience any itching or anything. Since then I promised myself I won't go to prostitutes again nor tell anyone about what happened. About a month passed since then and I used the lube I bought back then and used it 2 times while masturbating. I noticed the tip of my penis, more exactly the small hole there started itching and it's been like this for about 2 days. I didn't care that much, but this morning I went to the bathroom to pee and noticed a yellowish discharge when I squeezed my penis and I freaked out. I started using the clotrimazole cream again and here I am asking for advice on what to do next. 
 
I want to mention a few things before I ask you guys some questions. I'm a very clean guy, I shower 2 times a day, I wash my genital area every single time, I care alot about hygiene, always change the underwear, I never had STDs/STIs, never had any health problems of any type, I go to the gym pretty often and have quite a healthy life. What I did was just a dumb 19 years old move that now I regret and I'm trying everything I can to fix it.

So here are the questions:
1. Have you ever had any similar symptoms? If yes, what did you do?
2. I'm too ashamed to tell my parents and since I'm basically an adult I want to fix it on my own. I have about $250 saved up and I'm willing to spend it just to find a treatment for this. The problem is that I don't know what type of doctor I should look for, I don't know where to go or who to talk to. 
3. Is there anything I can buy on my own from the pharmacy that can make it before I throw $250 away? For example, the same way I used the clotrimazole cream, maybe there is smth else out there?
4. Is there any way I can find out on my own if I have an STD/STI or maybe it's just an allergy caused by the lube I used, the latex from the condom or the chemicals in the wet wipes? 

Forgot to mention that I also experienced some itchiness in the past when I peed in a public toilet and cleaned my penis with a wet wipe.
 
Thanks alot and I'm sorry if my english is not the best or if I did anything wrong while writing this, it's the first time I'm doing this and my intention is not to make anyone pissed or sad, just need some advice on what to do.",21Nov2019,1
774,"How do I decide between two job offers?

Company A: 

- 13% increase in current salary
- OEM manufacturer
- 20 minute commute
- Focused on analyzing engineering drawings and looking for discrepancies 
- I would not be overseeing production very much
- The hiring manager asked me if I would be okay with traveling to Asia on occasion to visit production facilities 
- I never visited the firm and all my interviews were done over Skype

Company B: 

- 30% increase in current salary
- Contract manufacturer
- 15 minute commute 
- Focused on being a team leader in a high volume, constantly changing manufacturing setting
- Process oriented 
- There is opportunity for formal training and education which would be good for my resume.
- I would be on my feet nearly all day, interacting with many people.
- I was warned by one of the interviewers that the job schedule can be unpredictable and inflexible at times. I could be required to stay for 10-12 hours a day and even come in on the weekends at times. 

About me? I am an introvert and soft spoken. I have great soft skills and more of a big-picture person. I highly value work-life balance and I am the type to resent my employer if they make me work overtime. I am very thoughtful and have a good work ethic. I do like being around people and enjoy interacting with others.

I think company B would be a better resume builder and further my career. I think company A would could make me happier due to the lower stress. However, at company A, I would be in a new city and I worry I would get lonely since everyone works in cubicles all day and there aren’t people similar to me. I am also fearful of traveling to Asia due to my fear of flying.",21Nov2019,1

776,"Hello, I hope you are having a good day so far, Redditor. So, I’m a (21F) and I’m a introvert, don’t have many friends, not really a big social person, get bad anxiety when I go to parties or clubs with people. I have a problem speaking up for myself, I can’t seem to talk back when people disrespect me, and unfortunately I just let them, so now everyone walks all over me since they know I won’t do or say anything about it. My coworkers treat me like shit, and my (ex)friends used to ALWAYS walk over me. I’m not that shy and to be honest I can be outgoing if I’m around the right people. But anyways, most days I just can’t speak up for myself and I don’t want to be viewed as some person that will take shit from just about anyone. So, if you have any advice on how I can overcome this and not allow ANYONE to walk all over me, I would very much appreciate it. I try not to let people throw me around left and right but it’s like my lips are sewn shut when I try to talk back and defend myself. It’s a struggle and I don’t want to continue living with this.

783,"I'll try to keep this brief yet descriptive. 

For some background on myself I'm a 23 year old male who is currently going to school for my bachelor's degree in biology. I have an associates degree in Biotechnology and that's why I was able to obtain these two jobs.

So in March of this year I stopped working at my job in industry full time for a job as a Research assistant at a local University because I thought it would be more intellectually stimulating, which it is. 

I didn't fully quit my industry job because I knew the one in acedemia would pay less ($18,000 per year less actually), so I work one day every weekend that I can, to make up for it. However, it doesn't come close to what I was making before. Because of this I am hurting for money more than any other time after high. On top of that I don't have any free time due to the fact that the acedemia job requires me to read  papers on the weekends. Plus the fact that I work 6 days a week and have homework from the two classes I take per semester.

So my question is should I go back to my boring industry job that pays well or should I stay in acedemia and struggle financially but be more fufilled on an intellectual level? Keeping in mind that the industry job is still decent for my resume as it is still a scientific job. What do you guys and gals think?",21Nov2019,1
784,"So  I need advice on how to respond to this guy.

I have a roommate that I got into a huge fight with day before yesterday.

It ended in him almost breaking down my door to continue arguing with me but him giving up when I refused to budge.

I don't want to go into the details because he might find it.

The argument doesn't matter. It doesn't have a right or wrong answer, it's a moral dilemma that I refuse to budge on.

What does matter is that he only ""apologizes"" so that he can continue arguing with me and force me into agreeing with him to keep the peace. I'm absolutely sick of it.

He sent me a message yesterday just saying, ""I'm sorry."" That's it. And I know it's just to get me to open up to another argument so he can try to get me to agree with him. 

I'm so done with accepting his fake ass apologies and him turning around and forcing me to agree with him to just keep the peace.

How do I respond to this? How do I say I'm sick of his shit and he needs to back off without causing even more chaos?

I'm afraid to walk downstairs and get something to drink because he'll bombard me. He did it three times day before yesterday and tried to yesterday morning before sending that stupid fake apology. 

I can't kick him out either because I'm not the landlord. And I can't leave because my boyfriends parents own the house. My boyfriend refuses(rightfully so, this is such a bs argument in the first place but the roommate keeps trying to pull him into it) to get in the middle of it.

So idk what to do. I can't just accept his fake apology. That ship has sailed and I'm through letting him walk all over me.

What do I do?",21Nov2019,1
785,"I am usually off work by 11pm, home by 11:30, and usually I'm starving hungry, so I eat something, then wash my face and brush my teeth, maybe do some homework, and then I'm off to bed.

Here's where the problem starts, I usually have trouble going to sleep, so while I'm usually in bed by 12:15ish, if I get to sleep before 2:30 it's a miracle. There are also times where I'm staying up super late on purpose to study or get homework done that I couldn't during the day because I was asleep for most of it. Because of all this, half the time I end up waking up super late, today I woke up at 1:30pm and I work at 5, so I have a very small amount of time to do the things I need to during the day, and it makes me feel like a lazy slob. It's not all days that I'm like this, some days I can wake up around 8 or 8:30, which is my ideal wakeup time, but I sleep in super late frequently enough that it's becoming a problem for me.

I have alarms set, I have 2 alarm clocks, one on the other side of the room, plus my phone with a fancy alarm that makes me get up and take a picture of something outside my room before it stops going off. I have all these alarms programmed to go off all together and then at 5 minute intervals after that. That's where there's another problem, in my groggy, grumpy early morning mind, I get up, shut off the alarms, then shut off all the backup alarms without thinking twice, and then plop back into bed and fall asleep, again without thinking twice about it.

I'm getting really sick of having no time during the day for anything and feeling like a lazy slob for sleeping in so late. How do I break this terrible cycle? Where do I even begin with this? Any advice would be appreciated.

791,"So, earlier this year, I moved back home to Chicago from Houston, and because of family situations and job searching moving very slowly, I moved in with my 3 friends. It was normal, like any group of friends living together would be, 
I had a bed that I kept upstairs and brought down in the living room floor when it was time to sleep. I started to see someone I knew &amp; liked back when I was in high school, and she became somewhat my girlfriend, although we weren’t in a relationship. She became a regular visitor at the house and got slightly aquatinted with my other friends. One day, she expressed a fantasy she had about a threesome with myself and another man, and after much conversation, she revealed that it was my best friend, stating that he was “attractive”. I told him about this, and he expressed concern about the idea, saying that he knew I loved her, and it’s a bad idea, which I agreed of course. She later brushed it off as just a fantasy that she would never take serious or even pursue. That passed. Over time, bills started to pile up, and I sensed I became a bit of an inconvenience to my friends because I was struggling with finances and somehow couldn’t get a job even though I tried. Then these thoughts came from nowhere that would disturb me so much. I started to have concerns that what if my best friend sleeps with this girl I’m seeing out of disrespect for me, seeing as though I’ve become somewhat of a burden to him in his house.

794,"So I am confused. More confused, surprised and bamboozled than I am upset. There’s this girl in high-school. The past week or so, she’s been flirting a lot with me (a lot is subjective, but oh well.) Things like: tapping me on the back when I’m not looking; looking at me, and when I catch her glance, quickly turn away; ask me “how I’m doing” in a flirty voice; etc. I’m pretty sure she’s not just naturally flirty, as I’ve noticed she only does it to me. So today, I told a friend of mine. He literally pushed me to ask her out by catching her attention and saying “he wants to tell you something!” “There’s no way out of this one now...” I think. And so I do it. Being the sad dork that I am (it’s my first time doing something like this) I try to tell her I’ve noticed that she has been flirting with me, but I stumble over my own words and make a fool of myself. So I just give up and ask her outright “so... do you like me?” To which she responds “me? Sorry no.” With a very awkward half-smile. By then this has stirred a lot of commotion and a few people got nosy and just start easdropping on our conversation. I just say “it’s ok no need to say sorry, alright bye” and walk away. I get enraged at my friend, but later cool down and realize that it wasn’t actually all that scary to get rejected, and I learned a very valuable lesson today. Though this begs the question: why did she say no when she showed literally every single sign of affection I can think of? What do I do? Do I approach her tomorrow on this topic?

Reasons to do it include:
He wouldn’t have to make 4 separate 10 hour drives (he has a heart problem so he can’t take meds to calm him for the drive)
He would have more space in a house vs apartment.

I always wanted to be something that has to do with art when I was younger. My parents were supportive at first, but then they discouraged me because the ""pay was low"". This was a few years ago. My parents think I'm going into computer science, and I used to want that, but I realized I've been fooling myself into thinking that the entire time. I don't wanna go into compsci. I'm too creative for that shit, and I feel like I realized that too late. And I don't think I can handle that sort of workload with math and physics and all that... I'm not a genius. I get low 80's in everything (A- here in Canada, but I know people who get far better marks than me) and I have terrible ADHD and anxiety that I have to deal with on the daily. Sure, I'm good at programming, but this shit isn't my passion. Writing and drawing is my passion, and I'm limited because I don't have any prerequisites to apply for certain programs. On top of that, my parents want me to go to university and not college (there's a difference between the two in Canada, apparently, college is looked at as a place for ""dumber"" kids but that's such a fucking myth). 

To be specific, I want to go into film (animation would be cool but I was conditioned into thinking I couldn't do it for so long). My mom is suggesting a ""back-up"" plan incase compsci doesn't work out (it won't, I hope). She wants me to go into writing but she doesn't want me to go into anything ""creative"". I want to write for TV, but when I told her that she threw me a curveball and suggested I become an ""editor"" instead. Like those two are similar. My Dad is dead-set on me going into compsci. He doesn't even want me to have a ""back-up plan"". And on top of that, I'd have to go to university for that if they like the idea. No college because college is for stupid boys and girls! Universities around here don't even have many film programs, and the ones that do ask for an arm and a leg only to accept a small handful of students. The college I have my eyes on is perfect for this program, I've done all my research- but the other problem is my parents think they know everything about everything and I'm afraid they're gonna shoot the idea down. 

They're also probably going to throw excuses at me like, ""Oh, but you don't even like films""! And just thinking about it really pisses me off. They might also say some shit like ""You're probably not even good"", etc. etc, like they did with me when I was younger. In freshman year I took an art class and I got a 74, my parents used that as ""dead proof"" that I sucked at art and shouldn't pursue it as a career. Now I can't even apply for programs I want, and I'm sick of this discouragement. I don't care if you think it's because they ""care"" about me. You don't say that to a kid, especially with art. That stuff takes time to improve on, and on top of that I've learned WAY more teaching myself how to draw than going to fucking classes for it. You don't tell a kid they're no good at something they're improving on like that's the end of it.

""Why can't you just show your parents what you've created""? Well, they're not going to get it. I'm inspired by a lot of stuff that they find ""unfunny"" or ""unappealing"", and I'm afraid that they're only going to laugh in my face or call it ""garbage"". How do I know it's not garbage? I show the stuff I write and draw to my friends almost every day, and they like it. I have friends who love it, even. And it's not like I'm the best in the world, and can draw the human body to a perfect T- I can't write something like Breaking Bad. I'm not THAT good yet. It's just that, whenever I show my work off, writing or drawing, no one says they like it just to humor me. They honestly love it, and that's not delusion on my behalf. I've even gotten fanart over the past few months, compliments galore. So yeah, I think I got a good deal going on here with my skills. Not the absolute best, but I'm afraid my parents aren't going to see that. 

Reason number whatever, if they don't approve of it they might not pay for university. They have a sizeable amount of money set aside to pay for my tuition, but if they don't want to pay it I'll have to go get student loans or whatever, and I don't want to think about that on top of the fact that my parents don't want to financially support me. That'd really hurt me.

To top it all off with a nice cherry, my parents already made me apply for a single university when it came to compsci. I was far too much of a pussy to speak out against it. They've already paid the $150 dollar admission fee, and when I was asked to apply for more I told them to wait until December. So I need help fast with this...

The problem here is that for a good chunk of my life I've been fooled into thinking salary = happiness by my parents. I realized that isn't true far too late and I'm afraid, for specific reason, that my parents won't let me pursue my dreams of going into film. 

Sorry if this wall of text is too much to read. Thinking about it has been depressing me lately, and I've been afraid to post it on here because I didn't wanna be called delusional. But at this point I'm out of people to turn to and I feel alone in the matter.",21Nov2019,1
808,"So I was heading home from work yesterday, when I saw a stopped vehicle in the middle lane (3 lane road). An old lady was the driver and yelled at passerby's for help.  A guy from the nearby tram stop ran to go and help push the vehicle off the road when I heard a bang and very loud screams. A BMW hit the stopped car from behind, and the man that tried to help them. The car then rolled into my lane and I hit it too. This man's leg was like completely gone below his knee, and there was a giant pool of blood.After the screams he went silent then looked me in the eyes and said ""My carrier has ended"" and ""Please stop the bleeding somehow"" .I comforted his panicking girlfriend while paramedics did their job. Then I found out he is a 33 years old professional dancer and would have had a premier this weekend.  I wondered what would I do if i lost all my hopes and dreams in like a heartbeat. He wanted to help and old lady, and now his life is in ruins. I want to give this guy some kind of present, like a watch with motivating engraving, or anything.

813,"I'm not anywhere close to getting married but this conflict plagues my mind all the time and I'm just not sure what I can do.

When I was a kid (ages 5-7) my older half brother (we share the same dad) molested me several times. I was unaware when it was happening because he would do it while rubbing my back or my stomach (back and tummy rubs were a very normal thing in my family when we were kids). 

When no one was around, he'd pull my shirt up and rub my chest or reach far down into my pants. 

The only thing I noted as strange when I was a kid was that he would never rub those areas when my parents were home. Years later looking back, I realized why.

I have never told my family about this happening and never confronted my half brother about It, and I'm pretty sure as far as he's concerned I never figured out what he was doing to me. 

My family has drifted away from him because he's generally been an absolute waste of a person (constantly borrowed money from our father and has NEVER paid it back, has contacted me personally only ONCE in my life which was when his car broke down an hour away from my house at 1am, went to college and ditched class until he flunked out TWICE on our father's dime, etc.) but we occasionally visit or meet up with him and his family because my parents love his sons (their grandkids, my nephews). And of course, my father still loves him because he loves his all us kids unconditionally. 

My family has drifted away from him because he's generally been an absolute waste of a person (constantly borrowed money from our father and has NEVER paid it back, has contacted me only ONCE in my life which was when his car broke down an hour away from my house at 1am, went to college and ditched class until he flunked out TWICE on our father's dime, etc.) but we occasionally visit or meet up with him and his family because my parents love his sons (their grandkids). And of course, my father still loves him because he loves his kids unconditionally. And to clarify, there's no animosity between my parents and him, my parents are (at MOST) just salty about his jerkiness. 

We have no relationship aside from when I'm dragged into coming to the kids' birthdays, and for the most part he's not in my life at all. 

But I'm haunted by the fact that when it's time for me to get married I'll have to invite him to the wedding. Not only that, but he'll have to be in my family portraits or else everyone will think I'm being a bitch and acting like he's not my sibling. 

My skin crawls a the thought of him being there and ESPECIALLY at the fact that he'll be in my wedding photos. Those photos will be ruined for me, because to me he is NOT family. 

But the sad reality of my situation is that unless I tell my family about what happened when I was a kid, they'll never understand me banning him from coming to my wedding. Especially since my other brother, who I'm extremely close to, will absolutely be part of the wedding party.

I am never going to tell my family. The only people who know are the people that need to know- my long term partner, my absolute best friend, and my therapist. 

So how do I solve this seemingly unsolvable conflict? 

(If you're answer is ""easy, just don't invite him!"" or ""tell your family and then they'll understand"" then please don't bother responding because that is completely unhelpful. I'm asking so far (several years) in advance because I can't stand pushing off the task of solving this any longer. Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer.)

817,"In April, when I was unemployed and living with my parents, powering through a quarter-life-crisis, I suddenly landed my dream job, doing what I loved with a renowned company. With two weeks notice, I picked up and moved to Europe. It was the biggest move of my life. I was terrified and supremely excited to start fresh in a new city, make new first impressions, ""turn over a new leaf"".

But as the saying goes: *wherever you go, there you are*.

I really wanted to be friends with all my colleagues, to make them laugh, to be the funny one, and to *impress* everybody. I wanted to leave an impression. I'm capable of being funny and sociable around certain people sometimes, just not when there are stakes, and not when I try to be. It's also very important to me to be funny; if I feel unfunny or can't make people laugh, it really gets to me. It makes me feel worthless and inadequate, which makes me unfunny (it's a vicious cycle).

I tried too hard and it all backfired. Now I feel stuck. I can't escape my first impression. I'm socially awkward, stuck in my head all the time, seeing myself through everybody else's eyes: unfunny, awkward, insecure, quiet, weird. I can't escape my bad first impression. It's branded me. How can I come in one day and just *behave differently?* How can I start fresh when everybody's already made up their minds about me?

I also had a couple poor performance reviews which shot any confidence I had left. Now I just feel self-conscious all the time. I try to keep my head up and remain positive and present, but most of the time I can't escape feelings of inadequacy and depression.

I still don't have a single friend outside of work. All I do is commute, work, exercise, and cook. And it's not enough. I feel empty. I can't get myself out of it.

It's all there, but I'm in my own way.

821,"Finally texting a boy I’ve always found cute

I’ve known this guy since I was 12 actually but he was a grade below me so we never actually talked. I always thought he was cute though. Well it’s been 8 years and I downloaded tinder cause I was bored and he showed up. I liked, just as a joke actually, and it was a match. He recognized me and now we are texting on Snapchat.

I honestly think he is really handsome, has his own apartment, rides a motorcycle and is taking an education. I mean, it’s all I wanted. His own place, a vehicle and he’s doing something with his life. 

Most of our friends are mutual which makes it a bit awkward. We’ve talked about seeing a specific movie and cooking together because we both suck, lol.

Should I be a try hard flirter? Or should I keep it kind of friendly/casual but with flirty undertones? Should I compliment him a lot? 

I want to take things slow because my last relationship was rushed and turned out super bad. I mean, I want to meet him whenever but actually going official doesn’t have to be any time soon. 

So far we’ve mostly just told each other the surface things about ourselves and admitted we think the other person is datable (obviously, tinder). Are there some things I should NOT tell him? Some things I should?

I’m in high school. I’m so terrified of making people mad that I just won’t talk to my teachers, even if I don’t understand or want to ask a question.

My parents have had meetings with all my teachers for unrelated reasons, and mentioned to one in particular (that I’m especially afraid of), that I’m not the best at communicating and he intimidates me. He told them (and later me) that he loves me, I’m one of the best in his class (not that I’m smart or anything, I just turn in the assignments. that’s pretty much all the class is lol) and that I shouldn’t be afraid to talk to him. 

So today in his class I wanted to ask for a paper I hadn’t gotten, but I was too nervous and so I asked my friend to ask for one. Eventually he agreed, but when he did he told the teacher “lunalily22 wants a paper but she says she’s scared of you”. My teacher jokingly shouted “lunalily22!” Across the room and asked me to come over to him. He told me being jokingly mad that I should stop being scared of him and he gave me the paper and a lollipop. Idk. He’s really nice, but I can’t bring myself to talk to him (and most people). Especially not ask something.

I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)

As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down.

Basically, my good friend who I speak to frequently (alongside his friend) on skype (he's an irl friend) has a tendency to just ignore me for weeks at a time seemingly out of the blue for no valid reason

Now don't get me wrong, sometimes I'm negative and I can understand him not wanting me there for a while, but he goes overboard I feel in COMPLETELY ignoring me throughout this time despite the fact he's there at his computer the entire time

Again though, I can sympathise with it somewhat, but when he goes through these phases of not wanting to speak to me I have a tendency to initially send a bunch of messages, mainly because I always type a lot whenever I'm typing to anyone I tend to write long paragraphs, but then after not hearing back for a couple of days I message him saying sorry for messaging him so much, then a few days later I say sorry for messaging him again then again and again

Now to clarify, do I feel he should ignore me completely? No

But I message him WAY too much because I sort of dig myself into a hole of feeling that

1. If I don't message him he'll forget I exist and he'll never contact me again (he has said repeatedly if he doesn't respond he will when he wants to)

2. I dig myself into a big apologetic pit there I just keep apologizing for shit even if I'm in the right on it just because I don't like confrontation so I just roll over and admit I'm in the wrong (which in most cases I am and I'm willing to admit)

I understand him wanting a break, I don't agree with his method of doing so, but is there anything I can tell myself to get out of this pit of sending him messages apologizing for sending him messages my mind just does these weird jumps where one second I'm like 'It's fine, you've been good friends for years he's not just going to forget about you completely' and I jump straight into 'Nope, he's waiting for another apology you just haven't apologized for the right thing' so I go and try to find other shit I might have done to upset him and send him a message apologizing for that too

As a first generation college grad, myself nor my dad (also co-signer) had any real clue what we were doing, and while applying, we had accidentally put my loans on an expedited repayment plan. So, my monthly loan payments are over $1,000 a month when they should be around 300-400. 

A couple of years ago, soon after graduating, I spoke with my lender, Sallie Mae, who worked with me to get it on a 2-year low-interest, low-payment agreement. I intended on permanently increasing the life of my loans to permanently decrease the payments, but this is what they gave me, and I had no choice but to take it. Regardless, I could finally afford a car, rent, and any other required living expenses. 

That two-year period is coming to an end in March, though, and I still (unsurprisingly) can’t afford to pay a grand a month, despite my hard work and financial planning. I have six months of forbearance left and don’t know of any other options outside of that. 

Does anyone know of anything at all I can do at this point? I’m scared, desperate, and at a loss.",21Nov2019,1
836,"First of all English is not my native language so don't be to harsh on me.

Backstory: my father was/is an alcoholic since I remember my parents got divorced because of it when I was 15, since then we spoke to each other every year or two.. So he is kinda dead to me. 
Last time I randomly saw him was about 3 1/2 years ago where I talked to him and told him that my SO is pregnant and I'm going to be a father and he asked me if he would be allowed to see my son when he is there and I told him yes ofc.

Some months passed and my SO gave birth to our son. 
Couple days later I called him to give him the news and told him he can visit his grandson anytime. He told me That he would love to but he is sick atm. I told him no problem and he can give me a call if he is better and ready to see my son. 

3 years passed and he never called me... 

3 days ago my mother saw him and they talked to each other and she asked him if he don't wanna see his grandson and he replied that he don't have any money... She told him that she is going to be at a specific location this coming Saturday and he can meet him. 

Later that day he called me(for the first time in 3years) and apologized that he never reached out to me because he was and still is not at good health (still a heavy drinker and smoker) and don't have any money but he would love to meet my son and is looking forward to Saturday. (I will not be arround that day) 
The whole conversation i behaved very distanced and only said aha mhm yes OK. 
After this phone call I broke down and cryed of anger sadness and all kind of feelings 

2 Hours ago my mom sent me a picture of a cup(trophy) made of packed gummy bears (my son loves them) my dad gave her in advance and this really made me think this whole situation through... 

I don't know what I should do.. Should I try to reconnect with him? 
Or wait if he trys to repair our relationship? 
Or even give him a chance..? 

I am 28 now and I see so many amazing story's on reddit and friends how much they still share with their father and I really miss that I never really got that chance and it makes me sad. 

I feel sad and don't know how I should carry on with him. 

One good thing this whole story has is that I know 100% what kind of father I will be for my son and I will never let him down like my father did!",21Nov2019,1

838,"Hey folks!

I’m in a bit of an uncomfortable situation at work. I’m 23 and I work as a (very underpaid but being budgeted for a raise) marketing specialist at a mid-sized IT recruitment firm. I make 40,000/year before taxes (bring in about 1450 every two weeks).

I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, and altogether my bills (and when I say bills I mean literally the bare necessities, like my car, home, internet, phone, etc.), add up to about 2000$/month. This is not including groceries, toiletries, and other similar expenses. I make it work, albeit barely, but can only manage to maintain about 100$ balance on either of my two credit cards at one time (I know, I know, I’m fucking broke. I’m not looking for money advice as I basically spend nothing on actual fun purposes so please don’t bother). 

The issue I have is with my work. I’m responsible for paying for all advertising costs, software costs, company swag purchases, etc, out of pocket to be reimbursed at the end of the payroll run, which is 1 month after the purchases are made. Due to my extremely fucked financial situation, I cannot afford to do this, but I’m too ashamed to tell my bosses as everyone at this company makes a great deal of money (IT and Engineering recruiters making commission, so think upwards of 100k) and really has their shit together. 

I’ve taken out loans, credit cards, borrowed money from my boyfriend’s parents, and borrowed money from my own (extremely poor) parents to pay for my work expenses. Although I do pay them back when I’m reimbursed at the end of the payroll run, the dip in funds plus interest always ends up costing me and I’m beginning to drown in debt. One month I spent over twice my paycheque on required work expenses and had to max a credit card out just to afford to eat for that month. 

Anyway, gory details aside, what can I do? I’m so scared to talk to my bosses and the company is otherwise truly AMAZING to work for. I also don’t know where to go from here because so much of my debt is caused by having to pay for things for my company. Does anyone have any advice for how to approach this????",21Nov2019,1

Very often I am just completely lost in my thoughts and I do think very much, sometimes which for other people makes me appear very inattentive and not interested at all. I have some friends who just laugh at it and think I am funny because of it. When I talk with other girls they often think I am just not paying attention and I am not interested in the conversation at all and/or in them as a person when in reality , I’m just like that. And also because of that , I often need to ask ‚What did you say ?‘ ‚You said something’ ‚You talked to me?‘ .. you get it. My father is pretty much the same , I guess I got it from him. So yeah I would say I am actually quite intelligent but this is I think a bad trait of me which I am trying to let go. 
I met a girl today and she instantly talked with me about it and told me she thinks it is funny(whatever that means) I generally don’t know what to think about other girls naming some of my ‚traits‘ funny. 
Maybe I can find some people who have similar traits or generally just other people who would have advice for me what to do.",21Nov2019,1

So I’m kinda new to this reddit stuff but this story is something only my closest friend knows about. Anyway back in high school I was pretty close friends with my friend that this is about, which will go unnamed. Anyway we were really close for a couple of years hanging out smoking laughing and doing dumb teenager things you know. After some time passed we become kind of distant stopped talking all together pretty much because of life and he has kids now and I’m a full time student. The only reason he became relevant anymore is because his aunt was working at my new part time job I started working at. Anyway she recognized me and asked me how I was doing. Some more small talk goes on before I ask her how my friend was doing. She then begins to tell me that he admitted to her that he had molested his daughter ( 4 ) and that he promised to get help blah blah. She goes on to tell me that the mother of the 4 year old lies to protect him and is still with him. For a while I didn’t want to believe this happened you know but then the said aunt of my friend shows me evidence and a confession but with all that they still won’t press charges because the mother of the child is protecting him and the aunt won’t do anything legally about it either. I’ve known this for about a month but I’ve also don’t nothing and said nothing because I don’t know how to react or think about the situation. All I really know is what his aunt has shown me and I don’t know what to do all I’ve really done is ignore the situation but it’s kinda messing with me",21Nov2019,1

842,"This might be a long one, disclaimer: English is not my first language and I don’t really post on reddit so I apologise if my formatting is not perfect, please forgive these issues if you can.

A little backstory; my (18M) girlfriend (18F) has always struggled with depression, she has quite a fragile soul and cries easily and gets offended easily, she has had to deal with bullying at school and the death of her father whom she’d never gotten the chance to meet when she was 12 so she has had it really rough.
I on the other hand moved out of Poland when I was 7 years old and moved to Scotland, lived here for 11 years. 
We met in high school 2 years ago through mutual friends in a friend group, our relationship has strange origins because we were both pretty shy kids but decided to ask each other out before we even really spoke properly because some friends had found out that we have a crush on each other and set us up. We thought our relationship would be a disaster because of the fact that we never really knew each other, strangely enough we clicked incredibly well, it sounds dumb I know, but at 16 I thought I had met the love of my life and she thought the same about me.

This is where things start going wrong, about two months into our relationship she starts getting depression, she has never been diagnosed with depression but all of the symptoms from online searches seem to match up, we never self-diagnose but after a while we decided to just start calling it depression because it could not have been anything else, she would feel horrible about herself, empty and numb, the only thing that would really help is me or her mum, whom she is very close with. We dealt with it well, it would go away for a month and come back for a month it was a constant cycle and it was exhausting but we love each other so much and she was always so grateful for it, it felt worth it, it felt like I was doing the right thing. Therapy was always something I’d considered and would mention it every now and again because I’ve heard great things about it, but she never really wanted to go, so I figured I just had to help her myself. Our relationship was not always all about her depression though, we have lots of happy and fun memories and we feel like real soul mates because we have both been through a lot together and even though we are only 18 things are quite serious between us now. She is a really good and decent person with great morals and a very caring heart. I love her so much.

Things began to go wrong when she started acting strange 3 weeks ago, she would not reply to my messages for hours at a time, when I asked what she was doing she would just say that she is watching a movie or playing a game, just procrastinating basically, this went on for about a week before I finally managed to invite her over to mines so I can see what’s going on. As soon as she got through the door she hugged me hard and shed a tear, we went upstairs and just hugged, I could tell something was wrong, she lifted her head and told me 
“I think we should go on a break”
At first I didn’t even know how to react, I just sat and cried with her for about 30 mins until she started to explain what she meant. 

She basically told me that she needs to stop relying on other people for happiness which at first I thought was really noble but something about it felt off. We decided to go on a break because I can’t force her to see me, we kept texting but just wouldn’t meet in person, eventually I realised that her reason for wanting a break is not true, she is just subconsciously isolating herself from everyone who cares about her, she told me that she has stopped having conversations with her mum and they only really speak passing-by, same with her grandmother whom she has great respect for, neglected. I assumed that she must be doing the same to me.

Her depression this time is a lot worse than usual, it’s like she cannot feel any emotions anymore, no sadness, no anger, no love, she is just an empty husk now with no ambitions, just living her life and existing. 
I hate seeing her like this, once so fragile and full of life and passion, she is now nothing like what she was like before. 
I have thoroughly suggested getting help because her case seems so urgent but she is almost aggressively denying it, she claims that it will be written off as “teenage angst” and just ignored, so she doesn’t bother going, I even offered to pay for her therapy but she is not having it. Nothing is getting better, I don’t know what to do, every conversation is empty, I feel like she is not even interested in what I have to say. 
I forgot to mention that she has an underdeveloped thyroid since birth and is taking medicine for it to regulate it to it’s proper functionality, I think that if she has stopped taking her tablets it may be causing a chemical imbalance in the brain. This could be very serious.

The boyfriend self-describes as bipolar, and he has always had a weird sleep schedule. Up all night, napping all day. He has a criminal record that my sister won't talk about; she defends him tirelessly, even after he lost yet another job, leaving them financially reliant on my parents and my sister's part-time job.

But dude's been getting worse. He is rail-skinny, and he nods off in the middle of conversations. He has gotten more irritable, yelling at the four-year-old to shut the fuck up and telling him that Santa didn't exist in moments of rage. He spends hours at a time in the only common bathroom. One day, my brother swore it was six full hours.

We rationalized it away for a while, but last night, a drug baggie fell out of one of his pockets and was snagged by my father.

There wasn't anything left in it, but my dad is beside himself. The confrontation is about happen. I expect they'll try to throw him out, but my sister who is vindictive as fuck will inevitably try to weaponize the children.

848,"A little backstory, I (23F) have always had contact with my mom(53) and had a decent relationship in the past couple years. She has always been a bit abusive growing up ( yelling, emotionally abusive, few times physical) but I have sought to see through it in order to maintain a relationship with my mom. We have had fights here and there but nothing lasting more than a month of us not talking. In 2018, I was committed to several mental hospitals and got diagnosed with bipolar, this was extremely hard on my whole family and I acted reckless. My mom had to endure it and I was living with her throughout all of it so I feel her pain. In June 2019, I moved states and this upset her greatly (attachment issues) causing a fight over text where we basically went off on each other and exchanged some hurtful things. My mom claimed I had stolen her stuff and stole her credit card (I had used her card with her permission a few times but NEVER stole any of her things). We sometimes have fights like this but this time she told me she **never** wanted to talk to me again and she can't endure being related to someone who is as mentally unstable as me. At the time, I was doing a lot better, taking my meds, no fights or any drama so this was a bit of a delayed reaction from 2018 in my opinion. It's been a little over four months and she deleted me on facebook and convinced her entire side of her family to disown me as well. Her and my grandma both blocked me on facebook.

I look back at all the decisions I made that led to the attempt and I look at the progress I thought I made in the time that has passed, but I find that the only thing that has changed is my mental state. I thought that college was going to be different when I went back, but I slowly floundered back into the same habits I had before. I don't go to class, I don't do the work and as a result I'm failing. I know that my current status is a result of my own design, but I have no work around. I'm wasting my parents money they're helping me pay for college, I'm slowly deteriorating mentally because I lack motivation, I'm going to counseling, but it just doesn't seem to be changing. 

I thought that I would reset things and join the military, but was just told that the suicide attempt was an automatic disqualification. I want to do something that isn't school, but I also want to survive and not be an inch from homelessness without living with my parents. I want to stop being a burden and a failure in everything I seem to do, or try to do, but fuck it's difficult.

852,"6 months ago I met and subsequently became very close and emotionally intimate with a man I would now probably call my best friend. He identifies as gay after previously identifying as bi, and is in a LTR with a man. However he has said he doesn’t think anyone is “100% gay or straight”. He has slept with a few women in the past, but said it didn’t do much for him. 

Throughout the course of our friendship he has:

-Repeatedly pecked me on the lips when we’re drinking

-Frequently initiated cuddling, hand holding, caressing, etc if we’re watching a movie or in bed
-Initiated spooning (while holding hands)

-Spanked me (hard, might I add)

-Pushed me on to my bed and simulated humping me for a few seconds 

-Very firmly squeezed my upper thigh while we were high in the back of a cab 

-Constantly complimenting my appearance, saying I would be the first girl he’d date if he was straight, etc

-Recently when complaining about my lacklustre love/dating life, he said “maybe you need a gay man” (????)

- Makes strong and intense eye contact 

I love him but it sometimes feels like he’s mildly gaslighting me with this behaviour, because he knows I am straight and that I think he is absolutely gorgeous. I know he’s gay and has a boyfriend, and often this stuff happens while we’re under the influence (but not solely). But to me this is not normal friendship interaction.

Ever weekend we have the same old fight about how nobody cares about her, even tho we do, and she gets this because she believes that the only way to show you care about someone is by cleaning the kitchen ceiling and ridiculous stuff like that. Anyways, she has always been physically and verbally abusive, to the point where I called the police because I was tired of getting beaten up by her. Well that case went on about a year however my entire family guilted me into saying that that was wrong of me to do, and that no matter what you respect you elders. I was 16 at the time. I ended up saying I lied about it all, and was court ordered to go to anger management therapy. I went even tho I don't have anger issues and my therapist even knew it was all BS. Anyways so I am 18 and live with my mother now and although she isn't as physically abusive, she still likes on the verbal saying things such as "" you are worthless"" "" you won't amount to shit"" "" your a slut"" ""if you dropped dead I wouldn't have any problems"" "" you are the reason my health is declining, my marriage is shit etc. etc."" Anyways I'm in college now and obviously still live at home. Here is the issue. I plan on moving out once I graduate and cutting her out. However, I did something dumb in school and found a stolen wallet and never happened to return it, I was going to but she took it and never gave it back, idk why but I guess I do now. She knew I'd want to cut her off one day, so she is using this ""secret"" as leverage threatening to turn me in for ""grand larceny"" and"" recieveing stolen property "" as a minor, as the statue of limitations are 5 years and it's only been 2. Also, I have never had a bf, and I got my first one and she flipped, she hates him because he isn't Greek, and is Italian, when the funny thing is, she herself married an Italian man so I don't get why she's flipping out over it. So I've had to keep the relationship hidden for almost 2 years, and it's difficult as I'm not allowed to leave the house ever to have fun, just to go to college and come back. So I know I can't deal with this in ability to be independent much longer however want to do it once I finish college, but how do you think I should go about it, as with all the instability she has, as well as the legal threats? Once I graduate the statue of limitations would be up so would the police even do anything at that point, or would they laugh in her face? And am I crazy? Tell me if I am unjustified for wanting to leave.

856,"This was posted earlier but received no replies, sorry if reposting is against the rules:


The rough outline of what happened:
He got into a relationship just over 2 years ago.
We just finished secondary school (I’m 16 he’s just turned 17) and he got into an apprenticeship in his girlfriends aunts business (currently too late to transfer to a 6th form). 
Girlfriend broke up with him (not sure on the date as he didn’t mention it at the time but potentially up to 2 months ago) and he seemed to not mind at the time.

I’m not too sure how long after his girlfriend broke up with him but he tried to commit suicide by strangling himself and ended up getting paramedics involved, he called a lifeline and got set up with a counsellor who, after a couple of sessions said she couldn’t help him the way he wanted and has been referred to a therapist waiting’s list which he has been told will last for at least a month. 

He says he no longer feels happy about anything and he can’t make other people happy anymore, that at work he’s reminded of her due to the family business (she has to go over there every now and then due to family, not totally sure why) so he can’t distance himself from her, he told me that he messes up at work, getting shouted at by his boss and his mum at home.

Recently his dad (separate from his mum) tried committing suicide after separating from his second wife and my friends mindset is stuck as, if he can do it why can’t I?

He says that he views everything as a tool to commit suicide, knives, windows etc and that these thoughts have been growing while on the waiting list for the therapist, saying that they just keep getting stronger and stronger.

He’s more often than not singling himself out and has stopped talking to me and my friends almost altogether and will consistently ignore messages from people. 

I just don’t know how I can help.

Sorry for any missed details that might make the story difficult to understand, I’ll try to add anything more I remember.",21Nov2019,1
857,"(I'm not good with words so bear with me please I'm trying to explain as best as I can. Also if there's a better subreddit for this subject let me know.) 

Me and one of my closest friend got a few years ago together into a fandom for a movie.
We started to rp a lot, draw tons of stuff together about certain characters and ships and just you know all the fun fandom stuff. Playlists, Cosplay, gifts connected to a certain ship, lots of insiders we and just everything revolved around this for about a year. I developed a big attachment to one of the characters from that series/ship and just identified a lot with them which is honestly a big way to cope for me because I've got some past trauma and just a bunch of personality disorders.

At one point me and my friend stepped a little more away from each other because we both struggled so hard with our mental problems and clashed badly.
Over the time my friend got into a new fandom with another friend and this is now basically all they enjoyed for the last 2 or 3 years. It's their thing which I'm happy for because they have so much fun but I'm struggling. 

I hope it makes sense so please don't laugh because it doesn't seem that deep for you or anything. This whole change left me with a feeling of being abandoned and that everything we enjoyed together is just kinda over and doesn't mean anything anymore. I connected a lot of happiness and just creativity to the stuff we shared and my friend simply moved on which I know is nothing bad it's normal. I got into other fandoms too but nothing left the same impact.

I really don't know how to move on too and not feel like I've lost something because I wasn't good enough and you know the negative exhausting emotions a borderline person goes through. It's extremely hard for me to communicate any of this to my friend without sounding like I want to put guilt on them. 

There's a lot of black-and-white thinking on my side, blowing things out of proportion I know that. I'm wondering if there are some helpful and more positive ways to think about this to make this situation just overall more bearable for myself and also less stressful for my friend because they mean a lot to me. I honestly don't want to bother them anymore about all of this and feel more happier with the things we shared instead of removing it all from my life so there are no negative emotions anymore attached  whenever I think about it or see past content we created together. 

Please try to not make fun of me for feeling this way, there isn't too much in life I can hold onto and it was just all a great mental support. And thanks if someone read all of this.",21Nov2019,1

860,": (. Please help me. I have many good things in my life as of currently, but I still feel like I am always still missing something. I haven't had a gf for a while, I don't have a good relationship with my mother, and the list is pretty short but still goes on. I really shouldn't be complaining though. My dad just recently bought a new house, and I've been living with him for a while now. It's just I've also been in a certain situation for a while now where I don't have a job yet but believe me, I am still working on it. I just feel kind of, angry ; (. It's very strange and frustrating, like I want to commit atrocities in the name of something, but don't know what. I suppose I have begun to feel very envious. The root of these new feelings aroused from the shitty iFunny community who all it seems does is talk down to people, treat them like shit, call people incels, etc ; (.

861,"Just a rather quick explanation, I've been a single father to 3 boys for about 5 years now. Their mother has been largely out of the picture until the last few months. Since then, she has been turning my kids against me in very subtle ways. She claims to be genuine but is clearly not. She has never, once contributed to their well being financially since we split and yet, regardless, my kids seem to have started gravitating towards her, none the less. I currently have full custody but she wants 50/50 and I worry she will do what she can to eventually get full herself. I dont have enough $ to hire a lawyer not do I have the energy. She has caused me so much grief. I'm not sure I have what it takes to fight and that's saying something,  considering all I have ever done was take care of my kids. She is a narcissist and and all around horrible human being, yet she is an amazing actress and can play the victim very well. I know this is one sided and all, but it's all I can give at this time. I'm worried I'm screwed!",21Nov2019,1
863,"Hello, I am 20M and I am in a program in Panama that lets me study 2 years here in FSU Panama, and another 2 years over in Florida State Tallahassee. The 2 years that I spent here in Panama I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend F18. I feel that during these years I made absolutely no friends in the university, I spent most of my time studying, reading, and spending time with my girlfriend. I do not blame it on her, I was very introverted and even though I knew I should make friends, I decided to stay in my comfort zone. Now I am leaving in less than a month, and my girlfriend seems to want to either put the relationship in pause or end it, since we will be apart for a long time. I feel completely empty now. I am leaving my home, my family, some friends that I still have in Panama from high school, my girlfriend. I am very anxious and I don't know how I am going to cope being alone in a strange place over there. How will I focus to study if I am so sad? Will I be able to make friends? On top of that I have a wrist injury and haven't played guitar in close to a month. I am very scared and nervous. Has anyone had a similar experience? Any advice can help I think. I just feel terrible right now and I tried to tell a friend through skype, but I couldn't so I would rather write it here.",21Nov2019,1
864,"So my older sister and I are very close, we don't really argue, but she's a really bad driver. Like she is kind of reckless, angers quickly, and kind of careless. 

One time, she drove my friends and I someplace on a dirt road, and when turning, she slid off of the road because she was going to fast and we almost tipped over.

865,"Okay I allready feel like an absolute asshole, here it goes. 

For the past 3 years or so, maybe more - I've been talking online to this guy. Both of our parents were bestfriend's growing up and that's how we initially met when i was 15. (Now 19). 

Yesterday my flight landed and he picked me up from the airport! The whole drive to his place all i could think was ""im not attracted to you like i thought i would be"" 

He does ALOT of the same things my ex used to do and it's just making me uncomfortable and i dont know how not to feel like this. 

Last night i had to dodge a kiss with a hug and i felt how bad that was. Lucky we're in seperate rooms.

But seriously, what can i do? I'm horrible with confrontation. I need advice, anything!!!",21Nov2019,1

867,"Lately I have been taking control of my life and everything up until now has been going swimmingly. I have been more upbeat and wellspoken and certainly more confident lately. Sounds good right? Well I gatherd the confidence to finaly talk to the guy I like. His friend told me we have a lot in comon and should talk. It took me a while and finaly I did. I talked to him about music because we have simaler taste and we seamingly hit it off. Later that day I excitedly told all of my friends that I finaly talked to him. I went home and cleaned a walkman that I was planning on giving him because he needed a way to play CDs and as an extra I put a nirvana CD in it. Now the thing is that up until lately I havnt been so bold. I was actually quite intimidated by him. Today was the day I was going to talk to him again and give him the walkman. In class i made sure to sit behind him. Feeling confident i tried to get his attention, but was ignored. I thought oh maybe he didnt hear me, so I tried many times and he could definiatly hear me but was just ignoring me. He didnt even look me in the eyes when he walked away. I asked his friend who is a mutual friend of ours if she knew anything avout it and apperently he finds *me* intimidating. One thing I really dont want to be is unaproachable. I strive to give off a friendly demeanor. The worst part is that she said he ""thinks im scary""
If he is ignoring me gow can I talk to him? How can I come off as more friendly? What do I do in general? If its of any importance I am a male highschool senior.",21Nov2019,1

871,"For some context, I'm a 23-year-old living with my father and grandfather. My grandmother basically kept my Aunt hostage for her entire life, and in the last few years in one of the most deplorable living conditions possible. She has since had medical complications that have placed her into a hospital, and my Aunt has come to our house. 

This wouldn't be a problem, except my Aunt is blind and an incredibly disgusting lazy excuse for a human being. She is easily 450lbs, can't even stand for a minute, smells so bad it affects the entire house and has no care to improve herself. She can't make her own food, and is so disgusting you wouldn't want her in your fridge.

He’s aware that cheating is a problem in his class so he says that if you fail the test he’ll think that the study guide was plagiarized

I genuinely read and enjoyed his book but I’m not the best at comprehension. I filled out the summary questions with diligence but when test day came, I blanked.

TLDR, I did really bad and I’m pretty sure next class he’s goin to confront the people who did bad and ask why we did so bad if we supposedly “read” the book.

I don’t know what to do right now cause I really care about his class and him as a professor. I don’t want to lose his trust but also don’t want to fail his class.
