0,"First off, I love her, a lot, but recently, the past few weeks, we have been fighting over EVERYTHING, even the smallest of things, every single day. Its never full-blown screaming matches, but they are heated arguments. I feel extremely happy with her when we aren't fighting, but when we are, its the worst feeling in the world. I'm starting to doubt if she's even worth it, but I would much rather fix things and get them back to the way they were before than break up. And I can't seem to stop these fights either, when I just admit fault and tell her she's right, she'll say something like ""You are only saying that so we'll stop fighting"" like that's a bad thing. And when I try to match her aggressiveness and don't back down, she just gets more pissed off, leading me to just go back to giving up and admitting fault. I always takes her crossing the line and apologizing or me just ignoring her and doing something else, which 99% of the time is sleeping. I don't think I can go on like this any longer, what should I do?

1,"hi everyone. 3 weeks ago, i started a new class at college. we don’t have lecture halls, just tiny classrooms, so you all get to know one another. i’m saying this to make it clear that i am very visible to this guy and i can’t just hide in a sea of people and go sit somewhere else. he had a brain injury, so he’s a little off. i’m sympathetic and decided to befriend him. we exchanged numbers. since then (2 weeks ago) he has texted me a ton everyday, constantly asking me to hang out, saying i’m better than him, i’m more “perfect” then him, he puts me above everything else in life, he trusts me more than he trusts himself (he said that after sending me his bank info ad me asking why?!), that he is completely fake, i’m his only friend and his first friend he’s ever had, etc. i was late to class today and he told me “you can ask anyone, i cried when i thought you weren’t coming” and pushed me on my way out of class.  i told him to stop and he pushed me again saying he can’t help it. i know he was trying to joke but this rubs me the wrong way. he is uber attached to me and i’m afraid if i cut contact that he’s going to spiral. he does not get hints (or just ignores him) so i am unsure of how to get out of this friendship without possibly setting him off. i would appreciate any advice you guys have. thank you",29Jan2019,1
2,"So I got caught procrastinating and got confronted this morning about it, and now I look like I don’t give a shit about my job. 

Right now I am waiting for my school to fax either my transcripts or diploma to the facility I’m at, and when I was asked if it would be there for the deadline (today), I said yes. Well it’s after hours and I don’t know what to do because I could get my cousin in trouble.

I feel the need to talk to her, but not sure what to say because it may lead to me getting in more trouble. ",29Jan2019,1
4,"Okay ima just make this real quick. So I met a girl on Tinder and we chatted a TON on FB messenger; really hit it off. Go on a date, thought it went well, she messages me after, says hey that was awesome, we gotta hang out sometime again! I said yeah def, then we talked for a tiny bit. She doesn't answer. I message her the next day, say hey what's up, she says sorry just been super busy, resumes the conversation we were having before about places to hang out (""have you ever been to...""), I answer her, and she never answers. I wait 30 or so hours, message her again, she doesn't answer. 

So, either she had a drastic change of mind and decided to ghost me (which I REALLY don't think is like her) or facebook messenger isn't working or something. We're also friends on instagram. Would it be creepy if I messaged her on ig and was like yo what's up, if this isn't gonna work that's cool or is FB messenger just not working? 

I just sorta want closure, either way it's cool. I guess I'm just super confused and idk what to do. Thanks!",29Jan2019,1
5,"So.... this is going to be long. Just a warning.

I moved to Utah about a year and a half ago and since I arrived here it has been nothing but one long suicidal depression episode. I moved here for a job. After about a year that job switched me positions and management was all over the place (ie., changing rules, changing positions, things were falling apart etc). So that being the case I looked for a new job.

Got a new job. After two weeks of training management ambushes me and says they are switching me positions and keeping me part time, instead of the position I was hired as and full time. Also no insurance coverage since it's part time.

With no insurance I cannot get meds for my MS. 

So, I look for a new job and go without the meds. Find a new job. Everything was fine. Then I started having migraines. Migraines that I woke up with and went to bed with. I started to see grey lines in my vision, I started waking up with pain in my limbs (growing pains are the closest thing I can describe them as), I was exhausted all the time (waking up took a good 20-30 mins before actually getting up), numbness in parts of my body, dizziness, and more. This is a flair up.

New job didn't have insurance coverage 'till a certain date. As soon as It got to that date I called my insurance and got my info. Called the docs and scheduled an appointment. Told work I need a couple days off to rest and have docs appointment. Go to docs, doc determines I need to go to the ER unless he can find an outpatient facility that day that administers steroids via infusion for my MS. Luckily he does. I go to the infusion site for 3 days of treatment( Solu-Medrol)  and a week and a half of oral steroids (prednisone). I take a good 2 weeks off from work. 

I go back to work. Docs are still trying to get daily meds for my MS authorized by my insurance, so I have no daily meds to take. Symptoms of flair up come back only after a couple days from being off. Work notices I am not at 100%. They tell me to go take care of myself and take more time off. I call the doc, he says to go to the ER. Went to the ER, then had four days of infusions at outpatient facility, then another week an a half of oral steroids, again. I take about 2 and half weeks off this time.

I come back to work today feeling much better albeit a cold I'm getting over since my immune system was in the toilet. After about 45 mins my supervisor pulls me in her office and tells me they have hired someone else to take my position. My options are do another job or take unemployment, as they offered that option to me.  

This other job they said I could do I absolutely despise and is the same job my last place of employment put me as when they ambushed me and is why I left. 

I feel like everyone in Utah that I've worked with has this sneaky fake vibe. Everyone wants to screw everyone over. They talk behind your back, are happy to your face but it seems fake and god forbid if you're not Mormon... well they won't tell it to your face but you will know by the way they exclude you in conversations and their body language. You just know you're not ""one of them.""

I am DONE living here. I've had plans to move to another city for a while. I have had NO friends here, just acquaintances who I try to text every once in while ( I'll be lucky If I get a text back). My job situation, well... obviously you know. Jesus the driving here is awful. Everyone is so shitty to each other here and I can't stand it anymore. This is the most awful, judgment place I've lived in, and I've lived in 3 other major cities in the west coast before. 

Anyway if you've made it this far I won't bore you anymore.

My questions are, should I take unemployment while looking for another job in Utah? Or should I do the job I hate?

OR ... I've been wanting to move to a new city for a while now and GET OUT of Utah. Should I apply for jobs there? I don't have much money but jesus I am desperate at this point and I feel like my mental health is suffering big time now cause of all these set backs and people and circumstances... it's like a huge breaking point. 

I'm done. I got home and cried and thought about ending it. I'm exhausted, I'm tired of going out to the store and dealing with the judgmental stares or cold shoulder attitudes of people. I'm tired of going to jobs with people who will exclude you cause they can tell your not one of them, and do anything to throw you under the bus if they don't like you. I'm quiet and I  know who I am. Does that throw people off??? I am just not sure what to do to. Living here is hell. Thanks. ",29Jan2019,1
6,"So...my car may be done for good. Without it I can’t get to work or school and my area doesn’t have public transport. I had just switched majors after discovering my passion and was en route to moving out of my parents place this April.

8,"Hey all, first time posting on here and looking for some help. So my sister and I are really close and usually get along really well. Well. my fiancee and I broke up last January and we were living together so my sister let me crash in their basement for a few months. They recently got a puppy and decided to go away for 2 days for a concert. They're leaving tonight. They asked me last minute (yesterday) to stay at their house and babysit the dog for the duration of the trip (yesterday they asked). I'm on my own vacation after my shift tonight It's a stay cation, but will probably be my only few days off all year.I told my family and friends not to disturb me unless it's an emergency since I plan on playing through Kingdom Hearts 3 which I've waited roughly about 13 years for. She's super pissed that I said I'd have to think about it because she called and wanted an immediate answer and I was in the middle of something. Mind you, she had people to take the dog out and feed him, she wanted someone to sit with him and watch him the whole time. Was I wrong in doing this and wanting some time to myself.

11,"I’m a 20 year old and she’s a 19 year old. I met this girl because I’m friends with her cousin, who I begged to hook us up cuz I thought she was cute. We’ve been seeing each other *not dating* for just only two weeks. Two nights ago, she slept over at my apartment at university for the first time and this is where it all went south.

We watching Netflix and talking when she just started questioning me about my sex life and asked when the last time I had been with someone was, so I said last night as a joke, but even though I said I was kidding three seconds later, she was freaking out on me. I calmed her down and we finished our night off together. The next day she ignored me all day and then went to the club with our mutual friends. They all kept sending me pics of her flicking the camera off, dirty dancing and even kissing other guys. Needless to say, it made me feel like shit, and she definitely took a toll on my feelings for that. I just went to sleep and tried to ignore it.

Later, at 2:30am, I get a phone call of her begging me to come take her home because the DD got arrested and it was like $140 for an Uber given an event that was going on. So despite her treating me like shit, I got up and took her home figuring this was the solution to our problem. She kissed me and hugged me when we got to her house and asked me to stay the night but I knew she was drunk and I had an 8am class this morning. So, I left thinking we were on good terms.

So today, she blocked me again and I’ve just been feeling so bad about myself and have been trying to get in contact with her cousin to get maybe some sort of gas money for the 80 mile round trip I took to take her home. Her cousin tells me it’s because shes just not interested after my joke and all of the shit her cousin and I talked about and how I was trying to get in contact with her after she blocked me. I “overwhelmed” her by sending a paragraph ranting about how she used me. 

So as I’ve been typing this, she just messaged me saying “what the *bleep* is your problem?” and I don’t know what to do about it. I know I should drop her but she’s all I can think about cuz we were vibing so well.

12,"I have a problem. 

​

I (20f) have Crohn's Disease, i lost my insurance at the age of 18 and was forced to sign up for this crappy income based insurance that only really paid for doctor's visits. To be able to keep this insurance i basically had to have NO income so i sat on my butt for 2 years depressed and suicidal doing nothing because i was too afraid to lose my insurance since that was the only way i was going to be able to see any of my doctors regularly. Well after 2 years of my life going no where and being flat broke i finally decided it was time for me to get a job even if that meant losing my ""coverage"". I got REALLY lucky and got this job out of town in which i made 11k in a little under 2 months but the job was only temporary and the chances of me finding a job like that again are basically none. The job ended in November and i haven't worked at all since then. I'm starting a new job this week that doesn't pay nearly as well. Since I've worked that job in November I've gotten denied for all the assistance programs i previously qualified for because they often ask for my pay stubs, see that i made 11k in 2 months, and automatically deny me. I have about 4k left from the money i saved that I've been trying to keep as an emergency fund, it's not going to last me forever and i have about 1k in medical bills that needs to be paid since i got let go from my insurance. There's no way i'll be able to pay out of pocket for my doctors visits or my injections once i get denied from the Humira assistance program i'm currently on. 

​

Now this is where the mental health part comes in. I had a very traumatic childhood, I've never had any positive relationships with anyone ever, even now, and it's made me suicidal for basically my entire life and honestly it's the worst it's ever been. Well now I'm finally seeking professional help so I can live a better life. I don't want to be like this forever.. Well, therapy isn't cheap. My plan was to pay out of pocket for 2 or 3 sessions a week and save the rest of my money as best i could, but now that i no longer have any sort of assistance, 1k in unpaid medical bills, no insurance, with a chronic disease (that's only getting worse) and (soon) no medication, that doesn't look like it'll be happening. I'm really afraid that if i don't get the help i need soon i'm going to kill myself. i have no idea what to do, with this new job that i'm working i don't know if i should focus on saving up my money to buy myself insurance (not really sure how that works) or focus on getting professional help so I don't kill myself.

TL;DR - I have a chronic illness, no insurance, unpaid medical bills and I'm suicidal. I'm being forced to choose if my mental health or physical health is more important and i need guidance.",29Jan2019,1

16,"I recently found my husband with lines of Percocet he was about to snort. He lied and said it was the first time and that he wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize our family. We have a 10 month old at home. Since then I’ve picked up on several signs that he kept doing it. I found several Percocet pills, razors and cards with residue on them. We’ve gone back and forth about it for the past 2 months and I finally gave him 30 days to get clean before we would leave. It’s been 30 days and he asked for a 10 day extension. I feel like it will just prolong it and not actually help. I tried being understanding and on his side. I tried being harsh and called him out for things I find. I just feel like the next thing to do is leave and leave it up to him. I know he won’t stop until he wants to and and staying home is putting our son in danger. My biggest concern was that he was doing it in places our son could crawl and then put his hands in his mouth. He would just blame it on something else when I would point it out. He has an excuse for everything. He’s been stealing the pills from his dad who has a problem and I know that’s what started it and most likely the reason why he’s an addict. He grew up watching his dad and says he doesn’t want the same life for our son. At this point no one knows about his addiction.

18,"I’d like to start off by saying I’m going to be vague but honest in this post. 
A while back I did something that I really regret doing to someone I love and care deeply about. However, I decided to not tell them what I did because I felt like it would not do anyone any good to tell. The guilt from what I did led to depression. At first I felt so bad all the time, all I wanted to do was stay at home and lay in bed. I made a promise to myself that I would never do anything to hurt anyone that I care about anymore and I’ve already been trying to become a better person. I’ve been considerably nicer to said person and everyone else. However, I still question whether what I did was right or wrong. About 2 weeks ago I went back to my therapist of a long time ago and told him everything. He said I was doing the right thing by not confessing and promising myself to change for the better. He said I’ll just have to move on and be the best person I can be to that person and everyone. I really do care about this person and would do anything to make them happy. My therapist said I had already beaten myself up enough and that I need to move past my mistakes and be happy again. The depression has gotten better I think, but I’m nowhere near my normal self. My therapist said this is just a part of growing as a person but I feel like it should have gotten better by now. But my question to you is, is it okay to hide something from someone if it would only hurt them, and you’ve become a better person? Or is it just selfish?

19,"My mom has been going through some financial hardships based on her recurring payments and debts. 

I pulled out a loan to help her, it wasn’t a lot of money to help cover her but it worked for her car payment at the very least.

My boyfriend knows I want to help (under guilt ridden social responsibility) and offered for her and my sisters to move into our apartment. The problem starts that while I agreed I was very uncomfortable and upset at the idea. It’s our first real place together and I didn’t really want to bring them into our lives after being separated for two and a half years. 

My mom suggested we rent a house between the three of us. Three beds and we would rent one out to a single female. I told her I didn’t like the idea of a stranger living in the hypothetical house and said my sisters could share it instead. Mom said it was okay and later on said she would be staying in her own apartment. 

She did suggest something that I didn’t agree with at first but do see the benefit in. 

My end point- I feel extreme guilt if I don’t try to help her or even make the offer no matter how half hearted it is. Her being a single mother of four has my respect but she has done/said things to hurt me that I haven’t been able to let go completely. Thus I’m socially guilty obligated to help her at my own expense because I’m the next oldest who lives close by. 

TLDR: I’m guilty about not wanting to help my mom but I feel like I have to help her out of duty as her next oldest and because she raised my four sisters all by herself. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this feeling after two years of no contact. ",29Jan2019,1
20,So I’ve had a juul since a few months ago (can’t remember exactly when I got it) and I’ve just recently noticed how much it’s affected my life.

21,"Throw away account. 

I moved into a new apartment over the summer with a cousin and a friend of mine. I have lived in this city for a couple years now, and my cousin is completely new to it. I am the only one in the house with a car. I am pretty introverted / independent while my cousin is the exact opposite in some ways: extremely extroverted, loves social stimulus almost always. He is an extremely kind and caring person, and one that has completely enriched my life.

We both kind of had similar goals for the year, one of them being to cook more because we had just came off years where we absolutely dominated uber eats and grub hub. Slowly we began cooking together because whenever I would go to the grocery store, he would tag along for convenience. The grocery store is a quarter mile from our apartment so I understand not wanting to walk, but at the same time it is very walkable. We cook together, we eat together and we spend time talking with each other after we eat as well - and this is every day. 

He is new to the city, so he doesn't have many friends in it really so we usually end up going out together on the weekends as well. He does have some though. He has some cousins that live here, and he has a couple friends that live here as well. I just want to go out with my friends sometimes without him because of the amount of time we end up spending together. It sounds super shitty, but I want to give my unfiltered thoughts for the best advice.

I feel guilty if I don't invite him places. There is a concert coming up that I know he will enjoy. Two of my friends want to go with me, who also know my cousin from growing up around each other. They aren't good friends with each other but they know each other. Again, I just wanna hang with my friends without this person that I spend so much time with, but I know that he would want to go and would ask me why I did not invite him along.

It ends up feeling like I am tethered to him. I come home and he's already home because he works from home. I get back to my room from work where I need to just chill and decompress and I get a knock on my door which pretty much signifies its time to make dinner. Sometimes its 5 minutes after I get back and I basically have to tell him to go back to his room and just give me some time. He comes in, we chat, then go downstairs and make dinner. Or the knock on the door signifies we have to go grocery shopping for the nights dinner. Its getting to the point where if I am going to go out with co-workers or friends during the week for dinner and drinks, I end up texting him to let him know I wont be home to make dinner and he should go on without me. Or I come home and am super motivated to do some side work and I don't want to spend time cooking and just want to order takeout. I feel as though I have to tell my cousin that I am just going to get take out. I know this seems like something extremely small, but just the act of **having** to tell someone that I am going to get takeout is enough to annoy me.

My introversion is getting the best of me. Sometimes I get home and I just dont want to spend time with anyone lol. I just want to chill in my room. Now I have to tell someone that I want to do that, but I usually don't say anything because I feel as though its rude to tell someone this. I just suck it up and make dinner and hang.

I really just want to ""break things off"" and have independence again. I don't really want to check with someone else anytime I go to do something.

Am I being completely selfish?

23,"So I made a throwaway because my main account is known by others and I broadcast quite a bit online and I really don't want people who watch my broadcasting to know how much I'm depressed. 

For just over three years I have been working really hard at broadcasting online and I really thought I was getting somewhere, making money, getting invited to events, making friends. I thought finally for the first time in my life I was doing something I was successful at. Ever since April I haven't been invited to any more events, pay has not been good at all and I'm just at the end of my rope because I still broadcast from home all the time for companies but never get the call when it comes time for the big events. Bills pile up because unless you are making the big events you barely make a month's salery and I have applied to so many jobs with not one yes I don't even know what to do at this point.

On top of all this I broke up with my girlfriend of four years and I hate it. I mean it was bound to happen I guess. We were in a long distance relationship barely seeing each other and honestly she didnt need me or want to speak to me anymore she was just focused on work and nothing else. I admire that hard work a lot but when you tell me you have no time to talk but constantly post on Instagram I get kind of upset.

I don't it just seems like nothing is working out anymore. I'm alone, I have no friends, and my line of work is fizzling out. I really thought I was good enough too.

A little backstory: My husband and I are in our late 20s and have to live with my parents while we finish our college education. I've tried really hard to stay at a distance and not get involved with her various issues including those she has with my father. When I was growing up she often put me in the middle of their fights and accused me of favoring my father over her. They often have massive blowouts. Some in public. 
Over the holidays this year she got into a fight with my brother's wife who blocked her on FB and now she thinks my brother has abandoned her. But at the same time refuses to try and mend things with his wife or reach out through more than just texts. She called me to her room during a fit one night to ""counsel"" her on the matter. I just told her that they would come around and to try to let go of the issue for a while. 
Today she started bickering with my dad who is trying to plan her birthday celebration tomorrow and started accusing him of being mean and bullying her. We managed to have a nice time at the movies and then my dad made a beigne comment when we got home and she fully blew up. She started wailing and crying and hitting herself. My dad left.

So she calls me in for ""counsel"" again and goes off saying she hates my dad and he's so mean to her and apparently told her that she does this every year around her birthday. She asked me if that was true and I just said ""yes"" because that's the truth. (Though she does stuff like this pretty consistently). I tried to tell her she was kind of blowing things out of proportion and to stop but she just started talking badly about herself. Then she just told me to go away. 
I'm sorry but I just can't deal with it anymore. She's so abusive to my dad. But I can't say anything without her accusing me of conspiring against her. And she wants me to sooth her ego and tell her how great she is and validate her feelings but I can't do that either. Am I doing the right thing by removing myself from the situation? Is there something I can say to fix things? If there is a better subreddit for this kind of thing please let me know! ",29Jan2019,1
27,"This may be a bit of a rambling post, my first on Reddit but I've been reading Reddit for a long time so here goes.  I've suffered with depression my whole life and like many people there's good times and bad times but unfortunately more bad times than good and more bad times as I get older. I believeI've tried all the things that people generally suggest when it comes to dealing with depression I've gone to doctors, I've talked to family and friends where I can, I've taken medication, I've just tried to keep going and focus on the positives with the hopes that things will improve, unfortunately things just keep getting worse. I've basically been on a downward spiral for years and I honestly can't remember the last time I smiled because I was happy and not just to put on a face for other people. I only get up from day-to-day and keep going because I don't know what else to do and I'm afraid of hurting my family if I stopped. None of my family is close I'm divorced my daughter has moved away and I was never a great parent because I just barely make it through the day on my own let alone trying to be the parent my daughter needed and deserved. I have few friends and none that I see more than once or twice a year because of distance and just generally poor social skills. I feel completely alone. I don't know what to do anymore. I had a medical issue earlier this month and at first I thought it was a heart attack. I honestly didn't call 911 or go to the hospital for hours because I figured, fine if I have a heart attack at least I don't have to suffer anymore. I honestly don't know if I would ever kill myself, I don't believe in an afterlife and part of me thinks that at least living and suffering is better than non-existence. But it gets harder everyday. I just don't know how to keep going or how to want to keep going. Please tell me something that I haven't thought of.",29Jan2019,1
28,"Hi All. 

Could use some advice from people who lift. I’ve (25 F. 5’8”) been lifting for over a year now. I’m up to 215lbs in deadlift and I was 185lbs in squats. But for some reason I’ve fallen back in squats. I’m now only doing 175lbs and can barely do a set of 5. Whereas before I was doing 185 for 5 by my fifth or sixth set. I do a slow ramp up. Start with 135 and increase in weight with each set. 

What could be making this happen? Not enough protein? 

In general I just don’t feel good with squats and I feel so weak. Not sure what happened. I also haven’t had any issues with my deadlifts. Those have continued to feel good and I’m increasing weight slowly. ",29Jan2019,1

32,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry if this is formatted weird, I'm on mobile.

The title pretty much says it all. A teacher's son that works at the school has bullied a long list of kids, and the school refuses to punish him. The excuses range from ""Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it, I know him, he'd never do that."" to actually getting the kids that were being bullied in trouble. Kids have literally asked me why he's such a ""dick"" or ""bitch."" I just tell them I don't know, I don't hang out with him anymore. Anyways, I'll list a few examples.

This one was back in 7th grade: He starts picking on a kid he's been bullying since 6th grade in science. Long story short, the kid ended up crying  and the substitute told him to go down to the office. We had a long debate in there, they called down witnesses, and pretty much everyone said (who we'll refer to as the bully) started it. The principal ended up yelling at the kid who was being picked on and made him call his parents, saying *he* started it. At that point I was so fucking close to losing it on the principal. But I didn't - and I now regret that. This kid has been down to the counselor several times to complain about him, and not once did the bully get in trouble.

I've watched the bully slam his binder into kids faces (I'm not even kidding) and when they tell someone, anyone, no one seems to care. Several teachers said it was an ""accident"" and he ""didn't mean it."" When one kid had enough, they went down to the principal, and he refused to check the security cameras that he's always bragging about. (Because he can see ""everything"" that happens)

This one's a good one. There's this poor kid in English that sat next to him for a short period of time (he's actually a friend of mine, that's why I'm so frustrated by this situation), that the bully would always drink his water (not fountain) and put pencils or pens in it. One time he got up to present his book report, and when he goes to sit down, the bully just grabbed his water and is drinking it. So he grabs the water, flips it upside down, soaks his shirt, and me and a few others burst out laughing, and the teacher gives him a stare for a good 45 seconds, like he did something wrong, or overreacted. And I doubt it's not like she doesn't see this going on *all hour*, *every day*.

One more. I'm in history class, and I hear a girl complaining to the teacher (I sit right by the teacher) that during lunch, while she was finishing something in the teacher's room, that the bully was ""pushing her around."" This one I wasn't there to see, but from how much I've talked to her it doesn't seem like she'd make it up. But the solution was ""Look, I know it might seem like he was trying to single you out, but, I know him, he wouldn't have done anything like that on purpose."" 

Anyways, you get the point. I don't know if I'm overreacting but the school is always telling us to 'stick up' for other kids and report bullying when you see it. 

tl;dr A teacher's son that works at the school bullys several kids, most of which have complained to the school but the school has refused to take any action to punish him.

I tell him this thinking he’d leave me alone. Wrong. Today, I’m walking in the hallway to the restroom and I see him talking to someone so I try to avoid eye contact. I successfully do, and head back to class without talking to Mark. I sit down in my seat and about 2 minutes later, Mark comes into my class and sits next to me. He says something like “hey I’m not in your class but I just wanted to say hi to you”. I ask how he knew which class I was in and he says he saw me leave the restroom and go down a hallway. He then proceeded to look in every classroom in that hallway until he saw me. I’m totally creeped out and just give him this blank look and he says “I’ll see you tomorrow”. Please tell me I’m not overreacting by thinking this guy is weird as hell. To make things weirder,Mark is definitely in his mid 30’s and I’m in my early 20’s.

He goes ""Hey my little Chinita!"" or ""My sweet Chinita"", etc, and hugs her very tightly, etc etc.  My girlfriend takes offense to this and one day she told me that she wants my Dad to stop that and I should tell him that it bothers her.  I told her that I was sure he doesn't say it to be offensive/mean, that it's done with love.  So my girlfriend exploded on me saying that I was insensitive to her feelings and that I am emotionally inconsiderate and invalidating her because I did not speak to my Dad about the situation and how I reacted to her bringing up that something bothered her, saying  that I undermined her and don't care about how she feels.  All I had mentioned was that  I was sure that My Dad does not come from a place of racism or that he was trying to be offensive, but that he was showing our daughter love.

*Some of my symptoms are (i am not asking for a diagnosis plz don't yell at me) :* 

1. I am constantly thinking, like when someone is talking to me I am too busy thinking about what the other person is thinking or about something that is completely irrelevant, therefore not listening to what the person is saying to me and feeling like shit when I ask them to repeat or pretend that I listened. My focus is never on what it should be. One time i was in an interview and the woman told me all about the company and then asked me to summarize what she said and I had to make a crappy response that meant absolutely nothing
2. My social cues are getting worse everyday, I cannot even talk to my best friend normally because I am always thinking that she hates me and Im self conscious around her
3. Nervous habits: I bite my lips to the point of bleeding and bite all of the skin off, same goes with fingers (this is getting worse)
4. If I do something to one side of my body, I have to do it to the other. My boy will freeze if I don't. For example, If I scratch my right arm, I need to scratch my left arm afterwards or I feel uncomfortable and my body stops working. 
5. I have gained 30 pounds in 1.5 years (ever since start of college) because I eat when stressed and cant stop. 
6. Mood Swings: I can be perfectly happy one second, and the next i am questioning life and getting really upset 
7. I have to consciously think about not moving in order to stop moving my body (constantly moving). 
8. When someone sits next to me, I have trouble breathing for fear that that they can hear me breathing. Sometimes I stop breathing fro extended periods of time and in class I cannot focus on the lecture at all. 
9. Lastly, and most scarily, when I am doing anything normal, like walking down the street or driving or waiting for the train, I get these images that pop into my mind what the worst case scenario would be in that situation and I am scared that that is going to happen, so it consumes my mind. My body has to stop itself from getting into car accidents after i have thought about swerving into another car. 

I guess the advice I'm asking for is how to push myself to go to the doctor. I put it off every time I get the opportunity. Obviously something I wrong with me and I need to be told that there is something wrong with me so I can stop worrying about it and get the help I need. Also, if anyone else is struggling with anything I mentioned above, can you give me some advise on how you resolve or relieve it.

I don't think he ever stopped liking me, and he did something a few months after the whole flirting that confirmed I was pretty much right. I stopped seeing him around at parties so naturally I stopped having strong feelings towards him. That's not to say I got over him, but I did forget about him. 

This past weekend, I went to a party that his frat was having and I saw him. Typically he'd run the other way when he sees me but that was not the case this weekend. I could feel him looking at me occasionally throughout the night too. Sometime during the night I was standing in a huddle of people and I guess he grew a pair (but not really) because he sorta awkwardly came over and stood next to me. He didn't say anything or even looked in my direction. I stepped like a cm away from him and I guess he took that as a bad sign cuz he DASHED after that and I didn't see him again for the rest of the night. 

My friends say that this was him actually trying. In their heads he came over so that I could talk to him. They also say I'm ""intimidating"" and ""always shoot him dirty looks"" (which I disagree with) and that I have strong rest b**** face which is why he's been scared to approach me for all this time.

I know the husband likes to watch sports, but I'm not sure if it's football or basketball, and that he drinks beer.  They have local family in the area, which they spend frequent time with. 

I'm moving out Mid-March and would like to gift them SOMETHING to say thank you, preferably something more personal than just a gift card to a store, something they can both use, or use together, and something that isn't a chore to maintain. I have a spending budget of up to $150.00. The only thing I've been able to think of is perhaps a year subscription to Graze snacking services, but I'm not sure if that is something they would like.

60,Ok im not sure where to go for this one so if im in the wrong sub im sorry. My washing machine is on the lowest water level setting. When the load is done and I need to switch it to the dryer the clothes are soaked and dripping. I have tried filling the washer so the water gets soaked up but it doesnt seem to help.

64,"About 7 years ago I met this girl online. We live on the opposite ends of the US I’m from Oregon and she is from Florida. The moment we met we instantly clicked. We had the same feelings for each other and we instantly fell in love. We texted, talked on the phone, FaceTimed and we were so comfortable with each other. We dated for about a year and then things fell apart and we parted ways.

But somehow through the years we kept coming back to each other on and off. We haven’t spoke to each other for about a year until recently.

For some odd reason she randomly popped up in my mind and I couldn’t stop thinking about her. So I found her on social media, and of course I reached out to her. We instantly clicked like if we were never apart, but my feelings this time are stronger than they have ever been. which I don’t understand, but I never told her. 

She expressed how she has recently moved and is only 2 hours away from where I live. Then she opened her heart up how she still has strong feelings for me and would love to meet in person finally. 

But through all this for some reason our feelings are deeper than ever and we can’t ever seem to let go. Neither of us understand why we both feel this way.

I just need help understanding how could my feelings be so strong if I’ve never met her in person?

Could these feelings be stronger just because of the excitement of finally meeting her?

So this may seem really trivial, but today at work I was doing my tasks and trying to get my work done. This person who just got newly promoted to lead walked in and said “I don’t know how to do this specific task and I need you to do it for me”.  I told him well I would check in on it but my plate is already pretty full. 

So later this afternoon he walks back in and says “did you get it done?” And I told him no I was busy doing other things and I didn’t get a chance, so he get smart with me and says “well I don’t have time either”, and just walks out of the office. Mind you this guy just got promoted to a lead position today, and is already acting like this. I told one of the other leads who has been here for a while, but he doesn’t seem to care so I am wondering should I bring this up to management level or talk to the person in question directly? 

I don’t want to get him in trouble but just the way he went about this made me so mad that I don’t even want to perform the job now. I also don’t want him to turn around and get me in trouble for some reason.",29Jan2019,1

My goal was to grow and become a higher position and this office said that they’d pay for my classes to become that if i worked there for a certain amount of time.

I haven’t mentioned it yet but I’m going to tomorrow because I’m really contemplating about putting in my two weeks. Idk if it’s because I’m too nice or I don’t speak up but the main reason I want to quit is because I feel like I’m constantly being degraded by my office managers. Idk if it’s part of their personality or how they talk i don’t know but I’m just at a place where I don’t feel comfortable talking to them at all.

69," 

Hello all,

Please be blunt with me because I am in a real need for some straight up responses and/or tough love.

""When you graduate from college, everything will get better"", I was told...

I  had idea that I would work hard and get a good degree from a reputable  school and then get a job that I really liked. I put in the hard work  and got a Finance degree from a top 10 undergraduate business school. I  interned in retail/branch banking and did a sales and trading internship  in NYC. When I graduated, I had a job lined up in the capital markets  division at a middle market regional bank in a big city. I've been  working there for almost two years and from the outside most people  would consider me to be a success...

But  honestly, I'm miserable. I feel like I'm trapped and don't belong in a  corporate setting. My work performance is slipping and I have come to  realize that its because I don't care about my job. My bad attitude has  cost me my relationship with my boss and coworkers. I've lost their  trust due to my rushed work and lack of attention to detail. I'm  miserable every minute I sit in my seat and I am miserable until the  moment I leave everyday. It sucks going to work on Monday and I start  dreading it starting Sunday night. When I took the personality test to  get the job, I wasn't honest and I was focused on getting the job rather  than showing them who I really am. I am an ISFP.

Now,  I'm stuck doing this job that I hate. In between, I worked part-time as  a car mechanic because I am a car guy. However, after realizing how the  older guys were (they had bad backs, bad arms, bad legs, etc...), I've  realized that the trades are not a good way to go, however, I like to  make things, create things with my hands and mentor other people. Doing  those things make me feel alive and going to the office is like cutting  myself with a blunt knife.

The situation  in the office is pretty bad. I don't get invited to lunch anymore and I  don't think my coworkers like working with me. I applied to another job  that is very similar to this one and they are extending me the offer  letter. The pay bump is pretty good, and I'm not sure what I should do.  Its in another big city on the east coast and it will be a pretty far  move from where I am living now. I am afraid that the result will be the  same if I go to this new place even if the work is only slightly more  interesting. I'm not sure what I should do and I really need help.

Thanks in advance!",29Jan2019,1

73,"So I (21F) connected with this guy (25M) on Bumble about a week or two ago. Really cute to me and we had great conversation on the app. Like, sending paragraphs back and forth to each other and both of us were asking questions about each other and connecting about things we both liked. So already very different from other matches I get where it’s a struggle to get a sentence or two out of a guy.

This went on for a few days. Then I don’t think I heard from him for about 2 days after I asked a question so I messages him on Bumble just letting him know that I was gonna move on because it seemed to me that he lost interest. He said that he definitely hadn’t lost interest and then said that he had gotten sick and had been dealing with a lot of stress from work/having to work really late so hadn’t been checking the app for a few days. Then he asked for my number.

So we moved to texting and it was back to the paragraphs back and forth. There was maybe two other times where he responded really late back to me and apologized saying he was just busy. He was also suggesting at least two times where we should do something together in the future. I agreed and asked him if he would be free Sat night or Sunday. Then I texted him on again Sunday afternoon asking if he was free.

It’s now Monday night and I haven’t heard back yet. He works in finance though and apparently it’s a really busy time of year for accountants. And he doesn’t text during the day while at work. He has been getting out of work at 7:00 at night a lot I believe. He does seem really interested in me when we talk about everything. But his response time suggests otherwise.

I have been ghosted before. Do you think he’s actually really busy? Just not a big phone guy/is not obsessed with his phone? Or about to ghost? Would you freak if you haven’t received a text reply in a few days? What would you do?",29Jan2019,1
74,"It took me YEARS to finally get away from this insane woman. She’s a hardcore alcoholic and has a generally toxic personality. I have countless times/situations I should probably start posting about her to NMoms/Nparents. She’s caused me and my younger sibling so much trauma my little sister has, at this point, run away. She’s barely 22 yrs old. With severe medical diagnosis of autism. She got pregnant last week, under my mother’s ‘responsible guardian/fiduciariness.’  And I took the time to call/explain/schedule an appointment with a local planned parent-good. (Ya kno who I mean. Yes they understood and took care of it.) From what I can gather she was taken advantage of but she’s basically a child, it’s hard to get the full story from her. I did whatever I could to help. This is just one of the most recent examples of how many times I’ve had to jump in and, not only pay $$ whatever I could to help the issue, but also emotionally fix whatever it was my mother had neglected in the first place. 

Now (my Nmom) is telling me that since my sister, who had apparently signed a lease with her for this 3 bed, 2 bath, HUGE ass apartment they were staying in together, had ran off with this guy who got her pregnant, (also did not help her out financially or seem to care at all whatsoever that she was pregnant) and has not paid a dime in rent since they both moved in. My mom has no money to pay the rent anymore, she’s told me. She called me up yesterday to let me know she’d be moving into my spare bedroom and would be happy to ‘help around the house’ that is, after her hip replacement surgery that’s scheduled for Wednesday. That I was also guilt tripped into helping with by taking her to and from the hospital since my younger sister had ‘abandoned’ her. 

My fiancé does not want her anywhere near this property, (small apartment with 2 beds, 1 bath.) But she claims that, my father, who also claims to pay her rent every month, and already sends her very large checks for alimony every month, hasn’t sent her any money since November. I don’t have proof of either. Though my mother is WAY more shady than my dad could ever be, I literally just have no idea what to do or even what direction to turn. I want to just go no contact so bad but when your mother is like literally begging and crying that she’ll be homeless if you don’t help her, what the fuck do you do?

75,"Hey all. Long story short, I'm a 20 year old woman who's never been in an actual relationship. I've asked out lots of guys in my teenage years, but I was rejected by pretty much all of them.

I feel like there are a lot of reasons why I've been rejected as much as I have. First, to be perfectly honest, I'm not a great-looking woman. I don't think I'm hideous, but on my best day I think I can at most reach a 7 and every other day I'm like a 3-4. However, in the last year I got a lot better at fashion and taking care of myself and got a little more attention from guys. I think that if I keep working at it, I can reach a point where I feel confident in my appearance. 

I think that the main explanation that I run into again and again is that most guys see me as a cute, soft little girl. I have a very high-pitched voice (my mom calls me minnie-mouse), and I'm very soft-spoken. I've gotten a lot better at putting myself out there over the years, but I'm still pretty quiet in most social situations and I don't stand out as much as I would like. I'm also super apologetic and overly-polite, like I say 'please' and 'thank you' so much in casual situations that people think it's funny. Speaking of which:

There's this weird thing that happens where people sometimes treat me like... I'm their plaything? I just got a new job a few months ago, and while all of my coworkers are super kind and I consider myself friends with them already, sometimes they make me feel a little uncomfortable?

One of them treats everything I say like it's a cute meme. He repeats almost all of my sentences back to me in a cute sing-songy voice, and he says that the way I speak ""cracks him up"". Another guy is the same, and he always asks me to say certain phrases to make him laugh. I always agree because it's easier to go along with it than it is to put up a fight. 

I almost feel bad complaining about this because otherwise they've treated me so well and they've gone out of their way to make me feel safe and welcome, but it always feels like there's this underlying element of them not respecting me? I felt this way in highschool, too. People thinking I'm a silly, cute puppydoll that they could play around with but hardly ever actually respecting me as a person. 

As a matter of fact, in 10th grade a girl told me that she could never imagine me having sex because I was way too 'smol' to do it. She always made jokes about how she needed to protect me from boys because I would never be able to handle them. I know she was joking, but this was soul-crushing lmao

There's actually another guy at my job, a guy who I like a lot and would love to work up the courage to ask out. But it feels like there's no point in even trying because he's almost guaranteed to say no, because he probably sees me the same way everyone else does. As this cute, soft-spoken little girl with no sex-appeal whatsoever.

Anyways. Would love any advice you could spare. Thank you for reading

77,"My friendship group has always been harsh. Our humour is quite dark and we like to take the piss out of each other constantly but it’s all in good fun. Sometimes my friends started to be mean to other people in school and college, usually they didn’t care and they joined in (A lot of people where I am are like this 😂). Usually however I’ll interject and stop them which usually works. I’m sort of the middle man between it all I guess. 

However one of my friends has sort of lost his way a bit. We always believed (still do) that you can make whatever joke you want IN CONFIDENCE. Wanna make a joke about something fucked up? That’s fine as long as it’s only to us. But lately he’s forgotten about this rule.

He made another friend when we moved up to college. The guys got a sort of god complex I guess, doesn’t think he can do wrong and doesn’t care about what others think. My friend has sort of picked up on this and now they both openly make fun of people. I used to join in when the people we did it to joined in. But they don’t now, they don’t want to do it anymore. But he doesn’t get that and he keeps doing it even if the guy is minding his own business. And like I said before, my friends are harsh so it’s even worse. 

We don’t really do “being serious” as it doesn’t sink in so sitting down and talking to him is out of the picture. I call him out of this stuff when it happens but it can sometimes stoke the fire and make him want to do it more. I don’t wanna loose this guy as a friend.

Currently getting loans from the government, but the prospect of a loan from my grandpa, which would likely carry no interest or deadlines, is obviously a big draw.

This is a very generous man. Donates millions of dollars every year to local causes, schools, sports teams, etc. He once flew the entire high school soccer team across the country, put them up in a hotel for a week, for a few soccer matches. He helps his children, I'm fairly certain he's helped out my cousins, and I know he does assist them with vehicles. Finds them one he owns that works, gets it repaired, then accepts payment whenever they can. Probably at a loss, realistically.

So like I said, I'm about 98% sure he'd loan me whatever I needed (like $20,000/yr), and I would be eternally grateful to the man that's basically my sole role model, but I just have no clue how to ask without fearing rejection. Even with success, I'd still feel embarrassed.",29Jan2019,1

I recently got a puppy and my coworker loves dogs (she has a dog that she probably loves more than her own kids), but she keeps subtly shaming me about how I take care of my dog (this is not my first dog by the way). Example: she'll ask me how he's doing and everything is fine until I mentioned that I used apple cider vinegar diluted with water to give him a bath. He had a rash and was super itchy so a friend (who has owned multiple dogs) recommended we try apple cider vinegar; so we tried it before our vet appt and it worked really well. Plus his fur was super soft after. But she kinda disappointedly said ""poor puppy"" and went on about how he probably suffered because of the smell of vinegar, etc. This is not the first time she's said ""poor puppy"" to me like I'm abusing him or something... Once I mentioned that he's not doing so well with the puppy pad potty training and she said ""poor puppy... you should take him outside to do his business"". I didn't want to do this because it's winter and really cold for such a small puppy, but I took note of this so that the next time she asked me about him I said that I was gonna consider starting to take him outside, to which she responded with shock that I would bring a puppy outside in such cold weather. Honestly, I know she's coming from a good place because I know that she loves dogs and just wants the best for him but everyone has a different way of taking care of their dogs and I'm honestly getting annoyed by this.

I don't know if this would be fine with their parents? In terms of if I got them something (e.g. a small gift, they like to play outside often so maybe something they can be active with). 

The other concern is I'm really not clear on where they live, or to be honest, how many kids there were (I was a bit focused on the dogs. There were 3-4 kids)... Or exactly which houses they live in. They do often play in the street so it should be easy enough to see them again.

And actually prior to the following and stalking the time me and him did take a break he had randomly showed up the a restaurant hangout place he always knew I was at. So he’s a previous stalker. Anyways he followed me to a grocery store then Starbucks and all the way to my house. After that happening a few times I finally went a new route to my house. But later after that I had these accounts following me asking me to hangout and they were associated to this particular ex. A few months pass by and I start dating a new dude (now ex) little did I know he was friends with him. But today I had found they are friends, and also the guys messaging me are as well with that particular ex! Why would one specific ex do this? Stalk? Follow? Have a friend date me? And then try and hangout with me? After all of this he is still dating the other girl but she had told me recently he was caught with 5 new hook ups. And apparently one of them had been stalked by him. Is this normal, to stalk a ex to this extent? And why would you have a friend date your ex? ",29Jan2019,1

I’m pretty sure I’m not in the top 5% of grades but I do get As and barely any Bs. If you’re not counting AP classes (ugh).

96,"To start off, I’m 17. My mom and dad were never married and they separated when I was around 3. They split custody and I was raised on a 50/50 schedule, but this schedule wasn’t implemented until I was 8. My mom has had struggles with depression, anger, being bipolar and she made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. I should mention that my parents had me when they were 20, so pretty young. My mom raised me as a single mother for a lot of my childhood until my dad took her to court and got 50% custody. She never liked me going to my dads because he had another family but I never found a problem with it. 
Entering middle school, I had a really hard time doing well in school. I have ADHD but I don’t like using medication as it gives me headaches and it’s just not a good feeling to be on meds. Around this time, my mom gave birth to my siblings (I have a stepdad) and our relationship got kind of distant. We argued a lot more and she would say really hurtful things to me. I don’t hate my mom, but it really sucks when your own mom starts telling you how stupid you are, that she has given up on you, or that I’ll never go to college. At the time I didn’t think she meant those things, but as I entered high school, things got a lot worse. She kicked me out when I was 15 and I had to live with my dad. My dad went through a lot of legal troubles and lost everything he had. His family, his house, his job, he basically hit rock bottom and couldn’t take care of me anymore. I was sent to live with my grandma. After a while, things got kind of better but I just felt like I couldn’t communicate with either of them anymore. They rarely call me, and I rarely call them. I’m a senior now and I’m about to go off to college next year. I used my moms mailing address so I can get financial aid so I had to recently go pick up my mail to check up if any colleges sent me anything, and this is where it got really bad. I went in and we started talking about college, but the minute I brought up the $$$ side of it, she just burst out in anger. I’ll admit, I got really angry too and I said a lot hurtful things but I regret them now. I stormed out of the house and we haven’t talked since. 
I don’t know if this will get better with time. I say this because she’s blocked me on everything and this is the first time she’s done this. 
My dad recently kinda got back on his feet. He got an apartment but it’s too small for me to live with him. Either way, I don’t think I want to. My dad used to be a really hard working guy who rarely drank and provided for his family but now that he doesn’t have anything, all he does is drink and go clubbing. I hate that. I stayed over a few weeks ago and we went to Tahoe, but we didn’t even spend time together. He brought his new girlfriend along with us and they basically went clubbing the whole trip. 
I’m sorry if I overshared, I just don’t know what to include and what to exclude. 
What should I do? I love them both, they did a lot for me and I understand life gets hard, but is that enough of a reason to stop talking to me? To lose interest? I was their first child and I just feel like shit lowkey. Should I even pursue a better relationship? Or would I be better off cutting them off as well and going on with my life? Please let me know.

97,"Hi all.

So, for the better part of a year, I've been making side money off of selling nudes. I post a sample pic here and there and cue an influx of people requesting my content. In the early days, some of the photos had my face. I also have very distinct tattoos. 

I feel like an idiot for doing it, but it really helps take the edge off of being poor and in college. 

I'm worried that some of my photos have circulated beyond where I post and sell them. They probably have. I don't know how to check, and I'm paranoid that someone could have gotten my name even though I've never posted it. 

I dunno, I'm worried that I fucked up my future. I mean, I'm trans and plan to start transitioning soon, but still. I don't want my whole life to be ruined because I did/do this. ",29Jan2019,1
98,"I’m a freshman in college, and I’m kinda having a hard time right now.

I believe that I have a repulsive personality.  I honestly believe that although I may be unsightly, if I had an interesting, friendly personality, I would be able to make friends in classes and stuff. I have always had a hard time making friends as I am socially awkward and feel anxious around new people.  By the time I can open up, people have already formed friendships and I’m third-wheeling.

As a result, I do not leave my house much except for classes.  I am not a huge fan of partying (I do not drink) so I don’t do anything on the weekends.  In my first semester of college I was absolutely swamped, so I could not join any clubs.
I am now extremely lonely.  I call my family a lot, and have one friend from first semester with whom I watch a movie with every weekend, but other than that I am totally alone.  My movie friend is extremely busy, and does not have any free time to do clubs and stuff with.  It’s also snowing like crazy here, and this being my first winter (FL native) has been challenging.

I let my insecurities about my appearance and personality get to me and started overeating, causing me to regain weight; I am now 160 lbs (I had lost 20.  
I am aware that I am unattractive to men.  I always have been aestheticaly unpleasant to look at; even some freakin’ tarot card lady told me when I was fourteen that I was “unconventionally attractive” and that I wouldn’t have a relationship until my later years.  I’d asked guys I had a crush on out in high school, but everyone said no.  I’ve never kissed a guy, and I’m afraid of even trying to date because of rejection.  I’m scared of even having sex because I don’t want a guy to think I’m ugly.

^(I am not trying to compliment-fish about my appearance or personality or whatever, I am simply trying to give the whole picture.)

I’ve tried my best to tell myself that it doesn’t matter, but nothing is working.  I still feel like a piece of garbage, both appearance-wise and personality-wise.

If I’m being honest, I am becoming a bit depressed (although I am not self-diagnosing).  Is there anyone out there who has had a similar experience to me?  How did you deal with it?",29Jan2019,1
99,"So I have a brother a year older than me. When I was around 8 or something we would always fight. A lot of the times they were physical. It went a lot like this: I would do or say something he doesn't like (it would never be anything serious like calling him an asshole or talking to him sarcastically) and would either give me a ""warning"" or just beat me up. It's been like this for years and I end up doing a lot for him (bringing him food and water). It's calmed down since the last year but it still happens sometimes. Instead of physically abusing me, sometimes he would just mess up everything in my room like throwing everything on the ground and possibly breaking them. He also loves to unplug every cable from my computer when I'm playing games I never had the guts to fight against him so I just let it happen and watch as he ruins everything. 

Telling my parents wont do anything. My mom has basically no control over him anymore and my dad is divorced and on the other side of the world. I just want to deal with this on my own but I don't know how.

This sister causes so much trouble for his family. She has a bad attitude all the time, she doesn't help with chores, and she's always picking fights with my bf. No one in the family likes her. She bickers to their younger siblings. The father says he wouldn't have spent 15 grand on her quinceanera if he knew she'd end up like that. 

The only reason she's around, besides financial reasons, is that she has little children and the mother wants to keep them around. She has a boy, a girl, and another one on the way(all from different fathers). And she does a shitty job raising them. When I try to talk to my bf on the phone all I can hear is those two kids screaming, even at 11pm. She also let's them scribble on the walls with crayon. She let's her boyfriend come to their house and waste their food. He would cook for himself and there would be leftovers no one wants to eat so they would just throw it out.

107,"Alright, so my group consisted of 3 guys and a girl this morning, the girl, a relatively new friend of mine has a rather shady past no one knows much about her, all we know is that she skipped the first year if college due to ""medical reasons"". So instinctually, we try and find out more but, no, she has her cards held extremely close to her chest, fine, so we stopped, this was a month ago when we stopped asking questions, thought we'd be respectful for once. But today, she had taken medication, my friend asked what she was taking, she was intentionally vague again, but as if hinting to what it was, she began reading out the side effects.

 After she'd read the effects, the more immature of the 4 of us began to make jokes about them, now, we are quite the tough skinned group of people, so all 4 of us began to have a good laugh. But that's when she took me aside and dropped the biggest fucking bombshell I've ever had drop me in quite the time. She told me she had a brain tumour and not to tell anyone, now, it would make sense, out of college for a year, medication and the vagueness, but here's the part that makes me doupt this.

After searching for about an hour and a half during my last 2 sessions of the day, I found no medication used for brain tumour treatment that had similar symptoms, specifically, the 4 she made a decent deal of, which was headaches, dry mouth and throat, impotence and painful urination. I also looked up the symptoms of brain tumours, one was poor memory, now, one thing about this girl is she has the best damn memory, I've ever come across, literally photographic.

Now I leave this question to you, did she lie, and if she did, why would she, my most plausable theory is that she may have told me so that I'd stop the jokes, but she isn't a stranger to telling me things that she doesn't want the group to know, personally I think she's telling the truth, but you tell me...

108,"A bit of backstory, I'm a junior in highschool and the kid I'm referring to is very socially awkward and very clingy. He's one of the people most generally try to avoid because of this, which just seems to make him more clingy to those to polite to tell him to leave or who end up in classes with him. I ended up in both categories. 

Today we had a speaker come and talk about depression, gender issues, abuse, and other things that people are age in a middle-to-upper class highschool can be expected to deal with. He was a really good speaker and apparently hit to close to home for this kid. Lunch was right after this period and I sat down at an empty table as I was near the door and therefore one of the first ones to get lunch. He sits down next to me and starts talking, I think he just needed to say something. I'm not even sure if he meant to let it out but he admitted to me that he was once molested over Pokémon cards, and that's about the entirety of what I get out of him, no idea when, where, or who.

115,"For some background, there is a sports team in my high school in which one girl gets hit on constantly as a result of there being lots of guys and not many girls (I'm also a guy).  There is a running gag where we talk about her dating a guy from another school despite her not having any attraction for him.  On the other hand, the girl will jokingly call me gay as a joke, even though I've told her to stop.  So today I went up to him and told him about this girl as a joke, but in retrospect I realize I went too far and I'm in the wrong.

I've already apologized to the girl but she's still angry at me, and most of the guys on the team take her side.  I've reached out to a friend, who gave me the cold shoulder and told me ""Good luck man"".  I know I messed up really bad, and now I'm not sure how to apologize to an entire friend group when I know I am 100% in the wrong.  

At the same time, I can't get it out of my head that I had some justification (being called gay), and that the guys on the team are betraying me in order to get on the girl's good side.  I know I don't want to ghost them (it's a big school) and I want to be on good terms, but I don't know how, so I was wondering if you guys could help me out.

116,"I'll try making a long story short. I'm 18. Last month I started a new job and made friends out of my new co-workers. One is a girl, one was a guy. In middle and high school, I never had too many guy friends. I had some but they were more so ""just there"". **Like we were friends but not ""real"" friends,** if that makes sense. I can explain, if it doesn't.

But the guy co-worker from before always talked to me, made sure I was good, uplifted me, etc. He was a really good role model. **For years, I've heard the phrase ""surround yourself around people who uplift you, who are positive, and support you, vice versa.""** things like that. The guys from middle/ high school never fit that phrase, at all. **I'm not exaggerating at all but the co-worker was the first real genuine person I've ever met. I'm really glad I met him.**

I have social anxiety and bad social skills. He would always say that I was cool but in reality, I thought of him to be the coolest person I've ever met. But again, bad social skills etc. so of course, I never told him. And after realizing how cool he was, I couldn't help but really wish that I had a friend like him. I imagined how much better my life would be if someone like him was in my circle. I also wished that I was like him, in terms of personality.

He left our job a few weeks ago to go back to school. I didn't think much of it at first, I mean the days leading up to his departure, I knew I might feel sad but when the day actually came, I was in my room (before work) actually crying, for a good 45 minutes or so. When he left in the middle of my shift, it took a lot for me to hold everything in. Then I got sad all over again when I got home. All of the stuff that I typed up there \^\^ about him being the first genuine person I knew etc. etc. hit me all at once and I felt like complete sh!t.

After a few days of being sad, I got over it. But now, for some reason, whenever someone mentions his name I shut it out completely. I get irritated fast and start to tear up when I think of how he left or when I see pictures of him on social media. Even as I'm typing this, I get emotional. **And for some reason, I'm mad at him? When I say emotional I mean in an angry way and I don't know why.** I get mad at him instantly and shut down. 

I ask myself ""Why did God put this person in my life if they're just going to leave and leave me hurting?"" That's genuinely how I feel about the situation. I usually don't associate with co-workers but I did this time and look what happened.

**I just want to know why I get mad at him, why I am mad at** ***him*****, who I thought so highly of, and why I shut down whenever his name is brought up.**

Also, I'm heterosexual. I know this stuff may sound odd to you guys but this is genuinely how I feel about a former friend. Nothing more I promise.

This weekend will make it a month since he's left. A whole month has gone by and I'm still affected by him leaving etc. **I need solid advice, please, because it's starting to get to me.**

Thank you and sorry for the long post.

Real life and on the phone are no problem, I've got a million social and verbal cues to go off of. Even email wasn't bad because then people would write longer paragraphs and I had more context, and lack of emoji meant they actually had to *say* how they were feeling.

The job ended end of October, and wants to start for next season (May) Since October, I have turned my time into selling on ebay and dealing with several family emergencies. I am also taking a IT certification exam in March.

I am looking to get a job in the coming months in my IT field. I am currently rewriting my resume, and getting this certification. So right now, job applications are being pushed until Feb. But this amusement park job wants an answer either way mid February.

I can transfer departments now (no more food). and ask about getting into HR or their IT position for the summer season. That is what I am asking for advice.

I am open to working there again as long as I am far away from food service or rides.

What would you do in my situation? Ask HR at old job for a possible HR/IT job using my college credentials while getting this certification (March)? Then if I get a full time job, either give a 2 week notice or go to part time status (depending on new job location) Or tell them I am no longer interested and simply work towards another job with another company?

Summary: Have a rehire paperwork for seasonal job which needs answer by mid Feb for next season. Currently, am getting a certification which has my job search stalled. Will be applying/interviewing for more jobs come Feb. I do not know how to handle seasonal job?

132,"I don’t think I’m breaking the rules here 
I don’t have anyone to talk to. Maybe I should go to a therapist. 
I’m a female, in my 20s, married. Had a baby on nov 7th :). I’m so happy to have my baby here with me. The last couple weeks of pregnancy were so difficult.  I don’t even know how to write about it. I feel kind of guilty for talking about this. 

My mom travels all the way across the country two weeks before my baby is due. My mom and I were so close. I used to call her nearly every day. Sometimes twice a day. I had always considered her my best friend, and I’ve always felt so lucky to have such a close relationship with her. 
So of course I’m really happy she’s here, that she’s going to see her grand baby come into the world, that I’ll have my mom and my husband to support me learning to be a mom. 
The first week is really nice. I haven’t seen my mom in over a year.. I get used to having her here. I feel comfortable and secure. Focusing on preparing myself for childbirth. 

After the first week or two my husband starts having anxiety about her being in the house. 
He stopping coming out of our bed room. If he did come out and see my mom I would have to counsel him later. I started feeling very torn between who to spend time with. I felt like I had to be a mediator.. constant tension. 
I wake up one morning and my husband is crying. He wants to kill himself, he’s anxious, he’s having intrusive thoughts. He’s too anxious to go to work, but I need him to work- we’re about to have a baby - so I convince him to go to work. I ride with him.. after work we go to a clinic  and speak to a social worker about getting him help ASAP. We learn he has to wait 3 weeks before he can be admitted and receive treatment where he wants to go.. 
I later tell mom that I rode with him to work but not why. She starts acting suspicious of me, pointedly asks me what I am hiding and why I’m not telling the truth. On the third or fourth day of all this.. it’s my due date and my husband cannot go into work. He’s having a complete melt down so I call his mom. 
We drive to his moms house. We’re all talking about what’s been going on, how my husbands been feeling, how I’ve been feeling, when she asks me if I can ask my mom to stay somewhere else, perhaps in a hotel.. 
I’m already on edge from talking about my fears of losing my livelihood, my husband, being able to take care of a baby, how my birth is going to go and if my stress is going to cause complications.. so she’s asks me if mom can stay else where and I start hyperventilating I’m embarrassed to say. 
My husband tries to console me as I walk away to gather myself. I tell him to go away which leads to him taking off down the street. His mother stays behind yelling at me for My behavior. Very irrational I know but this was an emotional situation. I eventually chase after him. While I am quickly walking almost jogging down the road I feel like my water might’ve broken.. 
shortly after his mother picks him and I both up in her truck. Apparently he’s called her and asked to be driven to the hospital. So we’re driving to the hospital and I’m sitting in the backseat feeling like I’m unimportant, and debating if my water really broke or not. I’m sitting in the back seat googling what happens after your water breaks while trying to comfort my husband and be supportive of him. 
We’re almost to the hospital and he decides he can wait the couple weeks to get into a nicer place, if I ask my mom to stay else where. I ask his mom to help me ask her.. 

She drives us back to my house and heads upstairs. I literally cannot ask my mom. Eventually my mother in law does it for me and I’m just hysterical, apologizing. I invited her to her grandchild’s birth, I worked for months to keep our apartment, alone (husband lost work due to anxiety had just started their new job) while pregnant.. and I have to ask my mother to leave when I know she doesn’t have anywhere else to go . Hotels are expensive you know.  I end up calling my husbands father and asking if mom can stay there . Thankfully he says yes. 
But my mother in law asks me not to leave my husband alone.. over the next few days I feel like I’m asking people to baby sit my husband so I can go see mom.  But all of his family is too busy. Eventually I get some time with my mom but there’s no where to go since we’re not welcome at my house or anywhere else so we just sit in her car in the freezing snow. 
I’m days past my due date, and they’re wanting to induce me. I decline. Days pass, I can’t walk past moms room without feeling horribly sad and guilty.. I’m so worried my stress is bad for the baby and perhaps I should be induced. 
I have a doctors appointment, their equipment is faulty.. she sends me to the hospital due to perceived heart decelerations. At the hospital they tell me I have to be induced, long story short here.. lol.. I check myself out of the hospital after spending the day there. My midwife tells me they won’t be able to treat me in the future which was a lie, that my insurance wouldn’t cover the expenses another lie, and I had to speak to the head of the department to get papers to sign myself out. I go in the next day and they still want to Induce me I decline. I go home. I Eventually I go into labor at home around 12 at night. I have my baby at 5:12 the next day. Literally 8 mins and 3 pushes after arriving at the hospital. I was terrified of the hospital ha. 
So my baby and I are both happy and healthy. Yay. After two days I’m allowed to go home.. I had to stay two days because they had no time to give me antibiotics or IV of any kind. 
So I’m home with my baby. I still can’t see my mom. I’m constantly worried about her feeling like I betrayed her . Plus I want her with me.. my husband and I are doing newborn baby things . Not sleeping. Feeding. Soothing. Changing diapers. Eventually my mom decides she needs to go back home. I’ve seen her maybe 3 times since I asked her to leave my apartment 2 weeks ago. She tells me she’ll have a plane ticket ready for me when I want to leave here and go back home to her with baby.. 
my baby’s 2 months old now. I haven’t spoken to mom since she left. My husband got a new job a week ago and is going to therapy. I’m now worried about trying to pay my rent. I’m trying to get food stamps.. I’m worried about my babies nutrition because I’m not eating much of anything besides beans and oatmeal. I miss my mom, and I don’t know anyone here. I was taken from mom when I was little by social services. I was a victim of suspected abuse.. took her years to get me back . And now every doctors appointment for my baby kind of scares me. Like he has the smallest bit of redness on his bum because I drank an acidic drink- orange juice.. I worry the doctor is going to label me neglectful and take my child away. I know this is completely irrational. So I practice positive self talk and move away from that idea. I’m scared that if I talk to a counselor for ppd they’ll take my baby away from me because I’m sad. Which is also irrational. I also literally have no gas money to get to a counselor if I wanted to go. 

This was seriously difficult for me to write out. I could’ve done a better job I’m sure. I just I wish I could just talk to someone about it in a fluid manner. I’ve only lived in this state for a year and All the people I’ve made friends with are also friends with my husband. Gotta respect his privacy ya know? 
So thanks for the read . I can’t imagine anyone reading all that disjointed text. And thank you for the platform to get this off my chest . Though I’ve left out a couple bits. ",29Jan2019,1

134,"My mother recently told my older sister over the phone that five years ago, when my dad was in vegas for work, he had sex with a random woman and contracted genital herpes.

He then had sex with my mother when he got home and did not tell her about it until afterwards.

My mother has always been an abusive alcoholic and their marriage was never happy, so I can understand that he might have been unsatisfied with her and decided impulsively to cheat. 

But to know that you have herpes and to choose to have intercourse with your wife anyway without her knowledge? I can't believe it. He seems like a better person than that.

They're getting divorced now and it happened five years ago but I'm still extremely uncomfortable and not sure what to do with this knowledge. I imagine that he doesn't want to talk about it with anybody, let alone his sixteen year old daughter, but I just want to understand why he did what he did.",29Jan2019,1
135,"Hi Reddit

Im pretty new to this so please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask!

I live in a semi rural subdivision in New Zealand (we are all on large lots of 2000sqm+) but still very much a “normal” subdivision in every other respect. Theres no footpath on my side of the street and theres shrubby berm plantings so difficult to walk on my side. 

Quite frequently neighbourhood people are somehow ending up right up at my front fence (which is quite a distance in from my legal boundary as my area doesnt allow front fences near your front boundary, so its also common knowledge that the fence doesnt reflect this) and are peering through it into my property - at what i do not know. I live alone and am not intimidating by any means so this really unsettles me. Its also just all round weird when you walk back into your front room and theres suddenly someone right up at your fence looking in. 

I was considering making a very vague, gently worded post on the Facebook local Community page about how if you dont know the owner of the property, be mindful you dont know their personal circumstances and this behaviour can freak people out unnecessarily, if you need to look for your pet or ball, ring the doorbell and let them know you’re not someone scoping the property to break in. But this will only work of course if these people are part of this page.

Does anyone have a better idea? Or have dealt with a circumstance like this previously and can offer some advice?

To complicate it even more, Fred’s “Best friend” is obsessed with me. I put best friend in quotation marks Bc he’s an absolute psycho manipulator who traps everyone in his life with threats of suicide and emotional manipulation. He said if he finds out I fall for any of his friends, he’ll kill himself or move away and ruin his life and it’ll be my fault. So fred and I are scared for our and his safety.

My manager and good friend, has suggested that I stay until shit hits the fan, or leave just before it. However, I’m not so sure about that.

140,"basically in seventh grade i had a huge crush on this family friend of mine. we started talking in eighth grade after i got braces and fixed my face LOL and we dated for about 6months. in that time i became the one person he told deep stuff to and really the only person who knew about his childhood and hardships and whatever. when we broke up he said we'd be better off as just best friends bc he didn't see how we were different from that (while dating, we didn't kiss or anything bc i was awkward). 
we never stopped talking, and we still talk every day, even though it's useless stuff or just snaps of our foreheads. he has fallen in love w another girl and gotten his heart broken over the past 5 years and i've been w him through everything. bc of that, i was never able to truly get over him, bc there was never a period of time where i could stop thinking about him. i've considered cutting him off in the past but i know i'm important to him because he often tells me i really am the only person he trusts, and he doesn't know how he would get by without me. i feel horrible just thinking about ending our friendship over my feelings for him, but at this point i feel stuck. i'm about to graduate high school and he's the only guy i ever ""dated"". it's hard to get over your first love, and it's even harder when your first love ends up being your best friend. 
i feel like i have to be there for him, but i'm getting tired of feeling like his personal cheerleader. he doesn't treat me badly or disrespect me or anything but i just feel stupid. is it worth it to end our friendship over this? or do you think this is something i can move past on my own?",29Jan2019,1
141,"I gave him another chance.. I had no where to go and I believed it would get better if I just started doing things better. I blamed myself for his abusive behaviour and I still do. He was only like this to me, and I know that for a fact. Physically anyways. And the first time didn’t happen until 2 years in. I feel like I created the monster in him, just like he tells me I did. I thought things would get better and they were getting better, honestly it started to feel happy again. And then he brought up an old thing (about me talking to a guy when we were broken up) and used it against me to break up with me. He got angry and aggressive, and made me show him the conversation between the guy. I was really scared and I regret ever talking to that guy. At the time I just really needed someone to talk to, and I wasn’t even doing it in a flirtatious way, just talking to a human being, a friend. 
And he did worst. He slept with someone else / dated someone else while we were broken up.
So I don’t see how any of this is fair. 

Anyways, he did get absuive with me in the past.. and he got a criminal record from it.. 
But now that we were back together and he just suddenly dumps me for something so old.. I feel scared again. He didn’t talk to me for a couple days after that, but when I mentioned I was going to my friends ( a girl) he doubted me and called me a slut over texts, and just being so mean.. telling me nobody cares about me and I couldn’t even count the number of people on one hand who would care if I died. 
I live in a city with him, where I know absolutely nobody. I have no job other than selling my artwork.. our son is not in school yet.. I just need to know what to do. I have no friends or family to go stay with out here. Especially with my son. 

I don’t want to make a move that would make him angry; as I’m scared of being attacked. 
I just want to know how to leave here safely. He tells me he hates that I’m the mom of his child and wishes he didn’t know me. 
I have non stop anxiety. I can’t stop blaming myself for everything. I just want to be happy with my son. I just wanted to be a family together, a healthy and happy one.. I tried doing things right. I tried being better. 
I barely talk to anyone these days. I don’t trust that one girl I know out here with these kind of things as I don’t really know her. And I don’t have any close family as I was a foster child. 

Any advice would be so appreciated. 
I don’t want to get him in trouble.. he didn’t attack again/re-offend, I just get scared he might. I just want to know what to do to get my son and I safely out here, without angering his dad. 
I sent him a long paragraph that was nice and that just said stuff like how I care and don’t want to fight anymore, and wish to know what was truly going on to make him feel the need to act like this.. and that if he truly wants to split up, that I hope we can be civil and do what’s healthiest for all of us.

I don’t leech off of my boyfriend I don’t ask for money never have and probably never will. He just buys us pizza to share sometimes so that’s about it. She really hurt my moms feelings by judging her parenting skills (my mom is an amazing woman who helped my sister escape a domestic violence situation multiple times) also during this talk boyfriends mom came out and said about how she spies on my boyfriend and goes through his stuff (I.e bags computer his entire room he paid for the computer on his own from saving up and most of the other stuff in his room is also bought by him) I’m not upset that they talked or that new rules was placed (rules from her end but from my end mom didn’t really give me any apart from using protection) I’m just really upset at the fact she truly believes that if me and my boyfriend were to last that I would leech off of him when we’re older because “I can’t get my life in order” even though I’m becoming a horse trainer, it just really hurts and I think I just needed to get this out and I’m sorry if it makes no sense because I’ve been rambling.

Not that I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but I didn’t listen to the guidance in my younger years and here I am with $0 dollars invested in my future.

Stupid mistake, regretting it to be honest. 

I feel embarrassed. I feel like I’m failing at this part of life. I spent a lot of time down and out over the years and I realize today (after crying my eyes out last night to my boyfriend about life, feeling alone, my future, etc) that I have a lot of catching up to do as far as a better career, savings, future, etc., 

I’m basically not happy with myself. I’m not happy because I don’t have a future that I envisioned as a young girl. Goals. A plan. I was literally living day to day with no plan and simply surviving the depression and first world problems that I made so big in my life for the majority of my 20’s. I’m not even depressed anymore, at least I don’t  feel that way, but I’m now just dealing with the consequences of almost throwing my life away and letting depression win. I turned 30 last month and I’m desperate to survive, succeed, achieve my goals. I’m desperate for a life that I can say “yeah I fucking built this life.”

Today I fucking woke up with a purpose. With some goals in mind. I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing and I just want to get it the fuck together. I want a future for myself where I have my own home, a good job (I recently became certified for something in the medical field that I’m so happy I paid for on my own and busted my ass off time to apply for jobs), money for when I retire. I was given everything, every tool possible to grow the fuck up and I admitted and acknowledge last night that I simply did not use them correctly. I blamed everything on being sad. How messed up is our mental health? I got this. I just need the guidance. Resources. The motivation. 


Where/how can I start ? Am I the only dummy who has $0 dollars invested in their future ? Is it too late to start saving for my retirement ? Am I truly late to the party ? What can I do ? I know that I need some financial guidance. I’m just embarrassed. Embarrassed to be writing this. Please, if anyone can give me some advice I’d really appreciate it. I cannot spend another couple of years of life cruising aimlessly. What the fuck will I retire with ? 

TLDR; 30/f spent 401k in my 20’s, just turned 30 and have $0 dollars invested in my future, where to go from here ? I woke up wanting to live my life with a purpose, goals. Where do I begin with investing money? Is it too late?

I ate when was happy, excited, sad, nervous - I used it as a comfort. I developed a big appetite and gained about 40 pounds. Since this time last year I have dropped those 40 pounds and ""developed better eating habits"" but now that I am just 9 pounds from my goal weight, I can't seem to diet for more than a week without giving up and eating a ton of food at least once a week. 

I am right in the middle of a healthy BMI, so part of me wants to stop right here, but some part of me keeps shaming myself for eating unhealthy, even when I have planned cheat days. I find myself every day considering making myself sick in order to get some of the food out of my system to help me lose the last few pounds. I have been able to hold back but that thought is always in the back of my head. 

Today I had an unplanned day off of my diet and I just feel so ashamed and am trying to distract myself because part of me really wants to make myself sick in order to get ""back on track"" with this diet. I really want to get a hold of this before it becomes an eating disorder. What should I do?

If I’m not next to her, I’ll get calls at 3AM with her crying. It breaks my heart. They all seem to be about me cheating or leaving, so she begs me not to leave and needs reassurance that it was only a dream. She’s had a lot of traumatic relationships involving cheating and abuse, so I think it’s damaged her. 

I’ve tried everything from comforting her to trying to give her sleep techniques but nothing works. She talked about therapy, but she doesn’t have the time to do it now. I can tell the lack of sleep is getting to her, but none of us know what to do. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to help her? ",29Jan2019,1

I'm a first year college student living in my dream city going to my dream school but I just can't find motivation to be alive anymore. Every group I've tried to get involved with on campus has ended up with me shunned and on the edges until I eventually leave. The people I thought were friends are constantly making friends without me. I have absolutely no prospects of any kind of meaningful relationship any time in the future. I almost literally just don't feel anything. I've shut out all of my emotions to the point where I don't feel anything unless I'm stoned or drunk. I guess the only good thing is that I'm not failing any classes.

The crickets here are not normal crickets. They're from Hell itself, and I almost truly believe that. I've listened to tons of mp3 samples of crickets. They're all enjoyable; absolutely *nothing* like the crickets here. The ones here are insanely loud, and so high pitched that adapting to them is literally physically impossible.  
&amp;nbsp;  
And this past year, it's gotten a thousand times worse. To the point that I can't endure being outside at times.  
I've tried wearing top tier earplugs. Doesn't matter. They're just flat out too fucking loud. And I've already had multiple ear infections from wearing them *just to try to function at all*. Most people don't *seem* to mind, but I have found dozens that say it drives them insane too. Do we just have super hearing? Are others deaf? I don't know. 
&amp;nbsp;  
Here are the best ideas I've come up with so far to 'solve' this:  
- Get literally tons of diatomaceous earth or something and hire people to spread on every lawn everywhere  
- Find a natural predator insect, buy billions of them, release them everywhere
- Quit my job, uproot my entire life, and go live up north  
- Somehow damage/dampen my hearing on purpose, preferrably temporarily  
- Play extremely loud music over headphones over earplugs (doubt this would work)  
- Contact the city council and bitch up a storm and hope they consider helping

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I just recently booked flights to Milan for spring break.  We are going for 12.5 days (Wednesday, March 13th we leave, get in at 11:15 in Milan on the 14th (Thurs), and our return flight is on Monday the 25th at 3:00pm from Milan.  The main reason I am here is because I am seeking some travel advice for these 12 and a half days.  We are definitely going to Florence, as her sister will be studying there abroad, so she will want to visit.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I went to Italy my senior year of high school for 10 days if I recall correctly.  We flew into Malpensa (Milan), and from there went to Verona, Venice, Assisi, Pisa, Florence, Sorrento, Capri and the Amalfi Coast, Pompeii, and finally Rome.  We flew back from Rome.  I do not regret this trip at all, but I *do* regret *how* we did it.  10 days was definitely not enough time to appreciate the areas we saw, and 12.5 will not suffice either.  My issue here is that my girlfriend is going to want to visit a ton of different places, which I do as well, but I want to make sure that our ratio of travel to sightseeing is not skewed towards travel.

&amp;#x200B;

Places that I can guarantee will happen include Florence and Venice - she really wants to spend some time there.  My Mom and Dad who visited last year stayed in Monteriggioni and saw Florence, Lucca, Cinque Terre, and another spot here or there.  Since then, my mom has really been plugging Lucca and Cinque Terre.  Girlfriend has expressed interest in Cinque Terre as well.  I personally would like to see some of the Eastern coast, since I went down the Western half last time.  I was thinking about potentially San Marino/Rimini and up from there.  She is ok without Pisa, and I am all for that - the experience is ruined when you turn 90 degrees and you are looking though the windows of a Burger King.  The pulpit next to the tower is way cooler imho anyhow.  

&amp;#x200B;

Things to consider:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23, she's 22, we don't care about finding a discoteca to go nuts in.  She was a double major english/history for undergrad, currently finishing her master's for teaching secondary english.  I too love history and have a penchant for art/architecture.  Long family history of architects.  We're definitely more interested in history, art, and culture than anything else.  

Our flights are in and out of Milan, so keep that in mind.

I am alright at reading some Italian from the leftovers of my high school days.  

Girlfriend would prefer to see her sister the first weekend we're there since she'll have off then.

Travel will be done via rail/bus/taxi.  Car rental is more expensive since neither of us are 25, and travel by car makes little sense if we plan on spending time in Florence and Venice anyhow.

Pretty much we've concluded we're going to see Florence and up.  Rome and below can be another trip another time.  Rome itself could really take awhile.  That being said, if there are any suggestions that people think would still fit, fire away.

166,"Tldr: I have strong feelings for my boyfriend's best friend because he was my rock when my boyfriend treated me poorly, and I accidentally came onto him when I was drunk. I don't know what to do. 

I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and he is my absolute best friend. I'd like to make it known that the thought of cheating on him makes me feel sick to my stomach and I would never do it in a million years. 

That being said, I have this uncanny attraction to my boyfriend's best friend- let's call him Mark. I'm also really good friends with Mark's girlfriend so I feel like twice the asshole. To add some background, my boyfriend was not always faithful to me in college, and Mark's girlfriend was not always faithful to him. We spent many nights pouring our hearts out to each other and at one point I pictured us both dumping our SO's and getting together, but it never happened. 

Now fast-forward two years later: my boyfriend has completely turned his shit around and I trust him with my life.  But every time the four of us hang out, there is this crazy sexual tension between me and Mark. One night we all got hammered and I remember Mark and I being alone, and me telling him that I always thought I would marry him; he told me he felt the same way. Later that night, after reaching blackout point, I texted him something (I literally have no idea what it said; my drunk self deleted whatever it was and all I saw the next morning was a text I had sent him saying ""I'm so sorry I was fucked up and didn't mean to make things weird please delete that""), so I can assume it said something inappropriate.

I've seen Mark once since then, and I made sure to keep my distance, but I was shocked to see that he had turned very openly flirty with me, which he has never done before. It made me feel gross but that small part of me that has feelings for him really loved it. 

I don't know what to do. Do I tell my boyfriend? Do I bring it up to Mark or just act like it never happened? I don't want to hang out the four of us anymore but I can't keep him away from his best friend and my boyfriend only agrees to go if I do. Or is it just a crush that will go away? Most importantly, am I a piece of shit? ",29Jan2019,1
167,"This kinda bleeds into a couple problems and I could really just use something anything to grasp to at this point.

For context about us, I've known this girl for years and she has always been nice. We go to a school with literally 4 students. I asked her out November but after since we've been dating a lot of stuff just unveiled itself.

About her:
Over 2018 a lot had happened, she got in a relationship with someone who got her into drugs and alcohol; drugs like lean and shit. Relationship ended badly. Her dad has anger issues and verbally abused her over a hickey. Lost trust in her. So she was stuck in a routine of cleaning and cooking and that's about it over about 3 months. She tried to kill herself by taking pills and going to sleep. Ended up throwing them up. 
Months after without knowing about this I asked her out.

About me:
I'm about fucking straight edge as it gets. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I've been to one party and did nothing and never went to another one. I've been told I have a big ego but honestly I'm just as insecure as everyone else. We all have something that we don't like about ourselves so I just deal with it. I'm very optimistic and flamboyant usually so that is probably why. I don't date wildly and have ""dated"" about 3 girls my entire school life; this one being the only one that's been serious enough to count in my opinion.



Now onto the present and what I need help on.


Lately, more and more has just piled on and it's taking a toll on me. Her problems are so much bigger then mine ever will be and I feel like an ass just saying this on the internet; but it's hard to worry about someone 24/7 like this. She still does lean and her friend is super nice and helped her when that's all she had, over those issues; but she's a horrible influence. So they do drugs and sometimes go to parties together; she doesn't drink as much as she used to if any. I'm a natural worry wart. So Everytime I hear she's hanging out with her friends it scares me because she could slip back into old habits.


She shows up to our school and I'll notice her arms if I get the chance to look, but obviously people hide that kind of stuff. I don't usually ask about them.


She's says she wants to die when she's 19 by doing everything she wants in a 2 year condensed period. And then just frying her brain with drugs. Like what the fuck?

She gets high just to escape the ""gross thoughts"" constantly running through her head

The way I'm saying it makes it sound like she just gives this info out like candy. But no most of this was givin' like slow drip coffee.

She has massive trust issues. She won't trust me. She says because nothing lasts forever so when I leave it won't hurt.
 (not relationship leave but just like something causes us to drift apart physically) 

Because of those past things. She says stuff that feels insulting but I know she doesn't say it to be.

Example we were talking today on a walk. Something about that 19 year old death thing. She says that that changes from time to time.

Me:""it's stupid. It's also incredibly selfish to think like that""

Her:""How so""

""Because people would miss you and you just want to die and leave that on everyone""

""People would only miss me for a year then it'd all blow over""

Mind you all this was said very casually. Like normal conversation.

Hearing the things she has done in the name of self harm is incredible. Hurts to hear, and I don't even think I know a fraction.


I don't want to leave her. My parents love her, my family loves her. Her family loves me. I told my sister some of these issues and she said if anyone can handle these issues it's you. But ever since dating her. I go to bed wondering if it's the last time I'll see her. If she just dies of an OD or self harm. Every night. 

She's so sweet and I can't say that enough. I know this post is negative on her. But honestly these things are back round noise. She wants to trust me I can feel it. But whenever we get really close and I come over to her house to cuddle and watch a movie. Hang out do fun shit like ride boards. I leave feeling like I fucked up something because you can feel that push away vibe near the end when we start getting closer. Like she's trying to trust me but just can't.


I don't know where to go. I'm trying to help and I don't want to leave her for sure. 

I just don't see myself as optimistic as I used to be. 
I feel sad and like a fuck up for not being able to help.


 And I won't bring it up to anyone because this isn't about me, she has way more issues then me so I'm the dick head in my mind being ""Oh woe is me"" So I don't tell my friends, family or her for sure. So the internet is the way to go. I don't go to bed happy anymore because I'm in constant fear of losing such an amazing person. I'm happy when I'm with her but when I'm not around I can't help if anything happens.


I don't want grade really brought up because it annoys me when people belittle relationships or problems out of age and ignorance.


At this point I need help being able to stay positive. I need help on helping someone who has these issues.
Steps for our future.
Steps for dealing with these issues.
Something any help is appreciated.

175,"Hi all,

So this is kind of weird.  I follow a girl who used to go to my high school on Snapchat.  We were never really friends or ever even talked, but we added each other back in high school in like 2012 when everyone was adding everyone they even possibly knew.  I know she suffers from quite a few mental health issues, such as BPD, depression, anxiety, etc.  She posts about it frequently.  It’s typically awareness posts and posts about how she’s feeling down, etc.  She also posts screenshots of the guys who message her trying to “help.”  I mostly just scroll through them as fast as I can to clear my story queue. 

A post about suicide caught my eye a couple days ago, and I’ve been keeping a closer eye.  She’s posted about wanting to commit suicide, outright saying she’s unstable and “not okay,” and also posts about going back to cutting herself. 

The more I think about it, the more I think I should call someone.  I’ve never been in this position before and frankly have no idea where to start.  I don’t really know anything about her other than her name and the town she lives in (my hometown).

176,"Tonight, I was driving home, around 8. I was in my neighborhood going about 20 when my roommate in the car with me yelled ""look out"" and the next thing I knew I felt a thud. I pulled over and ran back, and saw that I had hit the back legs of a cat. 

I immediately called Animal Control and they said they would send someone over. I looked down the street and saw a neighbor, so I walked over and asked him if he knew the owner of a Siamese cat. He looked up and yelled that it was his. I told him that I had hit a Siamese, and he lost it.

He started yelling and cursing and went to get his wife, who came out in a fucking wheelchair. She started having hysterics and swearing and he kept yelling and I tried to apologize but I don't think they heard me over themselves.

Animal control showed up and advised them to take the cat to an emergency clinic. He also made it clear to everyone present that what happened was not my fault, and I was under no legal obligation to pay or help them in any way.

He told the people that he thought it was likely that they would have to euthanize the cat, and the swearing and hysterics started all over again. At this point, I'm shaking and close to vomiting, I feel so awful. As they leave, the owner yells about how I'm going to pay this bill and I owe them money. 

I feel so awful. I have a pet and I can't imagine how I would feel if this happened to me. I want desperately to go back in time and see the cat or have taken another road home, or just anything to make this not have happened.

I understand that I have no legal obligation here, but morally I just feel like a piece of shit. I left my name and number, and I'm dreading the phone call I will receive with the heartbreaking news that the cat didn't make it.

Lately the owner has been asking more of me, some of which is crossing into my coworker’s tasks because he isn’t getting them done. I’m stepping on his toes and he’s getting pissed and is slowly turning the staff in the company against me.  Mind you, this is at the behest of the owner. 

I can’t complain too hard because the owner gave me a really big raise that no one knows about. The price came with disrespect and undermining due to pretty much being asked to do others jobs because it’s not getting done and there’s been major backlash. I’ve been rewarded with significant bonuses for my results too.

But my coworker hasn’t been fired or demoted, the staff essentially allowed to disrespect me and the owner is basically just using my coworker for the bitch duty now.

Just earlier this month we had lunch together, she showed me one of her favorite hangouts, and I gave her a bottle of skincare product that she wanted to try.

Then she seemed distant all of a sudden, and I didn’t know why. I was working late one night, my manager asks to talk to me. He said someone had complained to him about me, saying I come up to her and chat, distracting her from her work, that I slouch during meetings, and that I swivel in my chair and distract people next to me. I said I only chat with people who are smiling back at me and chat with me. He said he notices these things (he sits by that coworker so he can hear how friendly she is towards me) and he tells me not to get too comfortable around coworkers and assume they are my friends. He then told me specifically to “give (coworker) some space” and that’s how I knew she was the one who reported me. That and she was pretty much the only person I socialized with anyway. The next day was my 1 year anniversary working there so my manager took me out to lunch. He invited another coworker but not the backstabbing one. He insisted we eat at this high end place and paid for me and my other coworker out of pocket. I told my manager, “I didn’t wear my hat today because I was afraid people will complain about me being vain” and he said “I’d say something, but I can’t because I am a manager.” Which I think means he wanted to console me by saying my coworker is awful.

Since then I’ve waited for my coworker to approach me and she doesn’t. She pretends she doesn’t see me, even if we are on the elevator together. I had thought we were really good friends and I’ve cried over this twice because I feel betrayed. We’ve never even argued, and just 3 weeks ago we had lunch and chatted for an hour like we were old friends. Not once did she say she had the slightest issue with me. I wonder: was she pretending to be my friend THE WHOLE TIME? I don’t get why she would pretend to be my friend, do favors for me like picking me up from my wisdom tooth surgery, text me outside of work with an explosion of emojis and “LOLOLOL” comments night after night, and then all of a sudden try to tarnish me to our manager without ever talking to me first if I bothered her in some way.

Here are the possibilities I have come up with:
1. Maybe she was my friend, but I offended her without realizing it, or I did tiny things that she wrote off at first and then it became too much and pissed her off, so she is trying to distance herself from me. But even then she would have tried to talk to me I think?

2. Maybe she always hated me and was pretending to be my friend. She has a PhD and I only have a bachelor’s, yet we are on the same “advanced” team  and so it ticks her off that we get similar treatment. I am also 6 years younger than her and am on important projects alongside her so maybe she feels like it’s unfair because I haven’t had to work as hard.

3. A little bit of both.

181,"Gonna try to keep this short and to the point. 

I’ve been addicted to Vicodin (opiate painkiller) for almost a year and I’ve hit a low point. My body has built up a tolerance and I’m afraid I’m gonna accidentally overdose from taking too much in order to feel the “high”.  

I don’t want to be this person anymore. It’s ruining my life/body/mind and draining my funds. The withdrawals are absolute hell and I just can’t make it through them on my own- especially when the drug is at my disposal. 

I know I should probably seek professional help and I’m open to that I’m just afraid honestly. I don’t know what to expect, fear of the unknown I guess. I’ve taken Vicodin everyday for such a long time I’m afraid of not only the withdrawals, but the depression and anxiety that comes with them. I’m afraid to be completely sober. Every time I tell myself I’m gonna check myself into a detox facility I never do. I keep putting it off. Every time I get high I tell myself it’s the last time but it never is.

182,"I'm not sure what I'm even trying to ask right now. I think I just need help. 

Husband(29) and I (27f) have been married for 2 years. No kids. He and I haven't had sex in a couple of months. I haven't wanted it in about a year now. I feel like I have lost all attraction to him and I hate myself for it. I've tried forcing myself through it. There's been a few times that's I told him i dont qont to but he gets upset. There have been a few times hes caught me crying and that didn't end well so I keep trying to find ways to avoid problems.  I just ask for the lights off now in case I can't keep everything in. I wish I had better control of the sadness. 
Even kissing and holding hands is difficult for me. 

The past year has been incredibly difficult. He lost his job in November 2017, and for a year did not really put any effort into looking for a new job. I felt like I was nagging all the time for him to get a new job because he doesn't want me having one. I've begged (even to this day) to let me help but he's completely against it. He finally got a job this past June, but lost it because he was consistently forgetting to turn on a necessary software, but landed another job recently,after a near eviction scare. We are now about 15K in debt and that's a strain in itself. 

On top of that, last year in January(2018) I found out I had cancerous lesions on my cervix after a routine pap smear, and having some biopsies done. I ended up having a LEEP procedure done to remove them and was told no sex for 6 weeks in order for me to heal. By week 2 he was insistent on I should be okay and he didn't want to miss a day of sex. The LEEP was one of the more traumatizing things I had to endure. It was out of left field and my family was across the country. I ended up giving in about week 4 against my better judgment. I have screenings every 6 months now.  I think this has really affected my mentality because I freak out at the idea of being penetrated and I think part of it was because of the procedure itself and part of it was/is the amount of pain that hits sometimes. 

Since then I've tried starting a masters program. I dropped after 2 months. I was letting my emotions get the best of me. He would get upset at me for spending so much time on homework and would just sit behind my computer screen ranting and sometimes raising his voice, and I get it, but dropping the program hurt so bad. 

I know I'm depressed. I've been doing therapy but am afraid to bring this up with her because I dont know what I'm going to be told. I feel like a thing. I can't work, I feel like a burden because he wants kids and I'm too scared to right now. I feel useless because I can't even cook. He likes making my food for me and getting me drinks, and I really appreciate it but I feel like I just want to do my own things without him getting mad.

I know my family sees something in me. My sister said my eyes look sad and I try to mask it around my family. My dad says my husband doesn't talk much and that I need to work harder to make him feel loved and included.  Im exhausted. I've dropped from 125 to 97 lbs in about a year. I dont drive my own car anymore. I dont do anything except waste oxygen and maybe that sounds dramatic and I'm so sorry. I dont know what to do anymore.

183,"This kinda bleeds into a couple problems and I could really just use something anything to grasp to at this point.

For context about us, I've known this girl for years and she has always been nice. We go to a school with literally 4 students. I asked her out November but after since we've been dating a lot of stuff just unveiled itself.

About her:
Over 2018 a lot had happened, she got in a relationship with someone who got her into drugs and alcohol; drugs like lean and shit. Relationship ended badly. Her dad has anger issues and verbally abused her over a hickey. Lost trust in her. So she was stuck in a routine of cleaning and cooking and that's about it over about 3 months. She tried to kill herself by taking pills and going to sleep. Ended up throwing them up. 
Months after without knowing about this I asked her out.

About me:
I'm about fucking straight edge as it gets. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I've been to one party and did nothing and never went to another one. I've been told I have a big ego but honestly I'm just as insecure as everyone else. We all have something that we don't like about ourselves so I just deal with it. I'm very optimistic and flamboyant usually so that is probably why. I don't date wildly and have ""dated"" about 3 girls my entire school life; this one being the only one that's been serious enough to count in my opinion.



Now onto the present and what I need help on.


Lately, more and more has just piled on and it's taking a toll on me. Her problems are so much bigger then mine ever will be and I feel like an ass just saying this on the internet; but it's hard to worry about someone 24/7 like this. She still does lean and her friend is super nice and helped her when that's all she had, over those issues; but she's a horrible influence. So they do drugs and sometimes go to parties together; she doesn't drink as much as she used to if any. I'm a natural worry wart. So Everytime I hear she's hanging out with her friends it scares me because she could slip back into old habits.


She shows up to our school and I'll notice her arms if I get the chance to look, but obviously people hide that kind of stuff. I don't usually ask about them.


She's says she wants to die when she's 19 by doing everything she wants in a 2 year condensed period. And then just frying her brain with drugs. Like what the fuck?

She gets high just to escape the ""gross thoughts"" constantly running through her head

The way I'm saying it makes it sound like she just gives this info out like candy. But no most of this was givin' like slow drip coffee.

She has massive trust issues. She won't trust me. She says because nothing lasts forever so when I leave it won't hurt.
 (not relationship leave but just like something causes us to drift apart physically) 

Because of those past things. She says stuff that feels insulting but I know she doesn't say it to be.

Example we were talking today on a walk. Something about that 19 year old death thing. She says that that changes from time to time.

Me:""it's stupid. It's also incredibly selfish to think like that""

Her:""How so""

""Because people would miss you and you just want to die and leave that on everyone""

""People would only miss me for a year then it'd all blow over""

Mind you all this was said very casually. Like normal conversation.

Hearing the things she has done in the name of self harm is incredible. Hurts to hear, and I don't even think I know a fraction.


I don't want to leave her. My parents love her, my family loves her. Her family loves me. I told my sister some of these issues and she said if anyone can handle these issues it's you. But ever since dating her. I go to bed wondering if it's the last time I'll see her. If she just dies of an OD or self harm. Every night. 

She's so sweet and I can't say that enough. I know this post is negative on her. But honestly these things are back round noise. She wants to trust me I can feel it. But whenever we get really close and I come over to her house to cuddle and watch a movie. Hang out do fun shit like ride boards. I leave feeling like I fucked up something because you can feel that push away vibe near the end when we start getting closer. Like she's trying to trust me but just can't.


I don't know where to go. I'm trying to help and I don't want to leave her for sure. 

I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I just don't see myself as optimistic as I used to be. 
I feel sad and like a fuck up for not being able to help.
I don't want her to feel like this is her fault why I'm sad.
So I just put on my same happy facade as normal.
She does the same on a daily basis.
We both want to stay together, were happy with each other.
Just not happy when for 3-4 complete months my lack of sleep and general well being keeps going down.
It's constant, this feeling of dread. The malevolent presence pushing on my shoulders. I'm not a good enough boyfriend, I can't help her. But I can't say anything because I'm being selfish, I'm making it about me. So I cracked and made this post out of a need for help and an outlet.

This is only a fraction of the stuff that's weighing down.


She has way more issues then me, so I'm the dick head in my mind being ""Oh woe is me"" So I don't tell my friends, family or her for sure. So the internet is the way to go. I don't go to bed happy anymore because I'm in constant fear of losing such an amazing person. I'm happy when I'm with her but when I'm not around I can't help if anything happens.


I don't want grade really brought up because it annoys me when people belittle relationships or problems out of age and ignorance.


At this point I need help being able to stay positive. I need help on helping someone who has these issues.
Steps for our future.
Steps for dealing with these issues.
Something any help is appreciated.

This already helps because I've had these thoughts trapped and I don't know where to go with them so I'm hoping to get something to help me.

189,"Ok so I want to make this as short as possible. Me (F, 20) and this boy (20) had a short flirting spell about a year ago that lasted like a week. It was pretty intense tho cuz he really opened up to me but that whole thing sorta stopped outta nowhere and we ignored each other after that. 

I don't think he ever stopped liking me, and he did something a few months after the whole flirting that confirmed I was pretty much right. I stopped seeing him around at parties so naturally I stopped having strong feelings towards him. That's not to say I got over him, but I did forget about him. 

This past weekend, I went to a party that his frat was having and I saw him. Typically he'd run the other way when he sees me but that was not the case this weekend. I could feel him looking at me occasionally throughout the night too. Sometime during the night I was standing in a huddle of people and I guess he grew a pair (but not really) because he sorta awkwardly came over and stood next to me. He didn't say anything or even looked in my direction. I stepped like a cm away from him and I guess he took that as a bad sign cuz he DASHED after that and I didn't see him again for the rest of the night. 

My friends say that this was him actually trying. In their heads he came over so that I could talk to him. They also say I'm ""intimidating"" and ""always shoot him dirty looks"" (which I disagree with) and that I have strong rest b**** face which is why he's been scared to approach me for all this time.

191,"Hey everybody, I apologize in advance for this weirdly specific scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

First, some background. I (22, f) just graduated from college with my Bachelor's in Anthropology in my home state of Utah, and I'm currently part of the Disney College Program, which is a paid internship at Walt Disney World in Florida. I'm also currently doing long distance with my boyfriend (21, m) of 6 and a half years until I'm home from the internship. Due to some weird circumstances and a gap year, my boyfriend will not graduate his undergrad for about 3 more years. I'll be finished with this program in mid-May, and frankly, as of right now, I haven't really looked in to finding a job back in Utah yet because it's just a little too early to start anything. But, essentially my plan was, start applying for jobs at home in about a month, finish my internship, move back home, start a full time job somewhere there, at the very least until my boyfriend finishes school.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my main problem is that my mom keeps asking me about getting a full time position with the Walt Disney Company, and asking me what I would do if it was offered. While I'd love that, there are some issues with it:

\- My internship doesn't pay very much. I would probably need a higher level position to support myself.

\- Full time positions are incredibly hard to get with this company at all, let alone at a higher level.

\- I don't want to keep doing long distance with my boyfriend, who I'm hoping to marry once he's out of college.

\- I don't really want to live in Florida long term. It's hot here, and I'm afraid of alligators.

\- My lease on my apartment in Utah doesn't end until late summer, and I can't afford to keep paying double rent.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably reading in to this situation too much, but with the number of times my mom has brought up me staying here with the company, I feel like she thinks I have the best shot at a good job here, which isn't how I feel, even if I'd love it. I've also mentioned all the above issues to her, especially about my boyfriend, as he's the biggest thing keeping me in Utah right now. She's always incredibly dismissive, and it makes me feel like I'm making a mistake by staying with him. I know she just wants me to put myself first, but it feels like she wants me to break up with him, which is stressful and makes me sad.

&amp;#x200B;

So I need advice. Would moving home and finding a job there be a bad decision? I love my boyfriend so much, but it scares me to put my career on hold because he's behind on school. But I also don't know if I even would be putting my career on hold because I might find a wonderful fulfilling job back home. Ultimately, my mom makes me feel like I'd be making a big mistake, and I just don't know if that's the case. Is there a better way to explain to her why it's important to me to stay in Utah for a couple more years without her dismissing me? And what should I do in the event that I DID end up with a full time position here in Florida where I could support myself, as it would be a dream position?

195,"My uber picked me and a woman up (stranger through pool) and then we got stuck shortly after. My uber driver had seen the road ahead and said it didn't look salted and was very bad condition but that this is what the GPS is telling him to go (mind you we just came off a major road to pick up the second woman and he wanted to go forward not back. I did not voice my opinions.)

We continued driving and then got stuck. I didn't really mind any delays as long as I was warm. I ordered an Uber because I had finished a 10 hour shift and forgot to bring boots and only had my work shoes on. So I did not want to walk home after taking public transit. He noticed a van in front of us stuck and then he told them he'd help them if they could help him. There were 3 guys plus a driver on their side. They agreed. When they came to help him out they told me I had to get out and push but before when my driver asked if I could help I told him I wasn't wearing my boots.

If this were a life threatening situation, or a friend of course I would have volunteered to help even with just shoes on... But I paid about ten times more than public transit just so I could get home without having to walk in the snow. I didn't expect these guys to come and get ME out but I would assume uber drivers are responsible for getting their own cars out? I do not drive so I'm unaware if there is some kind of insurance for this.

I just agreed and was going to push the car and then the guys told me I should have been helping from the start and that earlier in the day they made a delivery and even women helped them get their cars out. But they had 4 guys pushing their van and not even all 4 were pushing the van? It was like 2 at a time. And then they just used their second car (was parked lights off) and a cardboard to push it out because the guys couldn't.

The woman in the car sitting behind me was asking him prior how long he thought it would take and if he could cancel so she could get her money back and she could take public transit. He told her to wait. (we were both 5 minutes into a 45+ minute commute)

All in all I came home 1 hour later than what uber expected. And now I was wanting to know if anyone thinks I should ask for a refund? Not because whether conditions were bad. Not because the driver was late. But because they told me I had to push the car with them and I had to sit in the car with cold wet feet the 40-ish minutes home.

I don't know if I should have just told him to cancel it earlier and gone with the woman on transit (we were going the same way 90%) or ordered a different uber. I just don't think it's fair they singled me out when I paid for the ride to get home? Like I said those guys that helped out weren't obligated to help me, but the uber driver got out to help them out and then they helped him out. If it was just to lose weight of the car I feel like both passengers should have been asked to step out momentarily, but this wasn't the case.

So should do you all think I'm entitled to a refund? I'm not using uber anymore for various bad experiences but this one is just so... tiring. ",29Jan2019,1

I'm sorry. I don't know where to post this. I usually don't post because Reddit hasn't been too friendly to me (on my main, this is my art account) but I need to hear from somebody. Anybody. This is very long. Not even all of it.

Also, I'm NOT asking for anything monetary. I just need to know what to do.


On January 7th, my twin sister and I were called out of work early because my mom came back home to a Dear Jane/John letter and a ransacked house. He had waited for her to take us to work to pack up what he wanted to take with him, and take off. It was really unexpected, especially because he had told her he loved her that morning, and he assured me that everything was fine the night before.


Some background: This man dated my mom for a little bit in 2012 before they broke up. After moving out and back into the state in 2013, he came back into the picture, with no job and an unstable living situation. In 2015, we let him in, but kicked him out later in the year due to his behavior, but we let him back in once he promised that he was different and learning from his mistakes. He even got a stable job a little bit after.

He married my mom in 2016 with my twin, my older sister, and myself as their witnesses. He promised (among other promises) that we were family and that we were stuck with him. I decided, after my biodad did us wrong and despite how much trust in others I had lacked, I decided to trust him.

Things were good for a couple years, except how he treated me when I was panicking or experiencing a suicidal or depressive episode (he actually told a police officer I was just trying to manipulate him when I called 911 to be taken to Psych for a while). He would have loud arguments with my mom and make us watch (knowing I have diagnosed PTSD/anxiety) because he thought we needed to see how conflict was resolved. He also had a habit of asking for opinions only for his to be the one that mattered. In hindsight, these problems that were increasing up to the point he left. 

Then we moved into this house in October of 2018. It's out of the city and more than 40 miles from our jobs... but getting a house, renting or otherwise, was a dream we had since we lost our first one due to my biodad's drug abuse.

Then his attitude completely changed once he got accepted into a leadership training program that would allow him to become a supervisor. He started becoming more secretive, especially regarding where money went (my twin and I sent our entire checks to him to help pay bills). He got less patient; grabbed my twin sister's wrist while she was driving and started yelling at her. He started to further treat us like we were dumb and that his word was gold. 

All while touting that he was a family man who loved us... until he didn't. Until he left. It was easy for him to forget that he even cared about us... if he did at all.

I can understand if he wasn't happy, but I wish he would've told us like he said he would so that we didn't have to struggle to pick up the pieces left behind.


Back to current month... In the letter he stated he wanted a divorce, that he didn't love my mom like she loved him, and he regretted hurting us, but mostly had a list of demands and a warning that he didn't want it to become ugly. This included to not contact him or try to find him. That he would be the one contacting the company we rented the house from (we started living here in October) on a specific date. He basically wanted everything to be done his way.

Problem was, my twin and I work part-time (have been looking for full time throughout this), and my mom up until recently was on medical leave for her knee. My mom had also been grieving due to the loss of her only living parent, and he convinced her to quit the job she had for five years, saying that it would be okay to do so. So I feel like she trusted his word at her most vulnerable point only to be abandoned at a vulnerable point.

So, we had to start pawning items that same day to get money quickly, but we found out that he took my mom's ID along with her credit cards, so she had to grab that from him at his job. She eventually got it from him after he tried to lie (saying he didn't have it), but the security guard at his job pulled it directly from his wallet. Per his request, though, they had my mom and my twin trespassed (despite them not doing anything wrong).

We also had to get our own Internet because he disconnected the one we had and took all the boxes with him. It is currently our only way to make calls because the cellular signal is terrible out here.

My mom also called the rental company to let them know what happened and that we'll be moving out at the end of this month. She doesn't take demands well. 

She also filed for divorce the same week, then amended it to include the notarized agreement that they came to following his ""if you file for alimony I will obliterate you,"" comments. 

Additionally, we got help with getting a storage unit to put our items in. All of the remaining items he left will be left for him in the garage.

Thankfully, we secured our apartment the same day he left too, but it's not going to be ready until the 8th of February (it was initially the 18th, so thank goodness.) We had called around for hotel vouchers, and shelters, and relatives, but this was without luck. My mom contacted him again saying that he needed to help us somehow because he did abandon us without much. 

He did pay for a week long hotel stay, but tells my mom that if she doesn't give him $100, he'll rescind it. Tonight, he reconfirmed with the exact quote, ""as long as you have the $100.""


I'm honestly scared right now. I don't like that he's waving shelter above our heads when we have nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to, all over some money. He's been intimidating us through his emails, basically saying to give in to his demands or he'll ruin (read: obliterate) us... whatever that means. He's supposed to be picking up his items tomorrow and my mom says she can handle herself but I don't trust that he'll be civil. She's only being nice to him now because she's desperate for him to keep at least this promise which is this hotel room. We have to be out on the first.

So what should I do? What CAN I do? I feel like no one's in my corner and I'm seriously considering putting myself on suicide watch because I don't know if I can handle this. I'm trying to be strong for my mom but it's hard. Any positive words... or just anything will help right now. I'm just feeling sad and sick to my stomach that we trusted this guy, and I  stupidly loved him like a father. I'm tired of feeling like we'll never be okay.

Thanks.



TLDR: Step-dad left us suddenly without much of anything. We buckled down and secured everything except a place to stay until the apartment is ready, step-dad has been intimidating through this whole process, has paid for a hotel for us on the condition that we pay him $100... for a situation he caused.

208,"Hi reddit. So I’m taking part in the global exchange program at my school so for 10 weeks we have a student from Germany stay with us (Australians) and then we stay with them in Germany for 10 weeks. I rarely post / comment on reddit because I’m scared people will ridicule me and this also translates into the real world. I don’t talk much and I suck at making friends because I’m scared to talk to people. Well when my global exchange partner arrived a couple days ago and at first we hit it off pretty well. Even during our first conversation she said she’d been on exchange before and that it was really awkward and she said she was happy she and I could communicate comfortably. It all went well that day and we went to bed. The day after it was a little awkward, I don’t know how to start conversations and when I do it it always seems a little awkward because we’re all teenagers and I sound like a boring adult: “this weather must be so different to what you get in Germany””how is it different to Germany?” Etc. I’m more comfortable around my parents and my brother so it was okay that day knowing my parents were always looking out for me (god I’m getting emotional rn). But today all the exchange partners met up so there were 10 of us going around the city. I arrived with my partner who is very outgoing and confident and pretty which makes me feel self conscious because I’m the complete opposite. Even when people were introducing themselves today they all asked her name but they completely ignored me and it hurt (oh god Im gonna cry haha) throughout the whole day everyone got along and I hung behind, because I didn’t know what to say to any of them apart from “where are we going now” and “this weather must be different to Germany”. I didn’t really talk to my partner much because she was getting along with everyone just fine (all the partners from germany only met about 3 days ago and the students from here only met all the other German students today) I’m actually writing this while we’re out and everyone is just talking together in a group. This is what it’s been like the whole day except for one bit where we were able to play some video games and one of the Australian girls came over and we joked a bit but then she had to go and I was alone again. 
I’m scared I’m going to ruin my partners experience here because I’m so insecure and scared. Especially because in our first conversation we hit it off well. I have no idea how I’m going to cope in Germany without my family and I’m sure I’ll feel pretty bad.

216,"This is a throwaway account, I just want advice. 

SORRY THAT THIS IS SO LONG, BUT MOST OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE IMPORTANT. 

This is gonna be a bit long, but I’ve been struggling with talking to anyone about it without fearing being judged. Only about two people know what really happened, so let’s begin.

It all started May of last year. My psycho ex(let’s call him X) X and I started dating after a while of being friends. He was funny and average looking, plus he treated me well. X was in love with me, I believed it(still do, even if it sick.)We were pretty good for a while, up until July when he broke up with me because I wasn’t leaving my room much due to severe depression I had over a close family member passing. I guess he couldn’t handle it or something? Whatever. He basically said he doesn’t like who he becomes when he’s with me and he needs time to be himself again. I say okay, brushing it off considering I’m a mature person compared to other people around my age. 

August 2018 rolls around day before senior year X randomly adds me after going major radio silent. I realize his intentions, and immediately become cold towards him, considering I went through most things myself that summer and I wasn’t interested in anyone or anything besides my friends and myself. X ends up sitting infront if me in one of my classes and his best friend behind me. Again, couldn’t care less. X tries talking to me in person, in hopes of getting back with me. I ignore and tell him to fuck off, because he put his hand on mine(I feel repulsed by people touching me because I’m hypersensitive, and he knows this.) Up until a week after where he turns around to talk to the guy next to me, and slide his phone on our desk trying to subtle. God I’m shaking with anger even writing this. After I come to see what the photo is, I become enraged and grab his wrist to take his phone, it was a Snapchat of my eye and some kinky text underneath (don’t remember writing that considering I’m not into it.) I immediately blow up. “Who the fuck do you think you are?” I say, He’s amused, and just smiles and shrugs it off. I can’t tell what the fuck just happened. Class ends, he stays back to talk to me. He says “Do you think anyone will believe you if you tell them? The school? The police?” I was shaking and frightened at that point, because i didn’t realize how dangerous he was. I just smiled and walked out, hid and cried in a secluded staircase until school ended. 

I carry this on my shoulders for what seems like forever (a week or two) until I take a nap one day. I wake to numerous notifications, specifically from my older ex (doesn’t go to my school, let’s call him B) 

I see a Snapchat from B, which is odd considering we’re on good terms but don’t really talk much anymore. B tells me there’s a fake account pretending to be me on Instagram and he sends me a screenshot of things they’re posting and B blurs it out, telling me it’s better if I don’t see it. I immediately start shaking. “This is it.” I think. “What’s the point anymore?” . 

The account was posting fake texts between me and my ex supposedly. At that moment, I couldn’t care less if my whole school saw it. I just didn’t want my family to see it. Managed to block the account on my families accounts. I messaged A LOT of my friends, telling them it was fake and to report it, as I’ve always found it better to tell people rather than wait for them to find out because otherwise it’s like you actually have something to hide. I fake being sick the next day to skip school. I was devastated. What am I supposed to do now that these supposed texts on discord are roaming around school? It’s been around 5 months since it all happened. X put the account on private 2 days after. Pictures still there, but username and profile picture changed. I went to the office once he started stalking me and switching to my classes. I was wayyyy too creeped out. I mean, 4 classes with him? In the middle of the semester? How? I went to the counselor ( a HUGE mistake) and she trapped me (literally) with the assistant principal. Assistant principal promises not to call my parents, I tell her who fucked with me, she switches my classes and sends me on my way. I panic, as I didn’t tell her the whole story about what happened, just the threats. Weeks go by, nothing from AP. Till this day, never found out if she talked to him or not. Now you may be wondering, what do you need advice on? 

X and his friend group are psychopaths. Every time they see me, X speaks loud enough so I get affected about “daddy issues” (I don’t have them, but he likes to tell people I do because that’s supposed to embarrass me in some way?) and coughs the word “bitch” when he sees me in the hall. I ignore him all these times, as I fear that X will bring back the account if I say anything or defend myself. What do I do? Just never say anything and live with it till schools over? Or finally stand up to myself and be in fear of this account that’s still there to this day, taunting me?

I can’t help but think I’m worthless when I finally like someone again, I overthink the shit out of it. “Has he seen those photos?” “Does he know everything?” “Has someone talked badly about me to him?”

At this point, I’ve given up on socializing due to the loss of sleep and the anxiety I get when I think of people knowing what happened. Please, tell me what to do. Sorry again.

217,"Hello. 

I’m a 22 year old female who is attending university. I have misophonia (a condition that causes extreme sensitivity to specific noises). Because of this, I find it so hard to actually go to and participate in class. 

In one of my classes, there is a girl who sits in the back of the classroom who chews gum like a masticating cow, no exaggeration. Every time she walks past me, she has her mouth wide open and making unnecessary noise. If that wasn’t bad enough, she literally cracks her gum every 20 seconds. Like LOUD FUCKING CRACKING. As in I can’t escape the sound no matter where I sit in the room. I have tried bringing in ear plugs to block it out, but it obviously makes it more difficult to listen to the lecture. I’ve left the room in tears and having a borderline panic attack over this. Needless to say I’m not doing well in this course. 

I can’t believe the professor doesn’t tell her knock it off. It’s so rude and inconsiderate to other people, not to mention fucking disgusting. I’ve tried just about everything to block it out, ignore it, etc, and I can’t take it anymore. I’m contemplating dropping the class because it’s affecting me that much. But it just means I’d have to take the class a different semester as it’s a required class for my program.

So I'm a student in a democratic school which is basically a school where you have a lot more freedom for example you can choose your lessons and most importantly in my school teachers mostly give small lessons if a child is bothering the entire class. They can of course suspend/expel you but basically the middle punishments you the student has to do with a system that we call suing. So let's say blah blah annoyed you then you take a slip of paper fill out some information ( name, name of the person who your suing...) and then put the slip of paper in a  mailbox where specific kids called the vadat cahev (I'm sorry I don't know what that would mean in English) empty the mailbox and slowly process through the papers. When they get to your paper about blah blah they'll call you from whatever class you're in and blah blah. Now here I don't know exactly what happens (I've never done this before) but that around sums it up. Now I've recently done this to a group of kids ( like three days ago) and somehow they found our that I was suing them. So around five kids barge into the small room I was in and start screaming at swearing at me and whining at me to not sue them. So I ignore them and finish filing out my sue and thought that was the end of it. But then in homeroom where there weren't any teachers close by (the first class I was in was next to the teachers lounge) they surrounded me and start screaming /whining harder and swearing at me much worse. So I push my way out of there and go to a empty classroom and read my book (hero of Thera for anyone interested) so anyway now I'm pretty scared of suing someone because its not only these kids who yell/whine at kids that sue them I've seen this happen a lot and I'm in a pretty small school the middle school is only 30 kids. So anyways what should I do?

223,"I'm 18. He's 21. He worked where we work before me but quit just before I was hired in. He was just hired back in about two weeks ago. Since meeting him I've started to crush pretty hard on him. He's funny, likes to talk, joke around, and seems to be a pretty good guy. 

Sometimes I feel like he's being flirty other times I feel like he treats me the same as everyone else. We mess with each other a lot and seem to be comfortable with each other but I think that just might be his personality. 

Sometimes he'll jokingly mimic me. He'll but into conversations at times with random remarks. While I was getting carts one day he was leaving and I was talking to him. I told him that I'm just happy that I haven't slipped yet. He said ""not yet"" and pretended like he was gonna push me down but followed up by saying ""just kidding. see ya later"" I was checking the schedule one day and he came up and said ""don't like you're not working"" randomly. I'll bag for him sometimes and he'll jokingly make smart remarks like ""about time"" A lot of our interactions consist of us just making fun of each other but we have had a few actual conversations. Just yesterday, we was ringing up a big order and he asked me to bag for him. He then proceeded to ask me if I was ready and then broke out randomly singing ""Are you ready for this?"" (if that's what that song is called lol) but he'll go from that to not talking as much when one of our other male coworkers comes in that he knows better. He can also be more serious and I've heard him talk about his long-term goals and he seems to be focused on making something out of himself. 

Yesterday, I got to work early and he was in the breakroom. I asked him how life was and he went into a pretty messy personal situation he's going through. It was a issue that him and his mother were going through that was clearly bothering him a lot. It was turning into a pretty good conversation until another co-worker came in and sat down and he just kind of shut up. He left and said ""See ya in 15"" when leaving.  

All of this sometimes makes me think he might be interested. Other times he'll talk to other people more than me and doesn't joke around as much. He's known most of our other coworkers longer than he has me because of him working there before so we're still getting to know each other but so far I've really liked him. I would like to get to know him better. He's made work more enjoyable almost to the point where I'm actually kinda excited for it now.

I understand dating coworkers is typically frowned upon. I understand the reasoning behind it but we work in a small town store that isn't a intense environment. It isn't a career. We both have future plans that don't consist of working there forever. Most are probably going to tell me to just ask him out but honestly I would like to test the interest before even thinking about doing so. I don't want to make him uncomfortable and I will probably never be able to bring myself to do it. Sometimes it seems like he could like me and other times not so much.

228,My husband and I have a very close guy friend who hangs out with us all the time and is really like family. The other night the three of us had dinner then he left our house and sent me this song via text message. No explanation about why he sent me this song. It was out of the blue and he sent it to me directly rather than sending it to both me and my husband. Our riend is a musician and he expresses himself through music a lot.  I listened to the lyrics and I think I know what it means but I really need some other people’s opinions on this... ,29Jan2019,1

I’ve never been in the car when this happens but he posts it on his snap story. He knows I don’t like when he does that and constantly tells me that he’s never driving fast again but then the other day he posts another snap of him racing his friend going 120 yet again down the highway. I just don’t want to see him hurt and my biggest fear is for him to get into a serious accident. I just don’t think he cares anymore.,29Jan2019,1

233,"So, I'll try to sum this up (if you want more context, I posted on another reddit the whole backstory) I've met this girl in June 2017, we were friends till September when she invited me over and after a few drinks ended up telling me that we were more than friends, we kissed for a really long time (we were both virgins at the time) and the other day I left super happy, only for her to tell me that she was confused about her feelings and didn't wan't to be with anyone else. Well, I was boomed about this but we managed to keep as friends because we really cared about each other. We didn't speak for a while after that, until last year we started speaking again and invited her to a discord call with some friends of mine. She ended up becoming friends with my friends which was awesome because we now get to hang and talk a lot more. Anyway this friend of mine threw a party for his birthday last September, and this girl and my friend got out to buy cigarrettes. This last Thursday they confessed me that that day they made out and started seeing each other, and now it got serious and feel guilty for not telling me (a few other things happened with this girl besides the kiss, but not worth telling) at first I was mad at them because when she joined the group she said that she would never be with a friend of mine because she knew it would hurt me. My friends (including the one that got with her) all said that anything with her besides friendship was off the table. I knew this, they knew this, they did it anyway. However, saturday another friend threw a party, And for the last months I was talking with this friend about rolling some ecstasy for the first time together. Anyway that night we were supossed to talk about this whole thing, but when she arrives she tells me that she ""got some candy"" fastforward that night we took one pill each and after an hour of rolling we went out to talk, found a nice and quiet place and she started telling me how things were with my friend, how it just ""happened"" but in my mind i was like whatever, I still care about you two and want you to be happy together, but not telling me was a shit move (even though I probably would have done the same) she ended up talking about this and the conversation took a big turn because suddenly we were talking about us. The pill didn't put any words in my mouth, just took all of my inhibitions out and let me speak what I felt, the same happened for her. She told me that she was always attracted to me, still is, but I'm weird in some ways she couldn't explain at the time. I told her that we are something more, the time in our lives it's just not right, and she agreed, telling me that if we were to happen, we obviously weren't ready. She told me that there will always be this ""tension"" between us and that we are not ment to be friends. We talked a lot about that, she even said that at this time of her life ""she can't last with a single person for more than a year"" and our thing has to be right. I strongly believe this, also, after having a hard breakup a few years ago I'm not into a full relationship as of right now, and haven't been these past couple years, so I want and need to be with more people before her. These things weren't a lie, you can tell when a person is being honest, I have know her for a long time now, and she is a pretty awful liar. Also we were under the effects of this pill and if you ever tried it you will know that doesn't make you lie, just makes you say things that are deep down on you or things you are too scared/embarrassed to say. To sum things up, after 1 hour of talking, I notice through the corner of my eye that she is staring and me and I know what's going to happen. I look at her, she looks at my lips, I look at hers. We kiss for a few seconds. Not the best kiss ever but probably the most meaningful moment in our whole relationship. We've been honest about ourselves for the first time in a long time, after the kiss we stay up there for another hour, hugging and talking about life and other stuff. At one point I asked her if what she has with my friend is going to be an obstacle if we ever come to be, she gets serious for a moment and says that obviously it won't be. After all of this, we said that the best thing was to not say anything to our friends about what just happened, that it's better if it stays between ourselves because they would not understand it, they would just blame the drug and probably the guy she's with would get hurt. There is this guy in our group that's 6 years older than most of us and we all come to him for advice so she ends up telling him, and i told the owner of the house who is a really close friend of mine. This wasn't a big of an issue. The real problem came when the effect came down and we realized what just happened. She confessed me that they're actually boyfriend and girlfriend and have been for about a week. I felt like shit, but I the same time it had to happen, It felt like closure for both of us, and also helped us to get all of that out. She got home, cried, and told me none of what whe though was her, just the drug. She also told her now boyfriend what happened because she was super guilty. I was in the comedown of this and got really angry at bot of them because they dropped this shit on me in like four days and expected me to be cool with it. After talking to this oldest guy in the group, he adviced me to sleep on it. This happened yesterday, today i talked to my friend, I told him what happened (and I know he went to this girl's house to speak about what happened, and also spent the night with her) today I woke up with a message of this friend, we kind of talked about the situation and he thinks none of this it's my fault, but he's not angry with her. It was partly my fault because I could tell something was about to happen, it did, and went it it. And 4 hours ago I got into a one hour call with this girl. She told me about coming home and crying, the feeling of guiltiness and when i asked her how she felt during the comedown her response was ""i didn't feel anything"" no shit, i told her what the ecstasy comedown is and then it all clicked for her. We talked all things over, and realized that what we talked about that night when we kissed was true, just things we had deep down ourselves, and it helped us be honest, and what she said to me was the anxiety, depression and guilt she felt after realizing everything. We are fine now. 
 As of now, I don't want to be with her, my friend needs her and she needs my friend, its their time now, and wished them both the best. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life waiting for this girl, so don't advice me against that. We just said that if the time ever comes, we will both embrace what shall happen. I have this gut feeling that if I ever get with her, it's going to be the right one, and I don't want to waste that now. But now finding out that his connection I felt between us wasn't just my imagination, is weird. She acknowledged it, so i'm not making things up. It's weird though, imagining the person who was a love of my life potential with a friend i really care about, it's weird. Also it's a lot of information to process in 4 days. I just want to know what you guys think of this, if something similar ever happened to you and if you have an advice for me, it will be greatly appreciated.

234,"I guess this is a lot of just getting things off my chest, and also thus will be long winded so I'll try to sum it up first.
TDLR: My sister is in debt and left my parents with a house payment. I'm figuring ways to help but besides the obvious I can't think of much.

My parents had bought my sister a home when she announced she was pregnant. At the time she was living in a tiny apartment. A cheap house popped up and they took the opportunity to help out. My sister has been living there on cheap rent for many years with the promise that if she took good care of the house then it would be given to her. She nor her husband have taken care of the house after many broken doors, walls and uncleanliness in general. My sister is now on her second child and she decided that the place wasn't big enough to raise two kids. Despite this, the place she's moving into is barely any bigger, plus it's about 400 dollars more a month, but probably more. Before she did this, it was offered that if she could sell the house, find someone to take it completely over... She could have the profit made. This would make up about what was already paid (about 15,000 after fees and such.)

So she finally found someone to pay the price she set out, and moved completely out into this new apartment. The deal was going through, lawyers were already set up and things seemed fine. Then the people buying the house went to take another look to find a leak in the basement. This was probably hidden previously by clutter that accumulated by my sisters bad habits. Or it could have been the snowfall and subsequent rain, given this is an old house. They decided to pull out despite being at a part of the process where they would have to pay the lawyers some such amount.

Of course, this meant two things. My sister had plenty more debt racked up that she now will be unable to allievate since she expected to get a good payout. Also, my parents can't afford to handle a house payment for very long. Much less stressing out over the process of selling it. So I suppose this is where I come in. I live with my parents and I have a good amount of money saved up so I offered in general to help in anyway I can, although they are too stubborn to accept. Regardless it's a little more complicated but I will try and clear it up tomorrow.

I'm not sure how much of the stress is caused by the financial strain and how much is caused by the fact that my sister is in deep trouble. My confusion came when something very mentally scarring to me occurred: my father started to cry and hugged me. I have never witnessed him cry nor did I ever expect to. He was always a rock and it scared me. He started to cry when mentioning my sister's kids. How he knows my sister is hard on them and takes her stress out on them and it affects them adversely.

To explain, my sister yells at her kid a lot. One is 5 and the other 1. The 5 year old has had plenty of issues over the passed year and some change. A lot of high fevers, coughing and runny nose, scratching spots on her face until she bleeds. Perhaps these are all other underlying conditions and not symptoms of underlying stress, or a regular young girls daily life...I don't know. The theory posited by my father that these are symptoms that are driven by my sister's anger. To summarize, if the kid talks to much she yells, sometimes the kid could be just wanting a small bit of temporary attention and she yells. The thing is, I believe my sister loves the initial stage of having a kid and cares little about the rest. She probably enjoys the attention and reliance a child gives her and it gives her temporary happiness from her own depression that she has been seeing a doctor about. The kid is restricted and when given freedom goes wild. She is very defiant and attention seeking. Doing bad things to hold your attention. Mostly enjoying negative attention over positive.

Forgive me for the details, but I feel it's important in deciding what to do. Anyway, my sister's husband is a mechanic. It's a twist to this story. He makes great money. More than this household does. It appears like the money gets spent on booze dope and god knows what else. Regardless my parents end up donating then food, juice boxes and such constantly. They also take the kids for sleepovers frequently, about once a week on average. I also watch the kids and such sometimes. The point of all this is to say that everything has enabled my sister up to this point and it worries me that I have been so passive. I want to scream at her and make her understand.

So back to the moment with my father. I understand he hasn't been eating nor sleeping well these last couple days. Leading to this breakdown. I know I should have asked but I'm wondering if the financial strain was really that bad? I can allievate that myself. And will offer to do so in one of my many attempts to help. My parents aren't poor and they have many assets. It isn't going to make them lose anything for many months that I'm aware of. But besides that it sounds like it could be moreso worry for the kids. During this moment he offered the idea that he may take my sister and the kids into this house in order to help matters. He specifically spoke about how mentally sick she was and he feared she would get worse. I feel this is wrong although offering to take the kids in is a fine suggestion. My sister had been previously banned from the house due to her constant fighting and loudness. Just a general tendency for conflict. I really don't want her back and perhaps that's selfish but oh well.

Finally, I'm wondering what I can offer and what I can do. I want to shove my savings in their face. I also had the idea to pick something up go help my father sleep. I will continue to buy groceries and such like I always have, and I even have thought about offering to look after the kids more if need be. I'm hoping you may be able to suggest logical routes for me to take as I don't want to be passive about this. I literally fear for my father's health and seriously have become paranoid about him dying or some such. I can't stand by. I have never been a stressor outside of being a slight burden living here but I do feel guilty. I want it to end. I want to go screaming at my sister to give a fuck about her kids for a change over herself. Any words are appreciated even if just encouragement. Thank you so much for reading.",29Jan2019,1

240,"My father has the mindset that there’s a drug to cure everything. As such, he has wound up on a cocktail of ssri’s, snri’s, and sdri’s for depression, as well as GHB for narcolepsy.

The only problem is, he somehow doesn’t notice these side-effects (possibly as a result of the drugs) and my mom is is denial of the situation. He acted like this once before, but instead of changing his prescription, doctors just prescribed an antipsychotic drug on top of it all.
Today, I was on video chat with my mom and him, and I couldn’t even stand to talk for 5 minutes because he was being so weird and, frankly, disturbing. I called my mom after and she insisted that they’ll go see the doc. My only worry is that my dad will go to the doc and insist that there isn’t a problem and will carry on with his drug regimen.

249,"A little background over this situation: I am a 20 year-old male who isn’t too “heavy,” but could lose a few pounds. 

I stand at 5’11 and weight 190 pounds. When I was born, I had many defects throughout my left leg and foot, ones that left me incapable of running, jumping, or even standing on one foot. About 4 years ago, I had a surgery that left me on bed rest for about 5 months. Ever since then, I feel like my life is falling out of control. 

One of these reasons being is a face strong insecurity issues. A few nights ago, my family held a get together for all of us to get together for dinner and to spend time together. During this time, my brother constantly attacked me at any chance he could. He was always the “good-looking” one. He’s four years older, but doesn’t have a car, a house, a full-time job, or go to school.

On the other hand, I have had 3 vehicles in the last four years, paying for them myself. I have a full-time job, and while I do live at home, it’s so I can keep going for school for my degree in English Education. 

At this party, one of our cousins lost weight and his response to this was “if only (my name) could lose weight.” This was really embarrassing because he said it before the family and only did my sister say anything. I’ve spent a large part of my life being the responsible one, even though I’m the youngest, and I was about to give my brother my old car, but now I don’t see the point. 

He ridicules me, mocks me constantly, and makes me feel bad for being me, but then wants to be seen as this “protective brother.” With him never being thankful for what I do for him (like loaning him my car for 6 months so he could go back and graduate high school while I walked to and from work everyday while getting rides to work everyday) and he never said thank you. 

This has caused a large slice in our relationship, especially sense I’m selling my old car and leaving him in the dirt. I do want to lose some pounds, but even as hard as I might, it never seems to work, and the issues with my leg don’t help. 

Does anyone have advice on how to handle both of these situations? Should I just give my brother the car and move on? How can I lose weight when my leg keeps me from being amble to",29Jan2019,1

I have a hard time focusing on what I'm doing when someone catches my attention. It gets really bad when people walk in the room when I'm watching something on TV.

I also dont know what to do when they move in between me and the TV? The TV is at crotch height, should I keep watching the TV, or look away? And because I dont look people in the eye, I dont know what they do when I move in between the TV and them.

I am very aware or how I am presenting myself to these people. I dont bend over in front of them so they dont think I'm trying to be overtly sexy, or sexualizing anything I'm doing. I keep my eyes averted and try to power through things like tiring the trash to be taken outside. 

I am also acutely aware when anyone doesnt do this in their daily routine, I just dont feel comfortable doing this myself.

I keep wanting to ask these people if I can watch how they react to certain situations so I will know how to react to them myself. Not that I dont know how to react, on my own I'm perfectly fine. It's just around other people that I have a problem.


I feel very alone. I often remove myself from the situation to prevent myself from feeling so uncomfortable. I dont have any friends I can talk to about this, I dont think there are many people who would understand this. ",29Jan2019,1

252,"So i don’t have a belief in religion and more then anything just believe science and the thought that we were formed by some sort of a biological process or another.  This comes with the idea that when we die we just die and thats it, its all over in an instant. So every time i think about my age or getting old and dying i start to get myself into a panic and cant seem to break it any other way than just telling myself to stop thinking about it over and over until i can calm down.  I feel very lost with it and because i believe that when we die everything about us ceases to exist it scares me out of enjoying the moment of life that I’m living out now.  I don’t want to live my whole life worrying about this and just suppressing the thought every time, i want to try to come to terms with it but don’t seem to know how. Is it normal to be so scared of dying to work yourself into a panic? Do others experience this? Any advice on how to stop running from these thoughts? ",29Jan2019,1
253,"alright. I’ve been really hesitant about actually asking for advice on this, but here we go: 

So, a bit of background, I’m 16 M, a sophomore in high school that isn’t really good at reading social cues. Now to my problem.

A couple of days ago, one of my friends, that I like, “asked” me to Sadies. Like any guy would, I was excited, but then I began to run through some calculations in my mind. She asked me reaallly informally and one of her friends jokingly did the same with another guy. So I was on the fence and wasn’t sure if it was real. 

So, I spent the entire day trying to figure out what I should do. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I should ask if it was real and go down the nice-guy route and say that I would be down to go.

Then it all went to hell. She said she was joking and I was pretty upset. I knew she would ask again because of that fiasco and I wasn’t really sure what to do. 

So now, a couple days later, I’m going to have to interact with her again (because of some club stuff). I don’t know what to do. I really want to try and mend that bond, but how should I go about that. Even so, is it really worth it?

254,"My first relationship ended a month ago. It lasted 4 years. It was absolutely terrible. It feels like since it was my first relationship, my ex took advantage of me. He knew that I could be manipulated easily.

I was cheated on which caused trust issues. I lost all my friends because my ex boyfriend didn't want me to talk to anyone no matter what gender they were. He physically abused me if I spoke to men in a platonic way. This lead to me being anti social. It's like I forgot how to socialize with people but I'm figuring it out now.

Being in that relationship made me feel like while you're in a relationship, you can not talk to other people at all even if you're just friends.

I've known this guy from my college for a while and I really like him. I'm still getting over my ex but this guy is absolutely amazing. He makes me so happy. He's so caring and gentle. He has a job, and he has plans for his future. School is his priority and I love that about him. We talk on the phone every night and recently just had a little ""coffee date.""

Before getting in a relationship with him, I need advice on how to change my mentality on relationships. He has a few friends that are women and they truly seem like very amazing people. However, I don't want to go into this relationship feeling jealous of these girls for no reason. Well the reason is because of the shit with my ex. How do I cope with this and change my thought process?",29Jan2019,1

Actually, he left my family for about 2 years before one day just coming back. It’s been pretty bad ever since. He can get pretty drunk sometimes, even on the road. He’s wrecked my mother AND grandmothers cars after drunk driving.  (Though he doesn’t drink and drive with us.) 

He has anger issues, (as well as the rest of the family) so it’s really hard for everyone. 

I’ve told my mom to make him stay at a hotel, or just find a temporary home to live in, so that we don’t have to cry every night wondering what’s going to happen next. But we’ve tried that, and that didn’t end up working.

257,"He is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. His heart is pure and he is one hell of a man.


 He just got mugged the other day walking his girlfriend home, he's almost 70 and so is she, and on his way back from her house he was approached by two tweakers. He was a marine in the Vietnam war, and two dirty fucking scumbags attacked him on his walk back, alone, and tried to mug him. He had 13 cents in his pocket, and showed them that. They attempted to attack him anyways. The entire left side of his face is black and blue from one of them hitting him. He actually took the fuckers out just long enough to make a run for it. They tried to chase him but were cut off by traffic and abandoned the mugging.


He stayed late tonight at my bar and really opened up. He did a lot of horrible things in the war, and lost a lot of really good friends. He kept sobbing over and over that he was forced to kill children, and absolutely broke down. Mind you, he was pretty buzzed, he's a regular here and he knocked on the door as I was closing just wanting to talk. He didn't want anything to drink, but I opened the door anyways because I could see the desperation in his eyes.


Normally he's a pretty chipper dude, always a gentlemen, never hits on me inappropriately like most of the older guys do. I can't even put into words how pure his soul is. I've never seen him so broken, and I wanted to do everything in my power to help. 


He spoke about what exactly he went through in the war, he was very reluctant and not very descriptive but he didn't need to be. You could see in his eyes how broken he was. He still works under the table painting and renovating houses 6 days a week. He lives paycheck to paycheck, with no government aid and that made me so angry. How can someone who lost their youth fighting for this country, not be supported by the government they served their life to.


Like I said, he's normal a very chipper dude. I knew he was a vet but he is one of those ones who never talks about it. If it gets brought up in the bar by other patrons his eyes immediately go dark and cold. It triggers him, and he does his best to cope in silence while the rest of the bar rambles on about war and shit. 

Well tonight he was alone, he asked to come on for a couple drinks as I was closing (he lives right across the street) but when he got inside he didn't ask for a drink. He just broke down. I tried my best to keep a straight and strong face, but I couldn't help but fight the tears in my eyes. His story was so powerful it felt like it ripped the heart right out or my chest. 


So I just listened, tried to change the subject to the happier times in his life. Tried to get him to laugh, and it worked for a short time until he brought it back to the darker times. He's truly an absolutely broken man, and being the soft and kind person he is, it really broke my heart. I didn't know what to say, I just listened. Maybe that's all he needed, but I don't think that's enough.


The stories he told me will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. As a young woman I don't have the life experience to even remotely have grounds to give him any advice. I just walked him across the street to his house, and am now back at the bar closing. I didn't realize all these months serving him how broken he really is. I don't know how to help. Maybe I can aid him financially? He opened up to me specifically and calculated, so I know finding him a therapist won't work. If anyone has any advice, I'd be so appreciative. I want to help him in any way I can but I DON'T KNOW HOW!!",29Jan2019,1
258,"So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 9 months or so. It feels like he just doesn't like me anymore, like he's uninterested in the relationship. I put a lot into a relationship-he was stressed, so I bought us couples massages, I only drive to his side of town which is 45 to an hour minutes away despite that I work full time and I'm studying for the lsat whereas he doesn't, I will go out of my way after working and studying to pick up his favorite food and bring it to him just because I like to treat him to something nice, I get to know his family and friends but still keep good boundaries, I support him in all his endeavors and try to give him lots of validation and compliments and love.

I understand that I can be a bit over-loving. I try to tone it down. However, I feel like he's always annoyed with me and doesn't have an interest in hanging out with me or enjoying each other's company anymore. Even if he isn't busy, like literally sitting at home just doing nothing, if I left it up to him, we'd hang out maybe once a week max despite that I'm the one working 40+ hours a week and studying 15-20 hours a week while he works 25 or less. I always offer to give him space, but he says no, yet his actions say otherwise. He goes out with his friends on his own a few times a week, as do I, so it's not like I'm trying to take up all of his time. I have my own life and friends and family and hobbies to attend to. 

When I talk, he rarely listens or responds to what I've said, even if it's something easy like ""do you want to go to this concert for this band we like this weekend, I'll buy tickets?"" I feel like he liked my bubbly personality in the beginning, but now he finds it aggravating and when I tone it down, I feel like I'm not being myself around him. It's really draining hiding yourself, especially the better parts, from your partner. He is distant, in which he tries to spend minimal time with me in any intimate way. If I'm lucky, sometimes he'll cuddle with me, but days of seeing him can go by without him even giving me a single kiss without me asking him to, which I find very weird only 9 months in. He tells me he only wants me and loves me and will try to improve at showing his love for me because I give A LOT and he takes more than he gives, which he has admitted, but then just a few hours later, he goes back to his normal behavior. I feel unloved, but I also don't want to annoy him by constantly asking for reassurance. 

I've been in a relationship where my partner really expressed their love for me and this just doesn't feel like it. It makes me quite sad.  I also generally have to be the one to initiate sexual intimacy, which makes me question how into me he is.

I'm just tired of giving with getting little back, and I've discussed this with him calmly and rationally, insofar as he's even admitted it, and I don't know how much more I can handle.

I've been deprived of familial intimacy (not incest, ew, but love expressed by my family towards me as my mother is mean and hostile and I have no father), so I like to have a boyfriend that shows me a lot of love. I'm quite broken up about this. I want to make this work, but I don't know if I can anymore. Help? ",29Jan2019,1

It was just confusing because I would introduce her to everyone as my girlfriend but she introduced me to everyone as her “gay friend” and I’m not even gay! I asked her about it and she said it was just a joke and to get over it. But I couldn’t get over it because I didn’t know what I was her boyfriend or just her friend!? so when I brought it up again she told me to get over it again and then I told her I guess weren’t not even dating because u just intrude me as your gay friend not boyfriend and I got frustrated. I just told her we’re not dating then and to stop saying I’m her gay friend even if it’s a joke. I’m pretty sure she got mad because she started texting me with “ok” “sure” “?” and when she gets mad she doesn’t even want to talk about it at all!!! And so I called her to talk about it but all she said was “fine” “mhm” “idk” and then she hung up to go to sleep and texted me saying “gn” like WHAT!! Now she hasn’t been responding to me and I got tired of trying to get her to text me back so I’m just started to give up.

263,"There's this guy I knew and had a brief thing with... *really* brief, we exchanged intimate words and some nudes over Snapchat and then drifted apart, nothing more and never intended anything more because we were way too different and could barely even communicate unless it was sexual. It's never been my habit to do that stuff on Snapchat, that was the only time. I am in a very happy relationship now, I find my man very attractive and could not see myself being with anyone else.

Thing is, I still think of this guy and his face every now and then. It's not even his body I remember even though we sent nudes. I just remember he had these sleepy eyes and very long and pretty eyelashes, blue eyes and soft-looking curly dark brown hair which always seemed too dry and yet I and I still immediately get these flutters remembering him. It's really clearly lust/infatuation but I have no idea why I can still remember him and act like a Catholic highschool girl about it.

264,"Hey peeps,

I think I am stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I recently met a girl who became my friend, then became intimate, and now we have a pretty vague relationship. Here's some context:

We are both pretty recently divorced, we both talk to each other about the trauma of our relationships, and the daily struggles we encounter. We empathize with one another, console one another, and we fuck one another. I don't think there'd be confusion or attachment if we hadn't started boning, but the ox is in the mire, what's done is done. Now, initially, she told me, ""If you meet a girl, date her, have fun, and don't worry about me. But don't tell me if you do, okay?"" I understood that to be a green-light to be non-attached and to put me in the ""friend-with-benefit-zone"" ... which wasn't a big deal. However, we are both catching feelings, I think.

She tells me that some guy was barking up her tree, but she shut him down. Okay, why would she tell me that? And then, she found out through a friend that my ex-gf is going to visit me, and she admitted she was jealous. I don't want her to be jealous, but I don't know how much more I could do. Do I confess my feelings? Do I express a willingness to commit to her despite our vulnerable states? Being fresh out of divorce is not exactly helping the timing, but can couples push through that?

I guess my question is: do couples that start off with beneficial sex have the potential of coming together? Is there a good way of making that known? I'm scared to trust her, but I see potential. Has anyone made it through that? Has anyone found a friend, fucked their brains out, and then started a future together?

That she kissed her ex’s friend cause she asked for it

I’m not entirely sure what I want advice on, but I guess I’ve just been feeling lost lately on what to do, so I thought reaching out may help.

Lately, I’ve just consistently felt very down and out of it. As a very busy student, recently I’ve gotten more easily overwhelmed and burnt out. I usually end up spending too much time just laying around scrolling on my phone, or sometimes just crying out of frustration of not understanding how I feel, for feeling unproductive and worthless, etc.

There are times when I do feel productive and positive, but I feel that the downs are coming more frequently and longer.

I’ve opened up to some friends lately which has been a great support, but I know that I have to help myself too because I am still lost. I’ve tried to build better habits such as exercising daily, eating healthier, drinking more water, sleeping more, keeping a journal, etc, and they usually last for a while, but never long enough. 

I’ve tried to find apps to help myself but always grow impatient and delete them. Similarly, I feel like I would benefit a lot from meditating, but I always feel too anxious when starting, can’t focus, feel like I’m wasting time, and have difficulty breathing.

I understand that all of my issues are just in my head (though I guess I could also be making them worse by minimizing them). I guess overall I’m just lost and don’t know what to do to improve. I generally feel more anxious,  depressed, unproductive, and unmotivated, but it is so difficult to start making changes for the better.

Sorry I’ve been kind of all over the place. 

Do you have any advice for what I could do or where to go from here? Or maybe just some words of encouragement, or even suggestions/advice from personal experience? I’m sure that anything could help.

They aren't audible and I'm aware they are coming from my head. They're mostly dissorganized and benign but sometimes mock me. My other symptoms include blunted affect(only can feel intense emotions), motor and verbal tics, sometimes dissorganized speech, trouble understanding what people are talking about and their emotions, anxiety, depersonalization, depressive episodes(only once), other types of hallucinations (rare, mostly dots in peripheral vision) and BPD like symptoms (up to debate; my mother had it and I didn't really have a great father). Most of these I can hide, but anxiety, dissorganized speech, BPD to an extent, depersonalization(not often) and trouble understanding what people are talking about, I can't. I will most likely get the diagnosis of  schizophrenia, when I get a psychotic break. This information was given to by a psychatrist, except BPD like symptoms, they are my """"diagnosis"""". I've talked my friend (isn't in my class) about it and ge said I might have chance.

I never aproached a girl before(they aproched me). In past ""relationships""(all are laughable, the longest lasted month and a half) I had constant fear of abandonment and was acting like a cuck. My emotions shifted rapidly and was anoyed every time they did not answer a text after five minutes. 

Can you give me the advice on how to aproach her? Is it worth it for mine and her sake? When do I tell her that I will develop psychosis(I don't want pitty)? At what point do I tell her that i like her ? Also if it happens and if it lasts more than a few months how do I tell her that I want to have sex? From what I heard her say about it she thinks girls that fuck that young are sluts. ",29Jan2019,1
278,"My bf and I have been together 3 years. Over that time, we’ve been more than fine in the bedroom department. Until about a year or so ago I noticed a massive drop in his libido. Naturally, I just thought that maybe he’d been straining himself. What used to be a 2-3 day session would drag up to a week to two weeks. I’m not going to lie. It hurts. Badly. 

Now obviously I went through all possibilities. He works shifts, so perhaps he was tired. There’s nobody else in the lineup. I’m just worried. I feel awful and I feel, dare I say it, disappointed in myself. I honestly feel like shit. 

I’m scared. So scared to talk to him. That’s why I’m posting here. So I can collect my thoughts and clear my head. I have a feeling that he prefers masturbation over me.

283,"I have been friends with this girl since early in high school and she’s always been an exaggerator. But within the last few years it has gotten very bad. She makes up very elaborate stories about her ‘boyfriend’ that is very obviously fake. Brags about how rich his family is, about all of his nice cars and crazy vacations. She has even ‘received’ a promise ring from him.  Problem is, this boy does not have any social media and ‘doesn’t like his picture taken.’ He hasn’t met any of her family or friends. This isn’t the first time she has made a fake boyfriend either. She had one in high school that eventually ‘moved to Africa’ so she could get out of the lie. So I have always played along with her outrageous lies but I’ve gotten to a point where it’s starting to worry me. Should I call her out on it? What is the best way to approach the situation?

I hate my life so fucking much. I’ve always had bad luck. I’m hated by everyone. I have an older brother that hates me to death and I can’t keep living like this. I share a room with him and he’s such a slob. He never showers and he’s a giant hypocrite. He tells me to turn the lights off when he sleeps but when I try to sleep I try to turn the lights off he turns it back on and yells at me. I’m not a very intellectual person. He knows that so he uses that against me and screws my argument completely. This is just one of the many examples. Last time I slit my wrists was because of him. My mom and I are not on talking terms right now and she started yelling at me because I needed the lights on for something when he wanted to sleep. But he was on his phone. Once she stops yelling at me she tells him goodnight. I’ve had enough. Family problems aside I almost failed my first semester in college. I’ve always gotten bad grades before and if I keep living I’m just going to become a failure. I’ve had arthritis for 7 years now and I’m getting tired of getting sick ever single week.

this is my first post here. Me 25M and my GF 22F have a beautiful relationship. Its really fullfilling in every aspect (love, trust, sex.. etc).

Her previous boyfriend died about 2 years ago affected by an illness. 

Sometimes she talks about it and I am really trying to be understanding, calm and empathic but sometimes I feel a little bit offended. I know its not okay but sometimes I am thinking what would have been if he wouldnt have died. They had a really nice relationship and I think she was really really in love with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working a lot on myself but sometimes when she drops things like ""I wish I could talk to him again"" or ""When I die I know someone is waiting for me"" I am sad and offended because I am forgetting my value. She really loves me and dont get me wrong she doesnt say anything like that to hurt me, she just doesnt know how she makes me feel like sometimes and I am not telling her this way because its my ego which is causing this. (hope this is understandable)

291,"sad, not depressed. i dont know what to do with my life 26m/ little story about me.


Hi, firstly i want to say that english isnt even my 2nd or 3rd language, so, im sorry if someone gotta have a hard time understanding me.
Ill try my best, though.

Im going to be 27y/o next month and i literally did nothing with my life. I fucked up with all my opportunities that i had because of some
stupid reasons. I firstly fucked up when i gave up university in the last year because of.. poker(or money). Yeah thats right. I know that may sound crazy for some people but
back in the day when i was younger the poker ""phenomenon"" was rising so high in europe, or at least in my country. I was making lots of money online and live aswel, before i
quit university i made around 60kdollars in less than a year. And that was good enought to give up to my dream(a psychology degree and actory) and also in my faithful girlfriend at the time.


In highschool i wasnt by far the bright student but i always managed to do VERY well when i had to. I always knew that my potential was higher than others.
Anyway, back to when i quit university. I was making lots of cash for my age back then, in particular for a kid in relatively 2.5 world country

My family is a wealthy family, my dad started from the bottom like a slave and make it through. Cant blame him for being a cheap bastard but we will get there soon.

After I made lots of cash i told my dad ( He had at the time many friends that started playing poker; many of them some sort of mobs and gangsters in some areas from my city and country ) and told him that we can literally
print money if I can join those games. ) We did it, he introduced me into his circle of friends. I dont even know what the word is in english to express what i did to those guys. We were playing 
for 5 figures a night and very often people would come with their stuff from home; cars, cellphones, jewelry, watches, pcs and EVERY sort of stuff that worth money. ( I dont feel very good about this rn but 
if you live in this sort of lifestyle.. thats not much you can do about it); you just go with it.

Then i managed to win so much money that i couldnt count for my age. Im so sad saying this because now im close to being broke, but man, i think i was around 20-21 when i had almost 100k in cash just for myself and at least a half of this 100k
worth in just CLOTHES and useless stuff that in the last years i just gave it away to people that needed it more than me and to so called friends.

I was so proud that i can  make my dad proud of something, i was literally tearing up every single time i was just remembering it to myself; ""wow, u did it!"".. but lifes strange and .. here i am now whining..

Going forward, karma or life hits me so hard; I broke up with my gf at the time; the most loyal person that i ever met. ( just because i had so many girls and always buzzed up and fucked up from some sort of subtances.. )

I then managed to get into clubs, women and inevitable, drugs. I've been an addict for...a long time for my age.
I first started with xanax and alcohol, then with club pills and alcohol and then with every sort of powders and.. alcohol. Ive been quitting doing drugs for like 4.5(?) years but here i am an alcoholic at 27...
Ive been drinking for the last 8 years at least, every single day. I hate my life and i am sad every time. But im even more upset..when i dont drink. Tears in my eyes everytime. Thank God my mom just thinks i just like drinking... its so sad
seeing her sadness watching me almost always blacking out in my room. I always hide and i act like i dont give a fck and im insensitive but.. im the opposite.

The thing that drive me crazy, are the random thoughts that comes into my mind and i cant control them. I just have random memories of things that happened so much time ago and i feel so embarassed about it.. and my only escape from
reality is.. drinking; i rarely smoke pot nowadays(only after summers when i grow it for my self). I feel i dont deserve anything and i just want everything to be over. (!! I do not have suicide thoughts !! - I am just sad ) 
I dont want to offend people that are really suicidal or depressed, I AM NOT. i am just very sad most of the times when im alone. It would be an offense to people that are depressed if I would say i am this way.

The last 6 months of 2018 i made my dad bank up more than 70k euros, and, i just received around 2k euros in cash and about 3k more in clothes and electronics. I still have to receive so much money from what i made but im pretty
sure i wont see any of this money that i earned, and tbh i dont even care anymore. Days and nights in a row with no sleep just to make my dad proud (literally so many sessions of poker - 24 &amp; 48h straight playing poker)And he is screwing me up everytime i have to receive the money that i literally earned.

Maybe he thinks that i do not deserve the money because i am going to ruin my life even more; i dont know. i just dont know whats going on(maybe hes right)

*Theres so many things i skipped about my shtty life but i think i covered most of my thoughts in this long post..*

With my last few bucks i am trying to book a flight in Italy (where i was born) and try to recover myself and visiting my relatives..maybe that would help, idk. At least thats the only thing i can think about now. Going back to Italy and..just
trying to ... feel something. Maybe God or life can lead me to some sort of happines.

Recently i started playing poker again online but things arent going so well for now; for anyone who knows how online poker works know what i am talking about; variance is a bitch, but i will make it through.

I dont know what to ask you, Reddit, but any sort of advices and questions are welcome.

PS: In the last year i developed psoriasis due to stress and also gaining so much weight i cant even watch myself in the mirror. not to mention all of my clothes that now are useless; make me so sad.

I also believe that thats just a part of a plan and things are going to be better but, for now, i am just hopeless and also i  really feel that nothing can change my life in better.
I dont know if i have some sort of mental problems, i probably do, and also i dont feel any doctor can help me in this way. to be honest i just feel im a lost cause.

What do you guys think ? Any sort of advice is highly appreciated.

PS 2 : feel free to ask me anything, im pretty sure i missed many points in this post about my life just because..i cant write them. Maybe my experience can help someone in the future. feel free to ask me anything

Thanks and have a good one !

292,"Long backstory here
Well I’m 16 and we’ve had a domestic helper for 5 days a week that cooks, cleans and washes for as long as I can remember but as of recently I feel as though. Till I was about 13 my parents had extremely hectic schedules and I wouldn’t see them much and they really wouldn’t have time to do any chores. The helper also doubled as a bit of supervision for the 3 of us. But given that it’s only me now and there’s schedules aren’t nearly as hectic. They can now do chores but I do believe they are too lazy to do this. I cook dinner ever so often, do my laundry, clean my room, the kitchen, wash all the dishes and I do all the outside work. I think the need for a helper is completely unnecessary at the very least so many days. I’ve started to feel extreme anxiety with how much I see her and as though my space is being invaded to seeing her every single day.
 I’m a person who needs a lot of space but at the same time it’s not MY household and I don’t want to come off as I’m telling them what to do. But I believe they’re just becoming lazy. As they do not do anything on the weekends that they may have off. And I mean ANYTHING.

There are too many problems to count with this guy, but that's a story for another time. Right now I'm focusing on what I see as the biggest problem. Baby steps.
Asshole Roommate has no regard for other people's schedules and acts like he owns the entire apartment. For the past two weeks at least, AR has gotten in to the apartment around 3A.M. every morning. Each time he brings his friends back with him, always no less than two. He comes into the apartment, turns all the lights on upstairs, does not adjust the volume of his voice in any way and talks loudly with his friends who follow his example, turns on music, smokes weed/sometimes cigarettes, and hangs out with his friends until morning or whenever they get tired. Every time, he wakes me up from my sleep. His friends don't live in our apartment and he's acting like they do. They constantly sleep over and it makes the mornings really uncomfortable as well. It's become so incredibly frustrating to not be able to have a decent night's sleep at my own damn place. I don't really talk to my other roommates and I have no idea if they take issue with AR's shit too.

The guys are supposed to move things, and the girls are expected to stand in the front to look pretty. 
The customers are all locals and know the bosses on a personal level and feel as though they can walk all over me.

Im not going to pretend like I’m a perfect employee, but this sounds unfair to me. I know my boss will literally laugh in my face if I asked for a raise.

303,"Ok well where do I start, I have a friend who I used to be very close to but sadly fell out with a year ago due to numerous incidents and a phase of depression I went through. We’ve tried to be friends several times but every time would end with them deciding they’d be better off just not talking to me and leaving me hanging every time (I was normally the one trying to rekindle the friendship)

In the summer before we returned to our school, our friendship rekindled itself after a disastrous school year between the two of us and we talked a lot and went out a few times, however upon returning to school... I found them reluctant to talk to me anymore and due to this we both grew bitter and fell out again.

We then argued one night and said some pretty awful things to each other, we had argued before but it was normally me being their emotional punching bag and not offering much in the way of an argument  (Something I would later come to resent them for) and yet after the arguing was done, they came to me and apologised and we agreed to revisit our friendship at a later date.

And then suddenly... two weeks later, the impossible happened and this person. A person, I had perceived as unemotional and uncaring towards me, opened up and admitted they missed being my friend and wished to be friends again for good. I know I said we were friends numerous times beforehand and tbh I should’ve predicted the outcome earlier. But this was the first sign of genuine friendship from them and I embraced them with open arms.

It took two weeks for things to slowly start reverting back. They’d stop making an effort to talk to me. They’d never look at me if we were in a group. Only the other people. They would never attempt to start a conversation with me. Unlike last time, we didn’t argue but we both let things get away from us and we stopped talking. However during a mutual period of exams. I found them suddenly easier to get on with and for a solitary month. They were consistently my friend and I genuinely thought things would get better.

And then last week, they stopped. Suddenly my “easy-to-talk” to friend was cold and unwelcoming. This was by far the most abrupt they’ve ever done this and to be honest I am furious. I have always been the one pushing our friendship. Trying to fix it and make it work and I’ve always been the one cast aside for no reason. It’s never been them. This person genuinely means a great deal to me but they’ve never been consistent. I was the sole reason our friendship collapsed in the first place and as a result always blamed myself when our attempted friendships failed.

However now, I see myself less as the sole perpetrator and more as the guy getting screwed. This person is genuinely a good and kind person however they play with my emotions and constantly make me feel worthless and unwanted in my attempts to be their friend. They’ve called me out before for “failing to confront them” (as if that’s the reason things always go to shit) and tbh I don’t want to confront them. I just want out.

And so I ask... people of reddit. Would I be an asshole if I was to just start ignoring him. Block him on everything and cut him completely out of my life despite the fact I don’t know his true feelings and we would still see each other regularly. I would ask him but doing so would most likely lead to an argument I’m really not emotionally equipped to have.

304,"So I've been having a bit of a tough time lately. Could really use some advice. I have a best friend, he can be unreliable at times but was usually there for me when i needed him and i'm always there for him whenever he is going through a tough time. He would call me or message everyday and we would hang out pretty often during the week. I even spent Christmas with him and his family. 

After new years i heard from him way less, like barley at all. I just assumed he was busy. But then i noticed he would be very non committal when i tried to make plans. Then when we did have plans, he would cancel last minute as someone else had asked him to hang out. He is trying to reconnect with a few old friends lately which I think is great, as he doesn't have that many friends, i have loads of different groups and often invited him along to things with my friends. So i was happy he was branching out. 

 What i think is awful is to have plans with me then cancel due to as he put it, an opportunity coming up that he cant pass up. 

After this he apologized and said he would make up for it we made more plans, and he cancelled last minute again to go hang out with someone else. I called him out  on it, said that it was pretty hurtful and made me seem like a second choice. He apologized again, said he would hang with me soon, has cancelled every time since. that was 3 weeks ago and i haven't seen/heard from him since. which is bizarre as we would usually be in contact and see each other at least twice a week.

I'm so confused, literally before this happened he was saying i was such a good friend to him, and he loves and cares for me so much. And now hes just gone the minute his old mates come along. It really hurts cus he knows I'm really sick at the moment, and its like he doesn't care at all. He hasn't even asked how I'm doing.

Not like the actual process but the ejaculation.whenever I feel the semen coming up it starts to pain instantly and during the time of ejaculation, the pain becomes kinda unbearable but after a few seconds the pain goes away. But it still hurts occasionally all through the day and hurts the most when I’m lying doing or sitting. I have tried. To hold my penis or testicles but the pain doesn’t subside this way. If anyone or any medical professional can give me a reason and what meds can fix this I’d be more than thankful. Also urination hurts after masturbation as well.

Not smart when you get up at 4:15, but I do get to see my dad get home at 12:00 from a second shift labor job, so that's a small plus. Anyway he gets home around that time, comes upstairs to brush teeth and drop off his bag, notices me awake and we talk a bit. Nothing out of the ordinary. He goes back downstairs, I assume to play games on the computer. I wake up and notice the computer is still on and I'm still logged in on my school account, with ""ehentai"" entered in the corner search bar. Check the recently closed tabs and sure enough someone was browsing. I panicked and closed the window, knowing that were this to be seen by anyone else I'd be the assumed culprit (being the weeb), forgetting that our browser is set to not record history if it is closed. Now I can't bring it up without implicating myself, I am nervous around my dad, and the fact he did this on my school email without incognito means my already at risk drive is in greater jeopardy of being deleted (district has a wierd three strikes=deletion by bot system).

My best friend is currently living with me but moving across the country and moving in with another friend in the next few months. They're house-hunting now and I keep finding myself making little snide comments about the friend she's moving in with and his partner. 

Same with my boyfriend - this sounds awful but when all of his focus goes on something other than me, I find myself making little negative comments about how all this stuff is getting in the way of his work goals. 

The stuff I say isn't untrue but it doesn't need to be said - especially by me. Friend and boyfriend haven't told me off for the comments - they don't happen often - but I really don't want to do it more. 

You might be thinking ""just stop saying those things!"" But I genuinely don't notice them coming out of my mouth until it's too late. When I do notice, I don't say anything - but comments like these still slip out too often. Any ideas on how to stop? ",29Jan2019,1

She’s extremely passive aggressive and when she gets mad she’ll withhold things from me, making it impossible to do my job. She’ll ask me a simple question, and I will answer it directly and politely then out of nowhere she’ll snap and get angry then complain about me to my supervisor.

320,"I’m a small woman. I look younger than I am, and many describe me as “cute and petite,” but I graduated in 2015 and I’m 26. Thus, I am not completely clueless to my job and I’d like to think I’m pretty good at case management. Nevertheless, there are multiple instances in which people tend to make me feel “less than” and as if I were a child because I look so young. And they don’t do this with my co-worker, who is 28, but looks older. For example:


1. I had a mom recently turn down a referral for her children because I looked young and she assumed I wouldn’t know what I was doing. She didn’t tell me this, but she told a co-worker whom she has adult case management with. I was a bit insulted, but whatever.


Even yesterday, I told my family we were going into a different room to meet in because my office was so small and I didn’t want anyone to feel claustrophobic. She said, “Yeah, that’s what happens when you’re at the bottom of the totem pole and never done anything like this before.” I had an inkling she felt this way considering after we had done the comp assessment, she proceeded to call their PCP after to let them know I “didn’t do anything for [them], and must not know what [I’m] doing”. I had to call her after I read that to let her know 1. I am not a direct service provider and 2. I gave you the information for our crisis team if needed, and 3. We hadn’t done a treatment plan yet. I can’t legally bill for any services done until a treatment plan is formulated and signed. How was I supposed to “do anything” for you guys if I didn’t even know what the issues were prior to meeting you? That’s what the comp assessment is for. I’m not a therapist. I can’t fix your entire life for you in an hour. And you haven’t accused the crisis worker or any other providers you’ve worked for recently of not “doing anything” when they haven’t yet either because you assume they’ve been doing this longer because they look older.


2. The med management provider associated with our agency is constantly undermining me. I make decisions and seek out resources and providers for my families because it is things THEY THE CLIENT ask for, and I agree for it to be a good idea. The MM doctor, however, always reads through my notes during clients appointments and points out in front of them and me why this and this is useless, not right for the client, etc. It makes me look stupid and like I don’t know what I’m doing, but most of these decisions I’ve gotten supervision on and I’m not just blindly sending referrals.


3. THE HARASSMENT. Not from my coworkers but clients. I have one parent who is constantly trying to flirt with me. I ignore it and he leaves it alone. It’s a bit annoying because I know he’s not doing that to the other, older coworkers (including my own who he has worked with and she’s very attractive). 


Another client’s family of mine always has a family friend over when I go there and he, on the other hand, is relentless. Always points out that I’m not married so we should go on a date. He asked me the first time I met him, “How do you feel about being with a paranoid schizophrenic?” (He was talking about himself, by the way). He tells me how attractive I have and won’t let up the entire time I’m there. Again, I know he’s not doing that with the other, older looking home providers. This makes me feel disrespected.


What do I do? I shouldn’t have to prove to someone I’m worthy of respect. This is something that frustrates me day in and day out because it does make an already difficult job even more difficult. Harassment, other providers undermining me, and even families disengaging completely after they meet me because I look so young.

324,"Good morning all! My fiancée and I found out that she is pregnant on Saturday. She has shown all the common symptoms, had 4 positive tests and we are going to the doctor this week to confirm 100%. 
Here’s a little background. I am 28 and while I can hold a job well, I have no college degree and in the last year have started in the electrical trade. I am in my first of four years of school. 
She is a dog groomer and does a little bit of dog training on the side. She has hopes of running her own business one day revolving around dog and pet services. She is also taking kratom (a legal drug essentially) and has been for 6 years. The pregnancy has caused the kratom to not work well at all and she is going through a mild withdrawal but is taking advantage of this and is doing a fast taper down for the sake of the baby and herself.
We have been together 4 years and live in an apartment with my mom. Her parents are extremely catholic and neither her nor I are very religious at all, but somewhat spiritual. This has created huge problems for us and this current situation is even more scary for that reason. I understand it’s our choice and our life but that’s always easy to say when it’s not your situation.
We have no savings, $5000 credit card debt, I have a $15,000 car loan(but also a pretty reliable car, which is important), and a dog who is essentially our child.
We’ve run over every situation and outcome and we are scared. It’s not good timing in the sense of living situations. There may be the possibility to live with her parents but that also may not be an option because of the shit of a relationship her and I in her parents eyes. We have no idea what’s going to happen with that. But even if we can live there, they will try and force control over us and our child and use letting us live there and our “mistake” as leverage. It is toxic and could be detrimental to our relationship. 
Our apartment is small and crowded with my mom(who is a saint and will support us in every way except financially because my brother in-law made some selfish choices forcing my sister and her three kids into severe poverty, so my mother(65) is draining her retirement money to help support them).we also have two cats and the dog. 
We discussed abortion and adoption as options but neither of us can agree with each other on either. 
We’re terrified and lost. We are assuming she is 4 weeks, about. We are very much in love but our relationship is very up and down at points as she is high strung and I am super laid back. But we make it work well for the most part and are happy together. I hope this next statement does not offend anyone; we are not sure what to do about this unexpected pregnancy. On the one hand, we are not ready or prepared. What about daycare? How will we afford that? Living conditions? Those are our biggest concerns. We are stuck between keeping it and making it work as best we can and sacrificing her career for a while, or trying again a few years down the road when we are a little more secure in the sense of living conditions and financial freedom so she can take more time off and not worry about going back to work until she is ready. Once I finish school I have a dollar amount I am guaranteed and it will put us in a decent spot. But until then, it will be very difficult.

326,"My father (60M) is actively suicidal. Last night, he took his handgun with the intention of killing himself, and turned the gun away last minute to shoot through the floor of his bedroom. My mom (45F) is terrified and so are my brothers (17M).  I no longer live at home (23F) but I am a full time college student, in my senior year, and in a difficult major (computer science). 

My mom is the textbook definition of learned helplessness, and is useless in high stress situations. For example: last night when I asked her to count how many guns are in the house, she said she was about to go to sleep and didn’t feel like getting out of bed so late. 

We are considering getting my dad committed because he refuses help. However, he’s the only source of income for my family so there is a lot to consider as far as how bills will be paid, etc. I also don’t know how to get the guns out of the house. I was ready to buy trigger locks but my dad has all of his firearms in safes that no one knows the passcodes to but him. One of them is reasonably small (so in theory i could remove the entire safe) but the other is a 5’ tall shotgun safe. 

I have fought tooth and nail to be successful despite my shitty upbringing with my mentally ill parents. This is my toughest semester ever, and now I have the hardest personal situations of top of it. I just don’t know what to do next. I have a wonderful therapist but he’s very expensive ($150 an hour) and honesty I just can’t afford to see him right now. I work as much as I can just to be able to afford to feed myself and live on my own. I’m drowning in responsibilities on all fronts and don’t even know where to start to fix this mess. Luckily, I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend who has been my rock. 

Normally i don’t advocate for adult children to clean up the messes of their parents but because my young brothers are involved and my mom will do nothing, I need to. I just don’t know where to start or how to manage college while doing all of this. 

tldr; dad, sole source of income for family, tried to kill himself. He needs to be committed. Mom is unhelpful and I fear for the safety and wellbeing of my younger brothers. I am a college student and don’t know how to juggle this with my extremely difficult coursework. ",29Jan2019,1
327,"Here’s the context :
My girlfriend is the nicest girl I’ve been dating. (I had terrible love stories until know. Ex gf cheating or using me, etc) She’s really respectful, funny and kind. We built an amazing relationship. And I’m her first boyfriend, so she tries really hard being nice and comprehensive when we disagree on something, and I myself try to be the best boyfriend she could ever wish for. (We’re both 24.) It’s been almost a year and we barely fight with each other. 

BUT.

Here’s the thing. Our mutual friends were her group of friends before I even came in. I was pretty much an outsider.
Now they are my friends too, but I still feel like I’m not part of the group. 
And it was fine at first. It’s a group of pretty decent guys and they didn’t excluded me on purpose.

But there that guy, who’s really nice and all, respectful when he’s sober. But when he’s drunk he tend to flirt with my girl. And it drives me mad ! They used to flirt and drunk-kiss each other when she wasn’t dating me. They see this as a game, but it drives me nuts that they didn’t stop doing that when I started dating her.

One night it happened at my place, while we were playing a silly game involving truths and dares. At first it was all fun, but then my girl started to say shit like she wanted to fuck him (answering a “truth” question) and later that night that guy kissed her again, but when the game was over. 

After that night I explained to her that that kind of games was making me feel uncomfortable, and that I didn’t wanted us to play to that ever again. She was disappointed but she agreed. 
She asked me a week after that if she still could kiss people at parties, because it was “fun”. I told her that it was making me jealous and she didn’t asked again since.

I asked about that issue to another guy of the group, he told me “it was all in good fun” and that I had nothing to worry about. But he used “they were drunk” as an excuse and it pisses me off. Same go for my girlfriend, she told me once “I can promise you that I won’t kiss someone else if I’m not drunk”. I don’t get those stupid excuses. I’ve been drunk to the point where I can’t remember parties, but I never did or try to do shit I wanted to do if I knew it would hurt someone.

All of this was pretty much a long time ago, so I stopped acting jealous for a while.

But recently we’ve been to a really small party, we had a few glasses of rhum, and I heard that guy telling shit about my girl to another guy-friend. 

And I know it’s dumb to get mad because of this, because I didn’t heard any of the conversation. I heard him say my girl’s name and a “don’t tell her I said that” while giggling like a dumbass. My girlfriend came in then, all giggly, like “WHAT DID HE SAID ? JUST TELL ME”

And it drives me nuts ! I don’t know what to do. I know I’m insecure. I don’t know if I’m the crazy jealous guy who just obsesses over shit, or if I’m right to be angry. I feel like they think not being in the wrong because they used to do that before I even came in. Like I had no importance whatsoever in that goddamn group. 

It’s been a long time since the kisses. It’s really that detail of a conversation that makes me think that, unlike I thought, that drama isn’t over.

They talk to each other almost every day and have known each other for about 5 years. He’s important to her.

When I see some of my exs I stayed friends with, I know that she can be a little scared too. But she trusts me so she never even talk to me about this. 

So, yup, I need advice. I don’t want to talk to her about this, because we already did in the past and I was already feeling like I was the one who was crazy.
And since I’m just bothered by a piece of conversation that happened two weeks ago, I actually feel crazy. 

Am I crazy ?

*Short :* My girlfriend used to kiss one guy when drunk, that guy keeps being inappropriate when drunk. Friends say it’s okay since they’re drunk and just friends. I start obsessing over it. What should I do ?

328,"First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.

TL/DR I'm in love with my sister and it's causing a rift in my family.",29Jan2019,1

330,"I've had a very long, intense battle with my mental health, and while I feel like I (mostly) came out on top, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now, and could really use some advice. Sorry guys, this is going to be a long one.

I was recently diagnosed with a slew of mental disorders, PTSD being one of them. I started receiving treatment (therapy and medication), and I felt like the fog started lifting. Overall it's been very positive experience, but it's also making me acutely aware of how 12 years worth of my life has been a spectacular shit show of a wreck. It's *really* starting to make me panic, and I'm worried that I'll never pull myself out of the hole I made when I younger, and incapable of getting help.

I made a lot of stupid moves education and finances wise in frantic efforts to get away from a bad situation, but now I'm a 28 year old woman without a driver's license, who's only a little over halfway through her bachelor's degree, in debt, has no savings, and no solid marketable skills. I've got 14 years worth of customer service/admin experience under my belt, 2ish years of management experience, and I taught myself some graphic design. I've got great references, but it hasn't really helped me land anything that gets me more than 20 hours a week on minimum wage in all the places I've drifted to in an attempt to stay away from said bad situation.

I had a scary close call health wise, which led to a meltdown in my physician's office, which is what led to me unloading, which eventually led to my diagnosis. After that happened, I was encouraged by my therapist to move out of the apartment I was living in. I could barely afford it after I started having these health problems, I knew no one in town, and had 0% support. I moved halfway across the country to stay with family. They're great, but I live somewhere rural, and I haven't been able to make the progress I was counting on being able to make so I could try and move on with my life (driver's license, getting a new therapist because yay insurance problems, getting a steady job, etc.) 

I desperately want to go back to school and finish my degree. I excelled there, and made a lot of personal and professional progress while I was enrolled, but I grew up a military brat. My dad retired and brought us to the last place I wanted to be when I was in middle school, and there's a billion complicated reasons why I can't go back to that area to go to school, two of which involves the bad situation that I'm steering clear of.

I thought I should stick it out where I am, get residency, and go back to school here, but I feel like I'm burning rubber, sinking back into bad habits, and not getting anywhere in anything. It's been nice reconnecting with extended family, but I feel like I don't belong here. It would be easier if I had the independence of having transportation, but that's just not happening. My goal was to have my license three months ago, but a major car accident that totaled the car I was using to get that done (not my fault, thank god) happened, and so did life. The people who said they could help me get my license got busy. I don't resent it. I can't expect my family to drop everything they're doing to help me turn into a functional adult, but I can't keep only getting out to drive once or twice a month, and I can't keep only working these part time jobs if I ever want to get out of debt and get a move on.

I feel like I keep trying to claw my way out of this hole, but I'm only pulling more dirt over my head. I don't want this to be what my life amounts to. I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm humiliated by my entire life and what's brought me here. If someone could give me advice, *any* advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",29Jan2019,1

For the first 3 weeks I worked around 40 hours overtime until 11pm cause the work load was simply overwhelming and a 3 person job. 3 weeks later my boss hired another person (let's call them Kitty), they are always showing up late and hangover, smelling and looking like a bum (every day of the week), they were tardy, lazy, always on their phone or outside smoking etc. you get the picture. Because of this I always had to stay longer or work twice as hard to finish their and my assignments (if their assignments were not finished I could not do my job). This continues for 3 months. They got this job cause their sibling has been working for our parent company for 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Forward 4 months my boss hires another person (let's call them Jack) for our position without notifying us or introducing us to them so I made them feel welcomed and showed him what needed to be shown. Thanking heavens that I will finally  have someone to take some workload off of me. At this point I am exhausted (physically and mentally and my health has gone to nonexistent) working long hours (without overtime pay) and a job for 3 people.

Everything starts being good, my hours are finally okay, I have some time to rest and do my hobbies outside of the work, and see my friends... and Jack expresses his hatred towards Kitty as well as the rest of the staff. Kitty is oblivious to all of it.

A month goes by and my boss invites me into his office and offers me a demotion and a pay cut. I tell him no and have a serious conversation with him where he pretends he did not notice my improvements and good job and Kitty's tardiness. I decline it and tell him to fire me if he still wants to do this. I go through psychological hell that day and night. Come into work tomorrow and he tells me Kitty got demoted and that he heard from other coworkers how much I did for this company and he wants us to be the best team.

&amp;#x200B;

Work is okay, but every week my boss plays mind games with me similar to the one above.

In a month I ask for a raise. He gives it to me but says it will begin with the begging of the new year. I accept it.

Mind games continue, I have now saved thousands of dollars for the company and helped make the workplace more efficient and made countless improvements as well as give training to my subordinates and coworkers in order to make their job easier and faster. My boss likes it and congratulates me because of it. But continues to make my job and my time at work horrible. He gives me one positive and then 3 negatives.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel exhausted from all the psychological bullying, from physical work I have to do and unhappy with my job and my life. I do a SWOT analysis of quitting and conclude that I will quit come January 1st.

But on December 31st this motherfucker fires me for ""structural changes"" and says he can't do anything about it cause his bosses said he needs to do this. I took it calmly and ask him for a recommendation letter he says of course. I continue working the same as before and continue contributing in improvements etc. a week in he says he won't give me a recommendation where I talk with him for half an hour and he said he will think about it for a few days. He employs another person in my position but Jack is tutoring him.  A week later I ask him if he came to a conclusion about my recomm. letter and he gives me a piece of paper with 3 words that describe me (smart, hardworking and fast-learner), his name and phone number. One more of his mind games. I can't give this to anybody!! So I ask Jack if he is willing to write me a recommendation letter he says he'll do it with pleasure.

8 of my subordinates quit when they were informed I was fired and tell me that I have done so much for this company and if they treat their best employee like this that they have nothing to do here.

My boss gets angry and gives me only 2 instead of 6 people in my team which means I have to stay late again and work my ass off to keep the company running. And now I am at the end of my patience and sanity.

I have two more months of my 3 months notice and I am just broken. Can I just show up to work, do a bit of it and then watch netflix? Can my boss do anything to me legally if I do that (there are cameras everywhere)? Cause I have been FIRED and my boss is just playing games with me making my life worse every chance he gets.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I have been nothing but a model employee but my psycho boss likes to twist my mind and make my job and life a living hell. I have been fired but am still doing my job amazingly. He keeps messing with me. I still have 2 months to work off. Can I just show up and watch netflix and what can be the consequences for that?",29Jan2019,1
332,"I have a recent issue with a roommate that I was hoping for some outside perspective on. In order to get the proper picture, I will attempt to explain as logically as I can. 

Recently, one of my roommates, who we will refer to as C, spent a couple of weeks in a behavioral mental health facility. She only told her boyfriend of her whereabouts, with instructions to “text her” if we wanted to know more. Texting her proved pointless, as they locked up her phone. She’s attempted suicide twice before. She’s been diagnosed as bipolar, chronically depressed, and with an anxiety disorder. When she returned, she declared that they did not find her to be bipolar, but instead suffering from medication-resistant depression and chronic suicidal ideation. She made a couple of friends while there, and she stated before she came home, she’s like one of them to come live with us to get back on his feet. We’ll call him D.

D was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder as well, and is a freshly recovering alcoholic. I had my misgivings. In this house already, there were 4 of us, including C, her boyfriend, a mutual friend, myself, plus C’s dog. I have lived with alcoholics before, both using and recovering, and both had been very unhealthy for me. We were given less than 4 days notice that D would be coming, and when I expressed that I did not want him to come, C responded with claims of feeling untrusted. I relented against my better judgement because I did not want my previous experiences to close the door on someone in need.

D and C joined us a week and a half ago, and due to the rest of us having jobs, we’ve not had much communication. Mutual Friend, C’s Boyfriend and I had terms of the stay to outline, but I’m not sure they were ever communicated, because all communication with C must be filtered through her boyfriend so as not to trigger her. D and C have had a seemingly wonderful time, smoking lots of weed, watching TV, sketching, and coloring. Another friend of theirs, M, comes to watch movies every couple of days. They also met M in the hospital, and I know nothing about her, other than what I’ve already mentioned. 

I got home tonight from work, and played some online games with a friend until he went to bed. I came out of my room to M, D, and C, pulling out the sofa bed in our living room, declaring they were having a sleepover. This made me pretty angry, to say the least. I also have an anxiety disorder, and do not deal well with unannounced changes. I bit my tongue again. This is the third time in less than two weeks that a change was made, with either minimal input or no input from myself, and with minimal or no heads’ up. I am through being compassionate or understanding. It has seriously affected my sleep schedule, my stress levels, and my work performance. My question to you, Reddit, is how to proceed? 

I know what my renter’s rights are, and I am aware I can get the landlord and the police involved if I need to. I’m asking for advice on how to proceed with my portion of it, prior to going with those options. I am ready to burn bridges with everyone involved at this point.",29Jan2019,1

334,"Hi everyone,

I've been binding books for years now, slowly learning from my mistakes.  I thought I might try to sell a few on Etsy or some similar website but honestly I don't know if it's worth the trouble.  Would any of you actually buy a hand-bound book online when you can buy books for pennies at any shop?

I can also bind printed manuscripts and repair broken books - but again, there are many places to professionally print up manuscripts via machines with practically no errors - and broken books tend to be chucked these days, right?

I guess what I'm asking is: should I try to monetise my hobby or save myself the trouble?  And if I do go for it, what should I focus on?

Thanks all

335," What will you do if you find out that your SO is a scam artist and had cheated people out of their money? I somehow found his online accounts where he was creating sob stories and people seemed to believe him. It was also probably he was a real master at it because it was a long con over a few years. Some people actually lent him 3 BTC for him to restart his life and now he has disappeared from the face of the earth. When he was with me he never seemed to have money, and I don't know whether he managed to convert the btc to money or not. But he did ask me to create an account with those bitcoins converter sites (sorry I'm a real noob about this) - but I don't know if he could withdraw some money before. I would know, right? Because the name at the site should tally with the name in the bank account? 

He was on the run from the police, though I don't know the exact reason, I don't want to go to the police and let them know I have a connection with him. And he used to be afraid to have money in his account and when he went to withdraw money in the event that someone transferred money to him, he would go to a crowded place and different atms everytime. He was always paranoid that someone will catch him while withdrawing money. 

Now the people he cheated seem to have accepted the fact that he cheated and vanished. I can't do anything about the btc because I can't help them get it back. But should I contact them and tell them I knew him in person? ",29Jan2019,1

344,"Context
I have been working for this company as a software developer intern for 2 months (the contract is for a full year). I will be getting my BSc degree tangible document in April. I am earning $480 a month. I have been doing website testing these past two months. I have a meeting with my senior soon where I will hopefully be assigned to some development work. I am a competent developer and I at least match my colleagues.

Problem
My father has been supporting me financially. I will no longer receive his support in April. I will not be able to support myself on my current income.

Suggestion
I want to ask for a raise (regardless of title change) in April with my degree in hand. But to do that, I am planning on showing them I am worth a full salary the months before April. I am planning on asking for around $1500 a month.

Concerns
What if they say no? Do I find a new job? I am happy at my current job. Looking for a new job will be time consuming atm, but doable. I do not see how the company can deny my request after proving my worth after 4 months.

Primary objective
Earning $1200 a month by April",29Jan2019,1
345,"My [M26] roommate [M30] was in the bathroom for a long time tonight and I really had to go to the bathroom so I waited quite a bit. Once I heard his door close to his bedroom I went in and sat down quickly on the toilet seat cause I really had to go. I felt something on my leg that was sticky and looked down and saw cum on the seat. I got up quickly and wiped it off my leg, and looked closer. It was on the front of the lid and dripping down the front of the toilet bowl. I felt super gross. I wiped it up and messaged him. “Hey I’m pretty sure I just sat on your cum. Next time please clean up.” 
He responds “I promise you it wasn’t cum bud, but got ya.” 

I say back “I mean, it definitely felt like cum, I’ve felt pee before. But if you insist you didn’t, and just missed the bowl. Still wipe up.” 
And he just sent a thumbs up emoji.

My question is, why would he lie? Just say sorry, right? It kinda made me angry that he lied cause it’s like... I’m not dumb dude.  
My second question is should I have a conversation with him about it or do you think he got the message?

Last semester, a guy admitted to cheating on an exam and was subsequently turned in. I had nothing to do with this, but because of unfortunate circumstances, someone in the class who was not fond of me spread a rumor saying I 'ratted' the guy out. The rumor spread further, saying that I had also 'ratted' on everyone around the alleged-cheater. This could not have been further from the truth, although I was never able to clear my name since holidays commenced almost immediately after all of this. 

One person I was friendly with before this whole thing transpired now does not speak to me at all.

I applied for my dream strip club to work in at my town and got rejected. I’m a young woman in my early to mid 20s, I have a good body with small to medium boobs and a good ass. I thought I must be decently attractive overall, guys tell me I’m good looking often and when I worked as a private party (visiting peoples houses for parties) stripper I was very popular and often got paid for more lapdances more than the other attractive girls I worked with.

When I asked them why they said that it was about my overall appearance, that my overall body tone and grooming, makeup etc wasn’t on point. Is it wrong for me to want to try to improve my appearance because of what they said? I want to be able to work there. Looks aren’t everything but still important to me 

Also I can appreciate the criticism and there is truth to what they said, but I have seen some of the dancers working there and in all honesty I don’t think they’re more beautiful than me and beauty is subjective to a degree. Maybe I’m wrong and everyone could see I’m way below the standard there.",29Jan2019,1
361,"I'm a 20 y/o male and I have been dealing with this issue for more than 6 years.

Throughout the day, I'll get these negative thoughts that refuse to leave my head. They usually fall under the categories of vast generalizations, jumping to conclusions or unreasonable comparisons. Seldomly, I'm fine with that. I have started to come to terms with the fact that my brain could be an asshole at times and that I can gather sometimes enough reason to not trust whatever it's telling me. 

However, what bugs me the most is that, most of times, engaging with these negative thoughts could almost seem tempting. By choosing not think about the stuff that's spit out by mind in its dipshit mode, I get the feeling that I am missing out on something. Maybe I'm not taking into consideration this particular thing when thinking about whatever I'm doing with my life. Maybe I'm not working my mind enough etc... Basically, I'm left with guilt.

In hindsight, the conlusions that I come up to when giving up to the endless cycle of overanalyzing things turn out to be unreasonable most of the times. When I look back at some of the reasoning I made, it seems laughable and I cannot understand how I could allow it to leave me in an unpleasant state of mind. But still, I cannot bring myself to realize how unnecesary it is to engage with these negative thoughts each time they arise.

It's worth mentioning that, during these last two years, I've become more capable of suppressing them by keeping myself busy with work or my hobbies whenever I have spare time. However, this is, either not always the case and I end up giving up or I find myself emotionally/physically exhausted from pushing them away even when I haven't done much during the day.

I always stumble upon advices on how to deal with my issue. And while they seem helpful, a lot of the time they can make things worse. For examle: when I force myself to do my hobbies in my spare time, I end up hating them for a while and refuse to do them for weeks because they're not as spontaneous as I like them to be. Walking while listening to music, although helpful before, doesn't seem to be helping anymore as it only adds physical  tiredness on top of my emotional one.

Also, I've also seen that going out with your friends is helpful. It's worth mentioning here that I'm an introvert. Not in the sense that I lack social skills; I think that I can relatively keep a conversation going. But in that I have a ""social battery"" that needs to be recharged with some time alone that I value a lot. So as a consequence, as my ""battery"" level drains, my capacity to resist the ""temptation"" slowly decreases until the social interaction becomes an unpleasant experience instead of a refuge from whatever I was running from.

What I'm getting at is that my methods can be helpful at a certain bearable level of negativity. However, at other levels, these methods can be a hindrance and not serve me any benefits. I feel that I've been locked into this cycle for a long time and that it has been in the way of doing pretty much anything. Maybe I'm locking myself into another mindset with how I'm analyzing it in this post which is why I'm really curious to know what you guys/girls think about it and maybe you could share your experiences. (I'm willing to give more details if asked)

**TL;DR:** My mind acts like an asshole most of the time. I'm constatnly in a fight to resist the temptation of the negative thoughts. Sometimes I win but end up feeling exhausted. Other times I lose and I'm left feeling like shit.",29Jan2019,1

Currently I'm 25 years old living on my own and studying. It's my second studies. The issue is that I never knew what to do later on. My first studies I picked because I heard a friend saying he wants to study that. I stopped 3 semesters in. These studies I picked because my sister suggested it after I been doing nothing for a full year. At first it was fun but now I'm in my 5th semester. I don't have any friends at all here, I don't know how to make any. I wake up every day around 14:00 and I have issues even leaving my house. Before this week I haven't been to university in 3 weeks. I just idle every day away hoping something good will happen to me eventually. I know that I have only myself to blame for this situation but it is so hard to get myself to do things even though I know I have to. I feel this is also related to the fact that I am not sure if this is the right path of studies for me. When I go out I find myself clenching my teeth and trembling in anxiety just wanting to get back home as fast as I can. I went to university yesterday and just 2 hours were too much for me. It's pathetic I know. 

I thought about going to a psychatrist but I don't know if that would even help me. The solution to my problem is finding a purpose in life I feel but not even I know what that is. I been thinking that it would be fun to be a pilot. I loved to fly as a kid, to travel the world. But my eyesight is bad so I need glasses, and I'm bad at maths and physics so I figured that's an out aswell. The biggest issue for me is that I can't talk to anyone about this situation because if I don't want to do one thing it's disappoint my father who heavily supported me financially and getting me all kinds of opportunities. I have been one of the better students in my first 3 semesters but I haven't done anything since and I barely achieve low average right now. I know this won't go good for long. I haven't done anything for university since a year or more. 

I have also been thinking about death a lot recently, but I couldn't do that my family wouldn't be able to bear it. There has been more than enough tragedy recently for them..

367,"TL;DR: Is a bad commute worth relocating your family? 

35/m with wife and two kids, living in a suburb of NYC. 

Need to know if I’m crazy or not. Love my career and the people I work with. But now that I’ve moved out of NYC to the suburbs, reality is settling in. It takes me two hours to get to work on a good day, and costs around $600/month for train/parking/subway. I have absolutely no free time and barely see my kids during the week.

I’ve been commuting like this for 3+ years, and there’s no end in sight. I’m really starting to feel suffocated, like another brick in the wall, just another dude with a soulless commute. In my 20s I swore I’d never let that happen.

So here’s my question: Is my own personal dissatisfaction worth a change? Or should I just do what dads have done for centuries and just suck it up and deal? 

My options seem to be A. Find a new job or B. Relocate. I do really like my job — it’s with good people in the exact field I want to be in. But opportunities tend to be limited outside of NYC. 

As for relocating, my kids are not yet in school, so uprooting is not an issue yet. But my wife is a different story. She hates the city and grew up in the town we currently live in. “Where to live” has been our original issue dating back to the early days of our relationship. She’s not open to any changes in this category. 

I know there are people who have done way more than 3 years of long commuting. I see all that grey hair on metro north. Do I need to just deal with it? Or should I attempt to improve my quality of life somehow? Is it selfish to want to improve my own situation when I have a family?

368,"we work together. we also work with his ex girlfriend, who is totally not over him (and i don’t think he’s over her either). they dated for three months and immediately after they broke up was when we started hooking up. it’s been about two weeks. 

i’m okay with everything’s that’s happened. i don’t feel guilty when i’m around his girlfriend and my time with him has been hella fun. but within the past few days, she’s been openly expressing her confusion for why they broke up and he’s been speaking to me less. there’s a small part of me that’s feeling jealous (which i know i have no right to feel) but most of me is just confused. 

do discontinue sexual things until he’s finished healing? do i proceed as usual to save both of us from feeling super awkward about a weird hiatus in our relationship? should i encourage him to mend things with his ex? do i stay out of it and distance myself too? mostly i’d feel comfortable asking him these questions, but he’s been avoiding me so...

whenever he and i discussed our rELatiOnsHiP, it’s always that we’re friends first and fuck buddies second; but, even as a friend i don’t know what to do right now. i tried to offer my help the other day but he totally blew me off and lied to face multiple times about being okay. he doesn’t owe me anything, but it feels a bit disrespectful. like, damn dude i put your dick in my mouth and now you’re gonna give me the cold shoulder.

369,"So let's just say that I need some help from both my professor and my therapist and neither of them has responded. Both situations are causing me a lot of stress. Specifically, in regards to my therapist, all I did was ask her via email if we could focus on a different issue for my next therapy session and if I could explain the issue further via email. And nothing. For one of my college classes, I unfortunately missed 2 straight classes due to transportation issues that couldn't be controlled by me in any way. In addition, I have ADD so I needed to email my professor a letter proving written by the disabilities office of my university. I apologized for missing classes in my email and just asked her if I could meet with her in person to discuss my accommodations solely for that class. No response at all. It's really discouraging to be in a position where I feel like my problems aren't worth their time. I'm not even doing anything wrong. Any suggestions on what I should do?

 I really want to switch to cj. The classes look fascinating and I'm not sure about my ability to counsel addicts. I love science and have trouble with abstract concepts.

The issue is that I've been at this for close to a year, and if I switch again I would be starting from zero.

Just for info, my school offers a limited number of online majors. I have no interest in business, education or nursing.

I would like to become many things and none of them require this last year in school and I don't want to go university. I live in New Zealand so there is a system in schools called NCEA which counts levels of qualifications, I have level 2 of the 3 levels of qualifications. If I choose to go this year I have the chance to gain the level 3 qualification. These qualifications can help getting different kind of jobs depending on what level. Also I go to a private school and I don't do any extra co-curricular activities. My parents are completely open to what I want to do in life and will support me no matter what I choose but I either have to work or go to school. If I choose to not go to school next year I want to get a job to earn money but ultimately be working on my future aspirations in the spare time. The most realistic jobs is becoming a professional wrestler or holding some sort of job in music whether that be a producer, engineer or an artist. Professional wrestling and music are my two biggest passions in life and I don't invest anymore time and energy into anything else. I think if I was to go to school this last year it would be a waste of time as I would only be going to get the level 3 qualification.

Next day she just doesn’t want to talk about it.. gets salty when I bring it up. So I leave it, hangovers and all. Fast forward today and I bring it up again, she says she’s got a message from the guy who gave her some unidentified pill which clearly messed her up.

380,"Unfortunately, my past with these two has been awful. 

My dad put us against our mom looking back when I was 12 and my sister was 14, so we wanted to live with him. When we finally did, it went downhill. 

He constantly talked about my mother at the dinner table, to the point where it was every single night in his drunken stupor in front of his current wife and I, at 15, had to tell him to cut it out. 

My father would force me to call my step mom my mom. If I said “she” in a conversation, like “she said _____” he would ask “who’s she?” Even though he very well knew. If I called her my step mom (I did this once by accident when talking about how I introduced her to a friend - big mistake) she texted me from upstairs saying she now knew how I felt about her and a ton of other terrible things. My father would say she was more of a mother to me than my actual mother who I was not able to talk to for four years. 

They would go through the numbers I was texting on my phone when I was in high school. If it was her number, as I tried to talk to her a couple times, they would confront me. Even after I moved out, they insisted I keep their phone and continued to look through the numbers and ask me about it when I texted her, still trying to keep me away from her. If I asked if they were looking through the numbers I was texting, they’d say “no it was just a question” and act innocent. 

My dad would tell me I was the favorite and the prettier one, and would pit my sister and I against each other. He would make it so, if one daughter wasn’t “home enough” he would chit chat with the other until, when the one not being home came home, the whole family was absolutely terrible to that person. That person was usually me.

My father would accuse me of always lying. He’s say he wished he could hit me. He called me a whore at one point. Because I wanted birth control, he was screaming and yelling that he wasn’t going to pay for his daughter to be a whore. It was ridiculous. 

It came to a point where I wanted to go back to my mothers. I tried, but my own sister was willing to testify (never really had a stable home) about my step father, who is a loser, but life was a lot easier there and less negative.  She was in with dad and step mom, she was apparently promised to be spoiled when I was gone and when I came back, she hated me for it. We haven’t talked in four years. 

After that whole thing, I started exercising. I tried to become happier with the situation as much as I could when living there. Eventually, the emotional abuse started again and manipulation. He once told me he still loved my mother and asked if she would take him back which, after everything he did to me, was utterly fucking crazy to say. His wife would text me saying how, while I was in high school, I needed to get a job after they’d told me I could work in adulthood and understood school was important.  She would also text me nasty messages about everything I was doing wrong In my life and what I needed to do while she was up in the bedroom and I was downstairs. 

It got to a point where I would need to confront him about his behavior. I would confront her. But I, of course, never won. 

I finally left after my father printed out my college essay, drunk, and shoved it in my face. It was about my time with my mom. Even though the Court ordered it twice, he wouldn’t let me have contact with my mother nor see her without a ton of backlash and making my life a living hell. 

After I moved out for those above reasons, not much changed. My sister and I still don’t talk as she used everyone and manipulated everyone, even my grandmother. My step mother would text me first thing in the morning about everything I did wrong and whining that they haven’t been at my house but my mother probably has. It appeared nothing had changed after being in my own house. They hadn’t learned. 

I finally got sick of it and stopped talking to them. She called me AT WORK and stupidly asked me why. I didn’t handle as well as I could, but I basically just said I was sick of their constant manipulation and hounding. I was sick of them not apologizing and taking responsibility for their actions  but acting like it was my fault they did them. 

I finally was free and happier. A part of me missed them. It had been a couple months and then I made the mistake of going to my grandmothers to give her a Christmas card. She begged me to go to their Christmas and wrote me a card, over dramatic at that, that said “please come back to us.” Im sure my parents just made it seem like I had run away. I ended up going to their Christmas to make her happy since she isn’t going to be around forever. and my parents were there. They didn’t apologize but rather blamed it on their past. All these years and that’s all they have to show for it. 

I wanted to make my grandmother happy so I went on a day trip with them and talked with them. I regret it now. They act like nothing happened before. They call me “honey” which repulses me, and constantly trying to talk to me. I can’t let go of this anger that I’ve been holding onto for years. It has affected my life in a deep way and who I am. I am constantly struggling. 

So, any advice on what to do? I really don’t know what to do at this point. Anyone else experience something similar? ",29Jan2019,1

399,"Backstory

My mom divorced my dad when I (F 22) was 17 and my brother (M 18) was 13. We moved to a new town where I started college and my brother changed schools. We stayed in that house for five years and made so many beautiful memories. For us, the house was representative of new beginnings. In a way, it was our second childhood home. 

My brother moved back in with my dad when he was 17 with plans to join the Navy after high school. I relocated thirty minutes away to be closer to my job. Soon, townhomes sprang up directly behind my mom’s home and she felt that she was losing privacy. With her kids gone and no real reason to stay in that town, she got a townhome and moved closer to the city that we both work in. Things were good for a while. She loved the pool in her community. 
My brother comes to visit occasionally. 

Here’s where the regrets come in: 

My mom works from home most of the time and lives alone, so she’s alone the majority of the time. I try to spend the weekends with her as often as possible.

Two months ago her dog, who was her only companion at home, passed away. On top of that, my brother changed his plans and decided to go to the college in the town we used to live in. To further the issues, the home she moved into has had many issues like a malfunctioning HVAC system. 

She feels immense regret over choosing to move. If she had stayed, my brother probably would have lived with her and she wouldn’t have been alone. Our house there had no issues. Our house was also filled with great memories. Not to mention, that town had the best Mexican restaurant that we miss all the time. It also had a great park that we used to ride our bikes in all the time. 

She called me last night crying about it, saying that she wanted the old house back and that she had made a terrible mistake. 

What should she do to get over this? I hadn’t felt much sadness over leaving the old house until now. I feel like a hole is in my heart where that house used to be and I’m sure she feels the same. 

So what can we do to get over the remorse of selling that house? 

TL;DR: Mom sold the house that we had so many memories in and now feels that she made a terrible mistake.

400,I'm constantly messaging people from r/r4r and they are ghosting me. That's what all of them do for some reason. And over time I've become more desperate to make friends online.

401,"I haven't really knew my dad growing up from a 12 year old to now. I'm 20. We grew apart cause he wouldn't make an effort to come see me or even talk to me. My mom would always put him down and saying he ""wasnt shit"" etc. I kept defending him because at the time i didnt wanna believe that because he was supposed to be my dad. But after awhile of constant defending him I saw that it was true he doesnt make the time to come see me and I dont know why. Before I was born I had a older brother but he died due to a crash from a drunk driver. My mom didnt know she was pregnant with me at the time and found out soon after. When me and my mom were going to town one day she told me my dad didnt want me when my dad found out she was pregnant again. I feel like I don't know my siblings either because I dont go to my dads and visit them. It's weird seeing my dad and stepmom at my workplace. (gas bar) I dont know what to say to him and only say hi and thats all we pretty much say to each other. My uncle says he still loves me but I dont know it doesnt seem lik it. I dont want to grow up not knowing my siblings how can I grow up with them? How can I get a connection with my dad again? My dad came to my birthday a couple times but that was it. Now today it's weird because he has 5 other kids to worry about living with him all different ages so I just quit visiting him. Now my mom wonders why I dont want to see him or talk to him. My mom was also an alcoholic and abused me and my brother when we were younger but kept it our family secret because I didnt want my mom to get locked up. We had CPS Come check me out before at my school cause one of the teachers believed I was being abused but I said I wasnt when I actually was. The abuse stopped once I could fight back and finally stand my ground then they stopped. It was scary growing up at my moms because every day you didnt know when my stepdad and mom were gonna come home drunk start fighting and end up trying to beat me and my brother. It was always constant worry and I didnt know what else to do other than just ""live with it"". I've never expressed my thoughts this much before with anyone other than my first love. My mom said multiple times that she will quit drinking and even promised on my brothers grave and still continued to drink. She drinks every day but about 2 years ago she slowed down and doesnt get super drunk and fight anymore but still drinks wine every day. Sometimes she gets a little to tipsy at times but that's it.

403,"I'm two years behind in high school. I tried public high school, two different online schools, private schools and private tutors but I can't finish a year of high school. 

I love to learn but I don't know, when I sit down to do my homework, I feel so stressed and pressured and decide to do something fun instead (play videogames/watch movies) and in class, I feel dumb because I can't keep up or I don't understand and when I ask, the teacher gets mad at me for not paying attention. Like I said, I love to learn and I know if I'm passionate enough about a subject, I can succeed because I took a summer dive course and loved it, I spent hours researching different brands of gear and tips and tricks and I do the same with video games. 

I can't do the same for math and science and english. 

I've tried to finish, I even tried deleting all the apps on my phone and games on my computer to focus more but then I found myself procrastinating and doing house chores instead. 

I told my parents I was thinking about getting my GED (17 and in Texas, all I need is parent permission) and they told me I shouldn't. They don't think I can test well on my GED or even focus long enough to understand the material. They think I'll just waste time pursuing it. And it makes sense, I'm 2 years behind in high school. But I feel like right now, I can either get my GED or become a high school drop out. 

Other than failing my GED, they want me to have a high school diploma for college reasons. I know there's a difference between a GED and a diploma when it comes to admissions but I'm not aiming for university or a good college right now, I'm okay with going to community college because 1. College is expensive 2. I'm not 100% sure I know what I want to do 3. I don't want to go to college, spent $$$ and fail again. 

I know everyone will say stuff like 'follow you heart/do what you want to do' but right now, I really need someone to support me, to believe in me. Everyone I talk to about this tells me I should continue with HS and not stray from that or that a GED will be worthless. ",29Jan2019,1

She wanted to use those memes that I made and file a criminal complain. She didn't do that. We made a peace and we were good friends again. After a while, she started to use me for her own wills.

Can I use those screenshot about me getting beaten up for my defence?(I also have screenshots of conversations about her having a sex and drinking when she was just 13 y.o. ) Is there a legal way, I can prevent her from filing the complain and making her in the same position as I am?

407,"First of all, sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom (56f) going through a hard time. 

She and my dad (59m) never really got along, and even though they ""separated"" about 10-12 years ago, neither of them moved out of our house, my mom because she didn't have the money to rent an appartment and my dad i really don't know why, i guess because staying was the easiest thing to do.

For some years now, my dad has been living a single man life, he mainly focuses on his job, his friends and attending social meetings, my mom even told me he's been seeing someone for over a year now and that he's already been with her in some family reunions me and my brother (15m) have not attended. Still he's never spoken about it with me nor my brother. (*I don't have a problem with a separated man going out, but i think that from the moment you have children, they have to be your priority, and because of the strange situation in my house (both of my parents living there) i think the least he could do was telling us first instead of having to know about it through family members)* 

Meanwhile, my mom has been taking care of the house, looking for a stable job (she is a kindergarten teacher but she graduated in her early 30s and had to stop working when my brother was born, so it hasn't been easy for her) and looking after my grandparents (my grandma had cancer a few years ago and my grandpa is almost blind to this point. She's the middle of 5 brothers but she was in charge of taking care of her family since she was very young, that and not having much money are the reasons she wasn't able to attend univerisity until she was almost 30).

Fast forward and to this day, my mom has worked in many schools but for short periods of time because schools prefer younger teachers, my grandparents health gets worse every time and my dad just went on vacation to the US for 3 weeks, he told me and my brother he'd go alone but my brother heard him talking to a woman about going. 

Today he left and while my mom did know about his trip she didn't know when he was travelling. This whole situation has been too much for her, she is depressed, angry, frustrated... she doesn't understand why my dad can do whatever he wants while she's left taking care of her parents, looking for a job and just not enjoying life. She told me that she isn't happy with her life, that she'd prefer not being alive.

I don't know what to do, even though i know for sure she won't hurt herself, it really hurts me and my brother to see our mother like that.

I told her to ask for a divorce, but she told me that when I was about 6, they separated and they signed a document where my mom would get the appartment we were living in at the moment and stuff like a fridge, kitchen, etc. They got back together a year after and have not gone thorugh any legal process since, so my mom told me that if they divorce now, even though now we have a couple of houses, she would only get the appartment we were living all those years ago. I consider that totally unfair, for all the time and effort my mom put into our family.

I want my mom to be happy, i just don't know how, please any advice would be very appreciated.

Internship starts and I meet this girl, L, and we hit it off like crazy.  Like as in I haven't connected that fast before ever (I know it's played out) and I find her wildly attractive and UNfortunately she says the same thing, but she's seeing this guy and we are overly flirtatious etc (it never goes past that). 

So my fiancee leaves for 2 years to go to school around this time and in my mind I'm thinking ""o this was meant to happen"". We clearly are connecting so quickly etc God's plan etc. Long story short she basically goes with him, they had been together for 11 months and he proposes QUICKLY after she starts talking about me. Well I completely misplay that news, instead of being happy I'm wierd and put off by it. She cuts me out completely (I don't blame her).

I have a guy friend that I met through mutuals through hangouts with my friends etc. I met him like 2 months ago but we never talked a lot until recently.

After playing a few times, he adds me on social media etc. And nowadays he dms me everyday with morning, or goodnight, and asks how my day was, so basically we chat everyday lol.

Recently, he asked if I wanted to go to the movies, I said sure bc usually we make plans with a big group of friends, so I ask ""let's ask the others?"" And he says, ""The others don't like horror movies, so just us two?"" 
I kind of panicked bc I'm socially awkward, so I go ""the more the merrier?"" And his ""excuse"" was, ""Its chill with less ppl."" 

I later then talk to my group of friends about it, and they suspect he likes me, even though I heard that he has a crush already? I ask my friends if they could please come along to watch it with us bc I don't want to be alone, they dont really like horror movies but they are considering it bc they want spy to see what happens xD

Basically this white friend put on a costume and pretended to be a black man, including “black face” makeup in high school for a class skit. This person did not know at the time but knows well now how offensive that is. The problem is that this skit was filmed and has been copied and distributed at least a few times in DVD form. 

The fear is that with increasing facial recognition everywhere someone is going to eventually put this video on the cloud and this person will be identified in this unintentionally offensive act. 

To add to this fear, this person works for a university and there have been a number of people fired from universities (and records forever tarnished) for this very act.

So, a bit of background, I’m 16 M, a sophomore in high school that isn’t really good at reading social cues. Now to my problem.

A couple of days ago, one of my friends, that I like, “asked” me to Sadies. Like any guy would, I was excited, but then I began to run through some calculations in my mind. She asked me reaallly informally and one of her friends jokingly did the same with another guy. So I was on the fence and wasn’t sure if it was real. 

So, I spent the entire day trying to figure out what I should do. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I should ask if it was real and go down the nice-guy route and say that I would be down to go.

Then it all went to hell. She said she was joking and I was pretty upset. I knew she would ask again because of that fiasco and I wasn’t really sure what to do. 

So now, a couple days later, I’m going to have to interact with her again (because of some club stuff). I don’t know what to do. I really want to try and mend that bond, but how should I go about that. Even so, is it really worth it?

I don’t have any job experience as I’m a freshmen in college so this would be my first job, which might limit my opportunities. 

I was thinking a cashier at target might be a good idea since you’re forced to interact with people as you’re scanning items and such. Another one is applying to like a store in the mall, since you always have to be checking up on the customers and kind of making sure they’re finding everything ok. I was thinking stores like Macy’s, Zumiez, Tilly’s, and maybe footlocker or finishline. A shoe store would also be really good because you get certain shoes sizes for people, while sometimes giving them recommendations and making small talk.

Those are some of the stores I can think of off the top of my head, but is there any I’m missing?

In a very large company that doesnt really care all that much about employees, only the ones in higher positions. But I'm having some home issues. My wife has health problems and we have a newborn daughter. Which lately has been causing me to call out a lot. (About once a week) and this is negatively affecting me at work because the people above me are all looking down on me hard for missing days. And management is starting to get pissy it seems. Even though I'm the only person they can get to consistantly work extra shifts and weekends. 

I've tried explaining to them that if I could only change to a different shift. I could be home to help my wife when shes at her worst. And could be at work during the time she has other people there to help. They just made up excuses. Then after I pushed and pushed. They finally said ok they'll do it...... soon. When is soon? Everyday I hear new things about how this other shift desperately needs people. And they cant get anybody to move shifts. But when I offer they give me some excuse about how we need to wait longer etc. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm gonna get fired If I keep missing days, but my wife has days where she really cant handle things on her own. Her health stops her. I've thought about applying to other jobs but the problem with that is I wouldn't make enough money to support my family (since at my current company I've had a raise). Other companies in the area dont start off at decent pay. Everyone around pays very very LOW. because they can, minimum wage here is extremely lower than a livable wage. $10/hr is considered good starting pay in most companies. That's HORRIBLE for someone like me who has a entire family and medical Bill's and multiple vehicles to pay for. This is why I work overtime regularly. I also make closer to 20/hr. (Less than 20 but closer to 20 than 10.) Thats what makes it so hard to leave. 

The only other job I know of that pays even better than what I make now. The hours are horrendous. On call 24/7 gone for days on end just to come home for 1 day and gone again. And that's something I really cant do. 

But besides that crazy job. Since I have no college education, and not a long list of work experience. I'm shit out of luck work wise.

I want to start my own business to combat this. But I dont have any money for start-up. And I dont know what to do as a full time business.

Digging through his old posts I found the dude was desperate for a relationship and so obviously they started dating again after being apart for something like 15 years.

He has a job with an airline and gets free flights, so she moved to be with him several states away from her sons.  What’s odd is from the moment she got with him, she stopped acknowledging the younger son.  I’m not even sure if this guy knows she has 2 kids.  The older son has some mental disabilities and other health issues and I half wonder if she only acknowledges him for attention.

Well, she goes a couple times up to visit that son, but then for awhile doesn’t mention him.  She goes on several trips, including 2 cruises and then announces her engagement.  A couple months later and suddenly she claims the father won’t let her see her son.  She puts up a crowd funding thing claiming to get money to get a lawyer so she can see her son again.

At this point I’m too curious and from a fake account contact the father and his new girlfriend and find out they have never stopped her from seeing them, she just stopped contacting.  Also found out that after things fell apart between them and he started dating the women he’s with now she got so upset she assaulted him in front of the kids and got arrested.  Did some digging and found the arrest online as well.

A couple months later she announces she’s pregnant and takes down the crowd funding which she raised close to $1000 for.  Now that her new kid is born she’s acting like this is her first child and everyone seems to be acting the same.  I’m just so confused how everyone who gave money just forgot she has another kid (well 2, but most of these people didn’t know her as long as I did to see the posts with both kids).

I feel like the right thing is to just keep my mouth shut cause if she’s that awful then her sons are probably better off without her.  I guess I’m just bothered that a mother could abandon her 2 kids and then have another and everyone acts like she’s this amazing person.

So, do I keep my mouth shut or use a fake account to tell all these people, who act like she’s so great, the truth.  The whole situation just bothers me.

I don't know what's missing. Maybe it's my perspective -- I think most people would probably kill to be in my position. But it honestly feels like time is just ticking by. All I do on the weekends is sleep, play games, or *occasionally* watch TV (which is rare, because I have roommates and I just don't like watching TV in the living room when they're around).

I don't want to do anything that's going to sabotage myself -- like quitting my job, just to wind up struggling to find minimum-wage work again, probably moving back in with my dad and his wife or something.

At the same time, though... I feel like my life is on a *very* specific track. And that track goes as follows: I continue working every day, I never meet anyone because I never go out and lack the time and energy to do so, and eventually I just die. I don't even think I'll make it to ""retirement"".

I cannot fathom anyone doing this shit, working 40+ hours a week, and thinking ""This is good enough"". As far as I'm concerned, I don't have any sort of ""life"". As the risk of sounding pretentious, I genuinely feel like a *slave*, that I lack any freedom to ""do what I want"". I don't even know *what* I want, but I lack the freedom to even explore the life around me.",29Jan2019,1

431,"obligatory apology for formatting, as i’m on mobile. there’s a TLDR at the bottom.

yesterday morning my friend (A) texted me and asked for an “emergency lunch”. we have a standing date every friday where we catch up, chat, all the things friends do. i have been to their house several times during these friend dates with no incidents of note. i had plans yesterday, so couldn’t make lunch, and offered a time the next day. later, A texted and asked if they could spend the night as something had happened, the police were involved, roommates had both left, and they didn’t want to spend the night at their apartment. they claimed to have no idea what was happening, as they had been gone the whole weekend, and asleep when the police were called. of course, having no additional information, i said yes.
i’m also friends with A’s roommate (L). i texted L, asking if she was okay and that i didn’t know anything and she didn’t need to tell me anything but that i was here if she needed me. several hours later (after i had already agreed to let A spend the night), she texted me back, saying not to trust A and that they were accused of rape. additionally, the third roommate (N) had allegedly attempted suicide and had called out to A for assistance (the word used was screamed) but A had ignored her.
i have an anxiety disorder, so you can imagine that all of this was fairly overwhelming to me. i texted A, and told them that i had spoken to other people (keeping the information deliberately vague) and that i didn’t feel safe having them sleep over. i told them i wasn’t accusing them of anything and i don’t know what happened, but that tensions are really high and until things have settled down i don’t feel safe having anyone sleep over. here, i think it’s important to note that i live with my boyfriend, (B) and that he is in agreement that he didn’t want A sleeping over.
a bit later, i texted A and offered a coffee meeting the next day or sometime soon. they have read this message but have not replied.
i don’t want to jump to conclusions and cut A out of my life without evidence that they did rape someone, but i also can’t ignore the fact that they’re accused of it. i don’t know what to do or who to believe or what to feel. mostly i feel unsafe, highly anxious, and overwhelmed by the whole situation. any advice would be appreciated. thank you.

For example, My friend was able to drag me out of my house a couple of weeks ago and we took a fun trip to Boston and hung out all weekend. That gave me the idea for my bf and I to go to Boston for the weekend and just have it be us together . I was very excited and it finally gave me something to look forward to. Unfortunately trip didn’t happen because of some work stuff and I was crushed, like very upset. My bf didn’t even care , seemed like he didn’t wanna go anyways. It just seems like he’s completely neutral. Like he doesn’t care if I’m around or not. I know he won’t break up with me but I hate feeling unwanted .

441,"TLDR: I don't want to hang out with this friend anymore even though she's technically been nice and supportive.

To add more details... I have a grueling full time job, come home and have a serious relationship, and have a pretty time-consuming volunteer commitment that I'm passionate about. I have some A level friends who are introverts themselves and and when we rarely hang out over some drinks or dinner to catch up, it's always as if no time has passed. I have this one particular .. friend.. who... always comes to support my activities and functions and who once brought me soup when I was sick (nice) but when we hang out 1:1, it feels miserable. and she's always planning for the next time we'll hang out too while we are already together. She has what I used to describe my beloved cat as having: a love tank with a hole in it. The time I give her is never enough although it feels like superficial, wasted time when we are together anyway. We have the exact same conversation every time we hang out. Word for word almost. It's like she has a book of questions to ask people which are socially acceptable. She brings up my work even though I've asked to not talk about it on the weekends because it's very stressful. She texts me good morning and good night and asks me to hang out every single weekend. I thought by saying no about 10 weekends in a row would do it, but it persists.

He's basically never done anything wrong, no drugs, no behavioral issues, gets mostly B's, etc. But, this year, even the tiniest mistake is severely punished. For example:

1. No phone or social engagement for a week because he forgot to read his little brother a bedtime story. His brother is 13.

2. No phone or social engagements for two weeks after he said goodbye to his girlfriend before she went on vacation, because he was supposed to break up with her because she's a republican.

3. Most recently, he missed ski practice because it was (ironically) rescheduled due to a snow day. The new practice wasn't put on the schedule, so barely anyone came, but his mom still said he can't hang out with friends or do any non-academic clubs etc. For a month.

He's really isolated and I want to help him out, but I don't want to make it worse. At this point he's resolved to just wait it out until college, but that's no way to spend your senior year, man.

445,"This april, I will have my first birthday where I will have no obligations to spend it with friends, significant others, family, etc. And hopefully it will also be my first good birthday. My entire life my birthdays have sucked, as a kid they sucked because my mom and/or step dad would always get overly stressed about whatever it was we had planned (even if it was just to have cake and presents with just the three of us) and would take it out on me; yelling, screaming, etc. Then, all of my birthdays after that were spent with whoever I was dating at the time. Which was never a good situation as I apparently have a knack for choosing to date abusive assholes.  
So, this year since I have no obligations to spend it with anyone, I want to do something on my own that I know I'll enjoy. But here's the problem: I'm disabled and I don't have a bunch of money to take off and travel. So that already takes off a bunch of options. On top of that, though, I'm not really one to enjoy a party or club, I don't want to stay home and do something because I still live with my folks and doing so will probably just lead to more screaming, I can't do anything that requires a lot of energy or walking (because I'm disabled), and the idea of a spa day just really doesn't appeal to me. So with a shit ton of options just magically gone, I have literally no idea what to do.   
I have a few months to plan though, so I figured I'd ask now to try to get some ideas rather than wait till its too late. What do you think I should do?

449,"I've been close friends with my friend, who we'll call ""S"" for the purposes of this story, for about three years now. Shortly after we met, S told me that he had served time in jail for possession of cocaine when he was 19 years old. He references this story a lot, and over the years I've known him, I have started to notice some fallacies in his story that make me very convinced that the entire thing is made up, or at least heavily fabricated, and I want to know what you guys think.

\#1: He claims that the time he spent in jail for possession of cocaine totaled six days.

\#2: He claims that he took a plea deal for a lesser sentence, but was not on parole and never had a parole officer. This would also likely be accompanied by a hefty fine, which he has also not spoken about.

\#3: He also claims that there was a jury present at his ""trial,"" which I don't know if that makes sense if you plead guilty to a charge (I'm 22 and I still don't know shit about the law, forgive me.)

\#4: There is absolutely nothing on the public record of his state that would suggest he went to jail or has ever been in trouble with the police. I've checked numerous places and there is nothing under his name.

\#5: There were apparently other people involved when he was ""caught,"" but has never mentioned that any of them got in any sort of trouble.

\#6: This sounds dumb, but this is just the kind of thing he would lie about. He recently referenced going to jail as the ""coolest thing he's done"" and I've caught him in other meaningless lies before. Would not surprise me at all if he decided he was going to tell me and other this because it makes him sound cool in his eyes.

\#7: He didn't have a criminal record before this incident that may or may not have happened, and I don't know what plea deal would give him six days in jail. He would be able to make bond because his parents (at least he says) are loaded.

\#8: He got into a great university after the incident and attended/graduated last year, but I have a hard time believing that the school would not find out about him serving jail time prior to attending their university. I didn't go to university so I have no idea how things like this work, but it's definitely a red flag.

452,"This might be an unusual question and I apologize in advance for how long this post is. And of course this is a throw away account.

So a week ago I received a message from a guy I used to know but haven’t been in contact with for over 3 years. He was talking about how he was recently preparing for a Christian mission trip to Mexico and that he wanted to share all of his experiences with me. This all checks out because I know back then he was extremely religious and did many experiences like this before so I know he isn’t lying. However, I know where this is leading to.

He’s going to ask for money or some support for another mission trip. It’s not that I don’t necessarily disagree with what he’s doing but I actually had a huge falling with the group I met him through initially.

Some background info about the situation:

The reason I know this guy is we went on a Christian ‘mission’ trip together 3 years ago through our church. We were amicable but I would not say we were close friends. Everyone else pretty much knew each other from a previous event and they would stick to themselves and I was essentially on my own most of the time. 

I had many bitter feelings about this for I confided with the group leaders that I felt uncomfortable and that they would help facilitate stuff but they never did. It’s bad enough to feel left out in a group but even worse when you’re in a foreign country and can’t speak the language. I shared a lot of very personal and vulnerable stories with the group like how someone we all knew sexually assaulted me so I felt very betrayed and misled. 

The entire group was 15 people and not a single one has attempted to reach out. I know an immediate response would be that I should’ve kept trying to reach out to them first and I did for the first few weeks but afterwards I was just so tired and broken.

I know that a lot of my feelings are being misdirected by the hurt I felt from the organization we were in but I really don’t want to stay in contact with this person and to eventually get the whole spiel to give them money for something I don’t believe in anymore. I don’t really want to tell him I don’t believe anymore because I feel it would create more drama and that they would start sharing this information within his group. I left the church after the trip too. 

I personally find it really rude or insincere to just out of the blue message someone after not speaking to them for years only to ask something from them. I would be more willing to listen to him or help if he asked if we could just meet up to reconnect or hang out first instead of this. He tried to sound as buddy buddy in the message he sent me as if we only stopped talking a month ago.

Should I just unfriend him or ignore the message? Or should I just tell them the truth that I don’t really want to help (but of course in a nicer way). What would be the best way to say that? Deep down I really want to say some things about how much him and the group hurt me and I won’t give them a cent but I know it’s prob not worth it. 

Does anyone else have any similar experiences and could give advice? Thank you for getting this far.",29Jan2019,1

460,"So, my coworker who has been there for a significantly less amount of time than me (she's been there for 9 months, I've been there for 1 year 10 months), a girl that I actually trained, has become increasingly unprofessional/hostile towards me. 

I work in leasing/property management, and, though my property does not have an assistant manager, the past two property managers and even our regional manager pretty much looks at me as that position. My property manager has even told prospects that come in that I am the assistant property manager. 

Well, my coworker, who is a leasing consultant (my title as well), and whom I trained, has become increasingly hostile with me - very rude/upset every time that she does something wrong or I try to give her a gentle reminder when I see she is about to do something wrong. She cannot take criticism whatsoever, it has been a constant conversation between my property manager and I. And to make matters worse, she also has still not gotten a hang of the everyday tasks of our job, so this is an everyday occurrence. She snaps at me and says increasingly rude things, and has even had yelling outbursts at me. 

In the past, at this job and others, I (23F) have been told I am very dry/direct/harsh, and I have always made an effort to not be that way, however this girl and I were actually very good friends (hung out outside of work at least once/week) for the first 7 months that we worked together. I told her on multiple occasions that if she ever thought that my tone was too harsh, please let me know, because I do not mean it to be that way. I am just a very direct person. 

Well, she has never been a good leaser (we do commission based work) and I am actually the top leaser in our entire company. I notice that her outbursts/rudeness hits its peaks whenever I have had a lot of leases and when she has had barely at all. An example is this month, I have had 10, and up until 2 days ago, she had had none. 

My problem is, I am not comfortable being bullied/treated unprofessional just because she's stressed out because she is not as good at her job that I am. I've talked to the manager, and we actually had a meeting between the 3 of us. However, she treated the meeting as if everything was my fault entirely - she even ended the meeting when our manager said ""we haven't really gotten anywhere,"" she replied ""well we won't go anywhere if she won't admit that she's the problem.""  How do I go about fixing this issue? I love my job for the time being (I am a student in college right now, but work full time at the property in the meantime before I graduate in the next 2 years), but I don't know if I will be able to put up with this much longer because it is impacting my overall happiness at work. Especially since I am very adamant about always being professional at work, so everytime she makes a snide remark or snaps at me I just kind of have to take it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My coworker is bullying me and I don't know how to go about making her act more professional towards me in the office.

462,"I've lived on my current house for about 10 years, since I was nine. Our landlord decided to build the house himself. He doesn't even live in the state, his daughter thats our neighbor is supposed to help manage the property. We share a fence to their backyard and it's clear that money isn't the problem when it comes to fixing our house. 

During my family's time there have been a multitude of problems with the house, especially with the plumbing. It's to the point where the basement shower had to be completely ripped out and the bathroom is no longer functional at all. 

Since we moved in, we've never had a working dishwasher. They tried to fix it for a short while before giving up. Nearly all the repairs have been done by friends or family. 

The main bathroom upstairs doesn't even have a shower, just a tub that doesn't work. The one half shower we have constantly clogs and the landlord keeps saying it's our fault. As if water and soap is too much for the drain to handle?

The upstairs shower is directly above my closet and when the shower clogs it leaks into the walls. It's done this for years and when I was cleaning last night I pulled an entire strip of paint from where the damage is the worst. On the wall is a strip of black mold that goes from the floor to ceiling. It's damaged the wall so badly that you can push on the wall and it feels like you could easily push it all the way through. The walls in the rest of my room also have cracks, and for whatever reason, wires sticking out of some parts of the floor. 

There are also two holes in the ceiling from water destroying it and falling through. There are always bits of plaster falling off. It used to be my sister's room but we had to switch because of her severe health problems and the mold making her sicker. I believe the mold is making me sick as well. 

On top of all these problems, our landlord has decided to raise our rent. I don't believe that if we're eventually about to move out that they should allow anyone else to live in this house. 

When it comes to these issues, especially the mold, how much responsibility does our landlord have to fixing it? I do have pictures and videos of how damaged the wall is. 

Also, is there anyway to make sure they can't have anyone else move in in the future? I can't imagine anyone else having to deal with this. 


TL;DR: The house my family's lived in  for 10 years has had severe problems with plumbing and there's black mold growing on my closet (along with other parts of the house). Our landlord has made minimal efforts to fix these problems and has done nothing in the last six years. How can I get this taken care of?",29Jan2019,1

465,"Hey guys. For context just for information I am a 24 year old male with a major in political science and a minor in business administration. I was also diagnosed this past October with high functioning Asperger's (social disorder). Now to begin. For the longest time now I have wanted to help people and in high school I figured out that I loved the political field. It would allow me to help tons of people and be able to have a positive impact on the world. However since I graduated college I have felt unfulfilled and I have not been able to find any legal or political jobs (Economist, Policy analyst etc.) literally anywhere. I also do have experience since I interned at the capitol building in Topeka Kansas and helped a representative with researching policy and a magnitude of other things so it is not like I have no experience. On the contrary I have quite a bit between my college experience and that. Since graduation I have been sort of supporting my wife while she graduated and now we moved to Portland Oregon so she could get her master's. These last 2 years I have gotten jobs to get by and even while searching in those jobs and here in Portland I have found squat. I have tried to reach out to my representatives here but the most I got out of them was to come down to the capitol and introduce myself. It is absolutely maddening. All I need is that first job in the field and I know I could handle myself fine. I lost my previous job here about a month ago now due to discriminatory issues against me and I really do not know where to go from here. I have tried looking on job boards, city websites, ""government jobs"" but it really just seems like it doesn't exist. It is to the point where it seems like the only thing I could possibly do is wait for an election and waste money to throw my hat in the ring and hope I get elected (with not nearly enough experience). All of this together just drives me nuts especially the fallacy of how our society sees work. You need experience to get the job but no one wants to give you a chance so you can never get that experience so you can never get the job. I have volunteered on campaigns before but I just hate canvassing so before anyone throws that out. So it is not a matter of me not having an internship or volunteer experience. I know this has been long winded but I kinda wanted to get all of it out there. If anyone could possibly offer any advice on what to do or where to go from here it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ",29Jan2019,1
466,"TLDR at the end.

First some context, I'm a junior in highschool and I'm currently 18 (didn't fail a grade but in a lower grade for personal reasons I'd rather not get into), the girl I'm gonna talk about in this is also a junior and 16 (I think, she could be 17 as well).

&amp;#x200B;

For about 5 years until just last school year I liked this girl (I'll call her M), before that point I had never gotten the courage to talk to this girl or really try with her but I had always thought she was attractive. Finally last school year I gathered the courage to talk to her, we became friends. Eventually I told her about my feelings and she essentially said that she wasn't looking for anything but when she was she'd see where things went with me. That time came, things seemed to be going okay but I ended up suffocating her and being just too much, so she ended up rejecting me and started dating another guy.  I'm not trying to be a ""nice guy"" here but this guy is an asshole (you'll see the reasons I think so in the next paragraph). if she had ended up dating someone good I would be happy for her, I really would! Even after all this time (almost a year now) I've not gotten over this girl and it's negatively affecting the rest of my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I think this girls boyfriend is an asshole are these: this girl has never had sex (she told me that much when I liked her) and is scared to do so with her bf but instead of comforting her and trying to make her feel safe he's just essentially saying, ""we should get it over with already"" to his friends when she isn't around, I don't actually know what he says to her about it but I've heard him say that stuff to his friends. Just yesterday I heard him say something like, ""Oh M's in a good mood today, maybe she's ready for the D."" That to me is reason enough but then there's the fact that he insults her right to her face saying stuff like, ""why do you always act like such a bitch"" when he knows she's having a bad day. He doesn't even care when his friends make sexual comments about his gf, he entirely overvalues himself, etc. We aren't really friends anymore (we kinda are but we talk very little) so I don't know if I should tell her about what her bf says or if she would even believe me or maybe even already knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to you are these: How do I get over this girl after all this time? Should I mention the stuff her bf says to his friends when she isn't around? I honestly just want what's best for her and I don't want her to force herself into doing something she doesn't want to do for anyone's sake, that includes my own, I understand why she didn't want to date me, it took me a while to figure out what happened but I did. I just don't want her to be unhappy.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Asked a girl about a year ago, got rejected. Still haven't gotten over her. Her current BF is an asshole for various reasons (things he says and does to her, read to find out what) and I don't know how to deal.",29Jan2019,1

477,"Hi there, 

As a kid, I always had trouble learning to read. Because I still had good grades, I was told I wasn't trying hard enough to read and was offered no help whatsoever. I did good at school by avoiding reading, I had tricks to not read the texts, etc. 


Anyway, when I ended up in college, I majored in anthropology, then it became harder to use ""tricks"" to avoid reading. I graduated anyway but with a bad GPA. I assumed it was partially because I had a depression, partially because I suck at reading. 
My depression got better shortly after and since I've been told I wasn't trying enough, I've been reading everyday since to try to be better at reading. 


I'm now 23, and I still feel like I'm not confortable to read as much as I should. This morning I was reading a book in my mother language for 40 minutes about linguistics, I only read 6 pages. 


Hence, I'm suspecting I might have dyslexia. On one hand, I do struggle to read, especially out loud. After reading for a long time, I feel mentally very drained (like after reading this morning, I had trouble focusing enough to play some stupid game on my phone).  

On the other hand, people always told me I'm not, I think I can spell ok and I can speak English as a second language. My pace of reading could also be normal, and I'm overthinking it somehow?


So I'd like to know if it sounds like dyslexia or not. If you had any advice about how to improve my reading, regardless of what my problem might be, I'd love to hear about it. 


On a side note, I'd like to add that I kinda want to go back to college. Either to get a master in linguistics and try to be a teacher, or to study to be a librarian. Beside not being confortable reading, I'm a huge nerd so I'm conflicted about this plan because I want to study nerdy stuff but feel like I don't have the capacities. I'm not really a ""physical job"" type of person.


Anyway, sorry for the length of my text. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks so much!  ",29Jan2019,1
478,"Hello Reddit
A bit about my situation 
I’m 22 years old and have been attending community college for about a year now. I have plans to transfer to a university in my state to finish my bachelors, and then eventually, my post grad. 
I’ve had a hard time making friends for a couple reasons. Mainly, my age. Most people in my classes are younger than me or much older. I don’t have an aversion to age gaps in my relationships, but what I do find is the issue is that my common interests seem to conflict. The people who are younger than I am(18-19)that I’ve tried to build friendships with, are very into the ‘college lyfe’ with drinking, partying, and smoking. That’s really not my scene. Most people who are older than me(30+) work full time and have kids. I’ve tried joining clubs, but the schedules always conflict with my class/work schedule. I have had some success with just talking to people in class but I have a tough time making that final step and asking people to hang out/for their number. 

TL;DR I’m a year into college, and haven’t made any real friends. I don’t really know how to, and the conventional methods aren’t working. ",29Jan2019,2

480," Right now, I currently live in a suburb and commute to the city for my job. I live in the suburbs because it is more affordable than city-rent, even with roommates it is a lot higher there.   


For the first year I was at this job, my commute was 2 hours each way. I've now moved a bit closer to the city (my rent is now higher due to being closer) and the commute is still over an hour each way. I wake up around 5:50am, get on a 7:00am train which takes about 1 hour and then I have to walk another 20 minutes to my office.   


I'm trying to make it work but the commute is absolutely draining me. I hardly get to see my family or friends, I don't have enough time to devote to a relationship and I'm not home enough to have any pets (I love dogs and want to rescue one from the shelter).   


The problem is, is that the company itself is good and the job pays well. I've already received pay raises while being there. Most of the jobs in my field that are available in my suburb will pay about $10,000 less in salary which is a big drop. The benefits that my company offers are also really good, which I'm worried about losing if I found a job with a closer commute.   


I'm very torn about whether I should keep sucking up the commute for my career or find a closer job so my personal life does not have to suffer.

486,"I have a couple of options right now and I feel like there are too many variables for me to weigh them out properly.  I have my girlfriend and family trying to make my decisions for me and all of their inputs are bias and self-centered.

I am currently working for a door to door insurance company which I enjoy half the time.  I made 22k last year while I was a fulltime student.  So I was in school full-time and only worked for about 4.5 months full-time.  With the insurance company I get residual income, so this year they will pay me an additional 5k before i work.  Next year it's an extra 1k, then 800 until it goes to 200 a year until people cancel.  This is all just from a year of barely working and it stacks on top of every other year i work.  I also get to make my own hours, work where i want and have almost everything as a tax write off.

I have an interview at td bank as a teller.  They would start me as part-time and move me to full-time after 6 months.  From there i could move to FA or above.  Typical FA at TD makes from 30-50k a year, and is a 9-5 job.  If i go for TD then i have to quit Combined, because somehow it's a conflict for an employee to work at both.  I wouldn't even be able to afford my monthly expenses if I only worked part time.  

I could work full-time as a RMT which would make around 50k a year, and do the insurance job on the side.  I just don't really enjoy the work, and it hurts my hands.  I have thought about personal training too but I don't feel like that industry is a suitable career for me.

I have a massage therapy diploma and work at a gym every Sunday.  This brings in minimum 100 a day and maximum 300.  I also perform treatments at home which brings in 200-500 extra a month.

So yesterday my girlfriend, who has only had sexual experience with men, mentioned casually how she has to really try to be aroused by men. 

She said that she doesn’t know why, and it might be because being with a woman isn’t something she’s tried and it’s why that’s what attracts her more. 

But regardless, it’s caused a lot of sexual insecurity for me very quickly. All I can think about is that she probably was forcing herself and really trying to be aroused every time we had sex. I lost my virginity to her, and I can say that I really truly love her. 

She said that she is emotionally attracted to me very strongly, but sexual attraction with men is something she has to work into. 

It makes me not even want to have sex now because I don’t want to be with someone who has to force themselves to want me in that way. 

I don’t know how to bring this up to her. But the fact is if this is what she really feels then I don’t want to be in this position and I’d rather just be friends.

But I occasionally get a call in the morning asking if I'd like to work a day shift day to fill in for soneone and I usually do it for extra $$. These last several times I've been asked to do stock room for the day and I really love that job!!! 

I called my boss back and told her I would accept working that day and she basically told me she'd be cutting my hours to only 4 instead of the full 8 because of a low number of nursing home residents at our place (so they cut my job hours in half) as they treat it like a business model. Now normally I have had help these couple times because I was new to stocking but now I'm doing it on my own. 

My aunt (assistant boss) would normally ask me how many hours I planned on staying 4-6-8 hours and I'd always do the full 8 hours. Then the next 2-3 hours I'm literally washing fan covers wasting time so that I can finally go home at 3:15 pm.

Back to previously what I originally said before getting carried away, each interaction I had with my department boss (not my aunt) she was a real asshole jerk to be around. I remember after putting away drinks/juices in the cooler I would turn around and see her checking to see where I put them and even opened up the door and said that I should be putting them in their separate crates instead of not wasting them and putting them in the next day's lunch/supper carts (to be used the next day), then when I reported a hostile work environment with one of my coworkers she told me about punching in too early for work so I told her that I wouldn't come to work until the exact time to start so I don't give them free labor (before that I would come into work 15 minutes early and work for free just like my work partner did because I was still new). 

It feels like a dead end union job that is a double edged sword to work for. I'd literally have to stay there 10 years to get any full time job/ benefits and I'm already tired of being poor while working this job and each job I bid on for full time is taken away because they have more union seniority. 



I'm not sure what to do? There's basically no way to move up unless nobody bids on that job and my own union seems to almost keep me staying poor because anytime I bid on a full time job in my department some other senior worker gets it and it's really just holding me back keeping me poor.

496,"So I have been getting calls for health insurance constantly. I just wanted to browse and see my options because I currently don’t have any but for the past few weeks I’ve been bombarded with emails and spam calls. 

I applied for a second part time job somewhere about an hour ago. I just had two health insurance people call me back to back, then a third person calls. I’ve been telling people this is no longer the number for the person they’re looking for. I was very adamant about that with the third caller, then he tells me he’s from the place that I applied to and he’s sorry and just hung up. 

So obviously I feel like a huge dumbass now. I didn’t expect a call from that place so soon and I normally get several spam calls at once and it didn’t even cross my mind it would be the place hiring. 

Should I just assume there’s no way for me to backtrack and possibly get an interview? I was kinda excited about possibly working there. ",29Jan2019,1
498,"Hello, I am completely new to reddit so I do apologize if my posts are awkwardly set up.

I have been in a server for a while that is dedicated to a children's game, I got involved in this game a while ago along with some friends to goof around on it and sometimes talk to kids who are obsessed with the game (They have the funniest things to say about everything lol) When I discovered there was a discord server dedicated to it I figured I would join to share artwork and chat! I got some of my friends involved in the discord server as well and we got along well with the owner. However, after a while we started noticing that one of the kids in the server (13) had entered a relationship with the 16 year old server owner. 

The server owner is not shy about telling everyone about their fetishes, sharing NSFW in a channel on a separate server where most kids are under the age of 14 and talking openly about wanting their ""Partner"" to be sexually active with them.

I have contacted discord support many times and I am sure they are looking into it. But is there any way I can talk to the child or server owner to relax the situation? I am starting to get pretty scared about the situation.

If I am overreacting you may tell me that too, but please be kind! Thank you!",29Jan2019,2
499,"Hello, I would like to share and at the end ask for any advice you guys have got for me. I don't have a good arrangement in this, so I am deeply sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

I (male) have a best friend (female) which is everything to me and I am everything to her. We don't love each other like couples do and neither of us have had any relationships with anyone before. In the past, there was a girl I deeply loved and cared about but she left me because I distrusted her a lot and now we don't even see each other so that doesn't matter. This girl, who is my best friend is really nice of a girl. Pretty decent and smart. We used to have (I used 'used to' because of what I will explain later) of living together after completing our colleges (in other words, after graduating) in some other country so that no one could find out that we are living together cause if they would, they'd think we are couples but we are not (Maybe my dumbness is being apparent to you guys. I am really deeply sorry for that). She used to say that I am the most important to her and she would never ever leave me for anyone.

But, yesterday, this girl told me that there was guy in high school which she still follows on IG and actually likes him and I was hurt to hear this. She used to say I am all what she has (i don't expect that girlfriend kinda love from her but...) and now she is saying she likes this guy. I mean she used to say that she would never leave me for anyone even if her parents tell her to get married. So, I yelled at her when I heard this from her. I simply asked, ""who is more important to you, me or him?"". Her reply, which wasn't answering the question, was ""You have no idea how important you are to me. I have never valued anyone more than you"". To be honest, that guy isn't even decent enough to be love by her (because she is a pretty decent girl). He is more of a jerk, and takes relationships as if they were something to spend time on for a while and once he is done with one girl, he looks for another (I know it all because I know that guy well). After hearing what she said, I said ""I could have never ever thought of getting someone even close to the place you have in my heart."". Then, I got mad at her and said that she is a liar.

When we first met each other, she never told me about any guys. However, I told her about the girl I previously was in love with (and who left me because I distrusted her and accused her for things she might have not done, tho I am still not sure). I said to her, ""I thought I was the only one for you. I know all the plans we made for us, would easily be taken back if he comes to you and asks you for getting in a relationship or something."". Obviously, she said. ""No, I would never do that. I won't ever leave you for him"". I know that she wouldn't because she cares about me but I am not sure if she would actually want to stay with me, after all, friends come after love. I could not ask her about this particular thing because after that we are not good. Today, I apologized to her and she refused to accept my apology, told me neither would she live with me not that guy and that she would live alone forever with no one to lean on. I was crying after she said this and I said that you can't do that to me. After talking on Skype IM for a long time, with me apologizing and calming her down and her shouting at me, we finally are friends again but she now says that she doesn't feel happy and is a lot depressed. She also said that she is no more giving me the promise of living together in the future because she doesn't know if she would be able to keep her promise or not and that she doesn't want to hurt me later when she may be unable to live with me because of some cause (to be known). I am not feeling good since then and I am not talking to anyone at my home nicely either. Whoever comes in my room, I shout at them. Be it my mom or dad. We were really good friends but because I yelled at her we don't even talk to each other much now. I am still not sure if I am actually a higher priority to her than that guy is. Idk, that guy might be cool or someone who likes fashion a lot, gets new hair cuts while I am a guy who you can say looks good (I am not complimenting my own self. I am saying this because a lot of people say that I am good looking or fit and fine and stuff, idk and idc) but never changes hair styles on purpose except it was a fault of my barber and also doesn't click photos and posts on facebook and doesn't like clicking photos with girls while putting hands around their waste either (that guys does so that's why I mentioned this). I am more of nerd and a gamer sometimes really humorous and sometimes, idk, maybe intelligent or smart, sometimes maybe introvert. I can't explain myself but I can explain him. He is maybe the guy who women call cool maybe, since he dresses up well and posts photos with a lot of different girls. I have thought of killing myself a lot of times since yesterday but couldn't do it. I have been crying for hours thinking about my value in her life. I was thinking if I am worth even a penny and all....There hasn't been even a single person whom I have loved more than her and she says it as well. But....how do you love some other guy but still love me more than him and say that you would never leave me for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I am asking girls, especially, (and boys if they can help) about what do you think my friend would do. Live with me and refuse him if comes to get in a relationship with my friend and live with me with out any regrets or would she just ask me to go away? Even if she chooses to live with me, do you think she would do it because she wants it or because she doesn't want to hurt me but actually wants to go?

502,"Hi guys,

In first row sorry for my broken english and possible mistakes.

I will present you 2 situations to explain my issue.

1. I have a well paid job with a small workload,  i could earn more but, comfort zone . I also have a house and a car, all i could need. But i have the issue, i can't handle the money, when i have money i usually do something to remain without. I don't spend the money in a good way, i forget to pay my bills,  buy unnecessary things,  i order  food everytime, weed or i gamble. And after when i;m low on money i get angry and frustrated and  i start to prepare food  by myself and also borrow money and i m more careful with my spendings.
2. I was having a good time with my gf, we have a long-distange relationship but we see each other like 10day/month, she is trying to trust me, she has trust issue, but everytime we are well i accuse her of some wierd shit because i also have trust issues. It happens when i love someone very much, and she is the perfect girl. But everytime when everything it's okay i destroy everything with my issues. but she is doing the same to me but i try to prove her that it's wrong on the other side if i'm doing her a scene she is accusing me that i don't trust her that i humiliate her in front of people.

In both situation when the bad happens i can't think anymore it the way i usually think. I feel like i m on automatic pilot, i can't control my emotions, i also do when i fight with my parents, i say very bad things but a couple minutes after i regret. When i have that bad vibe i usually go to gym or mma but i can't be all the time there. I want to do something everytime, i can't relax. Weed doesn't help neither.

What the hell is wrong with me? How should i fix this?

503,"Title pretty much sums it up, but for a little more information, I was just a jerk in high-school and college but in different ways.

In high-school I was very combative and argumentative. I was a snob and I liked to hate on things other people liked and made a lot of enemies, which I took a sick pride in. The more people that hated me, the more I looked down on them. I realize now I really really really hated myself and when you add that to the fact that school was all I have ever been good at, I see why I was that way (but I still cringe and get really sad when I think about who I was back then). I was also one of those girls who swore she ""couldn't get along with other girls"" but really I was just jealous of everyone. I somehow made a small group of friends who saw through that person and still love me today, and since then I have reconciled with some of those I alienated.

In college I tried to be a better person and I did an okay job for a few semesters, but I was a music major and the environment really brought out my ugly, competitive side. I got a little better by my very last year but in the earlier years I said some horrible things to people, both to their face and behind their back. I was a bitch, honestly. I blamed it on people being jealous that I was the best in my studio, but really I was doing the same things I did in high-school, just in a different way.

I have since taken some time off and have really been working on myself. I'm in therapy, and I know I should bring this up to her but I'm embarrassed and we have a lot of other things to work through that are weighing on me (I was groomed and sexually abused, and I really need to work through that with her, so this has taken a backseat). I'm trying to exercise and drink less alcohol, and work on my relationships with friends and family. One of the girls in high-school who I would have considered my arch enemy is now one of my BEST friends, funny enough. I am also the Maid of Honor in another friend's wedding and I'm trying to be the best damn MOH I can be. Solidifying my female friendships has been a huge priority for me, and it's been wonderful.

SO! All that being said, I am starting law school in the fall. It's a small school and it's going to be three years of seeing the same people every single day. I really really really don't want to fuck this up, especially since law school is going to be even more competitive than music school and the stakes are so much higher. I want this to be my chance to be the person I really want to be, but I need help. Any recommendations for reading material, viewing material, listening material would be amazing and I would be really really grateful.

505,"TLDR at the end

I'm 15, and I've never had a boyfriend or even kissed someone, while most of my peers have checked off both. It's not that I feel I'm in a hurry to do so, but I feel like that's kind of locked in my brain. I can think about it, imagine it, have crushes, and enjoy it inside my head but whenever I think about it actually becoming reality I don't feel like it could ever happen. You see, I grew up in a religious family (which is fine by itself, but they always interpreted it as ""you can't have a relationship until you're an adult"", but I'm also the youngest child by far AND the only daughter. It's not a great combo, since my parents always treated me like something fragile, and they always made jokes about how I wouldn't be allowed to date until I was 30, and how when I grew up my dad would stand there with a shotgun as boys showed up. Basically, my mindset has always been that love and relationships are waaay in the future, but now that I'm at an age where it's normal to be in a relationship, I still feel like that's waaaay in the future. Even though I would LOVE not to feel that way. I think that the only way for me to get past it is discussing it with my parents. I don't mean like a looong chat about it, but more like, it's not unreasonable. I can mention it without them getting horrified at the idea. I can tell my mom I think a boy is cute without it being the end of the world. Basically, how do I bring it up with them in a casual way that doesn't say ""hey I think I'm dating someone"", but more ""hey maybe I'll start dating in the near future"" without them freaking out about their Only Daughter talking about boys.

TLDR; My parents raised me on the idea that relationships are waaaay off, and now that I've been starting to ponder more about them, how do I bring it up with them in a sensible way without them thinking it's the end of the world?",29Jan2019,1
506,"My girlfriend lives alone in an apartment in a major US city. Her building is on the corner of a moldy busy street and a block from a quiet neighborhood.

For the past couple of months a man has been hanging out on the same corner across the street (about 100 feet from her front door and visible from her window). He is there almost every night in the late evening until late night/early morning so he is not always there yet if she gets out of work at a normal time but at least a couple times per week she gets out if work later and he is there to, what she describes as, ""cat calling"" her but she is usually around people so she usually keeps her headphones on and keeps walking. But she says her recognizes her and singles her out. He sometimes will follow her a few steps and watch her go home.

Last night she was walking home later than usual and the busy street was quiet. She passed him walking towards her. He then turned around and started following her. She was afraid to try and stop and try to get into her apartment so she kept walking and called me. He continued to follow her into the quiet part of her neighborhood and around a corner. After following her a couple blocks he disappeared so she looped around and went straight home. He was not there so she went in. She doesn't know how long he was gone because 20 minutes later he walked back to his normal spot from rig but outside her building where she couldn't see him until he walked out.

He knows who she is, he knows where she lives and is now following her home.

We have a problem with customers standing really close when they talk to you. I know it’s not just me because I’ve heard my coworkers (including the men) complain about this as well.

512,"I've been freaking out, I need advices, thanks to anyone that will take time to read everything and give me their opinions. 

I'm a 21 years old female, I graduated last june and has been working since then as a medical lab technician in an hospital, which is what I've been wanting to do since my early teen years. I don't imagine myself doing anything else.

The problem is, where I live right now the market is super saturated. People that graduated 10 years ago all have a position working full time day shifts. I dont even know if I will be able to have a night/evening position in ten years since the majority of the technicians are all in their thirthies, very far from retiring. Adding the fact that machines are doing more and more of the work for us, people retiring might not be replaced. I could work 40 hours a week in five years, or I could not work at all in five years. I cant know.

As of right now, I'm barely working which is freaking me out since people that have been hired at the same time as me in other labs and that gets more hours will gain more experience than me, which will eventually fuck me over since they will get first choices on positions available in the future (it s a government job, the only thing that matter to get a higher position is how many days you worked for them). 

I was ok with working evenings/nights shifts and knew it came with working in a hospital, however i thought that after ten years max this would all be behind me. But right now, I feel like I might do that my whole life. 

Let s add to the fact that I have bills to pay and barely working is not enough for that. And staying home and do nothing will make me go crazy. 

Im gonna have to talk to my boss about the possibility of having formation in another lab to complete my hours, but I dont know how likely this is to happen. 

I've seen other job postings to work in the blood bank which I feel is close enough to what I'm doing that I would like it. However, they arent offering a full time jobs either and I'm scared of giving up the job i have and make my situation worse there. The thing is I have no idea where I would get the best chances at being fulfilled by my career. 

I know this might sound like not a big problem, but experience being the only thing that matters in this field I was planning on working my whole career for the same organization. Because when changing, you go back to the bottom of the list and need to wait years to go back up and get day shifts and stuff like that. I don't know what to do.

I used to love smoking weed and going to parties at that age as a lot of people did, but she hated it which meant I'd hide the fact that I smoked weed from her which also meant that I'd tell white-lies... a lot just to cover this secret because I was worried about her finding out because I knew that I'd be in the dog house for a long time if she found out (but tbf she probably knew anyway) and I'd get caught out on the white-lies from time-to-time which would lead to arguments over text which would also mean that I was constantly on my phone trying to justify them all the time (I probably seem like the biggest dickhead right now).

Thing is, I want to make book illustrations and create my own books.

I sent an application to one art school, I will go there in March to get the results. However the school is kind of shitty in an even shittier town, I really dislike the city. The school is in my opinion about 5/10.  


I will be also applying for a non art college, to study English language and literature so I could maybe translate books in the future, I really like reading and translating. Not as much as creating art though, that's just like my life purpose. And I love the town this school is in.

If I go to the non art college, I will be in the town of my dreams, but I will get further from my actual dreams = making art.  


What do I do? I feel like no matter what I will waste at least a year of my life now and that I will never be good enough to get to those famous art colleges. Like I will never be happy and that I am a failure, cause I wasn't good enough to apply to them right away this year.",29Jan2019,1

522," I've (M/31) always felt like I didn't belong to this family, but it was always a thought in the back of my mind and i never acted on it until this past Friday. I was smoking a cigarette in my apartment when i came across a photo of the man that my mother claims is my father on Facebook. as always i looked at the photo for any features we shared and as always i see nothing. so i decided to call my little sister and finally ask the question that’s been on the back of my mind ""Is this man my father?"" 

   
 

after talking for about 30 minutes i recalled my mom trying to get me to talk to this man that lived in Canada and spoke only French when i was in my early 20's. i had no reason to talk to him so i kept it short and sweet. ""hello, how are you? Goodbye."" shortly after that man’s sons sent me a friend request on Facebook. I thought nothing of it. I don't know what made me recall that conversation but when my sister brought up a photo of their father in his 20's this past Friday I instantly saw the resemblance. this man had all my features from my nose to my cheeks to the way my oval face. It was scary. 

   
 

Now I’m panicking because i really found exactly what i was looking for and i don’t think i was ready for it. My mom and me aren’t on the best of terms. she is a very angry person and i left home as soon as i could. I live far away from her and we don’t talk. the day i found out was her birthday. I called her to wish her a happy b-day and this is how the conversation went:

   
 

Me: hello mom,

Mom: who’s this?

Me: hey mom, it’s me \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, i just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. how are you?

Mom: oh ok \*Click\*

   
 

she hung up on me. I knew the conversation wouldn’t go anywhere but i gave it a shot. If you knew my mom you'd know that approaching her with this information will not get me answers, especially if she feels like she's being put into a corner. 

I found out that this mystery man who may be my father has older sons and they have kids so i might be an uncle too. I don’t know what to do really. I don’t know what to say to the brothers. i don’t know any of their real names. i guess I’m jus looking for advice on how to deal with this situation. 

TLDR: i asked my sister if my dad was my real dad and we found out he might not be, can’t ask my mom since we're estranged, and she probably won’t give me the right answer. How do I deal with something like this?  what questions do i ask so it doesn't seem like im mad at what happened to the wrong people? ",29Jan2019,1
525,"Hey reddit I need some advices.  


A friend of mine wants a relationship with me, but the thing is that i dont know what to do.  


I have already had a long diatnce relationship 3 years ago and it did not ended well. Ever since that time I **HATE** long distance relationships but I arrived at the conclusion that is all because of personal problems and nothing general. This girl lives in my same country just at the other end of it and I'm not feeling very comfortable with it and I don't know what to do.  


so what should I do?",29Jan2019,1

527,"Since I was a kid I loved the idea or journalism whether it was stories about a plucky journalist looking for that big story or more grounded stories of people risking life and limb to show people some of the messed up things going on in the world.  It's something I thought I wanted to pursue until the past 4 or 5 years.  It feels like I've seen nothing but deplorable people in the news industry.  It's all biased and it feels like no one's in it because they want to genuinely do some good.  I mean I always wanted to be a real journalist.  Going to the sites of big events foreign and domestic and breaking real stories with as much factual honesty as possible but I genuinely don't know whether someone seeking to do that has a future in this industry.  I don't want to align myself politically I just want to make sure people are informed on what's going on in the world.  I'm in college now and I have a choice.  I could pursue journalism or more broadly English, or I could do something else entirely and I'm just not sure what to do.",29Jan2019,1
528,"Hello Reddit I'd like to start this off with saying that at no point in any of my conversations with her did I EVER insult her or even try and make her feel guilty or bad for ending the relationship over the phone (I'll get into why she did it later on) and I haven't blown up her phone or spammed her instagram or mailed her any sort of ""please take me back you're my whole world"". But we need to start at the beginning of my encounter with this perfect girl.

I matched with this beautiful girl on tinder; Lightskin fashion model that drives a Challenger and races 1/4 miles with the most beautiful smile I've ever seen, but was too shy to message her right away in fear I would ruin my chances with her. I waited three months until finally one day I thought ""fuck it what's the worst that could happen"" and sent her a message along the lines of ""I know I'm three months late but how are you doing"" to which we kicked off a really laid back conversation that went from tinder messaging, to snapchatting to texting in a span of 2 days, which lead to us going on a months worth of dates and her meeting my family and spending nights in my bed, I liked her so much that the first thing on my mind wasn't getting in her pants it was more getting to know her as a person and the fact I loved being around her because she made me insanely happy and I could tell I was making her happy too, she was constantly giggling and laughing at every mediocre joke I sent her way and when I was around her in person she always had the biggest prettiest smile. It was really like having a best friend I could talk to about anything about but at the end of the day she was still attracted to me and I was attracted to her.

Our conversations went from texting all day whenever we could get the chance to me waiting hours for three to five word replies I thought it was because she was losing interest in me but that thought definitely came from my extreme paranoia and anxiety (which I do seek help for). I could tell she was trying to distance herself but I wanted to know why so I just asked the straight up question ""The memories we made at ""X Locations"" and all the sweet things you've said to me was any of it real?"" to which she replied ""I'm just mentally fucked up right now, im sorry you don't deserve any of this. You're precious and I don't want to ruin you"".

At first I was offended thinking she was insulting me for being soft or fragile or that I wasn't ""man"" enough to deal with her problems but then I took some time to think and realized they're not my problems and none of it is my fault I've done everything the ""ideal"" boyfriend would do. She had just found and met her biological mom for the first time around the same time she met me and I didn't even think about how emotionally and mentally draining that must be at 19 y/o while working a full time job and still taking classes. I want to give her the space she needs to deal with her things on her own but I also want her in my life.

So my questions to you r/Advice are the following:

How do I let her know I'd be happy to give us another shot when we're both ready in the future but I'm not going to be putting my life on hold or saving myself for her?

Is it worth the stress to even be thinking about her anymore?

Is it even feasible to think the future holds a healthy long lasting relationship between us?

530,"So I am 23, and have come to the realization that my old friends from high school are all slowly going their own ways, and are less interested in meeting up and so on. We all live near each other, but what with work, some friends having girlfriends or making other friends and so on, it seems like everyone is less interested in meeting up, to the point where it is left to me to make plans which barely get a response. If I dont plan the event, then no one ends up bothering to do so themselves.

The confusing thing is however that when these meetups do go ahead, its a blast, and everyone is having a fun time and chilling and joking. So we all still get on, but its inevitable that we are slowly drifting apart due to outside circumstances.

How do you deal with this? Its not like I dont have other friends, what with work and my uni mates, but my high school friends have been there since the beginning almost, and so it sucks to realize that that part of my life is slowly fading away.",29Jan2019,1

532,"I'm still new to Reddit and not sure on rules linking to posts in other subs, but if you look at my extensive post history (2 whole ones) you'll see I was searching for advice on whether I should reach out after 20 years to thank a person (who I will call Marie) who helped me.  The TLDR of it is that I was absolutely horrible to Marie, wrote her and said all of this disgusting, toxic shit over months because I blamed her for what I was going through at the time. Eventually I accepted I needed help and asked her for help, because the sad fact was I trusted her more than anyone else. Despite everything I said and did to her, she helped me, a lot, and pushed me to do some things.

For various reasons I have this increased desire to thank her because she really did help me, but I have been anxious about it. I have had no contact with her in 20 years (saw her once some place, but that was it). I can easily reach out on social media if I wanted, but don't feel good sending her a private message after all this time. My alternative is to ask a mutual friend of ours if he can ask her if it's okay if I send her a message.

The problem is I don't think he knows about all of the stuff I did to her, which surprised me, because I'm sure she would have told him. If she did, he's being good and not bringing it up. The other problem is one of the things I asked her advice on involved another friend of ours, a girl I had serious feelings for at the time. I know he doesn't know about what went on between us and I really want to keep it that way, because I was able to fix my friendship with her years ago and don't really want to dredge that up (if he finds out he will TOTALLY go to her and start asking her questions, and she will be angry), so I don't want to get into details about what I asked Marie advice for. I still trust Marie not to say anything to him.

ANYWAYS...  I want to send this guy (I will call him Bob) a message asking if he can ask her if it's okay that I contact her. I feel I have to explain some things, plead my case so to speak (he's well aware of other things between Marie and I, so I need to make sure he knows it's not about that stuff), but don't want to carry on too much (which I have a tendency to do as evidenced by this post). I guess I just want feed back on the message I want to send (omitting some personal details and changing names of course). I know this might seem stupid, but this is giving me severe anxiety, and I know if I send this to him it will set off some shit I won't be able to take back. Appreciate it...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hey Bob, I wanted to ask for a favor. It’s a big ask on my part, and I don’t feel at all good in asking you for it, especially out of nowhere; I’m just at a loss. I will explain a bit what is behind it, so you can decide if you can do this. I apologize, sincerely, up front.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was hoping you could ask Marie if it’s okay if I send her a message. I wanted to thank her for something. And immediately out of the gate I feel I need to clarify it is not about all of that other shit. That was beyond ludicrous and I made it something it wasn’t because I was a manipulative piece of shit, hiding things. I’m embarrassed by everything, I lost a friend out of it, and I know now if I had been honest everything would have been fine. It was fucking pathetic, all my fault, and I’ll leave it at that.  
&gt;  
&gt;What this is about is during my first year of college I asked her for help. What I asked stopped mattering long ago and in hindsight it was simple (and stupid), but it and things around it were feeding into a lot of what I was going through, and I didn’t know what to do. But before I asked her for help (and if I’m going to have the balls to ask this of you, you should know about things I did if you don’t already), I was a toxic fuck to her, and that’s sugar-coating it. I would write her and call her all of this terrible shit and I did it, vehemently, over months. I blamed her for what I was going through, and I wanted her to regret she ever knew me; I don't doubt I succeeded. It was fucking disgusting. I don’t want to make excuses, so I won’t get into what was going on with me, but in the end, I put myself in that place. She did nothing wrong, but I was an immature, misogynistic, entitled little shit and I refused to take responsibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regardless I still had the audacity to ask her for help. I wasn’t entirely honest but despite everything she helped me. She was incredibly good about it, helped me realize I was overthinking things, and that something I deeply feared was unlikely to happen. I want to thank her because what she said pushed me to do something and because I did it everything changed, it led to me coming to my senses, out of the mindset I was in. I was a truly toxic shit and if I didn’t change I would not have ***\[my family\]*** in my life; that’s sadly not hyperbole. I’m embarrassed by it, but I needed help, and it was a first step. Marie had every right to tell me to go fuck myself and it means a lot that she didn’t. She helped me instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;It probably doesn’t matter but I’ve wanted to thank her for a very long time yet haven’t, and the reasons why are probably obvious. Even if I hadn’t napalmed that bridge I’m still deeply ashamed of everything I said to her, the person I was, all of it. I know I was this wholly misogynistic fuck and I’ve always been afraid if I contacted her I’d upset her. I know all of this old shit comes with me reaching out and it doesn’t matter that I’m not that asshole anymore, it changes nothing. It’s also not lost on me that it has been 20 years, which is absurd. But it has become very important to me recently, with the reasons being a bad cliché. I’m not trying to make amends or be friends again, you can tell her I know that’s still not possible, I am fully aware of what I did, what I turned that into; I fucked up bad. It was all so stupid in the end, but she still helped me a ridiculous amount and I just want her to know. I know she’s your friend and it’s unfair of me to ask for this, and I was a lousy friend to people (***\[omitted in-joke\]***) but it would mean so much to me if you could ask her for me, so that I know if it’s okay. I’ll owe you so much. If you can’t or won’t, or she doesn’t want to hear from me I’ll drop it. At any rate, no matter what, thanks for at least hearing me out. Please take care of yourself and I’m wishing you the best.

535,"I’m a teenager. I’ve had the same group of friends for two-three years. (met them in 6th grade) Lately, I’ve been feeling like they get bored with me. This has sent me into a panic, because they are my closest friends. I know things change as you get older, but I still want to be on good-terms regardless. My friends, a group of four not including me, are great people, in my opinion. We are a loner group, or at least we were. I started branching out, trying to overcome my social terror, and have been doing great. But it feels like that has made us grow apart. But it isn’t just that: I am ignored quite often, but I think it’s because of my small voice? However, they also ignore me in the group chat. For example, I posted some memes or whatever in our group chat, no one batted an eye. Then I found out they had all been in a group chat way before I messaged anything. It was only when I asked one of them about that they acknowledged me.   F: “Oh, sorry. We thought you were busy” ... Me: “I just posted a couple things in the last hour..” F: “Oh.” And then added me, but the call was almost tense when I joined. I just.. I feel like I’m being paranoid. My mother even said so.

540,"Hey guys/gals! Ok so this is actually kind of a two part thing. I am going to ask a question which I would prefer to be answered by people that have been in the air force and have been deployed but anyone is free to comment. So a little background info, I have been friends with this person for 10 years now and we always talk everyday or every other day and if we don’t talk for a while we always catch up on Sunday. She is pretty bad at keeping up with communicating but she’s never been this bad. Now my friend recently told me she is getting deployed in early April which I am excited for her since she wants to see the world a bit and she told me she’s going to be pretty busy which I understand but we don’t talk for 2-3 weeks at a time now and it just makes me wonder if she’s actually that busy or if she’s just blowing me off. I do know that she hangs out with her friends that she has made on base almost everyday which is fine but I don’t see how you can’t spare 15 seconds of your time to write me a text message being like “hey hope your having a good day” or something similar to that. I have some other friends that also can’t be bothered to do this which truly bothers me because it makes me feel like they don’t value our friendship but I’m getting off topic right now. So anyway I’m just wondering if getting deployed and the process and everything is that busy that you can’t even just send someone a simple text message. Oh I forgot to mention that this is her first deployment and I’m pretty sure that matters. My gut is telling me that she is just distancing herself away from me and is eventually going to stop talking to me all together which would absolutely devastate me. I already lost one friend whom I have been friends with for 9 years because he just decided to pretty much abandon all his friends for some reason and I’m not willing to give up a 10 year friendship just like that. Now my gut feeling is almost never wrong and is usually spot on but I have only been wrong a handful of times in my 25 years of like when it comes to my gut feeling.

Now comes the advice part. I’d like to hear some advice or just some general input from others on wether or not I should just drop said person as a friend. We haven’t spoken in about 3 weeks and I have gotten some Input from other friends but it’s all mixed. One friend did say that a friendship isn’t a one way street which and I’m not proud to say this but it’s been like that for a long while. I am usually the one to start a conversation and even when I do it doesn’t really last long. The only time we really do have a good conversation is when we are talking to each other over the phone and that can last for hours. Now I’m not sure if I should drop said person as a friend or not. Like I said earlier I’m not really willing to give up a friendship of 10 years but at the same time I can’t fathom how it’s even remotely possible that you can’t spare 15-30 seconds of your time to write me a text message like it’s just impossible to me that you can’t even spare that amount of time. I’m not asking for much but at the same time it feels like I’m asking for an arm and a leg. Said person doesn’t have to respond to everything I say or constantly talk to me but a simple message just goes a long way. So yea this is my situation. Any and all advice is very appreciative!

I did forget to mention one thing and I’m not sure if it helps or not. Said person works day shifts or whatever it’s called which is from 7-3 or 3:30. Again any and all advice is very much appreciative. I will try to respond to comments to the best of my ability. Thanks In advance!",29Jan2019,1

543,"Ok so basically I’ve dropped out university a few weeks ago. I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for about 2 years. Had problems with binge drinking and taking risks with my health with drugs. Wasn’t really attending uni and worked out that it wasn’t for me at that time and I need to recover from my mental health. My dad was great, moved me out and I’m currently at his in Place A.

Place A is pretty hard for me. I lived here for a few years before moving to uni and after a break up and falling out with friends there’s a lot of bad memories here and I think that’s really impacting me, especially setting off my anxiety all the time. On top of that, it’s a village that’s really isolated and as I don’t drive it’s a case of public transport or lifts for getting to doctors, counselling/therapy etc. As well as this, I only have one friend left round here who even then is over an hour away. I don’t have any family here either. I found out today as well that my step-mom is finding me being there hard (she’s been avoiding me constantly and has hardly spoke to me which is heartbreaking because I know her well and I’m gutted my dad hasn’t spoke to me about it until now and doesn’t seem to know how to resolve the situation). So I’m finding it tough being here and I don’t think it’s good for my problems anyways. My dad is really supportive so that’s a help but he is at work a lot so I’m kind of stuck on my own until I get a job sorted (which is hard as places are far away and there aren’t many vacancies).

Essentially, there is a prospect of Place B where I could live with my grandparents until I’m back on my feet. They are incredibly supportive and I imagine they would be more than happy to have me. As well, Place B is a town where everything is walking distance. There’s vacancies at a few cafes which I have the experience for too. I have a lot of family in Place B anyway including my brother, other grandparents and uncles, cousins etc. Also, lots of friends from high school are around an hour away. The idea of living here has been on my mind since I left uni to be honest.

After finding out about my step-mom, I really need to talk to my dad about the idea of moving to my grandparents. It seems like a much better place for me to heal and get back on top of things. I just have no idea how to bring this up as I don’t want him to take it personally. I really struggle to be open about my feelings with family anyway which is why I was battling things at uni for so long, I think I should have dropped out a long time ago. As well, he might think it’s a bad idea moving again (which would be a fair point) but with this whole thing with my step-mom, the isolation, the bad memories is really dragging me down.

Any idea on how to bring this up to him? If anyone has any thoughts on the two places as well that would also be greatly appreciated. ",29Jan2019,1

545,"Hi so sorry I’m not the best story teller and I’m not sure if this is the right place to do this but I’ll just get into it and hope for the best lol. So I’ll call my best friend Lucy.  Lucy and I were extremely close we would facetime from the second we got home till we had to sleep (and sometimes FaceTime threw the night into morning).  Anyway we were really close and have been best friends for 4 years. So me, Lucy, and this other girl who Lucy introduced me to, who we can call Chloe all had to do this project which we would have to present to the class. So we finish this project and it’s just reading definitions, which I was fine with. Than the day before we had to present, Lucy and Chloe decide to add another side with two long paragraphs. I didn’t know they added this slide until later in the afternoon on FaceTime when they told me.  Now I know this is stupid but I was very nervous for this presentation and was mentally prepared just to read some definitions so I said “well you guys added them so you guys can just read it ?”  Then we were kinda arguing about this for a little and her sister (who is also a close friend of mine for 4 years) said to Lucy and Chloe “When you present just don’t say anything and wait for (me) to break the silence.”  That just annoyed me that her sister would really just say that in front of me.  It was just a big “fuck you!”  to me. So I just said I had t leave the call. At this point I was feeling really anxious as I had never in our 4 years of friendship ever had an argument with each other. I have been avoiding any sort of confrontation with her for 4 years. So I text her saying that I’m really not reading the paragraphs and she says “ ya know what everything is fine, don’t worry about it I’ll read it. “  So I was relieved at the fact that everything was okay. Than for around 2 weeks I haven’t got a text or a call or a meme sent in my direction. This is really weird of her because we would talk and text like 24/7 so for 2 weeks were we only talking  in lunch. And these talks at lunch were nothing like our past conversations Lucy, Chloe, and Lucy’s sister did not care what I had to say so I just sat there. Lucy starting not to be my friend just had me not caring as much about the stupid shit they were talking about. I was annoyed but I didn’t really show it because I never wanted to fight with anyone.  So I text Lucy “why is everything weird between us?” and she just said nothing was wrong. Okay? I didn’t know how to fix this at that point so I just got more depressed and was acting not like my normal joking all the time self. So on my spam Instagram I posted a picture of me and my dab pen. Lucy was really against weed. And I just wanted to hear something from her. I wanted something, I wanted to start a conversation. And I did start a conversation. Lucy and her sister commented multiple times like ”what the fuck” and I realize me posting that picture was a mistake so I deleted it. Lucy texted me asking if it was real and I said yes it was but I meant to post it on a different account where she wouldn’t see. I was lying about this different account but she believed me. And she began to be really manipulative asking me “OOoooOo what is the @?” “I bet the page is really artsy! I wanna see!”. I know this was manipulative because she was not talking like herself, and I knew for a fact she was MAD because she really despises weed. She wanted to see this fake account because she wanted to see if I was doing other shit she didn’t approve of. So I just said no one follows it it’s just an account for me. Then she texted me a long paragraph, saying we can’t be friends and it wasn’t because of the dab pen it was because things have been weird for a while. I was extremely upset and I couldn’t even comprehend what had just happened I didn’t know what to say and I was so confused because she didn’t give a reason she just didn’t like me anymore. I couldn’t stand that she was acting so much more intelligent and mature than me threw this text putting all the blame on me. So I had to see her the next day at school and she wouldn’t even look at me she was looking down at her nails and talking in her tone of voice as if there was a stranger around when she would talk to Chloe. I was so hurt. I couldn’t function at school. And I couldn’t stand she treated me like a stranger. So I texted her a really long paragraph saying how I really felt throughout the friendship how I couldn’t stand how I couldn’t say I really felt because you can’t have a disagreement with her, that I couldn’t stand that every once in a while she would text me a really long paragraph about everything she thinks is wrong with me and those really hurt my feelings because those things she said we wrong with me were just parts of personality.  And school is just really bad for me now that I actually have no friends or acquaintances. Yesterday the period before I would have to see her I had a panic attack in class. I have science and gym with her and Chloe and I’m just alone I don’t have any friends to even stand next to and it just so awkward having the whole class see my lack of friends. I’m really sorry this is so long I could of left some shit out. So I want to see a therapist but I’m really nervous.

Should I just finish and waste another 5 months of time and thousands of dollars or should I continue making life changing impulse decisions?
Thanks.

I am overcome with so much guilt when I think about quitting. I feel a sense of loyalty to this job. I will be letting people down. I have only been here a year and everyone works so hard and is so nice. 

How do I get over this sense of guilt and wait like an adult? What do I even say?

550,"I (25/F) have a male friend (27/M) who I chat with on Facebook. We went to high school together and once in a blue moon our friend group hangs out together, but really on rare occasion. Him and I share memes with each other because we have a similar sense of humor. It's all in good fun. But he also sometimes confides in me his emotional state (he's bipolar). He'll get extremely low and start telling me how his friend stopped talking to him out of no where and how he gives up on all humanity and no one matters, no one is trustworthy, nothing is worth it, etc. Today, he was messaging me some pretty low thoughts on life and he mentioned suicide. I felt immediately really fucked up because personally, I have a friend in my life who committed suicide last year and it absolutely broke me. It changed my life. I don't take it lightly. I feel deeply for my friend who is having these feelings, but I also feel like it's unfair to unload all of this onto me. I'm just getting along with my day, busy working on things and I get these extremely depressing messages. I told my female friend that I felt it was unfair to unload that emotional burden onto me instead of talking to a health professional, and she basically lashed out at me and said it's my responsibility to be there for them and make sure they get help. I know that regardless of how I feel, it's my responsibility to handle the situation in some capacity (whether that is to respond to them with advice, ignore them, tell them I feel uncomfortable hearing all of what they're saying, etc). But is it WRONG of me to feel like this is unfair, and not my responsibility?

555,"This is long so bare with me. Also, first time poster so I apologize for any mistakes.

Backstory: I’ve been friends with this girl (lets name her Sara) for about 5 years now, we met my college freshman year, we were roommates for a year (best roommate I’ve ever had), she was my maid of honor at my wedding, so we been close ever since. 

Here’s the problem: She is always been a big drinker, she would drink several times a week every week, even alone. Now I dont mind her drinking but she has severe depression and anxiety, and has sleeping issues (she can sleep for over 20hrs nonstop and is always tired) and is prescribed everything and anything (xanax, aderall, anti psychotics, etc) its always worried me that she mixes alcohol and all these pills but its her life and the few times I brought it up she always told me she needed the pills and alcohol hasn’t affected her. I’ve also tried to convince her of seeing another psychiatrist but she refuses to this too, whenever she is on all those meds she acts so out of it, like she is not aware of her surroundings. 

Anyways, fast forward 5 years (Im 24, she is 25) and her tolerance for the medication is sky high, her mental health has not improved at all. She admitted to me and my husband to take from 4 to 11 tabs of xanax in a day or she just “doesnt feel it” and the drinking constantly (at least every weekend) continues, in addition to about 5-6 other meds she takes. I kept trying to talk to her about it but its pointless.

About a month ago my husband and I went over to her place to visit (she lives at home but parents were out of the country) she looked tired most of the time but thats not unusual. We left at around midnight but I forgot my glasses and had to go back, she opened the door and looked like I had woken her up from a 10hr nap. Anyways, I grab my glasses and Im ready to leave when she starts to lose balance, Im a bit confuse at this point and hold her for a second then suddenly she is completely out. I start screaming for my husband who is waiting for me in the car, he comes in running for his life, picks her up and we tried for a good 30 seconds to wake her up not knowing whats happening. Im ready to call 911 when she finally wakes up, she has no recollection of me coming back for my stuff, and looks very confuse and angry. After staying with her for an hour she insists that we go home, I insist I stay but she says no, and that she’ll call me if she needs me. 

I cried the entire way home. Im horrified and really worried about her, my family told me I need to have a serious conversation with her about rehab, but I know she will discard that option immediately. My husband insists that I talk to her parents about it but it feels like a violation of her trust, I know this is important but I have no idea how to deal with this and Im the only friend who knows whats truly happening here. 

Regardless of if what happened that night had anything to do with the pills and the drinking Im afraid for her life, and I feel really shitty for not doing anything about it... I dont wanna wait until its too late but I have no idea what I need to do.

Any advice on how to deal with this? she is genuinely one of the best humans I’ve had the pleasure of being friends with.",29Jan2019,1

557,"  As a start, I'll say that most of my friends have a history of self harm, and no adult or student outside of our friend group knows this. Another important thing is I'm also battling self harm at the moment (As of now, I wear a rubber band), no one except a few of my closest friends know my struggles.

  You see, my best friend cuts herself, I known this for a while. She also has a history of bad mental health. Although, I was kind of hoping that she'd taken a break from it, and possibly found anything healthier. 

  Today, my fears were confirmed, when I was in the restroom on my phone, she came out of a stall, and I just knew she'd been cutting again. This was unfortunately confirmed when she said something along the lines of, ""Oh, I'm glad it was you, I was afraid that it was someone else, and I'd get sent to the counselor."", I just responded with ""yeah, true. *nervous laughter*"", so I don't know what to do. 

  It'd be extremely hypocritical to tell, then she would never trust me again, and probably tell on me. I'm really conflicted, I promised never to tell anyone, but I want her to be okay. Maybe I should just face it, I'll never end up telling anyone. Please, please, help me, I'm confused. What should I do?

559,"Good morning r/advice.  For the last 6 months I have been attending massage therapy school one day a week.  It's a ~2 year program that is part of a larger school which focuses primarily on cosmetology.  It's the only school in the area with a part time program which is congruent with having a full time job as well.

The school was sold in December to a larger entity and our only full time teacher quit without giving notice last week.  The only other massage instructor is a part timer who was only hired in the last two months.  He has not taught before and is not interested in taking over the full time job.  While he is a capable massage therapist, he is still growing into the teaching role.

Even before these events the school and massage program in particular have lacked stability.  They had been looking to hire a second teacher from even before our group started in the summer.  Our primary teacher (the one who just quit) has seemed over worked and on the verge of burnout for months now - our first class day after she quit basically our entire class noted they felt it coming for a while now.

So, we have a school which recently changed owners and is revamping their policies and outlook moving forward, and was unstable and half jokingly referred to as 'teach yourself school' even before the primary teacher quit.  Now there is no teacher, only the part time assistant still growing into his job and not interested in taking over full duties.  

As such I am looking to take a leave from school while they reorganize and hire an actual teacher to lead the program.  A leave from school is permitted per the schools catalog, however, they require you continue making monthly tuition payments while you are out of school.

I fully intend on returning and completing the program, but only feel comfortable doing so after they have shown an ability to maintain a stable program with stable teachers.  (Beyond the fact I am not one to leave things half done, I am not ready to bear the label of 'beauty school dropout' which, technically, I would be)  Jokes aside, I have now been instructed to write an appeal letter to the school requesting a variance be granted to their monthly payment requirement when on leave.  Given the instability described above and the fact that THEY DONT HAVE A TEACHER.  I feel this should be pretty cut and dry.  That said I don't want to leave anything to chance and would welcome any input on the tone and contents of the letter.

TL;DR:  School is in upheaval and has no teacher.  Taking up to a six month leave, which is permitted, but they want me to keep making monthly payments while away, which seems silly given the mess they have themselves made.

560,"Hey there!

Thinking of doing a DNA test to trace my genealogy as dad broke the news to me that he was adopted and I got another pair of grandparents and family that we both never knew of. This kinda answered ALOT of questions I didn't had the balls to ask my dad as me and him get mistaken alot for other racial identities (I am Chinese).

 Asked dad if he wanted to find them but during the time he was born and given away, its was next to impossible to trace the bio parents as you can just bring a baby and register them as your bio child at any police station and no one will ask any questions and lets add the fact that the immigration and citizen records keeping building was burnt down a few years later we got nothing to work with.

But you could say I was curious AF and wanted to know who we are which led me to sites like AncestryDNA and 23andMe but I don't live in the US, I live in Asia. I am curious if even I bought a kit, will i still be able to trace anything at all?

567,"More realistically, the question should be ""Now that I'm over past trauma (loosely used) how do I bond with boyfriend when life is good?"" For context, I'm 24/F. Skip to TL;DR for important bit.

My first relationship was bad. Not terrible (no rape, no overt emotional manipulation), but really fucked up my view on relationships and sex for a few years. I finally got over this relationship as time passed and after having a relatively low-key, normal relationship which lasted for a couple of years. While I'm sad it didn't work out and that he has moved on, I also had no interest in marrying him (I'm 24) and did not see us together long-term. Solidly for the best.

Between these two relationships (3 years of being ""single"") I had a handful of short relationships lasting 4-7 months. I was thinking back to the passion I felt for some of them, and it always related back to 1) sharing my trauma and feeling closer to them, 2) hearing about trauma they went through and feeling closer to them, or 3) it was an inherently unsustainable situation (they were moving across the world permanently). In other words, it's rare for me to feel close to someone without some kind of trauma reveal on either side. FYI - solid childhood, loving parents, good friend group, successful academic career leading to profession.

My relationship with my current boyfriend (8 months, slow start, long distance) is good, but I don't feel that deep connection that I've had before. It feels more superficial even though we talk about so many things that are not superficial. I'm beginning to think it's because it's the first relationship I've had where there wasn't some kind of big trauma disclosure on either side. Like the passion doesn't exist without something negative to fight against together.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've been using trauma as a way to judge how much I can trust someone and as a bonding mechanism. For example, with my ex I had a panic attack during sex, revealed my history, he shared his own abuse, and boom we bonded. Now I see that was probably slightly-very unhealthy, if unintentional, way I've learned to feel close to boyfriends. Another time a different ex cried about an abuse ex of his - boom, felt close. Another time it was about how a different ex has dealt with being suicidal. Woah, bond.

Now I find myself unable to feel super close to boyfriends who are mentally health AND I'm mentally healthy. When there's no big reveal. I'm not worried as this is my first time dating while unaffected by my ex, but I'm curious how I should handle it? Where it might be coming from? If anyone has similar experiences? How do I bond with no drama?

&amp;#x200B;

570,"I'm just trying to get some clarity on my situation as a physical therapist aide of almost a full year  now. My background is in Kinesiology (I have my Bachelor of Science in Kines with an emphasis in Exercise Science) and I've been personal training and running high school strength and conditioning programs for the past 4-5 years. I'm also applying to PT schools right now. Anyway, I work with some amazing physical therapists but I have began to notice that a lot of them prescribe exercises that are too high of a level for their patients. An example, and one that is ALL too common, is the bird dog. Most people can hardly plank correctly, let alone perform a bird dog movement without a collapsing lumbar spine. 

&amp;#x200B;

My solution? I usually override the PTs programming and have them perform an easier, regressed version of the exercise they prescribed. Does anyone else have any experience with this or have any thoughts on the situation? It kills me to know that these people got their DOCTORATE and they can't tell when a patient needs to be regressed on a movement.

571,"Throwaway account. So I've been working at a small nonprofit office for about 7 months. There is about 10 total people that work there. Overall it's an ok job, aside from one thing. Every Thursday, most of the workers have a staffing meeting, and I have to go out, call in/order, and pay for everyone's lunch on separate tabs. So, once a week I have to go out and use my own gas and pay for 10 separate orders at the height of lunch rush. I hate doing it. They don't realize that this is really inconvenient for not only the restaurant but for the other customers as well. It puts everyone behind, especially at lunch, when other customers are likely on their lunch break. I've worked in food service before, and I feel like this is kind of shitty to do right at the lunch rush.

I've brought it up that they should order from restaurants that deliver to our office, or bring their own lunch (like they do every other day of the week) but they don't listen. 

I've also mentioned that they could all chip in so I don't have to pay for everyone's meals separately, but they insist on paying in different methods, and often they don't give me enough money. And they have the audacity to complain about their food after I drive across town to get their food for them. I have the mentality of ""beggars can't be choosers"" and I'm not about to open up and check 10 orders while still in the restaurant to make sure everything is there. Frankly, I'm sick of doing this. I feel like everyone should be responsible for their own food. It was never agreed upon that this would be something that I would have to do as part of my job. How can I say that I am sick of doing this in a tactful manner? Or do I just have to put up with this bullshit until I get a new job? Part of me is feeling like maybe I'm overreacting since it's once a week, but I've never had to do this at any other job in the past.

You have a guy/gal making the extra effort to make you feel loved and special, return the favor. Simple as that. Love, as most things, GIVE and take. Step up and give. Once you make genuine efforts you'll realize, life and love isn't as hard as you're making it. That's like being in a kayak and watching your partner row with your arms crossed wondering why you're moving so slow. Getting in the kayak shouldn't be the extent of your effort. Help out. Actually TRY instead of just saying it. Effort is key. He/she loves you and they deserve to feel special too. Romance, affection, intimacy, communication, companionship, love, family- a lack of these are things people kill themselves over each and every day. Meanwhile, you're taking it all for granted. Be grateful you have someone fighting for you and cherish that shit. Otherwise you will regret it, trust me. If they're not doing you wrong, why treat them as if they are? If you had a bump or series of bumps that lasted an hour, a week, a year, and you guys stick it out, they're doing their part and you say, ""I'm trying"" why not actually do so? You are the only one making things hard. You have a man/woman pouring their time and energy into you, they cannot get any of it back, don't take it lightly. Love as you are loved. Make your partner feel special. We are only here for a short period. Don't let someone who sees you as their everything, get away. That love is a rarity when it is genuine.

575,"I honestly don’t know where to start. My life has been a total rollercoaster for 3 years that all started with my parents divorce. 

My dad was a total piece of work. He pulled me out of public school in the 2nd grade so he could control me and my mother. I wasn’t even allowed to leave the house until I was 15. Eventually my mother realized what a narcissistic piece of trash my father was and got us out of there (not without him trying everything in his power to fuck us over on the way out).
I won’t bore you with the details of a typical messy divorce, but we ended up with a fresh start. I lost everything I had and have had to slowly build back up my collection of stuff, now I’m about to lose it all again.

My mother met another man that she fell madly in love with. He was a good guy, for a while. But eventually drama started to rear its ugly head again. And now they’re fighting. Constantly. Nothing but yelling and screaming to the point that I can’t sleep.

We’ve been living with his brothers family, and needless to say they’re sick of it. Sick of them constantly yelling in their house. Someone must’ve contacted their landlord because he wants everyone not on the lease out of the house by this Thursday. This includes me and my mom and step dad.

Over the past year I’ve been making money thanks to frequent plasma donations. And that’s currently my only source of income. $75 a week. I’ve been applying everywhere I can but surprise surprise, no one wants to hire a 19 year old with no experience and no formal education. I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options.

Finally we fast forward to last night. I went to go see a movie by myself because I needed time to clear my head and just get away from all this for a moment. When I come back a tow truck came and repo’d my parents car. That was the only source of transportation we had, and now we’re stranded here. The clock is ticking and we have nowhere to go.

Honestly I’m most concerned with my pets. I have a dog that I’ve had since I was 7 years old. He’s my best friend and the only thing keeping me sane right now. On top of that my parents have 7 beautiful cats and I don’t want to see them have to be released out on to the street. 
I can’t take care of all of them. I can’t even take care of myself.

One other person living with us is the son of my step dad’s brother’s girlfriend. He’s 28 and unemployed like I am. He’s also a known thief and does drugs. But his mom always protects him and lets him do what he wants because that’s her baby. I know she’s going to sneak him back in here after the landlord comes to evict us on Friday. And I know for a fact he’s going to pillage my collection of video games that mean more to me than anyone in this house does anymore.

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I have nowhere to go. Nowhere to take my stuff. Nowhere to take my pets. My parents constant arguing is getting them thrown out on the street and I’m going to be dragged along with them even though I’ve tried my best to remain quiet and out of sight in a backroom away from everyone. I lost everything I owned once and it nearly broke me. I don’t know if I can lose everything again. The family on my mother’s side has estranged themselves from us because they didn’t like her new husband. The family on my dad’s side are all druggies and crooks. And it’s not the responsibility of my step dad’s family to take care of me while I try desperately to find a job.

I have no car. No license. Not enough money to live on. And my final days in this house are gonna be spent listening to my parents scream and argue. I’m out of options and time.

He went to a counselor during his second year of college because of his depression but since stopped. Even though he lacked socially, he made up for it academically. He graduated around the top of his class and proved his intelligence. But once college came his downfall began to happen. He began to fail classes. He wouldn’t even show up to some of them. Every time he came home on the weekends or on breaks he would sit huddled up in his room. He still sits in front of his laptop all day. 

My family sacrificed so much to give him another chance. Our dad is currently sick and he’s about to be laid off. And my older brother knows about this situation. He is so unappreciative that it sickens me. He is wasting our hard earned money. 

We are expecting my older brother to get a job this summer after getting his diploma, but I doubt that is happening. He just got back three Fs from his most recent classes. 

But the thing that makes me the most mad is his attitude. He hasn’t picked up his phone all day because he is well aware of the topic of discussion. He gets a pissy attitude when you ask him for anything, while he sits on his lazy ass all fucking day. The worst case was during the summer of his second year. He had an essay that was due but he waited too long but his teacher offered him an extension. And guess what? He didn’t work on it. My mom did not allow my other brother and I to go anywhere until he completed it. We were punished but my older brother was too selfish to be aware of it. One day our mom and him got into an argument about the essay that sent my mom crying to her room. I got so upset I grabbed a bag and just walked out the house.

He’s ignorant to the world and his responsibilities. I’m completely clueless as to what to do as my family has done everything they can so far. He’s putting another layer of stress on my family who has had enough already. Sometimes I wish he could just go away so I don’t have to deal with him anymore. 

I’m so clueless as to what can I do or what can my family do. I just need some help. ",29Jan2019,2
577,"She’s not really my girl, but she’s my girl lmfao. We’ve been going steady for like a week now. She’s spent the night at my place once, and I’ve already met both of her friends the two times I went to her place. She’s already confessed to me how much she likes me because she said I can have side chicks, but she wants to be the main girl no matter what and that she won’t entertain any dudes while she’s talking to me because she’s “been there, done that”. And I believe her. She’s told me all the personal things about her, like her body count, and the last time she had sex (7 months). We came close to having sex, but I guess she wasn’t ready but she definitely said I “tempted her”. She’s just infatuated on how confident I am in myself. But she’s been testing me recently I feel like.

1. She downloaded a Tinder. When I was hanging out with her friend, her friend was telling her what Tinder was and she said she wanted to make one. Didn’t think too much of it or care because I know what we have. But thats just a supporting detail.
 
2. She hardly texts a nigga. Last time I heard from her was yesterday at around this time. Again, didn’t think too much of it because I don’t think too much of texting anyways and it’s not that serious.

Feel like she’s wanting to put thoughts in my head that she’s entertaining other dudes and is expecting me to start acting insecure lmao. Feel like this is definitely a test on if I’m a viable partner, but I’m not gonna fold. What do y’all think?",29Jan2019,0
578,"Okay so background about myself. I'm a teenager living in a standard family with two older brothers, mom, dad, and my grandmother, who doesn't live with us but visits OFTEN. I'm in a ton of advanced classes that give out quite a bit of homework that takes at least 3 hours a night, which I can deal with. My parents both work until around 7-8ish so they aren't here most of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my oldest brother moved out right out of high school five years ago, he was probably my best friend in the house and it was sad to see him go. My second oldest brother is now 20 years old, still lives here, does not go to school, has a part time job that he hardly goes to, and is horribly depressed. He is either in a depressed sobbing mood in his room that I try to help him through, or he is in a child like state of denial of growing up. All he does is play video games in his room, and wastes all his money to the point where he literally has none, and isn't planning on saving to move out or do anything good with his life. He CONSTANTLY bugs me to play video games with him like a 4 year old, and basically throws a tantrum when I say no, which I have to often since I'm busy with school. 

My grandmother thinks me and my older brother cannot take care of ourselves and is over everyday. She is constantly reorganizing and ""cleaning"" my room, and she has some sort of what I can only call obsession with keeping my bed literally the cleanest thing and has me change the sheet, blankets, pillow cases, mattress pad, everything three times a week which takes at least 2 hours and is extremely tedious. If it's not the bed it's other meaningless tedious tasks that have no impact on anyone. My grandma usually leaves by 5, which leaves me with my brother until about 8 when my parents come home. Then I can finally do my homework, but by the time I'm finished everyone's asleep.

Ever since my eldest brother moved out, the only people I see in my house anymore is my extremely unpleasant brother, and even more unpleasant grandmother who won't leave me alone. 

I'm not saying I don't want to see them ever again, but seriously several hours a day is too much and I can't handle them anymore... I know this sounds like a pouty teen complaining about school and family, but seriously... for the past 5 years it's every day... non stop... and I can't take it anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

What's an actual good way to tell them both to give me space without having my brother spiral into depression (Which he does often at meaningless things, trust me this would be one of those things) and my overprotective grandmother without hurting her feelings or having her misunderstand me?",29Jan2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

in the past few days I have been stumbling upon some internet posts regarding a concept called antinatalism, which is basically the belief that procreation as an immoral thing.  And well that got me interested. So I went to quora and soon enough a found a post belonging to this user [https://www.quora.com/profile/Lynn-Blair/answers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lynn-Blair/answers)……. and to be honest? I was actually pretty shocked when I saw the comments and posts.  Because, this particular individual, seemed more than hellbent on hoping that any form of life would be exterminated because as she puts it ""it will end all pain and suffering"" she also believes that happiness is an illusion and has said many other things that made me seriously question her state of mind and any other who holds the same ideology.  So how do you respond to people that think there is no happiness and that life is 'evil'.  And to be honest, I don't think simply dismissing them as trolls would be exactly accurate.

Recently tho after dealing with a lot of stress about a girl I’ve started to feel less happy and less excited. I know that this is borderline falling into depression but I’m not there yet. I feel as if I’m not happy doing anything I used to do. I go to the gym and even with preworkout can’t push myself to do anything.  Or I play Xbox with some good friends and I just get off early Bc I don’t feel as its fun anymore. Same with homework I just have no desire to do it or even go to class. 

I feel as if I’ve always been pretty in tune with my internal feelings and now I feel as if I’m at the edge of a ravine about to spiral down. I’m sure there has to be a way to just end these feelings before I actually start to fall off the edge. I think I’m still holding on but how do I pull myself up?

582,"Okay, so I'm a 15 year old male and I live with my dad. And I'm not some edgy teen who doesn't want to be disciplined or punished for things I did wrong. I acknowledge that. 

My mom passed away 2 weeks ago and I have been living with my dad for the passed year and a bit as they were separated. This doesn't really have much to do with it but just for context.

No matter what I do, or what I don't do it won't please him. When we argue nothing I say is valid, whether I am right or wrong. It always goes back to the premise of him being older and being the father. 

Generally I feel nothing I say is taken into consideration just because I am younger and not an adult, even though I think for my age I am rather mature and knowledgeable. 

Even things like going out with friends is frustrating because he is so worried and over protective I can't be at a friend or party for longer than 10 minutes without being phoned. 

It goes as far as me once ubering home with my phone was on mute and my dad made my brother leave work just to see if I was home. I was fine. 

I have to send updates every 5 minutes on where I am, send screenshots of my driver, send my location when I'm out, send my friends' parents phone numbers, put my phone so that it shows when I was last online, etc. 

When we speak to each other I have to chose my words so carefully and speak so softly and monotone or else Im accused of disrespecting him and being rude even though I think I'm just having a normal conversation like I would with anyone else. 

I'm constantly threatened with boarding school and living somewhere else. I don't know where. I'm generally indecisive and when it comes to buying things or choosing stuff I take long and can't decide and am always ridiculed and told how weird and illogical I am. 

When I lose at sports or something and I'm upset or disappointed I can't even show it because I'm 'miserable' or spoilt. 

I do well at school and when I get good results it is just a norm and I am never congratulated or recognized but as soon as I mess anything up then it has to be a big deal. And in general a mountain is made out of a mole hill. 

I'm also quite skinny and whenever it comes to physical stuff or helping around I'm not really mocked but sort of teased for not being bigger or stronger. 

Sometimes I wonder if adults were ever kids or if they just don't understand, and I could understand that. But I wish they were more considerate and saw things from my perspective for once. Or if they could just talk and ask. 

I'm asking to know if any of you had similar experiences and how you dealt with it.

I'm just seeing more and more stuff about measles outbreaks and such, and I'm really starting to freak out. My mom and both my older siblings are hooked onto this idea, I'm not sure about my dad but I'd be willing to bet he's hooked too. I'll talk to him about it, but I don't know how I'd go about this situation if he agreed with my mom. I feel kind of alone here, and honestly I'm scared, antivaxxers are really stubborn from what I've seen and there's nothing that could change my mom's mind. I hate the idea of getting the law involved, I know her intentions are good and all. When I had asthma she had me use a nebulizer but not an inhaler cause she says it's unhealthy, I felt like it could've been much easier for me if I had an inhaler.. But that's just one thing, I'm worried about if I end up getting sick and she doesn't get me proper treatment, what might happen?

584," 

On weekends or any time really. He's happy just to sit home and stare at the walls. It drives me crazy. I would kill to have him spontaneously make plans but it's never going to happen. Whenever I plan any thing at all it ends up just being the kids and I, he uses working all week as an excuse.. but seriously I mean he NEVER wants to do ANYTHING. If he does come he's like a big black cloud the whole time, even if it's something I specifically choose because it interests him. I've given up trying with him.. My friends are all off with their families doing fun things on the weekends so I feel so lonely.

He also will not take any initiative for his health. He quit sugar just before Thanksgiving, which he was way over doing (like 2-3 bags of gummies a day plus 12 cokes and what ever carbs he eats), and he started drinking water for the first time in his life. Which is a good thing to this that challenge on his own, HUGE really, and it gave me some hope.

He was never a big man, he weighed like 160 at his heaviest, now he lost like 40lbs of sugar fat and is around 120-130,(but refuses to get on the scale) he will not even tender the idea of working out, going to the gym or going to see a Dr. he has always hated any kind of sports or physical activity, I am not wanting him to get all Aquaman for me, but I think in light of his really unhealthy lifestyle (that I never knew he was so addicted to sugar) he should take on some physical activity for his health to be here with me and the kids for as long as possible. He just gets angry and says he hates the gym its a place for cave men to have a ""circle jock jerk"" and that Dr's are where you go to die.

I am at a loss and so frustrated I don't know what to do.

592,"As the title reads, I’m looking for advice on the best route to acquire ownership of my neighbor’s dog because he is a good boi that deserves a better life than he’s currently living.

Backstory: My image conscious neighbor (luxury cars, well-manicured lawn, Yorkshire Terrier) left his wife for his girlfriend. As, what I assume was, an apology to his three teenage daughters - he buys a beautiful English Cream Golden Retriever puppy. The Yorkie was pissed. 10-12 weeks later, puppy found dead in backyard and was replaced with yet another beautiful English Cream Golden Retriever. 

The current situation: I estimate Puppy #2 is almost 2 years old now. He spends 100% of his time outdoor since the Yorkie has claimed the space + family for himself. He doesn’t get brushed nearly enough and has matting behind his ears, he NEVER gets walked, heck I’ve never even seen them pet him. HE HAS SADNESS IN HIS EYES! I feel like divorcée dad just dropped him off in a house that he was never truly welcomed in in the first place - to three teenage girls that complain about his shedding + “how crazy” he is. Which is absurd! He is the most mild tempered good boy, but of course has some puppy tendencies because he’s never been trained and doesn’t get any exercise. I’ve also never, ever heard him bark which leads me to believe he was devocalized. Anyway, I’ve come to absolutely love this dog and I think the love is mutual (lucky girl, here.) I bring him toys and stick my arm through the gate to brush him, and celebrate his good behavior with treats. 

Question: Is there any decent way to ask these people if I can have their dog? They’re nice individuals, they’re just not good dog owners. I don’t want to come off as disrespectful or inappropriate as I do not want to compromise my relationship with them at all. Help!

From my dad throwing my shoes out the door for leaving them in the living room [i remember being angry because they werent in anyones way and he was being a hypocrite] to purposefully leaving the bolts loosened on my bike when i was 13, and i vaguely remember him throwing me out when i was younger, i packed my toys in a bag and was sick of him and ready to leave.

Now hes gotten to much enjoyment and hes taking ot to far. No chance of me making him stop on my own but my older brother is clearly on his side and thinks its harmless fun when its not funny at all. 

Im getting to an age where im starting to form a life and its still all a joke to him and he makes fun of me and just does mean things that takes the pleasure out of me moving forward. 

Its mostly things that are hard to prove but are to convenient and knowing his sick sense of humor makes sense to me. I proudly say i lost weight and he starts saying he wants to take me to eat, i say no thank you because its fast food that im pretty sick of. He doesent take No for an answer and attempts to pressure me, now he is constantly bringing home junk food when before you couldnt find a single thing to eat.

I tell him i rarely get sick and was sitting upstairs and be around the family and he would cough without covering his mouth and acts like its an accident. He did end up getting me sick, but i recovered fast and i let it go.

I get a good job and start making money and he claiming to know me so well gets me into drinking again. Its a tiring process to keep track of what hes going to do next and it is messing with me mentally and i am suffering i feel like its divided our family because he treats my mother the same as he does me, she found an old can of tuna fish hidden behind her dresser and im certain he was being a prick.

Her license recently went missing and she is recovering from a stroke and depends on him to take her places, and treats her pretty bad [they are arguing right now as im typing this].

I dont even know if im looking for advice or just getting this all out. But some advice would be great. I have tried talking to him and he denies all of it, laughs at me, and says im crazy.

She asked how he knew our: relationship status, our names, numbers, etc... he said he got it from one of my girlfriend’s coworkers (which didn’t have her number or know about our engagement)  
So I messaged him and told him to stop (my exact words were “Hi, don’t text my girlfriend again! Thanks man”)

There is a girl in my class (WHOM I TRIED TO HIT ON A YEAR AGO BUT FAILED)  So one day, we were in class and we got paired up in groups and I got in a group with her, i cracked some jokes we talked a little and  she start hitting on me for some reason afterwards. And i know what you are thinking maybe she is trolling or messing around, but I don't think that's the case. So she talked to me in school and also texted me. Like A LOT. It was obvious that she liked me, and all of my classmates noticed that. But, I wasn't really digging it, there was a lot of thing that I didn't like about her. So I just simply ignored some of her messages, didn't really talk to her at school, most of the convos was started by her basically.  So here is where the weird part comes in. I hang around school most of the time with my best friend. And ever since that day I showed her no attention. She started to do the same things that she has done to me but on him and it was super obvious that she was doing it just to make me angry. A little backstory about my bff: He is quite  a clever guy and he hates her basically ( thinks that she is childish, a bitch, stupid and ugly), he always talks about her behind her back about how stupid she is  and how annoying she can be. So she started to, I guess talk to him more and ofc my friend didnt show her much attention at first. I brushed it off as normal, thinking that my friend wouldn't do anything stupid enough. Skipping a week later he caught me off by suprise. He started to actually laugh at her jokes. Or even respond ! It's funny and annoying at the same time to look at this situation. Annoying because of what she is trying to do and funny because of how I guess dodged a bullet on her and how low she can scoup to make me jelous or angry. But hey that's my opinion maybe I'm wrong. But now I am concerned about my friend. Should I tell him about what's happening... I don't know really ... He should know right ? It would be really emeberassing to say it to him, that he should be careful and stuff. So any help would be appreciated",29Jan2019,1

608,"Hey guys,

In my college essay, I emphasized the importance of character, and why is disappointed interviews are mostly non-existent. I also laid out what was taking up my time for extra curriculars. 

The main thing is that I’m working for an apolitical community action group, in which I have a large role. The other is that I take training in the gym, as well as track and tennis fairly seriously ever since junior year as I used to be obese. It’s at the point where I’m called “psycho” by my peers for going to the gym for two hours after four-mile runs. I wrote about the importance of staying committed to a few things versus stacking many things which can’t receive as much attention. 

In addition, at the one school I applied to that had interviews (back before my track season started) they asked what one thing I wanted to do outside of my academic or business career. Apparently most people picked skydiving or something crazy like that, but I said I wanted to become a better runner. That answer surprised them.

Okay here’s my idea

I have just been awarded by the organization I work for, and am the youngest person by far to ever receive it (and I never applied or asked to be considered for it). My parents and teachers have insisted I alert schools about it.

The other thing is that after my first track season as a runner (I used to throw) I won a third place medal in one of my races, and made it to counties. I figure I should include this one to show how I stay committed and disciplined on a daily basis, but especially to the one school I interviewed at (not my top school sadly) that I am following through on my goal. 

Btw I have a 3.5 GPA/27 ACT so my grades are pretty mediocre in these schools’ applicant pool.

What should I do? Is it worth sending to schools or do you think it would just annoy them? Was planning on sending an email explaining my progress and attach various related images to both achievements.

Let me know if you have any questions related to the post. Thanks in advance guys :)

609,When I feel really bad about myself it’s difficult to get out of the mindset. It feels like I just keep spiraling with them until I get really upset. What do people do to try and stop those negative thoughts while they’re happening? ,29Jan2019,1

**\^The Chat, it's a must read to understand this.** 

TL;DR my friend started homeschooling recently and since then his problems have almost doubled. I want to convince him that its just because hes confining himself to one room and its not healthy. 

Context: We are high school freshmen, except my friend dropped and started homeschooling. 

I received a message from my friend just recently. Usually I know how to respond to it, but It has gotten way harder to stay positive and try to flip everything around by at least convincing him that everything is temporary. A week ago, he had a really bad outburst related to the same thing and its really worrying me. 

Now his family is well aware that he is depressed and he does take medication and go to a therapist regularly. They know what happens and have had incidents before. 

What I really want to tell him is that things will get much better if he just starts going to school again, that way he isn't confined into a small room for the rest of his academic and social high school career. I really want to see him grow, but this home schooling thing has really staggered him socially. I feel like I am his only friend that still listens to him. 

He's adopted and recently made contact with his bio family. His adoptive family are the nicest people ever, and his brother is kind of mean but would probably be the only issue in my opinion. He constantly denounces his family as if they are the worst people ever. I think they are patient and a few times they have saved me during bad weather and have been all around caring  even to me. 

Hes pulled a lot of shit in the past to hurt my friends before, but he didn't seem to think when he was doing those things. Although, that incident seems to link back to not being able to handle people socially. I mean, back in middle school he was a great friend and didn't seem as bad as he does now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if its appropriate for me to tell him what I think, because I am not an expert and I don't have any right on this.

Pros

The freedom of not sitting at a desk for 8-10 hours per day

Talking to all kinds of different people

I love my boss... easily the best boss I've ever had in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

Inconsistent hours; one biweekly paycheck could be 80 hours, another could be 30 hours

Am going to have to get a second job soon to supplement income

Not realistic for my long-term financial goals

Not a career that has tons of growth potential

I have to use my car for work which is adding wear and tear

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, my friend is getting me an interview to potentially work at the accounting firm she works for. She said they're hiring people with no accounting experience since unemployment is so low, and they're investing in training for good employees with client experience. She also said they're amazing people. 

Pros

It pays double what my current job pays, I could afford to survive on one job

Located in my city, I could ride my bike there and not use my car

It's a career move; there's tons of room for growth and I would be taking the right step for the secure financial future I want

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

Nothing, really, other than the fact that I would have to have a really difficult conversation with my current boss and tell her that I'm leaving RIGHT after they just invested all this time and energy in me for training (which ended 2 weeks ago). I would feel like a piece of shit for that.

After our second class, the guy that sits two seats away from me just simply came up and asked, ""Hey OP, is it cool if I get your number?""

I just nodded and proceeded to give it to him, and at this point I wasn't actually sure if it was a 'let me grab it in case I miss class one day' kind of thing, or because he wanted to talk. I was okay with either. 

So, he starts texting me and we just start talking and getting to know each other a little. Eventually (within the same day he asked for my number) he asks if i would wanna meet up over the weekend, and suggests a movie. I say sure, why not. I'm a bit taken aback because we don't really know each other, but I figure what the hell, I can appreciate someone being direct. 

We start to solidify the plans, and we agree on a movie theatre. But then right after agreeing, he suggests instead that I could just come to his house. 

Basically my question is, is it totally naive of me to think he really just wants me to come over for only a movie and to just hang out? Honestly, I don't really date too much so I'm not sure if this is obviously a 'hey come over so we can hook up' sorta thing, or if it could actually be innocent. 

I'm cool with hanging out and getting to know him, but I definitely don't wanna hook up with a guy I don't really know. And I don't wanna go there if that's his expectation. So yeah, any insight would be appreciated I guess? Or advice on how to navigate the situation.

Recently, she moved in with a friend of ours, S, after having to leave the apartment she was staying in due to an extremely aggressive landlord. S with was living with her ex boyfriend who had recently bought a home and offered to let them stay there for a while(bad idea, I know, but desperate times...). Because S could not take care of the pets she had, ex boyfriend kicked her out, and then decided to move his brother into the house in S’s old room. Ex boyfriend and brother are both sort of sketchy assholes with more guns than could ever be necessary, and a vengeance against cats, which H has 3. H has no valid options for living situations in our home state, as her parents moved out of state recently and she has no other family here. All of this is happening in the meantime of me trying to buy a house so that we have a home to stay in. 

H is a bipolar veterinary technician with a serious case of compassion fatigue. I am a retail store manager with serious ADHD and anxiety. When H has a period of mania, she tells me that there’s nothing I can do to help her, yet she also gets upset when she feels like I’m “not there for her.” I don’t understand how I can be loving and supportive to her when she can’t communicate her needs or her feelings to me. This living situation nightmare has me worried that, due to her natural reflex to remove herself from stressful situations, she will take the hard route and move out of state with her parents, which could end up being the end of our relationship.

Well when I look down theres a green thumb tack in my French fries, every one says they didn't put it there and the friend who took my burger, which was on top of the fries, says when she took my burger she had noticed something green in my fries but thought it was lettuce. So realizing it came from the kitchen I take the thumb tack to the kitchen and say ""I don't know if you want this back but I found it in my fries"", the lunch lady says they don't have thumb tacks in the kitchen but she is standing in front of a cork board full of thumb tacks which is right behind the food. She takes the thumb tack and I leave, my friends say we should go tell the principle so we do but we can't find him so we just tell the school resource officer. Fast forward to today and I get called into the office, the school resource officer tells me to come into his office. He seemed nervous the whole time, he tells me he had interviewed my friends and watched the security tapes, he says that while I went to go get my fruit salad one of my friends has gotten up to go get something and when they came back they brushed against a cork board about 2-3 feet away from my food and the tack fell into it, he says he saw the poster hang from only 1 tack in it's right corner after he had passed by. But this is wrong for many reasons, first, I asked each person at the table and they said nobody had gotten up or come in while I was away, I asked 5 people individually. Second, the poster he mentioned had been hanging from one tack for months, everyone at the table also agreed. Third, my friend had seen it before as soon as they picked up the burger. When he shows me they poster from the CCTV camera he never plays the video only shows me a still image. The entire time he is stressing it's an accident and he tells me that me and friends need to delete anything we had said about this off of our social medias. Later in the day when he is standing up in the hall I ask him who it was who had knocked the poster over, he says it was one of the guys at my table and he couldn't tell me who it was. Why wouldn't he be able to tell me that? Also the only person sitting near the poster said he didn't get up the whole lunch. When I had asked him he instantly got nervous. At this point it's pretty cleared they had lied, but I was never mad or anything in the first place but this can't be let go, finding a thing tack in food is one thing but to have them lie to me to cover themselves is downright scummy.

I’ve tried talking to her about it but she said she doesn’t want to talk about it with me because it’s her problem not mine. She’s also always tired, and often doesn’t want to hangout or have sex because she’s too tired. Which I’m assuming is caused by the depression. 

For example this past weekend we went on a trip with her friends to a nearby city. All day Friday she complained about being tired and barely talked to me the whole day. She’s broke right now and looking for a job so I understand why she’s stressed out. Over The whole weekend she wasn’t in a good mood, didn’t talk much and complained a lot.  There were good bits too and it was a very fun weekend overall but I could tell she was off. 

Today I went over to her place to say hi and talk about this weekend. I brought up how I noticed she was off. She said she has been stressed out lately. I said I felt like she’s been neglecting our relationship. She got very defensive and basically said ok I’ll try more in a angry tone and  tried to turn into a fight. I was calm and talked about how I just want to see her more and for her to put in a little more effort. She broke down crying and saying she’s super stressed and her depressions been bad lately. I asked about it and she said she doesn’t want to talk about it with me l because it’s not my problem and that she had a therapist for that. I comforted her and I left feeling depressed. 

I love her and I enjoy spending time with her when she’s in a good mood. But lately she hasn’t been. 

My question is how to deal with a partner that suffers from depression. How can I help. How can I see her good side more. ",29Jan2019,1
641,"I'm struggling to start this so let's just get right into it. For context, 20/m, I dont have any family, I live on my own. I dropped out of high school and got my GED because I ended up homeless until I turned 18, in which time I started getting checks yearly (mothers life insurance) I use this money to pay rent, bills and food. It's not a ton but I'm pretty okay at making money stretch.

-Here's the wall, I'm currently unemployed and struggling to find a job and I cant drive. the town I'm in doesnt really have public transport and atm the weather isn't really suitable to be walking in.
So as the mantra goes ""cant find a job because I cant drive, cant drive because I cant afford a car"" and so on.

-here's the moat; Sadly money hasn't stretched as far this year so I'm 4 months away from getting paid again and most of what I have left is going to rent and what's left after that is all going to keep the lights on... for maybe 3 months.

-And lastly the archers on the wall; I'm depressed  and with intrusive thoughts that belong on a different sub, I know i need to see a doctor but that's money I really dont have.
My only irl friend helps with food every now and then but I feel like I'm siphoning money that she could be using because shes broke too and has more bills than I do.

642,"So, I have been working at my company as an AR Coordinator for the last year, and it started off very well. I really enjoyed my job and had great flexibility with how I went about things. I was able to work from home, casual dress, and had a great relationship with my supervisors. 

Fast forward to now, and I am absolutely miserable here. My company was acquired (we were a small start up before) and everything since then has changed. I now report to our new CFO, and he is an absolute nightmare. I can no longer wfh (requires a PTO request now, even though I could do all aspects of my job at home), shames us into working more hours, is not open to suggestions at all (quote from him was ""I'm open to hearing your suggestions. I probably won't do a damn thing about it, but I'll hear it""), constantly throws his experience in your face, and is an overall stubborn and arrogant person (we are currently paying six thousand a year for a system that has the same function as our other system, but he wanted it because it was ""pretty"" and he had complete control of it). 

On top of everything that was mentioned, he has currently ignored/forgotten several things I have brought up to him about compensation. They did not pay one of my quarterly bonuses, and I was supposed to be provided a new offer letter that clearly ironed out the incentives for my position (reminded him about both a few times). I was very tolerant of everything happening as my yearly review was coming up and I could bring up all the complaints I've had, but even now it's been almost a week since I was supposed to have my meeting and if I remind him it'll just get pushed back again. 

I don't know where to go from here, I have sent my resume plenty of places and have sent it through out my network as well. Any sort of advice would be appreciated, I don't want to quit but I'm at the point where I'd rather smash my head into a chalk board repeatedly instead of coming here. ",29Jan2019,1

645,"Just a heads up fellow Reddit users, this is a long READ...

My name is Amber. I'm a 17-year-old female teenage girl, and I've had the same guy stuck in my mind for about 7 months (typical teenage girl problem, am I right? ) and I'm pretty sure he does not feel the same... or maybe he does? lol :3

I guess I should start off with some background information about ME and this OTHER person. 

 Let's call this guy ""Tyler"", just in case he ever finds this... Tyler is an 18-year-old boy that I met through work. We hit it off great. I knew that he was interested in me, since he would always stare at me from across the kitchen. He was also very shy around me at first. I then found his Instagram one night, and asked for his snap (I was not in my right mind atm, you know what I mean..) and he willingly gave me it the next morning. 

I didn't really start talking to him until one night after work, we surprisingly got off at the same time. He offered me a ride home and I declined since my parents were already coming for me. I then snapped him that night and apologized. This then grew into a smaller chat with him saying ""my day was a little better because you were there"" This is the night that I would regret in about 5 months or so...

I then figured out he had a GIRLFRIEND! and at the time I had just gotten into a relationship. So we were both taken. This didn't stop him from flirting with me though! lol. We then started texting A LOT. 24/7 we were texting each other about the most random things, mixed in with his extra flirtatious comments he would throw in. This comments being telling me im ""pretty"" and lowkey telling me I was hot. 

We then talked more at work as well, and it got less awkward between us. Hed start to touch me (NOT in dirty ways LOL) Little things like touching my back or shoulder when he walked past me, touching my hair and my arms. didn't think much of it...

We somehow started hanging out OUTSIDE of work. Just going on long car rides at 2 am talking about things or going out bowling or to eat. He was starting to feel like my side chick (but boy version) and I didn't know how to feel. (we were both still in relationships at this point by the way).

summer came and he informs me that he broke up with his GF because she never wanted to hang out with him.(to this day I still believe he broke up with her because of his developed feelings for me..) I still was with my boyfriend at this point too. The whole summer we hung out, we had a little work party at the end of August and (this will sound bad) Im pretty sure he almost tried to take advance of me. 

A couple days after that. He just stopped talking to me.TOTALLY cut me out of his life like we never talked before and I had NO clue what I did. I would text and snap him and he wouldn't answer... and of course, this made me REALLY upset. I cried all that night.. 

Finally one afternoon in September he answeres me. He tells me that he and his EX (that now lives 6 hours away from him since she went to school) are back together, and that he wasn't really over her and that us being friends wouldn't work anymore becasue it would cause more problems ( WHA does that mean?, and ofc my heart was CRUSHED even more!!) he said we could still be friends, but I know it would never be the same. 

jumping up 3months, I decided to take him off of all social media because my attempts to reach out to him have been fails... just this past week I added him back on snap just so I could see how he's doing. (too scared to snap him again thou since i yelled at him before I cut him out). 

Its like he was faking his emotions and actions the whole time.. even though he admitted he liked me it just seemed like he wasn't ""hurt"" or bothered by the fact that we don't talk anymore, and I was only affected. After all of that, how could he just cut me out so easily? it doesn't make sense. (still won't tell me to this day WHY he cut me off in the first place). Seemed like he really enjoyed my company, and i really enjoyed his and I really miss him and I cant seem to get him outta my head.. (and yes im still with the same boyfriend as before) and i DOUBT he feels the same as me right now... Are we secretly meant to be? sometimes I feel it.. lol

647,"My boyfriend's sister will not go to school. She hasn't been going to school for around a week and a half now. All she does is stay in her room doing nothing or sleeping, occasionally coming out for food or to use the bathroom. She will not even speak to us other than a nod or a grunt. We've tried everything we could think of; grounding her, taking her electronics away, no more tv, just plain yelling at her, and even trying to physically put her in the car, but nothing works.

Prior to her refusing to go to school, she had become increasingly more irritable. She refused to do her chores, she was starting to fail classes, and would throw tantrums whenever someone did not do what she wanted. She had never really done this before, so it was an obvious change. Her mother noticed these things immediately (as all good mothers do) and tried talking to her about what was going on, but she did not want to talk to her, claiming she 'could not trust her'. As a different solution, they contacted a therapist to see if she would be more comfortable talking to them, but she refused that as well.

The first day she stayed home, we discovered a duffle bag packed with all of her clothes and makeup, plus some food and water. It was obvious she was planning to run away, to where we still don't know, but we're pretty sure she was going to run away with a boy named Gavin (presumably her secret boyfriend). After confronting her about her plans to run away, she had her phone taken away (she is 13, so her phone is pretty much her life). This was around the point when she completely stopped talking to everyone.

The 3rd day she stayed home, they were obviously very frustrated, so they tried to pull her out of bed. When trying to pull her out of bed, my boyfriend's mother claims that she saw cuts on her arms, but we still can't confirm it because she will not come out of her room or get near anyone.

I suggested that she maybe look through her phone to see what is going on because who knows if it is really something serious (suicide, drugs, etc), but they don't know the password to her phone and she refuses to tell them. I tried finding ways to get into the phone but none of them have worked. The only thing I could think of that might work is maybe taking her fingerprint while she's sleeping? I know it's crazy but I couldn't think of anything else.

I was wondering if a similar situaution has happened to anyone else and how that worked out. Also, if anyone had some suggestions for things that could maybe help her or get her to go to school that'd be great.",29Jan2019,1

And I believe her. She’s told me all the personal things about her, like her body count, and the last time she had sex (7 months). We came close to having sex, but I guess she wasn’t ready but she definitely said I “tempted her”. She’s just infatuated on how confident I am in myself. But she’s been testing me recently I feel like.

1. She downloaded a Tinder. When I was hanging out with her friend, her friend was telling her what Tinder was and she said she wanted to make one. Didn’t think too much of it or care because I know what we have. But thats just a supporting detail.
 
2. She hardly texts a nigga. Last time I heard from her was yesterday at around this time. Again, didn’t think too much of it because I don’t think too much of texting anyways and it’s not that serious.

Hi all,

Very recently I began a new job at a boutique health/beauty retail store. I have never worked in retail before and mainly have experience in childcare so you can imagine how pleased I was that I got the job after the interview!

However... my manager informed me that I will only have four training sessions (two of which I’ve already had) before I am going to be by myself in the store for my shifts, as the store is very small and I suppose doesn’t need more than one worker on at a time. I am extreeeemly anxious about this. I managed okay the first two training shifts but there is still so much I don’t know and I’m terrified of being by myself and making a mistake, especially one infront of a customer that I don’t know how to fix right then and there. I’ve been taking a notebook to my training sessions and writing down everything she tells me so I can look back at it for reference, but there is still so much I don’t understand, especially the till system and the records we need to keep if certain of purchases.

What do you suggest I do? I’m becoming more and more nervous for my first shift by myself in about 4 days, but I need this job. Any advice would be beyond helpful right now.",29Jan2019,1

What I mean by that is that I act completely different with almost each and every one of them. It's not like I'm trying to fit in with them, I just act different and I have no clue why. With one group of my friends, I'll act mature and a little suck up. With a different group, I'm known to be the one who's up for almost anything, even if it breaks the rules or even the law. When I'm by myself, however, I'm usually more laid back and I generally don't care about what's going on. 

Is that normal? Does everyone act different around certain people in such dramatic ways? Why do I do that? Is something wrong with me?

See I still find it very difficult to be emotionally bare and intimate with people as I'm not used to giving so much power over to someone. or at least that's how it feels when I've tried to be open.

I’m a healthy late 20s guy who’s pretty satisfied with his life. Recently, at my gf’s request (she’s a therapist) I decided to take a look at some therapy options out there to do some sessions and explore myself.

I did a couple of intakes and was psyched to start sessions...until I realized from the prices that were being quoted back that I would be paying around $135-$150 per session per week. I’m entering these sessions with the expectations of it being my lifestyle for at least a couple of months. And having to pay this much money is shocking. What made me even more angry is the fact that my gf makes nowhere this much (she gets $35 per hour from her firm).

As much as I respect therapy, the cost for it is almost predatory. If necessary, I can pay the 600 per month (it’s around 10% of my salary after tax) but I want to save up for the future. it almost feels like I’m putting financial stress and the stress of fitting it into my schedule to do something that is supposed to help with my stress...

I had lived for 19 years in a small village in the mountains, more goats than people (population: 3000, mostly elders). I was very happy when I moved out because ***I'm meeting new people***! (Being LGBT and academically inclined makes you a victim of bullying in places like that).

But during these four years my health has just worsened. I was already depressed but it got worse, and I got insomnia. I hear my neighbours, my flatmates, the cars that pass by my street... Everything. And I've tried every method to reduce the noise but my hearing might be too good for my sake. 

I go back to my village one weekened a month because it's the only time I can sleep well (you can hear absolutely no noise, even if you are in the street. Maybe some insect, or the wind, or your steps, but nothing else). Also I enjoy my mother's food which of course it's something else.

I'm not sure if it's related or because I've been outside nearly every day this winter, but since I got home from dogs this afternoon, I'm in so much pain.

663,"This is long so bare with me. Also, first time poster so I apologize for any mistakes.

Backstory: I’ve been friends with this girl (lets name her Sara) for about 5 years now, we met my college freshman year, we were roommates for a year (best roommate I’ve ever had), she was my maid of honor at my wedding, so we been close ever since. 

Here’s the problem: She is always been a big drinker, she would drink several times a week every week, even alone. Now I dont mind her drinking but she has severe depression and anxiety, and has sleeping issues (she can sleep for over 20hrs nonstop and is always tired) and is prescribed everything and anything (xanax, aderall, anti psychotics, etc) its always worried me that she mixes alcohol and all these pills but its her life and the few times I brought it up she always told me she needed the pills and alcohol hasn’t affected her. I’ve also tried to convince her of seeing another psychiatrist but she refuses to this too, whenever she is on all those meds she acts so out of it, like she is not aware of her surroundings. 

Anyways, fast forward 5 years (Im 24, she is 25) and her tolerance for the medication is sky high, her mental health has not improved at all. She admitted to me and my husband to take from 4 to 11 tabs of xanax in a day or she just “doesnt feel it” and the drinking constantly (at least every weekend) continues, in addition to about 5-6 other meds she takes. I kept trying to talk to her about it but its pointless.

About a month ago my husband and I went over to her place to visit (she lives at home but parents were out of the country) she looked tired most of the time but thats not unusual. We left at around midnight but I forgot my glasses and had to go back, she opened the door and looked like I had woken her up from a 10hr nap. Anyways, I grab my glasses and Im ready to leave when she starts to lose balance, Im a bit confuse at this point and hold her for a second then suddenly she is completely out. I start screaming for my husband who is waiting for me in the car, he comes in running for his life, picks her up and we tried for a good 30 seconds to wake her up not knowing whats happening. Im ready to call 911 when she finally wakes up, she has no recollection of me coming back for my stuff, and looks very confuse and angry. After staying with her for an hour she insists that we go home, I insist I stay but she says no, and that she’ll call me if she needs me. 

I cried the entire way home. Im horrified and really worried about her, my family told me I need to have a serious conversation with her about rehab, but I know she will discard that option immediately.

665,"Sorry this post is long but I need any kind of advice I can get.

I’m bi, I’m dating a gay guy and his family hates me. 
I’ve never had this happen to me before as I try to be the most respectful and kind person with my friends or partners families. I thought we started off great, I met his mom who lives out of state when she came to watch my bf graduate, and there I also met his aunt, his grandma, his sister, her husband, and his dads family. I was shaking hands and even got a hug from his mom so I thought it was going really well!
Fast forward a few months to Thanksgiving, my bf was invited to his grandmas house which was very nice of her. The problem is, I wasn’t invited. Same with Christmas. My bf and I live together and have been since March 2018. It’s kind of rude to only invite my bf but I think I took it with a grain of salt because maybe they just wanted to see him without my interference? I have no family around here because I moved across the country to be with him and since March I’ve known nobody. Kind of sucks but eh.
Anyways, after he talked with them they invited me too. It was sufficiently awkward. His grandma at Christmas bought us both a stocking and I thought that was so nice of her to even think of me, I said thank you and opened her gift and it was a few gift cards which I was thankful for. At the end of the night she took my gift back, saying it was for show since I shouldn’t have come. Yikes.
Then last week, she calls my bf and doesn’t know I’m in the room hearing her talk. She asks my bf what my info is “just in case I do something to him”???? She asks him my social security number, my middle and last name, birthdate, place I was born etc...is this normal? They also said they didn’t trust my family. (which they’ve never met and all my family lives in other states across the US...they don’t know each other at all)

I asked my mom about it and she’s saying that maybe they don’t like the situation that my bf is in (being gay) and his family is taking it out on me. But then why would they think I’d actually do something to my bf? He and I have dated a little more than a year and it’s a happy relationship. I just don’t know what I’ve done to his family to make them resent me as much as they do. How do I make them realize I’m doing my best with them? ",29Jan2019,1

Throwaway for this one.

So about a month ago I got scammed for 200 euros for buying an Iphone which never arrived. He called himself Jordi. He sent me a track-and trace but postnl (he lives in the Netherlands) said that it was a track and trace from a package HE had received a month ago. Postnl can't give his address due to privacy rights, but He had given his address over mail. I did go to the police but as expected they couldn't really do anything about it because it was only 200 euros and I live in Belgium. SO I made another email and said that I was interested in the Iphone he sold. He called himself Jan-Peter this time. He also gave his address and it was the same street but a different number. With the fake email I made, I have however also gathered a photograph of his face with a can on his head and a phone where he has written Jan-Peter on to prove it was legit.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Threaten him to go to the police unless he sends the 200 euros back? What do you guys think. I will answer the comments tomorrow because I am going to sleep now. Have a nice evening yall and watch out with payments over internet or do it with PayPal. Lesson learnt the hard way.

669,"I am currently a freshman in college. I attended a different campus to one of the top universities with hopes of transferring the next year. I am doing very well here, have a 4.0 (2 A+s and 3 As), a junior standing, am a supplemental instructor for a Biology course, am working on publishing my research in chemistry, and am in the honors program. Still, I can't seem to get over the fact that I was rejected from this top school in the first place. 

During high school, I started out in all regular level classes because neither one of my parents are educated and didn't know any better. However, I decided I wanted to become a doctor after taking Biology as a freshman, so I moved up to all APs and honors classes. I did very well at first, but then my dad left us during my sophomore year and everything started to fall apart. My sister was hospitalized, my dad was making the divorce a living hell for my family, and I was slowly breaking. I tried so hard to be strong and get the grades I needed, but I continued to get some Bs because I could not study as well as I needed. I went to starbucks or the library as often as possible because studying at home became impossible. 

Then during my junior year, when I had to be on top of my game in order to get the test scores and grades I needed, one of my teachers sexually harassed me. This made me fear going to school, and I tried to cope with it on my own. My mom was struggling to get my sister to attend school, having weekly meetings with counselors and having them occasionally come to our house to get her out of bed. I felt like I couldn't tell her because she was already under so much stress. I ended up not studying for my ACT, getting 2 Bs, and dropped out of my precalculus honors course so that I could take it over the summer instead. When my counselors brought up college, I felt terrible because my one goal was to attend this college I am trying to transfer to, and the GPA they wanted was a 4.6 and an ACT of 32. Still, I was told my scores would have to be higher because I was a poor student in a high income area. I felt broken and just wanted to avoid the issue entirely. I had so much to handle already and thought my only option would be to take a gap year. 

Finally, as a senior, I retook my ACT and got the 32 I needed, but my GPA was still a low 4.3. I knew I would not get into this school or any other top schools, but I applied anyways. This year, I met my boyfriend who had a double legacy at this school, had a 4.95 GPA, got a 36 on his act, and was exceptional in a sport (hes won various awards, was captain and was the only person to play varsity as a freshman). He stood by my side throughout this entire process and continued to tell me I was smart enough and that my situation just hindered me. Ultimately, I had no options I was satisfied, so I decided to go to the other campus of my dream school. 

I am continuing to struggle because I hate it here so much, even though I know I will be able to transfer easily and may even get into the honors program. My boyfriend continues to tell me I am extremely intelligent and that very few people coming from my situation would be as successful as I am at the moment. I know deep down that he is right, and that I am smart, but I continue to compare myself to other kids from my high school and dream college who had the money, the legacy, and married parents. I am also aware of the fact that there are other kids who attend this university who probably struggled as much as I have, which makes me feel stupid. Does anyone have any advice for me right now? I am scared to be a transfer student, and fear that I just am not good enough to be here. I continue to fight through this pain to get the best grades possible, but this thought still frequently enters my mind. ",29Jan2019,1

674,"I'm 26 years old, from the age of 19 to 25 I've been abusing alcohol and weed, constantly overeating, and playing videogames all the time, jobless and not studying anything (NEETing), completely wasting my youth away. When I turned 25 I decided to turn it all around, I really don't even know why, just got sick of it all. 

I've been completely sober for 9 months (I still play a little here and there), and I've lost close to 40kgs, started going to the gym, I've been focusing on my health for a year now and I feel like I can finally call myself a somewhat healthy person, I can't even describe how much better I feel now, drug free, active and eating a well rounded diet, it really is a night and day difference.

The obvious choice for me from the start of my recovery has been going back to university, coding was my choice since it really caught my interest and I've been coding as a hobby for the past few months, the university people I have talked with emphasized to me that you really don't need to be a computer wiz of any kind, and that most people who enter can't code at all, that really convinced me to pursue the computer science degree, I passed the exams and school starts in 8 months.

My mother who has helped me the most through all this is really happy about me going back to school. After talking with people who are studying the same study program I know part time job is possible but working full time might be too much, I'm from the EU but I gotta pay tuition now since I'm old (1K USD a year, 5K total) almost nothing so that's not really a problem, but I can't fully support myself while studying, and I'm really tired of leeching of my mother (she has a very high income, but it feels really bad at this point)

I'm really scared of going back to uni, scared that I'll fail, that I'll drop out after 4 years without getting my masters, however people who graduate this particular uni have virtually 0% unemployment rate and very high paying jobs, IT degrees are in such demands that even the gap years won't be an issue for most employers, just getting a job scares me even more, I've been working part time and been offered full-time (I hate that job), working dead end jobs until I retire is my worst nightmare.

But since almost all of my waking moments are working and dealing with being an adult, I just can't take the time to decompress and calm down. I feel like I've got a bowling ball sitting in my chest that's about to break loose as I lose my shit on the next person that says something wrong. My wife is absolutely amazing, and sees that I'm struggling to keep things together, so does everything she can to make things easier for me. I try as hard as I can not to, but some times I take it out on her. She forgot to fill up the car one day after using it, and I spent an hour thinking about how angry at her I was. Thankfully this time I managed to calm down before seeing her so I didn't say anything stupid, but that's not always the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a man of action. If I see something wrong, I fix it. If some one is doing something wrong, I correct it. If some one points out to me that I'm doing something wrong, I correct it and take advice. My sense of pride lies in doing things properly, the right way. But the world doesn't give the slightest fuck about doing things right, it's all about pride and money. I don't know how to deal with the excess of arrogance and greed I'm surrounded with on a daily basis, and I'm worried I'm going to crack someday and I don't know what that will look like.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I cope with all this anger and stress? How do I deal with knowing the world is running at 10% efficiency and the powers-that-be prefer it that way?

679,"I’m using a throwaway because there are very specific circumstances that could link back to me. I might delete this later because I’m afraid someone I know reads it. This is going to be a long one. But just thinking about someone reading this already feels like being less alone with all these thoughts. English is not my first language, I have never written any of this down and I am drunk - I apologise in advance.

On the surface I seem like a very accomplished person. I (male) am in my mid-20s, I moved out to a big city when I was 20, I just finished med school and will start working as a doctor soon. I was always the class clown, I was never bullied, people think I’m funny and nice.
In reality, there has been so much stuff going on beneath the surface for the better part of my life. I am just desperate and don’t know what to do anymore.

It all started when I was 12. The careless child that I was, my parents sent me away to a private school in what can only be described as a religious cult. I lived with a family there whose son (few years older than me) started to molest me, basically from day one. (I should add that I was molested when I was about 5 yo as well - male cousin, few years older. I couldn’t really remember this incident until I was much older.) Coming from a very religious family, these incidents were the only form of sexuality I had ever known about or experienced. I lived with the family for a year until I was able to tell my mom about the abuse and got relocated to another family. I started to be depressed during this time. I was attracted to boys and attributed this to the abuse. There were so many nights where I was laying in bed, crying, trying to literally pray the gay away. I stayed with the cult for another 1.5 years until my expulsion from school. So I moved back home. When I was 17 I had my first crush on a boy. And this is when everything went downhill. After developing feelings for a boy for the first time, I started to realise that this wasn’t going away and it took me longer still to figure out that my sexuality wasn’t a result of the abuse. With all these feelings, I developed a major depression because I knew my parents couldn’t handle this. 

During the day I was mostly functioning okay. I kept up the facade of a happy boy pretty well. On the inside I was dying. As soon as I was home and alone every day, this indescribable darkness would wash over my body.
Every night I would be in my room, nearly unable to move because I couldn’t find the strength. Every night I would seek out the darkness and silence of my room and just sit there. Sometimes I would enter the front door and couldn’t even reach my room and just slept on the floor. This worsening depression would last for the next 5 years. I didn’t want to live anymore but I was also too paralysed to seriously harm myself apart from minor things. In my desperation I sometimes left notes to myself, literally writing on a piece of paper: `Please find help!`And the next day I woke up, laughed about it and the cycle repeated.
During this time I came out to a few of my friends I met at university. 
Because of the years and years of keeping my sexuality a secret I felt like I was never really friends with anyone because they didn’t really know me. This lingering feeling always stayed with me even though my new friends accepted me the way I was. 
I continued to visit the cult like once or twice a year. I had friends there and would stay in touch with them, always with the knowledge that they probably wouldn’t even look at me if they knew the real me. 

When I was 21 I finally went to therapy and continued treatment for 3.5 years. It took a lot of effort to work through all my stuff and I was much better after finishing the treatment.
A few months later, I got into a fight with one of my closest friends and he told me that I always overestimated the level of our friendship. After years of trying to accept friendship and love from other people, this confirmed my deepest fear and single-handedly pushed me into my next depression that lasted a few months. Because I was so frightened that my friends weren’t really my friends, I lashed out and destroyed even more friendships in the process. I started to really hate myself for the first time in my life. Who would want to be friends with someone like me? Who would want to be in a relationship with someone like me? And since that time I have never found my way back. I have become really shy and socially awkward, I am unable to talk to strangers or connect with anyone. I have 1-2 close friends left and I feel so alone, unable to form new friendships. I have never been in a relationship, I was never loved back by anyone I developed feelings for.
During therapy I came out to my sister and my mum. My sister loves me and accepts me. My parents are a different story...

My dad has been depressed for as long as I know him (yes, it runs in the family, grandparents and siblings included). He has psychosomatic pain so that he is in pain for most of the week. Stress and problems in the family lead to a dramatic worsening of this illness. As a result, my mom has been managing their lives for as long as I can remember. This has made her ill as well with strong stomach reactions whenever she is stressed. Being the Christians that they are, they resent psychotherapy and have never sought out any help.
The experience of coming out to my mom was terrible and much worse than I thought, I don’t want to go into details. She made me promise not to tell my dad and told me I would be responsible for his death. After this I never came out to my other siblings, fearing someone might slip up. My mother sent me a lot of material for conversion therapy and told me maybe this is God’s way of telling me I shouldn’t marry a woman and I should go do missionary work.
After that, I didn’t talk to her about my sexuality for about four years. A few weeks ago I texted her a joke about me marrying a guy. My sister told me that my mom broke down crying and had to double her stomach medication for a few days because she felt like it was eating her alive. So, there is nothing to suggest that they will be accepting of my sexuality in the foreseeable future. It is painful for me not being able to come out to my whole family, but I just can’t do it because I am physically inflicting pain on them. 

Yesterday a female friend from the cult texted me out of the blue, telling me that there have been „horrible rumours“ going around that I have a boyfriend. This is not true of course and I have no idea where this could come from (my social media is kept ´clean´ of any indications). But I’m also unable to deny everything wholeheartedly because I don’t want to lie to keep these friends. This is where I am now. I knew this day would come when someone would find out something and all my friends in the cult would drop me immediately. I don’t know how much talk there was about me and I don’t know if I can bring myself to go to a cult wedding I am invited to. With everything that has happened, I feel like I can’t afford to lose even more people. I don’t have a family that gives me any support, I am potentially losing more friends because of these rumours and I’m left with 1-2 close friends and the inability to find new ones. Since yesterday I have been in a depressed state again, I almost forgot what it feels like.  I just feel lonely, I haven’t been so desperate in a long time.

(F) I went through a rough break up a couple months ago and recently met some amazing friends at the perfect time. They've (M) been really supportive, they've never been disrespectful or taken advantage in me in any way, they just treated me like an actual friend. They're the friends I've always imagined.
It's pretty hard for me to connect with people so when I met them, it completely turned my life around. They're just as sensitive as me, they get everything I'm saying and we all seem so genuinely interested in each other's lives and well-being. they started spending the night at my house every weekend for about a month, we got drunk a couple of times, but we could just sit in my living room and talk and it would always be a great time. We can all just laugh at each other and call each other dumb asses.

 One of them has a girlfriend who was fine with him spending the night as long as our other friend was there. I always made her feel welcome and told her she could stay over anytime, too.
The other friend likes me but understands that I don't want anything other than a friendship.
The guy in a relationship told me that he found me attractive, got super fucked up one night and for some reason mentioned it to his girlfriend but she never held him back from hanging out with me. He loves his girlfriend very deeply and  would never be unfaithful towards her. He also told me that it would be a bad idea to date our other friend because he's not ready or built for a relationship at the time, on a couple occasions. I'd like to think it wasn't out of jealousy. 

Lately, the past two days i haven't heard from him. He hasn't been opening my messages and was even suddenly unsure about a trip we had all planned to California, when it was his idea.
He was always the friend that I was closest with, we were like brother and sister. He'd vent to me about all his problems and even listen to me. We'd just sit outside for hours and talk and he was very appreciative of all of our friendships and told us he hoped it lasted. We were together every day.
I'm unsure if I should give him some time, maybe about a week? I have no idea why he started ignoring me and I'm not sure if he's been talking to the other guy or not. Im trying to figure out why he did this.. we both didn't think his girlfriend would stop us from hanging out, but maybe she did? I'd hope he'd tell me if that was the case but he just slowly became distant and completely started ignoring me.
Maybe he noticed me and the other guy getting closer and was mad about it?
Maybe he just got bored?
 Does anyone have any ideas?",29Jan2019,1
689,"So basically, my friend is a little unstable. He’s very controlling, and he’s a violent drunk. He tells me how I should and shouldn’t act (I don’t listen, but still), last time he got drunk, he wouldn’t let me leave his house and said he was going to have ‘words’ with my parents. He’s also once made me withdraw money from my mothers bank account so that he can buy alcohol with it, and if I didn’t do it he’d quote ‘send his brothers round’, 

I know in the past his brothers have raided someone from my old colleges house because of some sort of issue that I don’t know the pragmatics of, and the family dropped all charges. I’m worried he might do the same to me. He gets annoyed when I don’t reply within about 3 minutes on social media so I can’t cut him off because he’d probably turn up at my parents house or something, 

I don’t know what to do. ",29Jan2019,1
690,"Hey I feel like this would be a good place to ask this so here goes: I am by no means a perfect student, I get good grades and do well in my classes getting A’s and B’s. School just makes me so depressed though, I am a junior and I’m tired and have fell into old habits to cope which I am not proud of due to the stress of school and just trying to do well. Here’s the thing I’m just not sure if I’ll be able to do university in the future. I mean I can barely handle the stress of high school what am I gonna resort to in college you know? I’ve already decided I want to take a year off to see but I just don’t know if it’ll do me any good. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do? My parents want me to go to a four year but neither of them did and everything turned out well for both of them so there’s not a huge stress for me to go but that was a different time and I don’t want to screw myself over for the future.",29Jan2019,1

I just started a new job for a couple of days, and I feel like I’m making a big mistake. I wanted to return back to my old company because of the people and work culture there. The difference between my current job is that it’s a contract position while my old one was a permanent one. So, I’m also worried about my employment status and stability.

Should I keep staying for a month to try and adapt? And on the downside I have to pay a month’s salary for penalty 😞",29Jan2019,1
692,"Here is the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a less than stellar driving record. His insurance premium alone is around 360$ a month on a 2013 family sedan.

* 1 at fault incident
* 2 not at fault incidents
* 2 speeding tickets in the past year with 6 points (took the safety exam and got 3 taken off)

This insurance premium is absolutely destroying his budget. We checked a Geico and Progressive quote but they are very similar, and I don't expect him to find any relief that way. He needs the car to drive 25 miles each way to work, so just dumping the car is not really an option and we are in a relatively rural area in PA that you really need a car for. His driving has improved, but he can't afford to pay for this for the next 3-5 years, and his car still has around 3-4 years of payments on it and of course he needs to have comprehensive/collision because the bank owns the car. I'm looking at options to sell, buy something in cash, and just get liability insurance on, but there's some unfixed damage to the car that is going to make that less than ideal - I'm guessing he is upside down on the loan as well but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas for what to do?",29Jan2019,1
693,"So first off, I plan on being totally honest with my parents about this whole situation. I’m not gonna lie to my parents, I just want to know what you guys think the best way to go about this is. 

A couple days ago me and my roomate were smoking weed outside of campus using a bong. After we felt like we had enough weed in our system we headed back to our dorm to watch some South Park. Our bong smelled terrible, like it made the whole room smell like weed, so we sprayed a bunch of Febreze in our room to hide the smell. After about 30 minutes, we got knock on our door and sure enough it was our dorm buildings police officer guy and a couple of RAs. To cut this story short, we were honest with the other police officer that showed up later and we got our weed stuff taken away. Police also took our phone numbers and left, we weren’t charged with anything from the police but my roomate and I had to talk with some head people from our college.

Essentially, I have to take a one hour online class and write a essay about that whole situation and it’s gonna cost $100. The $100 fine is going to be seen by my parents, and I’m about 75% sure the charge will be titled something about weed or breach of conduct or whatever. Either way, I should tell my parents.

I know my dad has smoked weed before and he’s pretty chill about this type of stuff but I’m not sure about my mom. Both of my parents are kinda the typical white Christian conservative type, so I imagine they’re gonna be pretty mad about this and on top of that, I’m in Idaho (as I said in the title), super illegal here.

So, what should I tell them? I gotta talk to them over the phone since they don’t live in Idaho so that’s kinda making it worse. Right now, I’m just thinking I’ll be honest about it, I’ll pay for the class and I’m gonna answer any of their questions. If you have any other advice for me, please tell me. Thanks all, wish me luck

TL;DR: I smoked weed in Idaho, got caught by police, didn’t get in trouble with police, have to take a $100 class through my college, parents will see the charge in a couple of days, what do I tell my parents?",29Jan2019,1
694,"I've been working for over a week now and I'm still anxious about going into work and dreading it, is this even normal after a week? Everyone seems to act like I should be accustomed to my schedule and fit it fine when I'm still worried about it.
