0,"My roommate agreed to find another roommate (since our other roommate was leaving Aug 1st) while I was away for an internship this summer.1. She never advertised it and I ended up having to do it for her 2. Had to get pictures from the other roommate that was moving out because she also wouldn't do that for me 3. Got upset and made me turn down a good friend of mine that needed a place since he was a guy. (Which I totally get, but we were desperate and I could verify they weren't a creep).

So now I've had to pay extra for August's rent and will probably have to do the same because we still haven't found anyone yet. I've posted on local fb groups, craigslist, etc., with no luck. We've had a few interested, but they all fell through for personal reasons or they found a different place. I don't want to have to get rental assistance either, but I only budgeted for what I was originally supposed to pay in rent money and can't work extra since I'm a student. I honestly don't know what to do.",23Aug2019,1
1,"Here’s a little backstory:

I’ve lived in a bad neighborhood all my life (still do). I’ve seen the statistics and everything around me tells me I shouldn’t be in college. Reading exposed me to the outside world and what it means to be a productive member of society. I promised myself I was going to be the difference in my community by not partaking in the violence, drug use, and crime. In my head I feel like I’m doing my community a service by not partaking in these activities although I always keep in mind that this world doesn’t owe me anything. Relative to my community my moral standards are high, relative to most of California I’m just another member of society. I’m approaching my final semester of community college, but it feels as if I’ve finally hit the brick wall of my own reality. I don’t have a car and I absolutely need one this semester to keep my job annnnd to keep going to school. How do I go about making money fast without hurting anyone? I don’t want to steal and I don’t want to sell drugs, even if it’s for a small amount of money. I don’t have a dime, I only have education and that seems to be worthless at the moment. How can I make money in a short amount of time? I know it seems like I’m making an excuse (if only I had.. then everything would be perfect). I’ve never been picky about materialistic things growing up &amp; I’m certainly not going to be picky about my first car. Where do I even find cars under 1k? Is school not for me?

5,"So, 

I'll try and keep this as brief as possible.
I've been with my GF for 6 years now and we have a two year old togeather and 1 more on the way (just recently discovered).
To put it bluntly, my girlfriend is negative as. She'll find the downside of everything and not to mention in me.
I struggle to stay motivated around her, she stays home everyday, doesnt have a licence ,(shes 25 and I leave our car home every day as I use my work vehicle) I supose she adequately maintains the household, as do I...
I usually work 11-12 hour heavy labour days and I just dont have the energy for her most days, even talking on the phone is depressing.
Retrospectively reading this you might say ""it's simple just fucking leave her"" but I actually really care and love her, shes a great mum too...
I just wish she had more ambition and drive to do something with herself like i try to.
I'm pushing 30 and starting to worry for my future with her, it seems she would be content with doing piss all the rest of her life.

She also is quite moody and cant get a handle over her temper most days.

Any advice??

Thanks.",23Aug2019,1

And this cousin is the exact opposite.  Everything I could want.  After a funny incident with an image of a hot dog toaster,  we have been hanging out a lot.  I feel really comfortable and have developed feelings.  There are a fee problems though.  Pillow case thinks we like eachother and already have something going on who's is false.  So Pillow case is trying to feed us both false info to get us to stop hanging out. And the other problem is that we live in different U. S.  states.  It's like a six hour drive.

8,"I took my husband's surname when we got married. However the marriage isn't working out and we're are talking about getting divorced after 2 and a half years of being married.  I don't have any contact with my dad for about 7 years now, so I don't want to go back to my maiden surname (of my dad) because I really don't want my dad's surname. My mom kept her ex husband's surname after her 2nd marriage which is really generic (think something like Smith), but I don't want that surname because it means nothing to me. Even my brother who still have our dad's surname said he'll want to change it someday. As for my mom's maiden name, neither she nor my grandmother kept it after my grandfather's death so it'll be kinda weird to take that. I don't want to keep my soon-to-be ex-husband's surname either.

As the title says I need an idea for my boyfriends Christmas present, I know there is a lot of time till then but he always says that he already got me something and I want to get him something special as its our first Christmas together .

For a bit of context its hard to tell what he would really like to get and he seems like the kind of person hard to impress with just a photo frame or a custom mug and I'm not looking for something insanly pricey so I kinda need a general thing that a boyfriend would like to get cuz I still didn't figure out much on what he likes so its a tricky one  .

10,"Hello, so in the past couple weeks, there's this guy. He's a friend of a friend. I hang out with him sometimes. But he seems to have, like, mood swings. Some days he's really mopey. He'll just sit at his desk with his head down, sometimes he falls asleep.

But other days, he's very energetic. It's fun sometimes, but some of his behaviors on his energetic days have me concerned. He just says and does things that are...odd.

He tends to be a little obsessive about certain things. He'll talk endlessly about games he's played or some movie he saw. Then, he got this mask. A cheap plastic halloween mask of a sheep and this shirt of the same thing, he treated them like they were the coolest thing. Whenever the teacher was out, he'd put it on. At lunch he wanted to put it on and scare the other kids outside. He brought it to school every day, wore the shirt for about 3 days straight.

One day, i saw him getting bullied. But, he was, you know...smiling and laughing the whole time. Like it was a joke. But i know the bully, he doesn't joke about these things. He's a real bully. Speaking of the bully, he had this wrestling game when i went to his house. He created the bully and was beating him up in the game. I asked why, he said there was no better alternative to deal with it.

There was this girl, he talked about her to the point of obsession. It's all he talked about for a week.

I caught him doing the Naruto run down the hallway, once.

Oh, and a few days ago, he came over for this assignment. He couldn't sit still to save his life. Couldn't focus at all. And, as soon he got to my house, i told him about my parent's rule for no shoes on the carpet. He said ""I didn't know you were Japanese"". Which, we aren't. And he put his shoes on a table. Not the floor, but a table. Then, my weenie dog started to bark at him, like she does all company. He literally got on all four's and started barking back at her. Thank God, my parents didn't see.

Anyway, afterwards, my dad was watching UFC. One of the matches had a triangle choke. He ssaid ""Oh that looks fun. Wanna try it?"", i said no and every day since then, he always asks ""Can i put you in that chokehold"".

That's another thing, i think he might be gay. He seems very, like, hands on. Always wanting to put his arm around other people's shoulder or touching their hair. Just guys though, never girls. Sometimes he'll talk in kind of a lisp. ""Oh, that's soooo fabulous"". He says it anytime something cool happens.

We played badminton in gym class once and he just smacked another boy on the butt with the paddle. Why? No idea. And in the locker room, even after he changes, he just kinda sits on the bench and looks around for a few minutes.

And, he even asked to sit on my lap a few times, as a joke.

But yeah, he seemingly has endless energy. He got in trouble by one of the teachers, and she just kept lecturing him. He cracked a smile the whole time. Made a joke about the vein popping in her head.

Like, nothing gets him down...when he's in an energetic mood at least. He's unpredictable, never violent but he has some bad habits. He's never hurt anyone or anything. I just wonder if i should be worried about his behavior.",23Aug2019,1
11,"I'll keep this short.

My goal I have set out for myself is to live away from the majority of humanity and on my own homestead. I prefer to live alone.

* I've tried living in an ecovillage, but I quickly became burntout and found the work unfulfilling. Specifically, I wanted to be able to claim my work as my own, rather than doing a task just because the group wants it to be done.
* I tried working at an auto-detailing job, but once again had the same issue as mentioned above. I thought perhaps I could save money to buy land for my homestead, but working at a job made me feel even more miserable to the point were I could hardly complete the tasks.
* I'm not interested in college or trade school, both of which are irrelevant to my goal and will only put me in debt and subsequent wage slavery until I pay them off.
* I am depressed. However, the cause of my depression I am certain is caused by not living my ideal life and continuing to exist in the monotony and superficiality of the modern world (see my goal statement above). I have tried at least 3 therapists, and they don't fill this void within me. They admit they cannot help me. I am often more intelligent than they are.
* I think killing myself is out of the question, since I have felt the overwhelming joys of my solitude before. It can be done, and this alone keeps me going. I've called a suicide hotline just to see if they could help, but they were just as clueless as the therapists. 
* Self-help hasn't helped either. It treats the symptoms rather than the cause (meditation, affirmations, etc)

Last year I didn’t really get a college experience aside from the first month of the first semester. There was parties and fun times in the beginning but after that it just felt like school and my friends and I never did anything fun together.

16,"I'm 16 years old and Im currently on summer break. I literally wake up play video games and watch YouTube almost all day every single goddamn day. I feel like I'm wasting my summer, I don't even have any friends to talk to or hobbies. Anything I try like learning to play a instrument or learning a language or hitting the gym fucking bored me and im good at nothing. I am even starting to have sucidial and homicidal thoughts. Especially towards people at my school because I'm so envious and angry. when I was in school a lot of kids always talk about how their weekend was and the things they love to do. I don't have anything to do let alone speak to anyone in my school. Not a single goddamn friend. I even see teenagers making out in the hallways and it enrages me because theyre happy and some even have sex. I once started a fight out of anger and envy when I saw a boy my age (16) slap this beautiful girls ass in the hallway while making out with her, a girl I can only ever DREAM of being with. I don't even know how to talk to girls or people in general. I don't have a fucking clue on what to say. NOTHING. I'm so sick of this life. Please may someone just help me and give me advice on what I can do?! School is about to start and I've done nothing and have nothing to do. The worst part is that my parents are unsupportive and don't encourage me or anything. All I do is fight with them and my 2 younger siblings which brings me more stress and frustration. So even at home I still have no fun. And if you're the type of people who looks at profiles, yes I know I posted this more than once. I just don't have anyone to ask advice for. So I come here to ask people. What did I do today? Eat, go out for a bit and Just walked, went back home and play video games. Listen to music and watch YouTube. What did I do yesterday! The same thing! What about the day before or week before? Same shit! And what's gonna happen tomorrow? The same thing. 

Also I have sucidial and homicidal thoughts not because I want to hurt people and myself or because I'm evil. It's because I have so much envy and anger kept up inside me. I also have sadness and depression. But the anger and envy turn into hate. And the more hatred i have, the more I wanna see the people in my school and any teenagers around me who are happy, having sex, having fun hobbies, talents and friends I can only dream of having, suffer! I feel like I'm wasting my fucking teenage years. I have nothing Absolutely NOTHING to do.

And by the way for people who always say the same shit about waiting to lose your virginity please keep it to yourself! Don't even think about posting your opinion on that here. 
I have reasons why I want to lose my virginity and it's not because I wanna ""fit in"" or look cool or something. It's because I wanna experience sex, I wanna have fun and see how it feels like even if it is awkward. I have many other reasons why. 

Oh and I wanna get some things out of the way, if you're gonna say any of these things:

1: if you're gonna recommend a therapist please dont! Just don't! I get the same shit every time and im sick of repeating myself. I already have a therapist but it's not a fucking solution. And I only see her once a week. I just went this Thursday and I have to wait next Thursday again. And therapy isn't gonna fix my problems.

Fast forward to January, my dad gets in a life altering motorcycle accident and I still haven’t signed up for online classes. Long story short I haven’t been in school since November of 2018. School starts on Monday and today is Thursday. I’ve registered at my old high school, the problem is I’m going to be a junior when everyone I know is going to be a senior and I’m sooooo scared. The thing is I’ve done this twice now, when I was a sophomore I transferred like two weeks after school started because there was this rumor going around about me, I finished school at this school closer to my house where I was bullied worse than I’ve ever been bullied. My question is, should I withdraw for the third time because I’m scared of what people will say about me regarding my appearance and that I’m a grade behind and get my GED or should I just suck it up?",23Aug2019,1
20,"I'm going to explain this as easily as I can because if I get frustrated that will show:  


I work in technology. I fell into this purely by luck. Turns out I'm incredibly good at working in this field. Far better than most. I honestly think its  because I'm totally neutral about my ability in the job, and never feel ""smart"" for knowing how to troubleshoot/putty/AD/SQL/whatever else, so when I study its purely to learn which seems to give me some kind of weird edge.  


In my first job I moved up at lightning speed, and found myself working as something between a Network Engineer mixed with Help desk responsibilities. (I absorbed multiple roles.) I had people non-stop bitching that ""...I've worked for this company for 20 years..."" literally refusing to adopt a new practice or admit they were wrong, to the point that once when we placed an order, and I had to verify it, it cost the company over 1 million dollars and their job because they didn't want to listen to some ""young buck"" in their words.  


After getting out of that position I decided I would look for work at another company. Mostly because the Peers/Superiors I had at the previous job were honestly some of the most prickish people I had ever met. Why? Because I was doing the work of like 2-3 of their team members. This was on top of an incredible level of stress that just wasn't worth the pay.  


This has routinely happened at every single job I've worked at in IT. I move into a position. The company realizes they can give me about 3 times the work of other people and I can easily do it. So they begin firing people and giving me their responsibilities and usually refusing to raise my pay. The last company I worked for did this and my quitting got my manager and my managers manager fired for failing to retain me. When I went back they refused to hire me back because ""We already replaced your position with 6 other people, and its against company policy!"" (The owner seemed pissed that I would ever even dream of asking for more money.)  


So I eventually found my way into my current job. I got put on the literal bottom position. This REALLY pisses me off for a few reasons:

1. I have experience and certifications in a position above my own.
2. They hired people with no certs or experience into positions above me.
3. The interviewer kept calling me a liar (basically.) The guy got fired later down the line, and it turns out he put me in this position because he was trying to retaliate against the company. I was promised a position where I would learn ""a whole lot."" Later it turns out they lied about the position entirely that they placed me in. Its likely the lowest tech position that can even exist.
4. I am now starting to see the same effect as the previous jobs I've worked in. Slowly giving me more work, and seeing 'what I can handle.' The team I am on currently has adopted the responsibilities of over 250 people, who were fired, despite being a 10 man team. They are also refusing to raise my pay because ""can't afford it"" but they are easily affording brand new TV's and Monitors that are unused by the teams they buy them for.
5. If I quit, odds are they are fucked. No one on my shift is knowledgeable about the job we are doing but me. Meaning they will have to move someone from day-shift. Doing so is still going to fuck them because there is a different set of information to know between the shifts. I'm not paid enough to record information in a manner that could make me replaceable, no matter how much they put in into policy that I am supposed to.
6. ""We can't promote you because we need you in this position."" Management is trying to steal my ideas, instead of giving me credit or promoting me. This has already happened three times at my current job, and I shut up and its clearly pissing them off when I call them out on it, and that I won't give any more advice, because its not helping my career. However my personality flaw is being blunt and stubborn, so I tend to not care that it makes them mad.
7. Its not worth the money, but neither is moving jobs. Why? Because my current job gives me lots of 'down time' to do whatever I want, and I work from home, however if I moved jobs and made almost twice as much I would either (eventually) be expected to be on call all the time (or at least M-F) and will be given responsibilities continually until I would deserve a raise and they would refuse.

I'm sick of working in tech: Initially I enjoyed repairing things, but to often 'repairing' something comes with the downside of dealing with other people. And it seems like after quitting my first job this has only gotten worse, with more convoluted ticketing systems, and having to verify/double check with everyone that what I'm doing is ""A-OK"" because ""you don't want to piss off manager X, because this could impact their reports and save the company a dime and show they aren't needed!""  


What I really want to move into is Art. I don't want to even work in technology anymore but I don't seem to have much of a choice. I'm in my 30's and don't know what to do. My wife says she wants to go become a doctor (works in medicine, shes about 8 years younger than me) and if she does that I can quit working and per sue art, but its looking like another 3-5 years  before she can/would be a doctor.",23Aug2019,1

I and the girl in question are of the same height, we like the same genres and I started our conversation with an excellent joke as to the nature of Baroque art. I know she loves Baroque art, yet she did not laugh.

As context, we conversed while in our high-school book-club. An institution I started last year, and where the promoting of real literature takes first place in my heart. I told her she could have this spot, the center of my attention, the cost only being a date to an upscale bookstore a few hours away.  
 She rejected me, and now my ‘friends’ in the book club are accusing me of driving out another girl, slander that is completely fictitious! I have had words with those few, and attempted to stress the reasoning behind my actions. They failed to understand my logic.

I have seen how her pupils dilate, I have seen how she loosens her shirt while I am around, and I have seen her sneak glances at me.

36,"Preface: My best friend lives with my parents and I, we are both 20 years old and my best friend will be 21 in 2 months. My parents have never had issues with us drinking or partying as long as we are being responsible (have jobs, going to college, etc.) Which I go to college full time and she has a full time job.  

Now onto the story, last night my friend and I were home drinking and had a couple joints in a jar. My dad works overnight so we only smoke when he is gone, since he has been a little weird about weed in the past. We had a chill night and ended up going to bed pretty late. We woke up this morning and my friend and I were about to head out to go swimming. She checked her bag and that’s when she noticed that the jar, her lighter, and the bag it was in was gone. Now we have spent the last three hours tearing my house apart because we don’t wanna it to be just lying around somewhere. The only possible explanation is that my dad went through her bag and took her stuff. I know he has done this to my older brother in the past but that was because my brother would steal my parents money to buy the weed, which is not the case here. He has been gone all day so we haven’t seen him. I guess we will find out for sure if he took it when he comes home. 

Do you think that it is appropriate for my father to snoop through my friends bag and take her stuff? Is it valid to be upset with him if he did take it? I just don’t feel like it’s right for him to be going through her bag.

TL;DR - My friend and I think my dad snooped through her bag and took her weed.",23Aug2019,1
37,"I know this post risks coming across as entitled but please hear me out before judging. Throwaway account because my family is on reddit.

I'm 26f and in the future (maybe next year, we haven't planned yet) I'm going to start living with my boyfriend of 7 years. I'd also like to get married before and he's not against the idea, so things might go slower than that, but that's more or less our time frame. We have a wonderful relationship, he's a great bf and we communicate well. He knows what I'm about to say, is willing to do whatever makes me feel more comfortable, but I honestly can't decide what's best and would like some external imput.

The issue: I'm from a middle class family. my parents always did all the cleaning and cooking when I was little, and later I helped them. I can't say it's my favourite activity. I'm not very good at it, I can survive on my own but it's not my thing, I'm not one of those people that take pride in a shiny floor. I just want my environment to be clean. At the same time I'm also particular about the way things have to be done. I love routine. I don't like to have people messing around with my things.

my bf however comes from a family wealthier than mine. He's never done anything around the house because they have always had at least one person to come in daily and do the cleaning and most of the cooking, except on weekends. He can do those things btw, just doesn't have to do them. He currently lives on his own but next door from his family, and the cleaning lady also visits his house on the regular. His parents work a lot and she's been there since he was a kid, plus he's used to having people around and doesn't mind them at all. Like, he wanders around the house in the old pants and t shirt he sleeps in, says hello and goes to get breakfast. He doesn't have a problem with people touching his things, moving them, cleaning his clothes etc., because that's always been his life.

On the other hand, I'm shy. I'm an introvert. Having strangers around gives me a bit of anxiety, and I wouldn't want to go around the house in my pjs with unbrushed hair and have to make small talk with people. The solution is easy, aka having them come when I'm not home, so that wouldn't be so much of an issue (although my work schedule is quite odd and so I'd definitely end up meeting them anyways). I'd like to clarify that I don't feel they're inferior to me or anything like that, it's just my shyness. I tend to feel protected when I'm at home and I feel like that would disturb it. I also feel embarrassed having strangers do things for me while I do nothing and watch them (but at the same time, given that I genuinely hate cleaning, it would be rather odd if I joined to help).

Another big deal: as I've said, I'm particular about the way things have to be done. I also have some ocd tendencies and, while they are not a big problem per se, I can't stand the idea of some stranger touching EVERYTHING in my house when I'm not there, without knowing what they have touched before, if they washed their hands after touching the bin and so on. my parents are pretty much like me, and my bf knows this, plus he's always been kind of a clean freak so he always washes his hands anyways. At the same time, again I'm shy, so, since I'd have a pretty extensive list of requests which might seem weird to people who don't know me, I don't think I would ever have the courage to approach anyone and tell them how I want things to be done (plus I don't know if I'd completely trust them).

There's also the privacy aspect: someone potentially snooping around your things??? I've heard some people clean their bedroom on their own to avoid having people there but that seems like a partial fix at best.

I'd be ok with a small home to clean on my own with just my bf, but his family wants to gift us the old family huse they recently renewed. It's going to be part of his inheritance, so I don't think he could decline it, and selling it would be distasteful at best. Plus, he's used to that kind of home, not to a small apartment (although he's open to whatever I want). It's honestly a really nice place, the location is very convenient for both of our jobs, it's a great area for our (future) kids, and we're starting to buy furniture together, which I love. The issue is that it's HUGE. The terrace is bigger than my old apartment. This is not an humble brag, I'm genuinely concerned. I don't see the two of us managing to clean all that on our own, but I'd like so much to just be with him without anyone else.

I know I may sound bratty but honestly this is a problem for me. Any advice? TIA!

Once waiting for her mom to pick her up for 20 mins. then another time before her class she invited me to sit in her class with her. (She didn't know snyone In class) Then we talked again as she was waiting for her mom to pick her up after. 30 mins ago unsure now should I ask her or wait (scared to ask in person at time)

pros
1.We both looked for each other after class
2.She invited me intto her class
3.She would went to the library with me if her mom didn't come
4.We both on the awkward side

doubts

 2.social wise my main friends in my major are noticing and making comments(I'm obviously showing favortism)
3. If I do this is my last time asking
4. last two times got a no b/c ask one day after hanging out on the last day of school decided it went well asked to meet next morning b4 I left and secound time she said out of town when i was in college for a few days in summer

42,"I'm not sure where else I should post this, but for two semesters straight, I had a huge crush on one of my professors. I'm 19 and I'm not sure how old he is, but he's probably somewhere in his 30s. Sometimes I thought my crush on him might have been mutual because of some of the special attention I got, but perhaps that could've just been me overthinking it. He was always super sweet to me, he would pull me to the side to praise me, and he would often joke around with me and tease me (in a friendly way of course).

I wouldn't say he was the best looking guy, but he was pretty handsome and the way he carried himself always caught my attention. His hair, outfits, and his voice were also really nice. The way he treated me, the interest he showed in regards to the things I would talk about, and the way he would talk about me also made me feel a lot of things.
Throughout these two semesters, I really wanted to be with him. Sometimes I'd think about being held in his warm embrace, and sometimes I'd imagine... more sexual things.

Anyways I'm still a student and I'm enrolled in the same college, but I'm not in any of his classes. I see him in the hallways every now and then and he always smiles at me and says hi. The problem is: I still think about him quite a lot.  I really don't know what to do with these feelings.",23Aug2019,2
43,"Well, we all heard about amazon fire, and personally i heard about it when he was in it s first week, but why would the media ignore it, well, i see it as a business, we use to hear about fires in amazon forest, so it's not something new anymore, it starts being boring, so the media wouldn't put the spot on it, cus it wasn't new, but when it reached 3 weeks, it starts being something new for ppl, something that will make a huge buzz on the media, it's all about the money,

And, on the other hand, Brazil could make a lot of money ncs of this fire, ppl will donate, and go visit it to see the fire and it s damage, i mean, the Brazil could really really make a lot of money from it, i think it s just a business, and the media hadn't covered it too soon just to wait till iy causes a lot of damage,

He can’t work yet due to his health problems. I’m also doing most of the chores in the house because he’s not used to do them. Lately, we’re a bit short on rent and he’s mad at me because I didn’t make enough. Plus, I gotta pay most stuff like groceries and utilities. Also, he asked money from me for his car repair so he can get a job. So I’m thinking if I should get a part time job on the side. He would also expect me to do the cleaning, cooking, taking care of our dog, doing to laundry and washing the dishes. At first, I didn’t mind doing them because I understand that he has health issues and I gotta take care of him. But as the time goes by, I’m starting to resent it and growing tired of it. I also pay for his phone bill and for his cigarettes because he will get stressed out if he doesn’t have any of them. Sometimes, he would yell at me or complain to me because I cooked the food in wrong way or the house isn’t cleaned up. He would also accuse me of cheating on him or lying to him which is completely untrue. He would also project his bad mood onto me. I’m so tired of being treated this way.

48,"I am a heroin addict. Another heroin addict/friend contacted me and asked to borrow 300$ for heroin in exchange for his handgun. I trusted him (stupidly) and said sure no problem. He had already borrowed 500$ from me and I had told him that I couldnt loan him anymore until he paid me back. He had a large check coming in the mail and I wanted to help him stay well until it arrived. He gave me the gun and I put it in my gun safe.
A few weeks go by and contacts me saying that if we go and buy some heroin through his guy (who I use sometimes) that he would have enough money to pay me back once he sold some. This has happened regularly and I said sure. He asked me to bring the gun with and I told him we could get it from my house once he paid me back. I brough 600$ with me to go and pick up. Give it to him, he meets his guy (supposedly) and we drive back to my house. We get out of the car and start walking to my house and he turns around and hops back into his car(which had his 5 year old daughter in it) and drives off. I've accepted that money is gone, its whatever I make enough that I'm fine with it.

Unfortunately I still have his gun. It's clear his intent was to get the gun back and ditch me and since I blocked that option he chose the dope over the gun.

Now options as I see them:

1) Leave the gun somewhere and tell him it's there and to go fetch it. I personally like this option the least as I basically gave him 1400$ and his gun back for nothing. Keeps me out of legal trouble however.

2) Turn the gun into the police. I dont know what they would do with it. Probably return it to him and then we end up with the first solution but have police involved which is never good for current heroin addicts.

3) Keep it. Could easily just keep it as that's the point of collateral. However since it's not registered to me and he knows I have it he could theoretically call the police, say I stole it or something and then I'd have cops show up looking for it. I could easily prove via texts that he used it for collateral with me but I'm sure we just both get arrested for drugs use and potentially selling or something.

4) destroy/toss it. No idea how to do this and I hate the idea of putting the gun into a trash can for a kid to find and hurt themselves if they found bullets. Unless anyone can suggest a safe method of disposing of it (like a facility or company) then theres no way I'm doing that.

5) somehow transfer it into my name. Find a way to transfer it into my name using proof he gave it to me and then stole from me. Doubt this is possible but that's why I'm asking.

Any other ideas are welcome!

My friend is kind of pressuring me to try it despite me mentioning I’ve having second thoughts.

My fiancée and others in the family hate the idea (her brother isn’t even showing up bc of the theme), but she says she still can’t help that she loves her dad and is being a bridesmaid. 

She wants me to go with her. I’m highly uncomfortable with the theme. We’ve talked about it and I’ve expressed my discomfort. She really wants me to go, but says she can handle it if I don’t. But it’s obvious by her reactions that her feelings will be at least a little hurt if I don’t. The wedding is in two days. Am I being too sensitive about this?

78,"Ok, so, this feels a bit weird as I \[22F\] am in a situation where I feel the need to parent my own parents. This is going to be pretty long so, bear with me.

I grew up in a mixed cultured family that was strongly Catholic and we would go to church definitely every week if not a few times a week. My dad grew up Catholic as well- both of his parents have passed and he has 4 other siblings (1 almost completely not religious, 1 casually religious, and 2 who practice the faith still but is very open minded and is very informed on different perspectives of the religion, if that makes sense). 

My Dad \[White male, 61\] is the most stubborn, narrow-minded person in his family and is not open to criticism or change. He is so firmly stuck in the extreme side of Catholicism that his life just revolves around anything pro-life, American politics / pro Trump (we don't even live in America). He doesn't believe in global warming and keeps posting about GW hoaxes, he is anti-feminism, super sexist (believes women should be having babies/ one of their main purposes, should be in the kitchen), and also somewhat racist (despite marrying someone from a different race) as well as being  homophobic, and xenophobic. Pretty much the full package. 

Due to all this, so many relationships around him have been breaking down around him. My parents have been fighting almost every day ever since I could remember. These fights are often contributed by my dad's attitude and ideologies, but my mum also seems to have pretty serious un-diagnosed mental illnesses. This has also seriously affected me and my sibling's mental health as well. He has no real friends, he thinks that the people who protest abortions outside hospitals with him are. 

Over the last 5 or 6 years, he has discovered social media- specifically Facebook and Youtube. Through these sites, he's been following people and pages that align with his ideologies and beliefs and that kind of stuff is all that's ever on his feeds. If you open up Facebook (He never logs out), all that you come across are grisly abortion pictures with extreme captions, or that LGBT people are going to hell, and that Trump is the best person to fix all this. On his Youtube account, most of the videos that come up and are recommended to him are videos about going to hell, and how the world is going to end etc. He shares so many of these posts in a day as well as private messages his family with these links over Facebook as well as through email where all of them have either told him to stop sending these links or have completely stopped responding. He doesn't stop sending them nor does he show signs of stopping any time soon- he is literally forcing his beliefs down other people's throats. My younger sibling and I have both blocked him on all social media and we don't really talk to him. 

My Dad is a teacher by profession, which is very worrisome especially with all the ideologies he has and knowing how big of a role a teacher is in a young person's life. He spends so much of his time on these sites- first thing he does when he wakes up and the last thing he does before going to bed. He has no other hobbies, he doesn't exercise. I feel like these websites are just sending him into a downward spiral the more he spends time on them. It has gotten to the point where his social media usage is affecting my social life as he sometimes tends to comment on local news sites with illogical, attacking views, where my friends are able to see his name and recognise that he's my dad.

One of the biggest problems that is affected by this is that he doesn't have permanent work and hasn't had a permanent job for about 8 years now. He is saturated in such negative views that he hasn't ever tried improving the quality of his life and continues to say that the only goal in life is to get to heaven. All the jobs he applies for, he is rejected even before getting to an interview stage. This has meant that our family's finances have been really rocky for a long time, and my parents are both terrible at budgeting and managing their finances.

My mum and I finally had an intervention talk with him. and he didn't budge with his views but I encouraged both of them to join the gym together as it is a good investment for their health, and gives them something else to focus on other than social media. They haven't signed up yet but are looking to soon (which is a big plus). I also talked to them about mental health and about how getting a therapist is such a healthy thing. They however hold big stigmas around mental health and are very reluctant about this idea. My dad is open to family counselling but rejects the idea of individual counselling. They also worry about the financial side of getting help.

I hope to eventually have a healthy relationship with both my parents, especially with my dad, but I know it's not going to happen overnight. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

**TLDR; My dad has been addicted to reading and watching videos about extremely dark and negative views, which fuels his extreme religious ideologies, on social media. This is affecting all areas of his life including breaking down the closest relationships around him.**",23Aug2019,1
79,"Hey, did something really dumb yesterday and the consequences of my actions have carried out to today. 

I punched my mom multiple times yesterday (on her shoulder/arm) because she kicked the puppy (while he was in his cage).

Long story short, I would have held her back, but my arms are too weak to hold someone back, I have been told when i punch someone, they feel too sore to mive it around so in my anger, I punched her. It was extremely stupid, I know, but I didn't like how she kicked the puppy's cage while he was in there.

She didn't even stop trying to kick him, she just kept trying so I kept punching her. When I finally got her away from the puppy's cage (she backed up to try to get away/block my punches), she STILL tried to get at him and seeing as I was in a position where id be able to push her back, i stopped hitting her and pushed her back u til one of my sibling's older cousin got between us (he left the house, but came back when he heard my mom yelling).

I don't even know why she kicked the puppy, i wasn't expecting it either becuase she's never done anything like that before. 

Just to give more info, as my sibling's older cousin and I were making food, my puppy went over to my brother's room and peed. I didn't know because I was occupied with trying to learn how to cook so when she found that his urine, she got pissed off. At this point the food was already done and I was in my room with the puppy in the cage. (I put him in the cage because he bit me, playfully yeah, but it hurt).

I know I should have put him in the cage before I started cooking, I know i screwed up on that. I know I shouldn't have punched her.

That all happened yesterday and today she's going around telling her friends that i abused her, that I'm copying my friends by not going to school today, and isn't even telling them how she kicked the dog's cage while the puppy was still in there.

I'm tired of feeling disgusting, having to wait to use the damn restroom because she won't let me walk to god damn McDonald's to use the restroom and won't even buy toilet paper until I said i was going to the store with my sibling's cousin.

I'm just sitting here, waiting for my sibling's cousin to come back with the toilet paper.

I want to spill everything to my therapist, but I'm afraid that if this is a big issue that the CPS will get involved. I'm afraid that if they do get involved, my siblings and I will get seperated. I'm afraid that even if the CPS gets involved and sees nothing wrong, my mom will be much more angrier with me.

82,"This stems from early childhood. My house was always really boring. It was small, and it didn't have anything that would entertain young kids.

We didn't have any gaming consoles, we didn't have a pool, and we only had boring healthy foods. In retrospect, I'm happy to have had that kind of upbringing, but my house was not a fun place for kids to hang out at.

When I hung out with friends, it was usually at the park or at someone else's house.

I always knew other people's houses had different things than mine did, but the first time I felt shame was summer after fourth grade. My wealthier cousin from Florida was visiting, and she said aloud that her house would have been so much more fun since they had all these things my house didn't have. A swimming pool, a pool table, and all these different things. I don't think my cousin realized how rude that was, but we were kids and I don't blame her.

I later came to learn that cousin's family was actually really wealthy, much wealthier than mine. I had already known rich people existed, but I always thought rich people were few and far like Michael Jordan and Jessica Alba. That was the first time I realized that even among people I knew, we had wealth disparities.

Ever since that day, I have been uncomfortable inviting people over.

My anxiety was made a little worse on another instance in middle school, when a computer geek dude was over to work on a science project. That guy noticed that my computers had the Intel Pentium 4 processor, as opposed to whichever faster processor he had, and he said aloud that my computers suck. That exchange, as silly as it was, still invokes a fear that if people visit me, they'll find that all my stuff is really low quality.

I make a point not to make friends with superficial people, and none of my friends would judge me over how wealthy I am, or what kinds of fancy toys I have. But I still have anxiety about inviting people over, and it stems from these experiences, and maybe one or two others.",23Aug2019,2

This guy is a little snowflake and has short man’s syndrome to where he wants to fight anything in his path. I wasn’t scared of him, but I stopped talking to her out of respect. Fast forward to when we were 16. We started talking again, and she said she wasn’t dating that guy anymore, and that they were done. Supposedly he was really abusive (which I don’t doubt). We started talking serious immediately because our personalities and interests match very well. Anyways she starts telling me she wants me to be her boyfriend and she loves me and all this shit. Turns out after a few months of talking, she cheated on me. But you’re gonna shit yourself when you find out with who... yup you guessed it. Small man. I think a piece of me died when I found out, only because I was always very wary to trust people, and I put my whole trust into her. That shit hurted. Especially for a kid like that. I didn’t think it affected me much at the time, but I see the effects as I grow older. Needless to say, I proceeded with caution whenever talking to her. We never fell out of contact with eachother. It’s now 3 years since that whole shit went down, and we still communicate on the regular, except since then, I have really limited the amount of times we actually meet up.

I am currently majoring in International Studies and German. If I drop International Studies I can graduate a semester early. It would save me time, money, and stress.

91,"   Today I had to put my cat down. I had him since I was 8 years old and he meant the world to me. It all happened so suddenly and I don’t really know how to handle it. It’s really tough on everyone in my family and making the choice to euthanize him was a very hard one. 
 
  He had a rare type of cancer a few months ago, and he then went through tons of tests and radiation and surgery and it was extremely costly, but we went through with everything and traveled hours away to help him and made sure he was always the most comfortable he could be. The specialist thought he’d have another year at least- he only had 8 weeks. 

  He was doing great in cancer recovery until about two days ago when he had stopped eating. He wouldn’t walk or move (he fell over every time I tried to help him move) and he kept hiding so we knew something was wrong and took him to the vet. They had a specialist there instead of the doctor (she worked in the er for pets) so luckily we had the very best. 

   As soon as she saw him she saw how lethargic she was and even the technicians who knew him said they didn’t recognize him. They ran a series of tests and he had a very low blood pressure (43, the normal should be 90-100) so they didn’t want to stress him out very much. Too much and he could’ve died while he was on the table getting tests. 

  So the tests came back and she showed us his x Ray and we could only see how his lungs were being crushed by fluid surrounding them and there was so much of it that it had covered and surrounded his heart in the x Ray, so the specialist said it was a heart failure. I forgot the name of the type it is, it was very upsetting to hear. We tried to see if we could travel 1 hour+ away to get him more help, but she said the stress could kill him and make him more uncomfortable. 

    As we heard the news we were all crying of course but I knew we had to put him down. He wasn’t him anymore and he couldn’t breathe almost at all. He was wheezing and not eating and drinking so much water.

   We all wanted to be with him as he died so more of my family came to say goodbye to him (he was a VERY beloved cat) and it was really emotional but we stayed the whole time. I feel like seeing him go really changed me and I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same way I was before. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope/grieve?

98,"I'm having a really hard time in high school. I started freshman year at  our local high school BHS. In November of that year,  I went to a  residential treatment facility because I was really depressed and  suicidal. While in residential treatment, I decided that I couldn't  handle going back to BHS. The bullying was horrible, and there were just  so many reasons why I knew it would be bad to go back. Because of this,  I decided to finish out the year on Connections Academy. I finished the  year in Connections, but my parents weren't a fan, and nether was I, so  I started a fresh year, Sophomore year at a local online school, as  opposed to Connections. I did that for all of sophomore year. Now, I'm  starting out junior year, doing the same program. I really don't like  it, and am considering switching to a different school called Big  Picture. It's an ""alternative"" school technically, but I feel like it  would suit me well. I really want to get out into the world. With Big  Picture, it's internship and project based, so I would complete 120  hours of an internship, as well as projects to demonstrate my learning. I  really like this idea, however it would mean switching schools again.  Online school I just find to be really isolating, and it's also really  hard to motivate myself with it. Also, last year I really struggled with  a bit of cheating on assignments and tests, because I was so  overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. I feel horrible about it, and I really  want to start over. Please here me out though. I'm sure right now I  sound like a horrible kid. I know cheating is horrible, but please here  me out. I've gone through a lot of trauma. When I was about my mom  started really struggling with alcohol. She ending up really getting  bad. I have multiple horror stories from that, to include seeing her  passed out on her bed, watching my dad restrain her while she was drunk  and almost overdosed on pills (she wasn't normally suicidal, but the  alcohol interaction with her meds caused it). Anyways, my dad would be  off at his job, and my sister and I would have to deal with it. My mom  ended up getting a DUI, but fortunately following that she went to  treatment and turned her life around, and has now been sober 2 1/2  years, and I'm really proud of her. Anyways, in sixth grade my sister  (twin) started self harming, and became depressed. She then developed  anorexia. She went to multiple residential treatments and was very  severe. She ended up going to the ER multiple times, as well as the  hospital. In fact at 15 she weighed only 68 pounds, and her liver and  kidneys were failing. So I watched that. I also started self harming,  and attempted suicide about ten times or so because of being so  extremely stressed. Anyways, her anorexia lasted about five years, until  last month, she was in a tragic ATV accident and died at 16 (my only  sibling, my twin, gone at 16, which is hitting me really hard). My  depression still continues. I've also gone through, as I mentioned, a  ton of bullying, as well as being very traumatized in residential  treatment. To top all of that I'm also autistic. I say this, because I  want you all to know that while all of my school switching sounds  ridiculous, and that my cheating was horrible, I want you all to know  how desperate I was. I do assure you that I haven't cheated at all this  year, and I am really focused on turning everything around. Anyways, I  figure my transcript is already pretty crappy, but my question is,  should I transfer to Big Picture? I really think it could be good for  me. Also, will colleges get worried because of the fact that it's a so  called ""alternative school""? I'm not a bad kid. I've never been  rebellious, or done anything illegal, or anything bad, aside from the  small bit of cheating, which I feel terrible for. Is there any hope for  me? The college I want to go to has an 80% acceptance rate. I'm really  hoping to get in. Thank you all so much.",23Aug2019,1

Im a complete homebody and I am very close with my family, leaving them was so hard. I decided to take a chance and go to college far away. I am in Colorado. I have been wanting to lice/attend school in Colorado since the start of junior year. So finally getting here felt great and I was excite. My boyfriend also attends this university and I can not even express how hoary I am that Jim and I are on the journey together.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I can not help but feel like I do not belong in a college setting. I do not like this experience at all. However, today is really my first REAL day (since my parents left last night). I feel like I am lost and I want to go home so badly. I miss how my life used to be and the thought of having to live like this for the next four years makes me want to drop out so bad. BUT this is only THE FIRST DAY. I just don't really see myself making friends. Girls are always rude to me and guys only talk to me because they're trying to get with me. 

This just blows so far and I hate it. Somebody please give me advice.",23Aug2019,1

Do I say anything? And if yes... What? I really like her as a tutor and I know the swastika isn't a nazi Germany original symbol, and it has MANY interpretations... But my mind keeps going 'what if?'

107,"So back in May, I told my bf (ex now) that I wanted to take a break. We’re broken up now and he attends the same community college I do. We still talked as friends and I was telling him that I was taking Statistics this semester. He said he had a calculator that I could use and that I could get it from him after class. I was like okay that’s cool, I’ll just meet him at his car to grab it, since that’s where he said he was. I walk over there and we have a normal convo talking about our classes and what not. Then, he goes on to ask me if I thought our relationship was toxic and I say I think it was. He proceeds to ask me how it was toxic and I was like “I have to go, I’m meeting my friends for lunch.” Then he proceeds to follow me to my car, which is about 3 parking spots away, and I knew if I let him in my car, he probably wouldn’t leave. I only unlock the drivers side door and get inside. I roll down the passenger side window where he’s standing and I’m like “what?” He proceeds to tell me that I don’t need to move on too fast and asks me if I’ve made out with the person I’m talking to right now, which is none of his business. I tell him he needs to leave, but he leaves his arm hanging inside of my car through the window so I couldn’t roll my window up all the way. He wouldn’t leave until I answered his questions. I told him multiple times to leave because I needed to go. I felt so uncomfortable and kind of scared. I have never had anything like that happen to me before and it makes me scared because he knows so much about me to the point where I’m sure he knows how to get inside my head. I cried on the way back home from school that day because it took so much of an emotional toll on me.",23Aug2019,2
109,"Hey there, so a bit of background- I was pretty good friends with this guy up until June, when he ended our friendship with little  explanation as to why. It was an absurd and sudden thing that is out of character for him. I then quickly continuously tried to rekindle our friendship but then I gave up and didn't bother for a while. It's now been two months.

He did so much for me and he's just not someone I can bear to live without, as cheesy as it sounds. I want him back but I have no idea where to start. He's very stubborn and refuses to listen to me. 

Please, Reddit, how do I get my friend back?",23Aug2019,1

I'm building different variations of control boxes and it's not repetitive for me, at least yet. The people are nice and the work enviorment is super chill. I don't feel rushed to get things done, I'm pretty slow working since I'm still in training and I have to be sure I don't make any mistakes. 

The only problem I have with the job is my back. I'm 6'3 and the long table we work on is to my waist. I have to bend my upper back down in order to drill the tiny screws into hard to reach parts and in just minutes my back hurts like crazy all day long. I made a comment about it to my supervisor and he said don't worry your body just has to get use to it. The pain never stops until break time. Then when I get back to work it's okay for like a minute but then the pain comes back. I thought it might get better after a couple of days but now when I come home from work my back is still aching and it feels worse then ever as I lay down. I feel like I'm damaging my back and if I keep doing this job I'm going to get a hunched back.

115,"(TL;DR AT BOTTOM)
I’ve been here for 6 months. It’s my break away from retail and I enjoy being away from it. I’m not making minimum wage. I get 40 hours a week. There’s beer in the fridge. I wear whatever I want and I get along with my office. 

My office is the president (D), the commercial project manager (S), and Office Manager (Myself).  It started off great, learning everything pretty easily. They ended up stacking more work on me, but strayed on teaching me how to do this work. I ask simple yes or no questions, and I usually get a mere “Idk, it’s your customer.” Or a figure it out answer. They present these problems to me, offer no solutions, and get angry when it’s not done how they want it. Did you know you can take a picture of a check wrong? I just learned this, the hard way. 

Lately, I’ve been miserable, absolutely miserable at work. Nobody is in the office anymore, and when they are I’m usually being scolded or stiff armed when asking for help. My boss has no patience whatsoever with anything that inconveniences him. He yells at everyone, gets attitude with everyone and even gets in peoples faces. He’s yells at customers for asking questions, and spits at our crew when they do something wrong. I never leave work feeling accomplished. I never relax anymore due to stressing about work, or what’s going to go wrong and explode on me this time. I spent all last weekend stressing over a simple mistake and how  it would bite me in the ass. 

TL;DR: I thought I loved this place but my boss scares/stresses me to the point of physical illness and I’m not feeling accomplished or relaxed ever. 

What do I do? It’s so soon to leave, and I don’t want to go back to retail but I don’t even know what field would be a middle of the two?",23Aug2019,4
116,"Hi there. I have an annoying university classmate and friend who I used to enjoy spending time with. We would only ever talk about like homework and career opportunities but that was our relationship and I was totally cool with that. He always had a competitive streak to him but I either brushed it aside or just laughed it off because it never really bothered me. Fast forward about four years later and it's really starting to get on my nerves. I will take responsibility for encouraging this behavior from him because I never told him that it doesn't bother me before. I try to tell him now and he always tries to twist things and make it seem like he's doing it for MY benefit to make ME a stronger person. I personally do not buy this at all. I mean he has shown care towards my schooling and stuff and we've worked well together but I have little doubt that this person has a toxic competitive streak. 

Another thing that really bothers me about him is that he has said something bad about everyone in his life. Nothing terrible of course, just comments like ""oh this person is so annoying"" and ""I wish my dad would just leave me alone"". I get the sense that he's very self-centered and doesn't care about anyone who has helped him before. I've told him to not be so negative but he mocks me and says that I'm living life wrong and need to be more hard headed. Overall I think he just lacks gratitude and only keeps me around because I'm a valuable resource. 

Now I know we'll likely lose contact once school is done, but should i just end it now if I sense that he'll hurt my feelings later on? It's just tough because despite all this, he has actually been a great help with school in the past. I feel like I'm the bad guy if I tell him I'm done.",23Aug2019,1

123,"On mobile. Sorry for formatting. Throwaway account because she has my main

The beginning part takes place over the summer where I did not see her in person too often.

My friend (Let’s call her X) has a lot of mental health problems. Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, the whole thing.
She often comes to me for advice and help. I try my hardest to help.

Recently everything has got a lot worse. She has become toxic. I also have mental health problems, so I have to keep my mental state in consideration when helping her. She says that when helping someone else, my mental state doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is helping the other person.
I respectfully disagreed, and she picked a fight about something small that I did in the past.

 She went on rant after rant about god knows what, I can barely remember. 

I couldn’t deal with the stress of her life plus the stress of my life by myself. I told her that she needed professional help that I could not provide. I basically send a breaking up letter saying I couldn’t continue this friendship if I wanted to stay sane. She went on a rant about how I didn’t care for her and that if she died no one would notice. This scared me, so I continued talking with her even though my gut told me not to.

After this incident, school starts.

Fast forward to tonight. She tells me and everyone she knows that she can’t trust us and that we were all gonna have to earn her trust back. She makes us all promise that we won’t leave her and threatens suicide if we do. For me, she makes me promise to go to a concert with her in about a month that she knows I can’t afford.

I really want to cut ties, but with her threatening suicide, us sitting right next to each other in 2 classes, and having my friends being mutual friends with her, I don’t see a way out. My mental health is declining, and every time I speak with her it’s always about her.

Am I overreacting? If I’m not, what do you suggest I do? We will be attending the same school for the next couple years. We will have the same classes together all year long and neither of us would be able to switch out. I honest to god don’t see a way out of this situation.",23Aug2019,1
124,"So I'm a very skinny guy (18), and have virtually no muscle. I started my current job a month ago, and couldn't be happier with it TBH. I like the people and the environment, although my manager can be a bit of a witch. Sunday she had someone's else teach me how to use a C3 cable to push more than 4 carts at once. Then had me getting carts from the parking lot and bringing them back in. I was sweating my balls off for 2 hours, I've wrecked my work shirt. The worst part is I literally cannot efficiently move more than 2 carts at a time. Any more and I can't turn them enough to get into the store, and pushing them is a struggle. I had a co worker I didn't really know give me shit for it and mock me (well not really but more like ""You seriously can't push 4 carts?"" It was the way he said it.) And I told him ""yeah I'm weak as shit leave me alone."" When I struggled to get 3 in at once but finally managed to do so he was ""bravo."" About an hour and a half in I saw my manager talking with another manager and I know for a fact they saw me as I grabbed 2 carts when there was 6 right there ready. She didn't seem so bothered. My dad says to just do what I can do, which I'm just going to and if they ask I'll saw ""I'm sorry I literally can't"" and sound like a pansy. I just hate doing the carts in general because of how much I sweat. I felt so bad for customers as they grabbed the cart and felt the handles and went to get another, only to have to resort to getting a cleaning wipe from the thing next to the carts. I've never done work that physically tasking so it was a shock, and my arms only stopped aching yesterday. I've changed my hours around so I'll be working 4 hours after school (4-8) so hopefully if I do get the carts again it'll be cooler. I considered going to my local target to see if they were hiring (pay is 14 and hour as opposed to 9 and they only have you doing cashier work according to my friend) but they aren't hiring so :/. 

I guess I just want advice on what to do if they complain about it to me. Nobody likes her and I think I've accidentally soured things by rejecting 2 offers for extra hours (only got 8 hours for this set of 3 weeks) because I couldn't and she's like ""don't come crying for hours if I offer them and you don't take them"".

I really think he holds onto this very dark place in his heart, and I would like to see him release it. I told him I thought maybe it’s time he go back and find a way to make peace with it. He asked me how, and I said I really don’t know. I don’t know if you visit the places that traumatized you...? I don’t know if you write letters and mail them to no one in particular...? Send balloons in the air with messages attached...?

129,"So my sister and my boyfriend both have jobs that they’re not the biggest fans of, mostly because their managers/higher ups don’t respect/listen to/understand them and their expertise/positions. Basically, they like doing what they do but the people can suck.

Well, they’ve both started just randomly dumping their work complaints and scenarios on me. I’ve always been a listener, so I’m totally fine with sitting back and being an ear, and I want to support them both anyway because I care about them and want them to see that I understand their frustrations.

But it’s started to get old. Sometimes my boyfriend will spend the first 2-3 hours of us hanging out each weekend just talking about work, and our calls during the week frequently are 80% him recalling everything that happened in his workday. My sister will also just start talking to me about how horrible her boss is while I’m watching a video, getting my stuff ready for the next day, etc. which just sucks my downtime away.

I really do want to be there for them both and I do make an effort to respond and ask questions and not just nod and “uh huh” all the time, but over the last few months I a) have noticed that I know a LOT about their jobs to the point where it starts to feel like I work there too, and b) I am kind of okay with my job so I’ve started to feel like any minor problems/weird situations I would discuss just seem small in comparison to what they talk about dealing with.

I know people will probably say “just talk to them about it!” but I’ve let it go on accidentally for so long and I don’t know how to word it to where it doesn’t sound rude and still gets across that I want to support them, but it’s just a lot of negativity that I don’t really need.

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Both of them are really good people and I know neither one of them is doing this to an abusive level or is trying to have a pity party on purpose. It’s just gotten to the point where I feel like a sack of flour that’s being talked into all the time.",23Aug2019,1

Started out as a hobby and became something more, writing decently sized scripts in Python and PHP to help manage my environment and improve my day to day life at work.   


Well recently I decided to try my hand at being a dev in test, so I applied around, got some interviews and some of which I  completely nail the first impression at.   


one of which stated that In order for me to do the second interview I needed to complete some homework, so they give me a script.   


Get this script to compare two json files, and have it output the number of trips to a store you'd need to make to satisy the shopping list.  


At first I was confident, feeling good, digging into it and seeing calls and functions I was unfamiliar with.   
4 hours later I""m feel exhausted and stressed, trying to figure out why I'm not understanding how to compare the two json files and why I'm having such a difficult time getting it.

When I do participate in outings/nights out with this couple it seems like all they do involves drinking. Not necessarily crazy blackout drinking or raising hell on the town or getting in any kind of trouble drinking, but they drink literally every time I see them. I have maybe one or two drinks a week. An occasional pint of beer or a small glass of bourbon and some ice is just fine for me every so often.

I don't like girlfriend's friends because while they do nothing wrong, they're just boring people who lack any depth. Aside from the male's marginally interesting government maintenance job I have nothing in common or anything to talk about with girlfriend's friends. Not counting their saving up for a house and getting married soon, this couple has no goals. Their idea of a good weekend is staying in, getting drunk and playing cards/watching a movie and sleeping in the next morning until the afternoon when they'll all watch a cartoon movie. 

Girlfriend asks on Saturdays if I can hang out with them after my early morning work shift, and I keep finding myself trying to find excuses so I can avoid her friends. 

Am I an asshole? Is there any diplomatic way around this? 

Any thoughts or input would be appreciated. Thanks guys.",23Aug2019,3

148,"I am going to try and make this as short and understandable as possible. I currently own three jobs, one managing a restaurant I have worked at for over 9 years, owner operating a landscape company and I am also a decently active realtor. (7-10 closes a year) I also have aspirations to start two business'. One is a passion the other I feel has a decent shot at huge growth. 

Here is my dilemma; landscape is seasonal, real estate is very up and down and the restaurant is the most steady but lowest paying and starting the business requires decent amounts of start up money that I honestly dont have. Recently the owner and I agreed to hire a former manager from one of his other restaurants as this person has a good amount of management experience. She is a great worker etc. He had a meeting with her about giving her some managing duties there (which I was supportive of due to the fact i cant micro-detail everything that happens there) and its slowly turning into an office politic atmosphere that frankly I hate (strictly because of her). the gm was let go several months ago and myself and one other manager have done what the owners have described as an outstanding job of turning it around and building the team there. I feel like this new manager is going to try and wiggle her way into a bigger role and somewhat destroy what we have built.

Now honestly I do not feel like I have a strong desire to be there much longer anyway but my uncertainty is what direction to go. Should I follow my heart and start one of these new business. I should also mention I am the single income in a family of three (wife is a stay at home mom to our one year old) Should I stick it out at the restaurant for awhile or should I pursue more energy into real estate?

any input is highly appreciated",23Aug2019,1
149,"Hi advice community. I’m worried about a situation that has perpetuated for a year now. My mom (53) has been struggling with depression almost her whole life.  These depressive episodes are usually like 10 years apart or so and she’s currently in one. My parents got divorced 11 years ago, so she had a couple of boyfriends since, but now she’s single.

The thing is that now that I’m more mature (26M) she’s constantly seeking my advice on things like how should she act in certain situations, or how should she talk to someone about a certain uncomfortable topic, etc. She complains about my grandma (my mom lives at her house) with me, and all I tell her is that she could find a job and get out of there if she’s so upset, but she says that she’s too depressed for that or that she couldn’t take it in this state of mind.  When she was in a relationship, she constantly asked me for advice or told me how she was having a bad time with her boyfriend, or whatever. I really don’t think that I should be worrying about those things; they make me really anxious.

So, as she has no friends, I’m sort of the only thing she values to live and also the only one that she can talk to, but I’m not sure I can take this much longer. Sometimes I get angry and catch myself giving her advice on how should she can surpass her fears, approach life, etc in a way that I feel like I’m talking to a child or at least like I shouldn’t be the one that tells her that. She’s seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, so I often tell her that she can talk to them...

So to wrap up, my dilemma is that I really don’t want to hear about those problems but I feel that she’s going to get more depressed if I don’t do it. And that gives me an unhealthy amount of guilt. 

What do you guys think about giving advice to your mothers? Or when your mothers ask for advice on these kinds of things?

Sometimes I think: what kind of mother would ask his son about how to solve her problems with her mother(grandma)?

Any reply is much appreciated",23Aug2019,1
150,"My husband (31) and I (30) have a 2 year old. Up until this age, he was the perfect baby. The most easy going, happy little guy ever. 

Now he's still pretty great, but the ""terrible twos"" have kicked in and it's tantrum city. I'm a SAHM, and I'm losing my marbles being with him constantly. Fortunately, he starts preschool in two weeks (3hrs/day 4x/week).

My question: I know when I am an older woman I will regret it if I don't have a least one more child. I always thought I wanted 2-3. 

Now, the idea of being pregnant, having another baby while caring for my toddler, and raising two kids in general sounds like hell to me. 

We live in a super high cost of living area. Day care has two year wait lists and costs about $2200/mo per kid. We can't afford it. 

I have exactly one family member in the area (who is on school full time). Not really any close friends unfortunately, they recently moved to another state. I'm really doing this mostly on my own. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Did you have a second and enjoy/regret it?.

I don't know what to do. If we did have another, it would probably be next year. But now we're really wondering if we could stop while we're ahead...",23Aug2019,2
151,"Hey. Before I get started, there’s important context to this decision. I’m a FTM highschooler, born female and transitioning to male. Last year was when I publicly came out, and thankfully all my class periods had people that were supportive and accepting of me. It was the happiest year of my life. It was the first time I’d ever felt okay at school.

This year, I lucked out and got every person whose ever given me grief, in all my class periods. When I went to sit down, in multiple classes, people would give me the side eye and sometimes giggle and whisper. I’m very obviously trans/gender nonconforming and it’s never been an issue up until this year. It was a really painful experience for me, as most of my classes had none of my friends in them.

The one class I do have my friends in is really tricky. My crush is in that class, and I have a lot of hurt feelings regarding him that he doesn’t even know about. I have a lot of issues with myself being trans, and having feelings for him makes me feel disgusting. I can’t even focus in class because all I can think about how he is there with me, and it’s not a good thing. I don’t want to have him see me get mistreated. 

I’m really embarrassed and humiliated by today’s experience, and I’m thinking I should just bounce out this year, or even just for a semester. I don’t really know what to do.

TL;DR being trans at school is hard",23Aug2019,1
152,"I've really only been friends with her for a few months but we really clicked and just started hanging out all the time and pretty much becoming best friends. The problem starts with her father.

The first day I met him it was clear that his whole family hated him and rightfully so, it was like he couldn't ask for a single thing without yelling and insulting them. I try to act polite to him and he's super nice to me, but it's very obviously a facade. (Even my dog didn't like him)

So I just don't know what to do, I know that speaking up will make thing's worse so I'm sure to never do that, but whenever she talks to me about it I just don't know what to say. Is there anything I could tell her that might help her situation? Any advice or just helpful things at all.",23Aug2019,2
153,"I don’t want to make this post too long but context is needed to get a full picture.

So my grandparents (bio grandpa, grandma by marriage) had full custody of me due to family problems. Now she it’s was an average childhood until my grandpa died in middle school. After that my grandmas toxicity came full circle. She would lie, throw tantrums to get her way, harass girlfriends in high school(and after), emotional abuse and harass me. Fast forward to me graduating college this year and her doctors calling me saying she can’t stay by herself( dementia now and getting too old).  I leave my family ( girlfriend and two month old) to take care of her for a week or two while I prepare to take over the estate and get her into an assisted living facility. During this time I tend to her 24/7. I cook, clean, shower her, help her go to the bathroom, prepare her medicine etc basically everything except chew her food. SIDENOTE- I feel it’s important to know that I have an older brother who has been getting help from her for years ( 200 here and there, rent, whatever he needs). He stole 15,000 out her account one month but she forgives him and later spends 11k on a new car cause the used bmw he bought broke down and he can’t afford to fix it. (I’m not faulting him he went through the abuse too). I get control over her bank account due to her case workers telling me she has been spending a lot of money ( going out to eat, just giving random people money who take advantage of her). I see that she has blew through her savings and used up almost all of the 30k she had since December of 2018. She now has only around 6k total. She wants a private room for the assisted living facility but her with her income she can’t afford It. She makes 3k a month and private rooms are 3.8k and ones with roommates are 2.8k. After entrance fees and everything she’ll be scraping pennies and that’s not including bills for her house and cars so she can’t afford a facility. I came from my home 5 hours away expecting to only stay a week but didn’t know her situation was so bad. Since she can’t afford a facility she needs someone to watch her 24/7 but I don’t want to give my life up to take care of her (especially all that she’s done to me). I can’t work since I have to care for her and I know that going too long without employment will hurt my chances for work in the future. What should I do?",23Aug2019,2

I went inside and was greeted by a man. We will call him Joe. I was getting my pedicure and the woman continuously asked me if I wanted gel polish and repeatedly stated ""It lasts longer."" After about 4 times I told her no thank you I don't want gel, please stop asking me. I then caught myself in a bad mood over stupid things. Maybe it's because I had my homework in the back of my mind. After we're all done, I sat in Joe's chair. He started asking me about work and asked me if I was a student. He then proceeded to tell me about how he came from Vietnam and his daughter is very excited about school. He told me how much she loves school and will not miss a day. His face lit up as he told me stories about wonderful people who his home country admire for being great examples for Vietnam. Joe kept telling me to stay in school and his vibe was just pure joy and love. He told me a little bit about his childhood which was sad. He then received a phone call about his daughter and I overheard he had multiple issues going on. I heard him tell the person on the phone ""It's okay, We will be okay."" He had car issues, his daughter was in a car accident the previous day, and he had 2 other personal matters. I looked at him and said ""How are you so nice, after going through this?""

171,"So for some background, I've been staying in a somewhat small town in the mountains for the past week and a half with my family. We're renting the end unit of a quadplex two blocks from downtown, and since we're only here for a bit, we don't know the neighbors at all. Some of the people live here all year, some are just on vacation like us, and some just stay for the season. It seemed like the unit next to our was empty, until a few days into our stay we noticed an SUV in the driveway, and my father and I seem to remember a strange van being parked in front  as well. (The van isn't quite as suspicious because of all of the construction up on the mountain, but it wasn't marked with any logos or company names). The SUV was gone after a couple days, and the whole time, the only activity we noticed was that my father heard music for a bit on one of the nights the car was in the driveway. (He could hear music because the units are connected). 

After that the place seemed vacant, and a few days ago four packages were were delivered to the place and nobody picked them up or took them inside. The just sat on the porch. My father confirmed the adress and tried ringing the doorbell, no answer. We talked to the neighbor on the other side of us and they didn't know the people either.

Then this morning, we were expecting rain, so we moved that packages a bit under cover do they wouldn't get soaked. We didn't think much of it until we came back from a concert and noticed that the three smallest packages were gone. We just assumed there were porch pirates that took them and felt sorry for the owners that would eventually come home to stolen goods. That would have been the end of it and we wouldn't have thought anymore about it until we realized that their front door was *unlocked*. We obviously didn't go inside, but I did see a little kid's train table inside the window, so we know that somebody owns this place.

I can't understand how a door could be left unlocked like that, and my family is very concerned and confused about the whole thing. I'm probably just paranoid. Am I crazy in thinking something may have happened to this person/people? Should I at least call the police?",23Aug2019,17

177,"I moved out of my parents' place about 7 months ago. I pay my portion of their bills monthly (cell phone, car insurance, health insurance) via Venmo to my mom. I pay all other bills (rent, gas &amp; electric, water, etc.) myself.

I recently got into a car accident. It was my fault, I made the wrong decision and a sedan sideswiped my SUV and was totaled. My SUV just needs a little body work but no substantial damage. 

Insurance is under my mother's name, car is under my Dad's name, he owns it on paper. My dad has been handling all the dialogue with the insurance as I'm reaching the tail end of an 11-day work binge. My insurance is covering the damages on both cars and writing a check out to my mother. Also, I was written a ticket for Careless Driving (2 points). I currently have no points on my license. My court date is Sunday where I hope to talk to the prosecutor and reduce the charge. If I get points anyway, my dad predicts I'll be kicked off of our car insurance.

This leads to today. My dad (via phone call) tells me he thinks the best move is to sell my SUV as is and buy another (used) vehicle. He told me I should make around $2500-3000 from the SUV and then pay for the rest if I have the money. I ask him about the insurance check-- he responds firmly saying ""Don't worry about it."" I ask him what he means. He changes the topic to the replacement vehicle for me. I tell him I can put down up to $5000 if I really have to. He tells me I can sell my current SUV and it towards the new vehicle along with that hypothetical $5000. So I ask him again about the insurance check. I shouldn't have to pay a cent for this new vehicle if I have the insurance check &amp; old car money.

He finally cracks and tells me the check is for $4000. He then tells me he's planning on cashing it to buy a used vehicle this weekend and flip it for more cash-- then pay me back later down the line. At first I said okay, as long as I get the $4000 back down the line. But then he follows up saying he was ""bullshitting"" me and that the check was more like $4700. He then covers the mic on his phone with his hand, probably to talk to my mom and I assume the call dropped.

I call my mom and tell her directly ""no funny business"". My dad heard as it was on speaker and I hear him losing his shit and walking off. I tell my mom that I'd call her back. 

I text my dad telling him not to take advantage of the trust I was giving him. He gets angry and tells me to not bother him with this anymore and to deal with it through my mother. That's when I decided I wasn't comfortable with this whole car flipping business and I just want that check to be deposited into my account so that I can put it towards a new vehicle. So I tell this to my mom over phone and she bursts into tears essentially telling me to just do what my dad tells me and that I'll get my money. I tell her that I didn't like the conversation I had with him and that it was sketchy. I told her I just want to keep things simple. No flipping. She fights me on it saying I need to let my dad do this to help them out. I tell her no. 

She tearfully begins to guilt me into letting this happen. I tell her that this isn't fair, that guilting me is unhealthy behavior, and that this is unfair to HER because this conversation should be between my dad and myself. She tells me that she's handling it because he has a short temper. I told her his temper is not an excuse and that it's unhealthy and wrong that we all have to accommodate for HIS problem. She tells me I shouldn't be like this and that they did their best for me-- more guilting. I defused the conversation because it was clear she was just helpless under my dad's psycho manipulation. 

We decided we'd talk about it again tomorrow, after my dad's temper tantrum settles. If it isn't clear enough, my dad and I don't have a great relationship. He was (and to a degree still is) an abusive father and husband with a very short temper. Part of the reason I moved out. I'm especially hateful towards him right now because it recently came out that he was cheating on my mom for years, even through her recent cancer treatment-- but I digress. I believe I should be given this check immediately because:

1. I'm not comfortable with this car flipping business
2. I'm not happy that my dad was being dishonest with me and outright refused to tell me about the insurance check until I pursued-- not to mention he, verbatim, said he was ""bullshitting"" me earlier and that the value of the check was higher.
3. I've been paying my portion of the car insurance for 7 months and counting
4. I am paying for this $4700 one way or another because my insurance premium is going up
5. I don't trust that my dad will pay me back in a timely manner, or if he's going to make the money back anyway-- he's basically gambling here

So folks, would I be an asshole son if I stick to my guns and take the check for myself? Or should I let them make a little money from my mistake?",23Aug2019,3
178,"I got diagnosed with an autoimmune condition in my last year of college and I’ve been living with my parents since then; I love them and I could never repay them for their support and sacrifices that they’ve made to help me but I’m beyond ready to live on my own. I live in a very small town and the constant lack of stimulation is making me miserable. 

A bunch of my friends from college live in nyc,  I could never afford to live there but I was thinking about maybe finding a place in jersey city or the surrounding area. The problem is the one friend I was planning on moving in with seems to be backing out  now and I just don’t know what to do. I had some comfort knowing that I would be living with a good friend that I could trust in this new place. I’m so afraid of doing this alone especially if I start up with a debilitating flare up, I don’t know if I can handle it emotionally and financially on my own.

179,"Ight I'm 15/M and I have a small crush on a childhood friend that I haven't talked to in a while. We caught up less than a week ago. She has these 2 friends, lets name the black haired one Julie, and the blonde; Pam. So Pam is like really nice to me, I mean like really nice to me. At school today, Pam was sitting with her other group of friends and I was sitting by myself. I wanted to sit by my childhood friend, which we'll name, Jan. So I wanted to sit by Jan, but I was too nervous to do it for some goddamn reason, idk why. But when Pam saw me, she waved at me, I waved back, she came to me and said ""You know Jan is over there if you wanna sit by them"" I said ""Yeah I know, I'm just busy with some school work"" which was complete bs, I was just too nervous and kept scrolling through reddit. So when it was time for us to go back to our class, I stood up and went to the intersection we have going toward the lunch lines and when I was in front of Jan's table, Julie was looking at me. I cant tell if she was staring at me, but if she was, then she was staring into my soul, like for real staring. So I waved bye to Jan and went to my class. When I got to my class I was just saying to myself ""I fucked it up"" over and over again cause I didn't do anything. So really my advice is, wtf is that stare about, and if you see this; I dont mean it in an insulting way, I'm just confused.",23Aug2019,1

I live in DC right now bc my family is here and a parent recently had a health scare so I came back here for a little. I’m originally from TX and have spent most of my life in Montana.

Im moving to Denver in February and while I’m excited and I know it’s the right thing, I’m nervous. I have moved a lot and moving doesn’t usually phase me. But now I have a BF and a dog and a cat and it’s not just me loading up my car and hitting the road, it’s uprooting a life and animals etc. He wants to move (I don’t think as badly as I do) but definitely is nervous about the change. 

Idk why this time I feel so scared. I don’t feel scared like “oh maybe this is the wrong thing to do” scared, but I guess just scared because now there is more on the line and finding jobs (he is a chef and I am a medical assistant) scares me because I want to be sure we can live comfortably. Neither of us make tons of money now (he makes $17/hr I make $14/hr and work PT he works like 50-60hrs/wk so gets lots of overtime) but we are definitely comfortable and I’m scared we won’t find that in Denver and we will struggle.

Idk I’m so scared. I’m just scared. I’m scared of failing and im scared of letting him down - he wants to move but prob wouldn’t if I hadn’t asked if we could consider it - because if it fails, I worry he will blame me.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this.",23Aug2019,1

185," 

My husband (30M) and I (32F) are living with my grandpa (81M), my mum (54F) and my uncle (48M) in my grandpa's house outside of Boston, Ma.

My grandpa has a multitude of health issues. Most troubling are his Chronic Kidney Disease, Diabetes (insulin intake management), Congestive Heart Failure and severe knee arthritis. He also finally just stopped driving. He's been getting senile with hints of dementia and confusion.

My mum has a rare blood disorder which she takes Coumadin for so she won't have a blood clot and Major Depressive Disorder. She has had a stroke when she was 33. She has a very negative and sometimes aggressive temperament.

My uncle is moving to Boston from Georgia and was temporarily living with us until he found a house for his family and sold his old house. It's been over a year and he hasn't bought a house and is still living with us. We don't have a good relationship because he tried to manipulate me when I was 18. I bought my first car from a co-worker who was moving and my uncle sold it saying it was unsafe. He borrowed some of my college money from my mum and paid me back by buying me a new car which he told me he'd take away if I got bad grades in college. Basically, I find him a very manipulative &amp; controlling person and I haven't had a relationship with him since then. His motto is ""ask forgiveness not permission.""

I was recently diagnosed with functional neurological disorder and fibromyalgia. I also have a history of social anxiety, panic disorder and general anxiety. I work as a pet sitter and for the last 2 years it's been full-time with barely any days off.

My husband works as a construction laborer.

To explain my problems I need to give you some back story.

2 years ago my husband and I moved into my grandpa's house. My grandpa was having trouble paying his bills and keeping up with the house, so he asked for help. At the time we thought it was temporary. We thought we could move out once he got his financials in order. That never happened and he refuses to do any kind of budgeting. My mum and grandpa are difficult people to live with. They are extremely needy at all times. They are give an inch take a mile type of people. Living with them was hard but at least manageable.

The real problems started in February 2018 when my mum's dog died, which I took over financially and planning wise. I scheduled vet appointments and specialty hospice care for dogs as well as tried to make the house easier for the dog to get around. I paid for all expenses pertaining to the dogs sickness and eventual euthanization. A month later my grandmother (mum's mom) passed away. I handled planning the funeral as well as pitched in financially. I did this because my mum was unable to and no one else wanted to help with the funeral or  respect my grandmother's death wishes.

Both the dog dying and her mom dying sent my mum into a spiral of depression. She completely stopped taking her meds, laid in bed and cried all the time. When she was up she was nasty to be around.

In June 2018 I had my first episode that would later be diagnosed as FND and Fibro. My hand stopped working and then cramped up and I lost major strength in my dominant arm. I had a claw hand for a week. My arm is still not fully recovered and I can lift less than 5 pounds. I had to stop dog walking and lost some clients.

Later in that summer, my uncle moved in ""temporarily"" while he was looking for a house. He started doing construction around the house without talking to anyone about it. For example, a week after he moved in, he tore a hole in one of our walls because he thought “a door would look nice there.” Since then he ripped the back porch, kitchen and basement all apart but hasn’t finished any of it. This has been extremely frustrating. One morning at 5am on Saturday he decided we don't need an electrician to pull dead wires. Now we don't have a doorbell anymore. He said then work would be done by Thanksgiving. During this time of construction, he had nonregard for other people's time or personal space. My husband helped him a bunch with some of the work, offering advice just to get it to move along. My uncle complains that no one helped him. No one wanted the construction but my grandfather never stopped him because he's the prodigal son. When I or my husband confront him on the work being done, he would either play dumb, completely write off what we were saying, or play the victim.

Since he started doing work, we knew he was only doing it because he is waiting for his dad to die so he can sell the house. I get this feeling because he talks about the value of the house and if ""we were to sell it."" He also did shady crap when he asked my grandfather to take out a $100,000 loan so he could have $50,000. I am assuming that money would go towards a down payment on his new house. The work has still not been completed and we live in a worksite. This has interfered with my business because the house doesn't look good for clients. I don't blame them.

In December 2018 my mum officially cracked. She couldn't handle her dog dying, her mum dying and then my uncle tearing the house apart and manipulating my grandfather. I convinced her to get voluntarily committed to a mental hospital which they stated she was passively suicidal. She got out 2 weeks later. Since this time I've been having to do her meds and making sure she takes them as well as taking her to most of her appointments which are a couple times a week. This has been going on for 9 months.

In March 2019 my uncle ordered new windows for the entire house when we only really needed 7 windows replaced. He ordered $50,000 worth of windows without figuring out how it was being paid for. He was still trying to get grandpa to take a loan out to pay for the windows. Fights over a potential loan were nightly. He's been taking $1,000 from my mum's bank account (which he set up for her) as payback for the windows. She is on disability and only gets $1,100 a month. This is a really messed up situation but she won't set up a new account because she's afraid he'll backlash at her. My grandfather still refuses to put my uncle in his place.

At this point my FND causes me (all right sided) muscle stiffness, intense painful muscle cramps, movement tremor, burning sensations, sound sensitivity, muscle weakness, memory issues and occasionally a stutter. My Fibro causes dull pain everywhere, muscle tightness, fatigue, word finding issues, brain fog, joint aches and memory issues. I also have trouble sleeping.

Even though I work everyday with the dogs, I'm barely getting by money wise. Many of my best clients have left me. The clients I do have can be very needy, requesting work outside of my hours (example: wake up at 5am to pick up their dog). The clients demands are making it so that I don't want to do this work anymore. I am also too tired most days to really play with the dogs.

My husband and I have taken over all the chores of the house. This includes: food shopping, buying household supplies, doing everyone's dishes, laundry, mowing the lawn, cleaning the house weekly, taking care of broken appliances (our fridge just broke recently for example), picking up medication for everyone, as well as driving everyone to their appointments or errands which seems almost daily. My grandfather often throughout the day asks a lot of questions on how to do things or just random jibberish. I don't expect my grandpa to help with chores, but he often goes out of his way to make a mess. He causes 70% of the dirty dishes. When we ask my mum to help she either becomes aggressive like I'm verbally attacking her or she says she'll do it later and never does. My mum also criticizes us for the way we do the chores.

My husband isn't doing well financially because he's had to take time off to take me to appointments and help me. I have trouble driving long distances, so he drives me when needed. 

The reason I'm writing this is because I recently had a drop attack (FND term). Basically my leg stopped working in an instant and I fell. I couldn't feel my leg or even move it and I had to call my husband for help. I'm better now but the incident was extremely scary for both of us. 

I need to start taking care of myself. The doctors say a major cause of FND and Fibro is stress. I'm coming to the realization that I need to focus on getting better, but I can't do that living in my current situation. I have a few dilemmas about moving.

We originally moved in to help out my mum and grampa financially. By moving I feel like I'd be leaving them high and dry. I also have thoughts that my mum will kill herself from the pressures of the house without me. I also want to protect them both from my manipulative uncle.

My other dilemma is financial. Because FND has so many symptoms, I don't think I'll be able to hold a traditional job. I do have a degree in legal admin and I worked for a law office in my town for 13 years. I don't want to return to that line of work, I'm just jotting down my work history in case anyone has any ideas. I was trying Amazon merch and I'm working on a Shopify store but there is no income from either yet. I know this type of income stream can take months to get going if it does get going at all.

My husband has said that he would do whatever he needs to do to support us both. I don't like the idea of not contributing to the marriage financially. The idea of getting social security disability feels like I'm giving up. I'm not even sure if be eligible. My husband doesn't enjoy construction work either and I'd like him to be able to do something he enjoys.

Cost of living is also very high in the Boston area which is another concern about moving out. There are not many apartments that we can afford, that would be close enough that I could still help my family. 

I know this is a lot of information, but I'm desperate for a direction! If anyone has any advice on how I can find a way out of my current situation that would be immensely appreciated. I feel like I'm being strangled by life and I don't know what to do.",23Aug2019,1

187,"I’m not best friends with this person but when we meet up we usually have a good time and hang out the entire day, though we only see each other like once or twice a month since graduating college together a few months ago.

I thought they must have had cancelled plans or they really needed to meet up to talk about something super serious at first.

Before I even open the message they then send an oops sorry that was meant for my mother and then they deleted the message asking the previous question.

I’m kind of suspicious bc I don’t know who uses the word chill when texting their mom and asking to meet by the school we used to go to is kind of weird.

189,"So, some backstory. This year is my first year in college and today there was a meet and greet type thing. My dormmate went so I decided to go because one of my big goals was being more social. 

We went to the meet and greet and sat down and then everything just got worse. So many people were there and I felt out of place, but I toughed it up and talked to some guy that exchanged names with my yesterday. The person next to me didn't even try to talk to me which is fine, cause nobody *has* to talk to me. I just felt super insecure and like I didn't belong there so I went to my dorm and laid down. I don't know if it's because of the big crowd or just because it's hard for me to talk to people because I get anxious. 

Honestly I just want social advice because I still want to be socially active it's just hard for me. I'm sorta jealous of my dormmate was able to talk to everyone like it was nothing.",23Aug2019,1
190,"F20 here. I never had friends growing up. When I was around 15 I made a bunch of friends online that were all into the same obscure TV show I was. These guys were my best friends. I wrote fanfics for them, ordered food and gifts for them, even flew across the country to see them. Last year they finally came clean and told me they’d hated me the whole time and only put up with me to be nice, in hopes I’d eventually grow apart from them. It messed me up bad.

Now I finally have two new friends online. Our relationship is much more even, but I’m starting to get nervous. I was supposed to meet one friend at a convention only for her to have a medical emergency last minute (don’t worry, I know she’s a real 20-something girl, I’ve FaceTimed her).

191,"So I’ve been semi-close friends with this girl I’ve known for a long time. We started to get even closer as friends, because we spent a lot of time together at a 2 week music camp we both went to this summer.

It seems like being around each other so long throughout the school day has really amplified our friendship, and I started to realize I have feelings for her a few days ago. I am a bit scared to ask her out though, because we are both part of a super close friend group and I’d hate to hurt that group in anyway. I wonder if being together would hurt the friend group as a whole just because it would be a big change for all of us. Also I know I shouldn’t be concerned about this, but my ex girlfriend and I broke up two months ago, and I’d hate for her or anybody to think this girl I now have feelings for is just a rebound from my last relationship.

194,"Hello, brand new sophomore here! I've been in sophomore year for only 3 days, and it's fairly easy for the most part, except for my PAP Algebra 2 class.

I've always been really good at Mathematics, and I excelled in Geometry, so I've been curious on why Algebra 2 is so hard for me. But after thinking, I realized that I never took Algebra 1, and that's why most Algebra 2 topics - factoring, FOIL, etc. - seems so foreign to me.

In my 8th grade year, I took Advanced Pre-Algebra. It was explicitly told to us that it was only going to prepare us for our entrance into Algebra 1, and wasn't going to count for a credit towards Algebra 1.

In my 9th grade year, I moved to a different city and was given the option to take either Algebra 1 or PAP Geometry. Naturally, I want my credits to look good, so I took Geometry! 

Now, in my 10th grade year, I've gotten into Algebra 2. Nobody has said anything so far, and I'm going to my school counselor tomorrow to ask about this, since I'm paranoid that trouble will come from it.

Will this harm my school career? Will I be forced to take Algebra 1 despite already exceeding it?,",23Aug2019,1

196,"This is a really messed up situation. 

My husband and I have been married for almost 8 years and we have a daughter who is turning 5 next week. My mother and my teenage sister also live with us for various reasons. 

I have a very high paying job and he earns about 10% of what I make (it has never bothered me as we both do what we enjoy).

Yesterday, I was on a work trip in another country. Around midnight, I got a call from my brother who lives halfway across the world saying he needed to speak to me about something urgent. Apparently, my sister had come home from dance class and walked into my mum’s room only to find my husband and my mum naked in bed. My sister freaked out and called our brother to tell him about what happened. Brother then called our mum, who broke down and said that my husband has apparently been forcing himself on her for about a year - almost every time that I travel for work (which happens at least once a month). 

I didn’t want to believe this so called my mum and she said exactly the same thing to me. So basically, my husband raped my mum and my sister walked in on it. 

I felt sick and broken and just totally stunned. Had to cancel my work meetings (told my bosses I had a family emergency) and basically spent about US$1,000 equivalent on getting myself home by taxi (there were no flights overnight and the distance between where I was and my home is about 350km). 

I confronted my husband and his version is that he got drunk, my mum was also a bit drunk and they had sex. He acknowledged that it has happened more than once but claims it has always been consensual. 

I know my mum gets a bit drunk sometimes and can do stupid stuff when she’s drunk. I’ve also known my husband for over 10 years and never in this time have I seen him be violent. 

So now I don’t know what to do and what to believe. The thought of sitting down with both of them and talking about it makes me physically ill and I just can’t face it. 

I’ve told my husband to leave the house and that I don’t really care where he goes or what he does. Before that, I took away all the credit and debit cards as I feel like it would add insult to injury if I have to cover the costs of his hotel. Not sure if what I’ve done is right but I just can’t think straight right now. 

Our daughter is at school and they are having a sleepover party so she won’t be back until tomorrow morning. I’ve got to figure out what I’m going to tell her. She’s a daddy’s girl and I don’t want to break her heart by telling her daddy has left. But I also can’t face having him in the house or anywhere near me or my daughter.

So, Reddit, what do I do? I don’t think I’ve ever felt so hurt, confused and lost.",23Aug2019,31

I try to help as much as I can by doing small things like prepare some food or make her tea because I know she stressed out with work and stuff. Maybe I am selfish and inconsiderate but what she said today really hurt my feelings. There’s no point in talking to her about it because she’ll probably just yell at me again. I don’t know what to do.",23Aug2019,1
200,"Bit of backstory; my fiancé (26 M) and I (27 F) have been together for ~5 years and engaged for the past 6 months. We had hiccups like any couple but we’ve always been pretty strong.

About 2 years into the relationship, we were at a party together and a girl tried to make out with him despite knowing he was in a relationship, she told me a while after it happened as I didn’t witness it and claimed he threw himself at her, to be honest I didn’t believe her, but I thought it best to speak to him about it, so I just calmly grabbed him and asked him to go outside with me. I asked if it had happened and he confirmed that it had and that she had thrown herself at him. He admitted that he’d kissed her back for a couple seconds before breaking it off and walking away. I chose to believe him and forgive him as this girl was known for doing things like that, but the fact that he kissed her back and he didn’t even immediately come and tell me about it himself has always left me with a bit of an uneasy feeling.

Because of this I’ve always felt a bit insecure when it comes to his friendships with other girls, even when my better judgement tells me there’s nothing to worry about.

Now fast forward to present day and my insecurities are playing up big time and I don’t know how to talk to him about it without coming across as trying to be controlling or anything.

The reason for the flare up is because last week he went on a lads night out for his best friends birthday, and since then, he’s been snapchatting this girl his best friend works with (fiancé also used to work with them both), like a lot. He’s been overly protective of his phone and hides his screen if I ever happen to glance his way while he’s doing anything on it. He’s also been really snappy with me over the last week as well and has also announced that he’s going out again to the clubs this weekend (something that is out of the norm for him since he only goes out like once a year).

Now the thing is the week before I went out myself for a co-workers birthday and one of her husbands guy friends was adding everyone on snapchat (which is pretty normal when you meet new people on a night out) but in the days following the night out, he was messaging me a lot and it started getting a little weird and obsessive, so I blocked and deleted him because despite it being 100% innocent chatter I felt weird talking to him when the guy was messaging me so much even though he knew I was engaged.

So the thing is really I want to talk to my fiancé about how I’m feeling but I’m not sure if I’m just projecting my own guilt because of how obsessed this guy got with me and I’m just reading into it too much. I don’t want to be that girl who just gets insecure over dumb things.",23Aug2019,1
201,"I am currently working at an income tax place. I have 2 months in the job. I answer phone calls, take messages, i input checks and deposits in the computer. I pay taxes online.

I am not getting it at all and the majority of the stuff I have learned is because I learn questions. My trainer has taught me stuff but not for the majority.

206,"I’m a male in my early 20s and never told anyone and never want to.

I’m afraid to even admit this to myself which is part of the reason why I’m making this post.

I honestly don’t know how to start this because I never told anyone before. Well basically, I think I’m bi because I’m sexually attracted to men. I know I’m not gay because I really like women sexually and emotionally. I’ve only been with women and only been in one serious relationship for 3.5 years with one (we broke up a few years back).

I have no interest in being in an emotional relationship with a man but I’m super interested in having experimenting sexually with a man. I know I think I might be bi because 99% of the time I watch porn I watch gay porn. However, I’ll occasionally watch straight porn when I’m in the mood and I still really like it. 

I’m terrified of my friends and family finding out in some sort of way so I’m afraid to do anything in case they might find out. I also refuse to come out to them because my parents are very traditional/strict/conservative. Plus I don’t see the point because I know for a fact that I want to marry a female one day and have a big family with her. I also don’t know if I’m Bi for sure because I’ve never been with a man. I could for all I know try being with a guy and not like it and change my mind. 

So the real reason why I’m making this post is because I don’t know what to do about it. I really want to hook up with a guy but I don’t know how. I’ve tried using dating apps like tinder and bumble to talk to guys but it makes me super nervous every time I do. I get so nervous to the point where I unmatch with them anytime the conversation goes anywhere. What if someone I match with has a mutual friend!?!? That would be the end of me if someone close to me found out. I’m super terrified.

I just don’t know what to do about it and all I want to do is hook up with a guy to find out if I like it and if I’m truly bi. 

So here is the basic question: how do I hook up with another male without anyone know and without hurting that person’s feelings. Sorry for the long rant but this post was somewhat of a confession as well. Someone please help. I feel lost and need advice.",23Aug2019,1
207,"I consider myself a normal person for the most part. I’ve always been goofy and I care a lot about people and I never try to hurt them.

I don’t remember much of what happened and it scares me, ive kept really good controls over my emotions for a long time and nothing like forgetting what happened has ever happened. I just remembered waking up in my bed with a text from my friend saying she hopes I get better. I read through all of your texts and they were disgusting.

I have therapy planned in about two weeks and I’m going to talk about it but still I’m scared of myself. I feel like a monster and I’ve lost one of my friends because of it.

208,"Too long of a story so I will shorten it.
I was groomed from age 15. 
Thought I knew it all. 
Got preg. 
Didn't want baby religious mom forced me to keep 
Keeping my documents locked up so I would not be able to put baby up for adoption or abortion. 

5 years of domestic violence ( stomping head punching , hair pulling bleeding ,suffocated when pregnt. Groomed manipulated and guilted into stuff pushy intercourse even when I didn't want to)

I was raped by sperm donor 2 years and a half ago 
I never filed a report because I was scared 
But I do however have a plan B report at Plantparent hood the next day it happened. 

I left the baby to the spermdonors grandparents 
And left to Europe. 
I returned 
But my mom insists on having her around so whatever I'm like fine , because the fact that the grandparents don't care about what sperm donor has done to me and , child is safer with my mom.

From what I knew child was being taken care of by grandparents but then I find out months later that 
They have allowed child to stay with father. 

It makes me uncomfortable 
And child's grandfather said ""hey sperm donor wants to talk to you about child""

I said "" nope no thank I'm not speaking to him""

I want to place a restraining order on the guy 
I have been filling reports of his harrassment and calls online but
I also want to give up my parental rights. 

I do not know what to do 
And if I somehow will get introuble with law because I left baby with grandparents , but didn't know they would allow baby to be taken care of father. 

I'm scared
I want to do something 
I want to make sure child is atleast safe 
So she's coming home to my mom's 
But not sure what to do and what it means if I give up parental rights when I just want child to be safe with my mom or maybe even a proper family.",23Aug2019,1
209,"Today in one of my classes, there was an incident that I am freaked out over. I am in high school for reference. It began with the teacher explaining the lesson and showing us notes to copy down. There is one boy who frequently interrupts with his opinion on the subject. While this sort of discussion is perfectly fine after the lesson, he blurts it in the middle when the teacher is trying to explain the lesson. The next time he blurted out, she kindly explained that he is interrupting her explanation and that he is welcome to talk about it after the lesson. There was nothing upsetting about what she said and it was perfectly reasonable in this situation to ask him to nicely stop. 

The part that freaks me out is how he reacted. He burst up out of his chair, knocking it over on its side and stormed out of the room. I'm not sure if he threw the chair over because I was looking down at my paper but I know the chair was on its side on the floor. When he ran out, he slammed the door extremely hard, so hard that I looked back to see if the glass in and next to the door broke. It was violent the way he knocked the chair over and slammed the door. It went from 0 to 100 in an instant. 

The teacher was obviously very rattled since she was trying to be nice about it even though he was interrupting her and the whole class just looked at each other thinking what just happened. I even heard someone say ""that's the second time today hes done that."" 

I assume administration had a conversation with him because someone came to collect his stuff later on in the class, but it still scares me. School has only been on for two weeks and I dont know anything about this kid. From a glance he seemed normal-- harmless, happy and socially awkward. But what scares me is the thought that instead of angrily storming out, what if he pulled out a gun? What would be stopping him from doing that? I hear so much about horrific shootings and the fact that he got angry after seemingly being happy within a second scares me and I'm not sure if I feel comfortable being in a confined space with him. What if something someone says angers him, because it would only take seconds for him to pull out a gun and fire. 

I dont know if I am overthinking this but I dont have a good feeling about this right now. I dont have any evidence that he could have a gun or do anything seriously dangerous, but I cant stop thinking ""what if"" because he could have pulled out a gun instead of violently knocking the chair over and slamming the door. Is there anything I should do in this situation? I can't get this out of my head.",23Aug2019,0
210,"I’m a 16M. My Dad is in the military, so I’ve moved from one place to another more than a few times. But this last time was so much worse than any of the others. I had friends before in other places, but in the last place I was in, I met my two best friends ever (16F and 17F). I was always happy with them no matter what and I could be honest with them about who I was and what I thought and they accepted me and I could talk to them for hours and do nothing else and still be completely intrigued and entertained. I know I’m just a teenager, but I legitimately think they’re the best people I’ve ever met and the best people I will meet. Not just because they’re both great people, but because they just fit so well with me. My relationship with them was the best and purest relationship in my life.
Then, during my sophomore year of high school, my Dad retired from the military and decided that he wanted to move to another state to be closer with his parents. I know I should be glad I get to be so close with them now, but I would’ve preferred finishing high school at a place where I actually knew people. But we moved here about three months ago. 16F also moved to another state around the same time as me. On my last day in the last state, I spent the whole day with 17F (16F had left a few days before). We didn’t do much. Most of the time we just sat on the couch together, laying on each other. It would’ve been the most peaceful thing ever if I wasn’t about to leave. I can remember that in the last hour, we just sat alone in her living room, her head on my shoulder and mine on her head. And I remember it being so calm yet so dreadful and there were such strong elements of sadness and happiness happening at the same time that it created this new feeling in me that I can’t describe, but every once in a while I think back to that moment and I get that feeling again and it’s the best and worst thing ever.
I left the morning of the next day, and I promised both 17F and 16F that every day that I didn’t see them, I’d text them that I love them and ask how their day was (I did ask their permission first and I told them that they didn’t have to respond if they didn’t want to and if they ever wanted me to stop, they could tell me and I would). We planned that once 16F and I graduated from High School (17F had already graduated) we’d move in together. And this wasn’t just something we hoped for but never acted on, we discussed where we’d get a house and how we’d work out the costs and stuff like that.
So I moved to my new town and I’ve been here for the majority of my summer, and there hasn’t been a day that I haven’t missed them and thought about how amazing that summer could’ve been if I had just stayed there. 16F and I would talk pretty much 24/7. I’ve talked to people on here about my relationship with her and many people have said that it’s not normal for us to talk that much, but we just would. We’d talk about our problems and about moving to new places and about missing each other and a million other things I can’t remember right now.
But a few months ago, band camp started for Marching Band at my school (I’m in Marching Band) and I got my first taste of what the kids here are like. They’re almost all mean and violent and offensive and homophobic and disgusting and some of them are even a little bit racist but the worst thing is that nobody has a problem with it. Everyone there is someone who either makes the jokes or someone who just ignores them. Everyone is okay with what happens there. They’re okay with mean jokes and they’re okay with making fun of people and they’re okay with killing small animals like frogs.
I hoped it would get better once school began, but it didn’t. While not everyone is mean like the band kids are, everyone else that I’ve met is either just as mean or doesn’t care. And the teachers don’t care about new students. I still haven’t gotten all of my supplies because I can’t get my school email set up because nobody is willing to help. I even have a sophomore class I have to take because they didn’t have it in Texas and the teacher has forgotten that I’m not a sophomore. I’m just being ignored. Nobody explains anything because they just expect everyone to know it and I’m so lost every single day. I’ve been at school for 4 days now.
16F began going to school around the same time as me, and since then, things have just been horrible between us. She’s really stressed about being in a new school and I can’t help her because when she gets stressed she stops talking so we haven’t had a real conversation in days and I miss her so much. When we do talk about her problems, I know that no matter how hard I try, I’m not helping her and I don’t know what to do. I wish so much that life wouldnt be so hard on her and I wish that she could’ve just stayed at our high school from before so she could keep going somewhere where she knows people, but that doesn’t help anyone. She’s still stuck there and I can’t help her. I talked to 17F the other day and she cried because she said this was the worst place for me to be. It’s just so dull and unhappy. I need to get out of here
I want to run away. Well, half of me does. Half of me wants to stay here, but at this point, I honestly don’t know what’s best. I know that running away is bad, especially when my reasons are because I’m sad and because I miss my friends, but there’s nothing for me here. I keep thinking that I could just get a bag together quick and be out of here in only a couple minutes and it honestly seems like a good option to me now. There’s a high chance that if I left, I’d get arrested or killed or worse, but I can’t be here anymore. I hate the people and I hate the place and I was just so much happier with 16F and 17F.
But they’re both miles away now. 16F is hundreds of miles away and 17F is almost twice as far, but I need them.
I know I shouldn’t run away, but I don’t know what else I should do. I’ve tried talking to my parents about it but they won’t take me seriously no matter what. And I feel like 16F and I are getting more and more distant every day, and I need her. I can’t be happy without both of them. I can have short bursts of happiness so I can smile and laugh, but there’s just not that warm, long lasting feeling of true happiness.

Well i did. I started being really nice and helpful to tue people around me. Seems fine and all but i kinda focused too much on not hurting peoples feelings and now everytime i say something i always think that whatever i said could be offensive.

Well hot dog on a bun, it's someone's VERY small kitten. I almost ran the little thing over! He wasn't moving at all and in the dark alley it woulda been really easy to hit the little guy. Anyways one of my neighbors saw this and said that he had tried to return the cat to its owner on a different night and warned them that this was a dangerous thing to do, but they told him that he is an outdoors cat.

Our friendship “breakup” hurt me really badly, gave me so some serious trust issues amongst other things.

219,"Hello, 

I have neighbors who hoard cats. They have at least 12 in a small, single-level house. They do not let the cats out, or believe cats should be allowed outdoors. Upon meeting them, they made a comment like, “Don’t ever let your cats over here!” In a time that suggested they may not be joking. Weird, right? 

We live in a rural area. Every spring I find kittens, feed and get them used to humans, and hand them over to the Humane Society. This year, I found a litter of three. I rehabbed them, and two went on their way. But the last one was just fucking great, so I decided to keep him. He would regularly go outside, but always came home, usually the same night. He is very friendly. 

He went on a walkabout for a few days, and I contacted the neighbor, wondering if she had seen him. He came back that evening. Recently he just disappeared. He was gone about 5 days before I called the neighbor (because she knows what my cat looks like, I’d think she’d return him or let me know right away if she saw him).

She claims not to have seen him. But she and her husband are a tad nuts about cat hoarding, so I fear he’s being kept there. Being so friendly, my thought is he may have wandered over to say hello, especially since that place reeks of cats. I honestly think he got lifted. This all happened the same week I had him scheduled for neuter/shots/microchip. So I have zero legal claim to him. :( 

What can I do?",23Aug2019,1
220,"I've been dating a guy for just over six months. While I haven't been able to definitively prove it, my gut instinct strongly suspects that he has lied several times to get out of making plans. He is an introvert and requires a lot of time to himself. I am also very independent. We see each other once or twice a week. He tends to freak out around people and doesn't like to go out much. As such, sometimes he just doesn't feel like hanging out during the week. Instead of just being honest and clear about that, he comes up with a story. Some of the details haven't added up when I've asked him some follow up questions about events and it's led me to believe that these are made up excuses/plans. 

Tonight, he claimed he was working late after hanging out with co-workers. I asked him to take a photo of his new workplace and he wasn't able to produce one. He started saying he would, then came up with a story about how he was watching a webinar on his phone and would probably have to wait til tomorrow to send one with his phone, when he could just take a photo after the webinar was done. I don't want to sound like a creep by asking for verification, but I strongly suspect he is lying and that he couldn't produce a photo backed up my suspicion. 

I don't think he's having an affair or anything like that. I suspect he lies because he wants to avoid conflict and doesn't want to be hurtful by saying he prefers to be alone sometimes. I assume good intention into why he's doing it, but it does make me think he can't be trusted. I got burned badly by a dishonest ex once, and vowed I wouldn't date someone like that again. I believe people shouldn't be lying to their partners, and that anyone that doesn't mind telling smaller lies will have no problem telling bigger ones. Because trust and open communication are so important to the success of a relationship, I am really doubting that this relationship will work.

How do I handle this? Should I have a serious conversation about it or just end it? For context, he does seem like he cares about me otherwise. This is just one quality I can't deal with and it makes me feel really on the fence about him. Thanks for your advice.",23Aug2019,1

224,"The last three years have been terrible for me and I feel like the prolonged exposure to my depression and stagnation is severely affecting how I think, feel, and act. I can't really tell who I am anymore. I used to be so, so much better than this, and I'm not sure if the me before was the real me or the me now is the real me.

I won't dump my whole life's story on here or anything but to try and summarise: I had it rough growing up. I lived in a dysfunctional environment and my school/grades/social skills/mental health suffered from it. I've always had problems with anxiety and depression, but I'm not sure how much of that is by nature or nurture. As in, do I have a chemical imbalance or am I just surrounded by things that have slowly contributed to my mindset? My mother has mental health issues but I know mental illness isn't inherently hereditary even though it can be.

Anyway. My early life was tough but I pulled myself out of it when I was 16. I got into college and realised what it meant to work in an environment that respected me. I had friends for the first time in my life. I realised I wasn't a fuck up and that when I worked hard I could produce amazing work. My lecturers were proud of me. I was proud of me. I made sure I got top marks in every project no matter how small. It night sound tryhard to some of you and I suppose it was, but I wasn't doing it out of a sense of ego or anything. I just felt *alive* by the validation it gave me. Not only was I not an abject failure but I was actually *good*, *disciplined*, and *focused*. The work was exhausting but it just made the breaks I earned feel God damn near orgasmic (too far? Too far. Maybe. Not really.)

I worked hard. Too hard ...  I got into university and half way through felt the beginnings of burnout. Things in my life started to fall apart. My family, my friends, my own neglected health. I still graduated but earning my diploma felt so empty. I decided to take a year off hoping that I could shake this ""funk"" I was in, but one turned to two and I think this ""funk"" is actually some surreal psychosis that I don't know how I fell into or how to get back out of. I feel like everything is happening so fast and yet I'm standing still. I know that describes living in your 20s in a nutshell but also, like, fuck. I don't know. I feel like there's your average disillusioned Gen Z 20-something (still tragic) and then there's me.

I feel like I can't articulate myself anymore. I used to be fairly eloquent and words rolled off my tongue easily, but now I stammer or trail off, and even when I type I'm left staring at the little blinking line more often than not, or backspacing paragraphs worth of work. It's like I don't have confidence in my ability to carry a conversation anymore - and I've never been a particularly opinionated person by any means but now I've went so far the other way that I don't even know what *I* think about certain things anymore. I'm fatigued to the point where I don't even want to hear myself think sometimes.

I know this might sound strange, but would anyone understand what I meant if I said prolonged exposure to untreated mental illness feels a bit like brain damage? I know it's a weird comparison to make but it just ... Feels like I've had a minor stroke or something sometimes. For example, my mind used to interpret thoughts like a Repin painting. Comprehensive, detailed, if not a bit brooding. But overtime it's turned into an abstract painting. The colours are off, the proportions are warped, the nose is where the mouth should be, I know I'm looking at something familiar but it's all so wrong that the uncanniness is disturbing.

I'm sure these weird metaphors make me sound like a dumbass but it's the only way I can describe how off I feel. I just want someone to tell me that they've been through the same dissociative episode and made it through the other side.",23Aug2019,3
225,So I already had an in person interview with the manager and two other higher up employees. The manager said the next step would be hearing from HR. HR has now emailed me and wants to do a phone interview with me. I just am a little confused as to what more they need from me when the in person interview I had was very comprehensive with the types of questions asked. I guess I'm just not totally sure what to expect from them and am trying to best prepare myself for what they may ask.,23Aug2019,1
226,"I am due tomorrow to have my first baby....right now my husband and I are living with his grandparents for a couple of months until we can find a home to buy. 

His grandparents have a set of old front loading machines in their laundry room. There is a large build up of mildew and mold in them, especially on the gasket, whonknows where else. 

I daresay that these machines have never been washed or treated for the mold problem, due to the amount of visible buildup in the machine. 

My husband told me he would offer to clean the machine, to put my mind at ease. I am concerned that the mildew and mold is being transferred onto our clothes as they are being washed, and not being killed in the dryer cycle. 

I am uncomfortable washing my newborn's clothes in this washer, even if my husband tries to clean it. 

Am I over reacting? Are the clothes probably fine being washed in a dirty machine? Are their any health repercussions to using this machine? Also, does anyone have great advice for cleaning these machines sufficiently?

227,"Hope I don't come off in a negative way, I just wanted to be direct.   


I'm currently overweight, 70lbs give or take, man boobs, gunt, ect. But, I've been working hard the past month, going to the gym EVERYDAY with one rest day, of course, got a good regiment and am being helped and encouraged by family. Complete diet change too. I've also been working on reinventing myself, going from a kinda awkward, nerdy boy in to a confident, more ""alpha"" man. Training myself to be more outgoing, risk taking and confident. And while I'm getting slimmer and stronger, I still don't look good, still looking fat and such. Maybe I'm just not used to talking to women, but I am seeing that other men are taking me more seriously and like me more, but I'm not paid much attention to or taken seriously by women in the few situations that we've engaged in.   


I'm sure I'm overthinking (it's part of me I'm trying to reinvent and overcome), but I figured I'd ask. Please be honest! Should I just work on myself, mentally and physically, and approach women when I'm fit and more masculine, or should I try and... I dunno, practice talking to girls and see where it goes?

228,"Photos of Ants, holes in ceiling, and Thermostat http://imgur.com/a/2h4LPF5



Me, My Spouse and our son moved into a new apartment July 1st. We signed a 12 month lease.Since week one we have had a slew of issues, and we really aren't sure what to do at this point.

These issues include

-Ant infestation
-Rodents in the walls
-Clogged Sink
-Broken AC followed by botched AC fix


To briefly detail each issue-


-Right off the bat we noticed ants, but they were only little wood ants here and there ( at first) so we squished them and moved on. Then day by day, through
out that first week we noticed more and more ants; until we would find thousands. We immediately went to the office, who sent out pest control, but that really only made the issue worse. Every day, several times a day there would be a new trail going or coming somewhere, no matter how clean the apartment. Finally we went out and bought caulking and started closing up any holes and cracks we could find. When we started following the ant trails to find the places to caulk, we found they were coming from inside the foundation itself. I mean these things are everywhere. You stick a tac in the wall, an ant will later
come out of the hole it left. Lift up the carpet? You'll find some there. We eventually started finding places that the ants had actually been painted into
the walls- telling us the complex was well aware of the issue. One night we went to get bags out of the trunk of our car and found them all inside the trunk.
When you look around, they are in trees, on walking paths, everywhere! Despite complaining nothing has been done and we still find ants everyday.

-You can hear rodents, crawling in the walls. There is at least one possum that we know of that very valiantly tries to get in the apartment via the vents
and fire place. We have actually been able to look through the vents and see him. If we wanted we could legit put our fingers through the vents and touch him. He is right there trying to claw his way in. We have informed the office, and nothing has been done.

-Our sink backed up, also causing our dishwasher to back up. Water stood in our sink and dishwasher for almost 2 weeks before they got it fixed. We went in
everyday and asked for it to be fixed because the standing water was not only disgusting- but also surprise surprise- attracting even more ants! Still it took
just under 2 weeks.

-There are also small more ""cosmetic"" issues as they would say such as loose dead bolt, loose and partly hanging hall light, and broken closet shelving.

BUT HERE IS THE REAL CHERRY ON TOP OF THIS BULLSHIT!

-Through all the above issues we have been going without a working AC! Folks, we live in SOUTH TEXAS!Within 72 hours of moving in, we noticed the AC wasn't cooling. We went to the office and made a work order, and when they finally sent someone over 2 days later, all they said was that there wasn't anything they could see wrong but to let them know if it didn't correct itself within
24 hours.. like what? But ok.. when it was still hot as hell 24 hours later- we of course went back into the office. This time we explained our son has asthma and extreme heat can trigger attacks and that this issue needed to be taken serious. Through out the next week, they just kept sending maintenance guys, all of which just kept saying there wasn't anything wrong. At this point, its 100 degrees outside during the day,reaching temps of up to 94 Degrees inside. Finally they told us they would send an HVAC Tech. A few days later he shows up, ends up telling us our ducts are broken and need to be fixed. The office then tells us we aren't the only unit with the Duct issue, so we are put on a waiting list. It has now, at this point,been 3 weeks without AC. They eventually put an AC window unit in the back bedroom of the apartment, but clearly that isn't enough to cool the whole unit so we stay asking them when the ducts are going to be fixed. For 6 weeks they keep telling us ""soon"" Finally 2 days ago ( after over a month without AC and a tremendous energy bill due to the window unit) contractors finally show up and tell us to leave the apartment for 4 hours so they can fix the ducts. When we get back, we find HUGE holes cut out of our ceilings- holes the contractors claim is the apartments responsibility to fix.. to which the office responds by telling us "" it'll be a work in progress."" THERE WAS 6 HUGE MAN SIZE HOLES IN THE CEILING! Work in progress?? Keep in mind that on the list of issues is rodents and ants in the walls.. now there are huge ass welcoming holes for these creatures to come on through! After all afternoon of back and forth with how unacceptable these holes were, especially considering the rodents and ants.. they did come and cover the holes up with cardboard and they did have someone out here today to truly patch up the holes. Ready for the kicker?.. after ALL of this.. THE AC STILL DOESN'T WORK. As I type this, it is 84 degrees in here and the sun has been down for hours now.

We are at our wits end, and any advice or insight on if we have any rights here would be greatly appreciated. We have thought about requesting a change in
unit.. but a lot of the issues seem to be with the office and complex as a hole. It is clear that they knew this unit had issues prior to moving anyone into
it- the painted over ants prove they just didn't care- so we are scared to go through the hassle of moving all our things just to be in a similar or even worse
unit- that is even IF they agreed in the first place.

229,"I apologize for any typos, my typing on phones is not very good. My thoughts have been all over the place, so that might show in here.

Alright, now let's get into it.

I have been pretty athletic my whole life, and I do great academically as well. But, I didn't really have a productive hobby, even now as I'm about to go into high school. My whole life up until now has bren video games with friends. It's like my way of winding down after a long day. 

I am having really big issues right now in what I want to do. I definitely want to go to college, but I have no hobbies or interests that I actively pursue to help me with that. My mom always tells me that I sports is a great thing for college, and every school wants an athlete. But... to be honest that's not how I see myself. About 4 weeks ago we had an argument because I told her I didn't see myself in boy scouts and I wanted to quit, and she was basically like ""ok, but what do you see yourself in then?"". After that, it turned into a big argument over what I wanted to do. She kept turning to sports, and how I have the athleticism even though I have told her many times in the past how I would hate it. Usually her response is ""how can you know if you haven't tried?"". Her example is how in elementary school, 4th grade specifically, I loved the kick ball league the kids organized. 4th grade, by the way. Even if I do have the physical capabilities, my emotional side and what I enjoy isn't fit for that. I get really really anxious in siruations with pressure. Last year I had a whole meltdown when I had to do a really, really easy group project due to my super bad groupmates. This added with the fact that I am a much more indoors/nerdy person just doesn't work well. I eould be fine in a playground environment where there is no pressure of teammates really relying on me, but in a competetive scene I think it's just fucking insane.

With that said... as I go into high school, I realize that I really need to step up my game if I have college as a goal of mine. Right now is the best time to start thinking about it, since I'm also trying to improve myself in general. Trying to learn art, working out, fixing my sleep schedule, reading more, etc. I just don't know where to start. I have never really thought about what interests me that I can show on a college resume. I asked my mom about art, and she said realistically it's a nice hobby to do in your room, but it can't be the major thing (which I don't really think is true?). Something I have kind of thought about in the past is computer science and programming, but what kind of accomplishments would be looked for? I guess I'm better off in the sense of figuring out what I want to do, I just don't know what to work towards.

Sorry if this is a bit confusing, these past 4 weeks have been considering what I'm going to do. I can also already anticipate some answers telling me that my mom is overreacting, but in a way I agree with her. Not in sports, but in what I see myself in. That's what this post is about figuring out. 

Thank you for the help!",23Aug2019,1
230,"My friend died recently and our school isn’t backing the student body or the teachers due to religious reasons. They took down our memorial and discouraged us from making a poster or literally any other way for us to try and grieve. We’re a small school and our entire class is devastated. I was closer to him than most others. The school has brought counselors but any time we want to talk to each other and congregate in places like the bathroom they stop us because they’re worried about us doing something. At this point I feel like life is so pointless. I feel completely soul crushed. No matter who I talk to or what I do, nothing changes and I’m broken. I sat by him in every class we had together. They tell us to pray but I don’t see the point. It just makes you feel good about yourself. It doesn’t change the situation. I don’t want to eat. I don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to shower or brush my hair. I still don’t even believe it happened. I keep thinking I’m going to turn down the hallway and see him sauntering down with his chest puffed and fists clutched because that’s just how he was. I keep lashing out at everyone around me, including my mother. I’m trying to be a rock for others and I know that’s what he would want but genuinely I can’t. I can’t force it. I feel so lost. I feel like life is completely pointless and I just don’t understand why I feel this way. I should be celebrating the fact I got the chance to know him at all but I just can’t. We had made plans for the day after and i just wish I would’ve known. I wish I would have made him promise or something else I don’t know. I know that everyone is doing the best they can. I know that I can’t change things. I know I’m grieving and going through the stages or whatever but I can’t go thirty minutes without sobbing. I think I’m just way too sensitive. Well, I know I am. I’ve been thinking about life and I just don’t see the point. I’m not suicidal but I just. I hate everything right now. What do I do?",23Aug2019,2

233,"Okay so I understand I’m a spoiled brat, and it’s really not about the money here, but it also is.

From a young age I knew I wanted to go business as an adult, so after discussing it with my parents, my dad specifically, he told me if I was able to get into UCLA or UC Berkeley, or a good school like that he would pay for my college, or help me.

I was very happy. I had begun planning my future with joining certain activities at school, and just overall planning on attending one of those two schools.

And just tonight, 4 weeks after I’ve started freshman year of hs, my parents have told me that unless I get into a Ivy League, they won’t help me pay. I’m so angry and sad. Not because they aren’t paying, because I’ve based my future and all my classes on this. And I know what it takes to get into an ivy league. I don’t have what it takes. I’m just so upset, because they never started any college fund or anything with me.

This isn’t about the money. It’s about the fact that they’re changing this on me now and it’s to late to change any of my classes. I just don’t know what to do and I feel so sad and angry and I just keep thinking that my futures over.

Please, any advice besides calling me a stupid brat would be so useful. Thank you.",23Aug2019,1
234,"Ok so a few things about me before I lay everything down for y'all. I'm and 18 year old guy and I have dealt with a lot of loss in my life. I lost three family members and my home a little under four years ago which has made me into who I am today. During my processing of what had happened, I decided to o anything and everything to keep my mind off of things. One day, I went onto Omegle and was text chatting random people until I eventually met Her. We had chatted for almost an hour and a half until we decided to exchange handles since we both felt a friendship forming. I love everything about Her from the way Her nose crinkles up when She smiles to the fact I can get lost in Her eyes so easily. I was in love. I cared about her more then I did anything else and I would do anything for Her. Now when my father found out I was talking to some stranger I met online all connections where cut between Her and myself immediately. I was crushed that I had lost literally everything except my dad in that fire and he took away the only friend I had. So that was it, another page in the book of my life. Flash forward three years to earlier this year and I get a random message on Instagram. *It was Her.* I couldn't believe she had remembered me all this time. We have been talking again for months now and she is, once again, my best friend. I still love Her to death and I care about Her so much. The only problem is She lives thirteen and a half hours away, has a boyfriend (who she has admitted to me several times he treats her like garbage), and I can't see myself with anyone else. I would do anything to be with Her but she isn't a fan of long distance relationships. So what do I do? No one where I live gives me a second glance but they way we hold conversations for 5+ hours a day and it never gets boring or stale.

I live thirteen hours from a girl I care very deeply about and she doesn't like long distance relationships.",23Aug2019,2

Every single pair i buy always works it's way out of my ear, no matter what. I think, maybe, one or two pairs stayed in my ear but they had really bad audio quality. I absolutely cannot wear air pods (but that doesn't really affect me because I am a hardcore Samsung person). I haven't tried to use Galaxy Buds because I don't want to spend a couple hundred dollars on headphones that are going to fall out. If it helps, the large, round knob (idk how else to describe it) on top of the air pod is much too large for my ear. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should buy? I'm quite desperate. Also, other small-eared people of Reddit, what works for you? Have you tried the Galaxy Buds?

We are all taking this pretty hard. My wife especially, since she got our pup before we were together.

257,"Hey guys, so I was in a car accident last September (2018) hours from my home. It was the other driver’s fault. Unfortunately I am young and it was my first car crash so when the police arrived on scene and asked if I wanted a police report, I asked what difference it would make if I got it vs if I didn’t. He shrugged me off and said he would only fine her (the driver). The driver was being very cooperative so I told the cop it was ok and just called for towing. My friend, who’s a cop, later told me he believed he made it seem unnecessary to get out of filing so much paperwork. I got an attorney and since there was no police report, they had to prove the other driver was at fault. They promised me that all my expenses will be payed by the insurance including time missed at work, towing, injuries, etc. My car was also declared ‘ total loss’ and they immediately set up an appointment to a chiropractor for me to go. I began to go but grow anxious because the attorney ghosted me and I knew nothing of the case. Thinking I could be blamed or get no reply, I stopped going to the chiropractor knowing it was too expensive for me to pay out of pocket. I also began to try to find the cop’s information as maybe a witness in hopes of proving my innocence. I drove hours back again to go to the police station and did unnecessary work until I finally reached the officer. After it was proved I was innocent, they allowed me to get a car rental until I was able to collect the money for a new car for myself. Well, I wasn’t able to check out a car because I wasn’t 21. I spent nearly 4/5 months without a car, money, or any word from the attorney again, just voicemail. One day they just randomly called me again for me to send copies of my towing receipt and a signed paper from my manager how many hours I missed, etc. Months later, I got my money for the value of the car that was totaled and again, no word from them. Recently, I received a call for me to sign a settlement agreement to release the insurance from all claims. I denied to sign because they were only offering me $500 to myself where the days I missed alone were $250 and the towing was $240. The attorney grew angry because I refused and said I “had to sign it” and basically just hung up on me. I send her emails clarifying why I was not willing to sign and they still insist I need to sign. I don’t know what to do because I struggled waiting months without knowing what was going on and having to pay out of pocket for Uber to work, with my injury that wasn’t able to be treated because I was afraid of getting fined more than what I could afford just for them to give me $500 and set me aside after what I was promised? It makes me feel like the attorney just agreed to whatever just to get payed their share already without consideration of my expenses. I don’t know if I am in the wrong or not but any advice helps, thanks for reading.",23Aug2019,1

Him: I told him I was  going to break his jaw for his language and disrepect

Him: I was threatened with the authorities.

Him: as the Klingons say ""Today is a good day to die.""

Me: ok so wait why was he insulting her in the first place lol was he just drunk

Him: we were arguing ethics

Him: he resulted to ad hominem attacks.

Him: If I see him again he'l be drinking his food for the next 6 months

Him: I'm going to bust his jaw

Me: ok i guess i don't really know how to respond to that

Him: How do you defend your families' honor without striking the man who made such accusations toward you?

Him: As a man I must now kill him.

Him: He has only one chance to beg forgiveness.

Me: murder sounds extreme the dude was probably just buzzed/drunk

Him: Too bad.

Him: His ancestors will remember his mistake..

Me: i rlly dont know how to respond to this my guy

Him: When my car is fixed and I can travel on my own I will hunt him

Him: and I will end his life

Me: uh ok..

Him: the difference between me and other assassins is that I want to die

Me: are you ok?

Him: Yes

Him: I fear not the valley of they shadow of death

Him: for the LORD is my shepherd.

Him: my cup overflows and I do not want.

So at first I just thought he was joking or trying to sound badass or whatever, then it progressively got more weird and serious and I was just kind of confused, freaked out and didn't know how to respond. I genuinely cannot tell if he's being serious or if he's just trying to sound like an aLPhA mAlE or something.

I feel dumb bc it’s going to come up again and I don’t want to start lying to everyone and hurt my reputation down the line even further. It already came up again in front of someone from another department where she said “he’s 25, I thought he was 21” ... I was just tight lipped and nodded. However I feel like admitting it now could hurt my reputation bc I feel like she will tell my other co workers that I lied about it. 

Anyways.. I’m wondering if I should come clean to her and hope she doesn’t start gossiping and appreciate my honesty. She seems kind of immature and talkative so it really wouldnt surprise me if she did, especially at happy hour. Maybe others would say well he told you the truth so what’s the problem? Or they would all just agree and think I’m weird.. (bc it is weird to lie about something so minor). I feel like she was already surprised I was 25 so if that also wouldn’t surprise me if she used that as a topic of discussion.

Or just not bring it up and if it comes up w others tell others my true age. She said she would probably leave when her contracts up in February, and my bday is in May but that’s a long time to carry a lie.

Im the introvert of our friend group so Im kinda dragged everywhere but I have fun and I enjoy their company. I was like this with our other friend too. Maybe it's because we never hung out without our other friend and that's probably why I'm scared. Scared of her thinking... Idk .

278,"NSFW because of the topic of conversation I had. Just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I \[33F\] had a heated debate with my friend \[35M\] about abortion. 

(But I don't want to argue my point of view about abortion in this post, 

but an insight of if I sounded rude or condescending.. 

and if so, what would have been a better way to have put my opinions.)

&amp;#x200B;

The conversation went something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

friend: I am so against abortion- I think it hurts the women too much.

OP: How so?

friend: Like if you're pregnant, and then forcefully get rid of it, of course it's unhealthy.

OP: I heard getting an abortion and giving birth is equally painful and produces about the same amount of risk of health issues. I'm actually pro-abortion.. but not because it's OK to get rid of a life.. but because I'm more pro-choice, you know?

friend: I feel that if abortion was freely allowed, then men will just not use any protection and have the women take all the responsibility for the aftermath.

OP: But what about the people that weren't just having mutual consented sex? What about rape?

friend: That's only a minority of people that need abortion. I'm talking about the majority. Like the irresponsible people who have unprotected sex and then demand they need an abortion because they can't take care of it.

OP: In my view, the irresponsible people felt more of a minority. The unwanted, unplanned, and inevitable pregnancies are what abortion was about to me. Plus, not everyone is as privileged as we are.. Some parts of the world, and even some parts of this very country (I am in USA), there are people who are still not taught about STDs and contraception. I don't think I will blame someone if they didn't have the opportunity to learn that there was an option available. Some people might not be able to afford contraception, too. You have to think about all the different circumstances that can lead to them needing abortion.  

friend: Well, I think if you can't afford contraception, then you just shouldn't be having sex. Period.

OP: Now that's a whole another topic there. That's more like a human rights topic.

friend: Yea, yea.. whatever...

&amp;#x200B;

The conversation ended there and I could obviously tell my friend and I were not agreeing on the topic- which is OK.

But he came back to me today and told me how offended he felt during our conversation.

He said I sound very opinionated and condescending, and I should learn to hear other people without opposing them.

While I didn't intend to force my opinion on him, I also didn't want to agree with his opinion which I don't agree with.

I could kind of understand how I might have sounded condescending,

but I can't figure out how I could have put it to make it less aggressive.

I'm not the type of person that would just pretend like I agree with something to make every conversation lovely,

so this has been a problem I encounter occasionally, and is not the first time.

I obviously lack a certain skill in communication if I'm offending people more than a couple times.

Academic Standing (from strongest to weakest):
Math, English, Computer Science, Art, History, Science 

Math is really my strongest suite. I took all the available math courses in High School and my favorite subject was Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry.

Personality:
I go to the beat of my own drum, and definitely don’t fit in with the vast majority of people in my area. I have very liberal views and I live in a red state. I have 17 tattoos, and plan on getting more. I want to work in an environment where I don’t have to worry about covering up who I am with a stiff collar and long sleeves everyday.

Hobbies:
Reading, cooking, writing, yoga, and taking care of my 2 dogs.

I want to feel passionate and positive to going to work
I want to proud of my profession
I want to be accepted/respected for who I am

Same old bullshit to the subreddit I know but holy fuck I need some advice because she’s moving on and I am not.",23Aug2019,1
288,"I’m her older sister, not her mother, but my mom is a single mother and she asks me for advice.. 

So my younger sister has a small history of depression and self harm since she was in middle school. (Btw, so do I, so I’m kind of speaking from experience here). We are the only two in the family who understand what it’s like to be depressed/suicidal, and my mother doesn’t understand at all. She means well but she doesn’t really take it seriously. All this time that my sister has self harmed, my mothers basically called it attention seeking and never gotten her help for it. I have seen a doctor for it though as a child into my teens. 

Anyways, my sister just graduated high school and last week, my mom brought her to move into her apartment 2 hours away from home. She has multiple scholarships and financial aid, so everything is paid for. She has her own room and bathroom and a nice large bed and her own desk. (As compared to at home where her and I shared a room with two twin beds and not very much room or privacy). She got it set up all cute and got her textbooks and registered for her classes and everything. It’s pretty awesome actually, and I’m kind of jealous I never had the opportunity to go away for college. She had the option to stay and go to community college like me, but she really wanted to be on her own and go away for college. 

Well, we hadn’t heard from her in a few days, so my mom sent one of her friends to her apartment to check on her. Turns out she either tried to or threatened to commit suicide (we still aren’t sure). One of her long distance friends call the police to check on her, and they baker acted her with a 72 hour psychiatric hold. Of course I’m sad for her, but in my opinion this might be a good thing because she is finally getting the treatment she needs. They have her on medication that will continue after she leaves and she will be following up with the doctor. 

My mother (understandably) freaked out. She was sad but also annoyed and thinks my sister is being dramatic. She wants her to come home, and my sister agreed because she will do anything my mom wants her to. At first I thought this was the best idea too, but now I’m not so sure. She’s getting treatment now, so hopefully it will get better, but that doesn’t mean her depression is going anywhere. At least for me, depression has always been a part of my life, and if that’s true for her, it won’t go away just by her coming home. 

I think that coming home will make her more depressed if anything. All her friends went away to college and she’s going to see all the pictures and probably wish she had too. I think she might be embarrassed that she has to tell everyone why she came home. I think she’s going to be sad because she wanted this so bad and what she had was great, and I think she’ll regret it a lot if she turns back now and comes home and goes to community college (not that there’s anything’s wrong with it, I go there myself but I know she wanted more than that for herself). 

Of course I don’t know how she’s going to feel, I just don’t think that coming home is necessarily in her best interest. Also, she hasn’t started school or made friends yet or gotten a job, and I think that once she has those things to keep her busy, she will be a little better and probably enjoy herself. 

I don’t want to downplay her suicide attempt, because all attempts are serious, but I’m not sure how serious she actually was about it. She told a friend what she was doing or maybe sent him a picture or something, but what she did was put a plastic bag over her head. The whole thing is just confusing to me. I’m not sure if she was planning on going through with it, or her friend just freaked out and reported it. The thing is, that’s a very unpractical way of commuting suicide and she is very smart and I don’t think she was planning on succeeding. Maybe she was just seeing if that was something that she could actually do. I tried it myself just to see, and I was only able to keep the bag on my head for about 7 seconds before my body forced me to rip it off. I know she is suicidal and it’s horrible to say this but I think telling her friend/attempting suicide was a call for help because after all these years of asking my mother still hasn’t taken her for treatment. Regardless, I’m still taking it seriously but I’m just trying to figure out if this is worth ruining her college plans for, which IMO will make her more depressed.

Of course if she wants to come home, she should. But should my mom force her to come home? She is 18 but she will do anything my mom wants her to. I just think that being followed by a doctor now and getting probably coinciding, she might be okay to stay there. Should I recommend  that my mom allow her to decide instead of forcing her?

I’m sorry this is so long, or if I offended anyone but I appreciate any feedback. My mom is freaking out and doesn’t know how to deal with this and honestly neither do I.",23Aug2019,1
289,"Im on vacation visiting my mom in another state where my grandparents take care of her and she's told me she wants to commit suicide because she can't take the pain of her conditions (MS and Lupus) anymore. She has told me this many times over the years and we have always talked about it and she's felt better afterwards. She was very excited at first to see me when I said I was coming but the next day after I arrived she has a complete breakdown. She goes on how she will never get better and land a job in with economy with a sexist president like Trump, being embarrassed to be an American and how America has displaced immigrant children and so forth. Since no meds seem to help with the pain she has been on marijuana edibles for a while now but says it doesn't help that much and all she does is sleep and never does anything. She's very Type A and had a huge career in the tech business but has been out of work for about 5 years now because of her conditions (I took care of her for four of those years myself). She talks about how she will never have a relationship again and that my grandparents ruined all of her love life and that she really wants to die this time because she can't accomplish anything and says living with the pain of her conditions and the loss of all of her friends in life isn't worth living anymore.

290,"I really have no idea where to start with this. I've been feeling this way for about 6 months. Everything around me feels fuzzy, like the way you feel for a few minutes after you wake up but it's like this all the time for me. I feel like I'm dreaming and that nothing's real, although I consciously know that it is. I've found myself being less aware of the things around me and acting more bold than usual because of it. Subconsciously, I feel like my actions won't have consequences though I know they will. It's like watching my life in 3rd person, everything takes way longer to process and I can't focus on anything. This includes school since I'm 14, and I seem to learn nothing from class because I can't focus on anything. This has caused my grades to drop and I feel like it's physically impossible to learn anything because of it. I've been formally diagnosed with ADHD and depression. I'm supposed to be on depression meds, but I don't take them because they don't do anything (I'm serious. I was taking them for a couple months and they did nothing, hell I felt more depressed when I was on them. I've been off them for about 3 weeks now and haven't noticed a difference except less depressive episodes). They didn't make me happier or more productive, actually I think they worsened this feeling of fogginess. I don't know if this whole thing is an ADHD thing but it's driving me crazy. I want to live my life to the fullest but I can't when I can't grasp everything that's going on around me like I used to. It's like I'm in autopilot full time and can't turn it off. This lack of focus and immense brain fog has been killing me. Has anyone else felt like this? What can I do about it?",23Aug2019,1
291,"Hi all,

I am 1 of 3 roommates in a small apartment. My other two roommates smoke weed and since the apartment is small you really can’t escape the smell. I was wondering if it would be unreasonable to ask that they either smoke it outside or in their room with the door shut. Smoking in the living room spreads it throughout the place, my room included, and I really dislike the smell. Honestly, you can still smell it, though it’s much less, when they smoke in their room. But I don’t feel it’s fair to ask them to not do something in their own personal space so I won’t ask that of them. Is that unreasonable?",23Aug2019,1

294,"So my girlfriend and I are looking for a rental property in Calgary, AB 🇨🇦. We found this really cute old place in a hipster nebourhood called Inglewood. We met with the landlord and liked the place. He told us it used to be an airbnb/vrbo but it was too much a hassle. He is all about the short term lease which is the first red flag for me. 6 or 8 months. It is all furnished and he is firm on leaving everything there.  Another red flag is winter is coming... He even lowered the price from 1800 to 1600. It took him a few hours to check our references and told us we could sign the lease on saturday and bring the deposit.  Being the mastermind I am, I put all the peices together. Is it normal for an airbnb in slow months to rent to unsuspecting people and then kick you out after the lease is up and start airbnbing when it picks back up? Is this a bad decision? We are going to meet him Saturday where I plan on investigating and asking him bluntly. I like the place but moving in 6 months is worrisome. My girlfriend is so excited about the place I don't think I can break her heart.",23Aug2019,1
295," I had a friend from about 6 years ago. We lost touch after she and her husband got pregnant with her second kid, We stopped hanging out because her husband used to threaten to kill me all the time (He thought I was trying to steal his wife despite not being gay). He had been threatening me since I was 16 years old and we were in Job Corps all together.

When she and I reconnected she started telling me all these things her husband had done to her and the kids. Very Stereotypical abusive and douche nozzle things.

She decided to leave him and I supported her. I have been there since the day she left. Watching her kids, making sure she had food, helping her get to appointments on time, ect. She used to be a housewife and now lives in a shelter. I am supposed to testify in court to set past precedence for her husbands behavior as well as the threats he made against her before he went to work the day she left.

She is constantly mistreating me though. She always dumps her 2 kids on me with no warning, she constantly makes fun at me for being fat, having PTSD (She claims to have PTSD as well), being molested, and a bunch of other things like my depression. She sends me things about abortion supporting her side with no facts (we disagree on it) even though she KNOWS it'll start a fight. She asks me to defend her from people then when I do yells at me for it.

When I tried to bring it up to her gently while she was doing laundry at my house, she started screaming that I triggered her PTSD, that I am just as bad as her husband and started punching herself in the face. She does this when people confront her about anything. I told her to leave.

I was still going to testify but recently she blew off an extremely important meeting (to get stable housing) and instead went to a concert instead with her oldest son. When I told her I wasn't going to watch her youngest while she goes to a concert she got really mad and now won't stop saying ""I keep MY promises"" I never said I would watch him. Her husband was there (Court hasn't happened yet). She has a restraining order but he was there first (cops said he was fine).

Instead of leaving and missing the concert she just ""hid"" her oldest son (who her husband abused most) under her coat and waved at him to rile him up. We highly suspect he has been doing drugs as he is living with his mother and she is a meth addict with a warrant. When my friend forced me to serve him to divorce papers he was definitely on something.

I told her on the phone that I can't do this anymore. I'll watch her oldest for the sleep study she has with her youngest but after that I don't know. She is demanding I watch her kids the day after that so she can go to that meet she blew off earlier. She is also demanding I testify for her and against her husband in court because I am the ONLY person in her life that was there when he started abusing her. I am the ONLY friend from that far back.

Her husband is abusive, she is telling the truth. I have seen it myself, I have testified against him before (not in court, just social services). I just can't take the constant abuse, I tried killing myself, luckily my real friends stopped me (they the real MVPs) and told me to drop her and not help her anymore.

If her husband gets the kids (even partial custody) though I have no doubt he will kill them either in rage or neglect, but if I stay helping her I think I might die myself in the process. I stay up all the time aching over this decision, I don't know if I am in the wrong to wash my hands of this.",23Aug2019,1

301,"We moved in with him when I was 5. Then he broke up with her when I was 12, because some 25 year old co-worker wanted to sleep with him. He threw us out of his house. After 2 months they got back together. And then in the following years they broke up 6 other times.

So now I am 20, They have broken up 7 times and now they are starting to date again. It's just so uncomfortable. The new relationship started by him driving by at hour house, because my mother didn't aswer him for multiple days (After he contacted her after months of no contact) and he was worried about her well-being. They guy has completely lost control over his life. He is an alcoholic, he is morbidly obese, he is a junkie. And all of that at the age of 60. I give him 2 more years to live with that lifestyle. But my mother is like a stupid teenage girl and for some unknown reason she is attracted by ""men"" like him.

So now they are starting to date again and it's so uncomfortable. He is always sitting around at our house and I can't stand him. He smells like nicotine and weed and he is always complaining about everything. He is also always trying to give life advice while he has severe health issues because he is obese and alcohol addicted.

309,"Hello people of Reddit. I am a 17 year old girl and I’m posting this because though I know I have people to talk to, I can’t seem to truly open up to anyone. So I’m coming on here to see if anyone has any advice for me or can help me out in any way. So here’s some information about me. No matter how long I’m peaking, an inevitable fall always happens. I almost always feel guilty. When I’m not home I feel I should be. I feel I don’t spend enough time with my family because I’ve hardly been home this summer, but being home makes me feel even worse. It’s a constant feeling of being torn between spending time with my family, especially my sister over going out and being with my boyfriend and friends. The worst part is nobody forces me or guilt trips me into going anywhere, and I’m welcome everywhere. I just feel that I’m not wanted around much, aside from my sister and my boyfriend. My parents work a lot, my dad 9AM-6PM, and my mom usually 12PM-1PM, and later that day 3PM-11PM. The weekends we can all spend together. The only thing is, is im usually stuck at home through the weekdays to watch my sister, so the weekends are the time I can go out. I usually spend my Fridays and Saturdays with my boyfriend, and can tackle family time too. However, the constant feeling I could do more, spend more time with both. Even though I can’t. I think part of the reason I feel so shitty most of the time is from my birth control. I had a conversation with the person I’m dating a few weeks after we had sex for the first time, that I would get on the pill. When I first got on it, I was slightly moody and nauseous in the morning. But now I think it’s just made me flat out emotional and depressed. I’ve got eating order tendencies as well, so I’m not sure if that helps influence my overall mood of emptiness. I really don’t want this to be a pitty party, I just want to see if anyone can relate or help me out. Where I come from, weed is a pretty common thing and it’s easy to get ahold of. My parents don’t care if I get stoned every once and a while, as long as I’m honest. They know I don’t constantly party and get wasted, so it’s a pretty solid “I don’t need to worry about getting caught” type of attitude I have. However, I smoke a lot more than they think I do. I steal my dads pen, maybe 3 times out of the week. And before when I had my own, I would hit it every night for maybe 9 months. Most of the reason I do it, is because I think/know it will help keep me relatively thin. It’s almost never enjoyable for me, and makes me feel anxious and panicky. I’m just beyond stupid and vein. I’ve recently talked to my best friend of 17 years about this (jokingly) while drunk by the river. It made me feel a little bit better. I haven’t talked to her much this summer, I’ve spend most of it with my boyfriend. Mostly because, he makes me not feel so shitty and I love him. It’s also nice not being home, because I think too much there. Because of this though, I’ve kinda went mute on my best friend. She works constantly, so that also doesn’t help. Not to mention, because of that weird tension was built. Before when she didn’t work so much, we would kind of use each other to uplift and forget about shitty things that were going on. Now, the person I’m dating kinda took that place to some extent. But when my best friend and I were at the beach, I told her a lot of it and now I don’t feel like I need to run from her anymore out of feeling bad. I know this is kind of all over the place, but I hope whoever is reading this can understand. My parents and I have a pretty decent relationship, and I think because I’m gone so much now (because summer) I feel guilty and feel like we’re growing apart. However, their relationship was rocky for a little bit this summer. They almost got a divorce and would rant to me about one another, leaving me kind of in the middle. But a little about my parents individually. My dads pretty stern, kinda tough love if you will. Sometimes, he’s a little too much, but I know he loves me and he’s just looking out for me. Since my moms gone a lot because of working, I take on a second mom role for my 7 year old sister. My mom and I are pretty damn close. I can talk to her about a lot of things. But she frustrates me because she’s so messy and our whole family has just gotten into the habit of me being nanny. Moving onto my sister, she’s diagnosed with selective mutism. Since the time she could speak, she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with girl clothes and likes boy things. She likes to be referred to as a “kid” instead of a “girl”. If she does end up wanting to be a boy or transition, nobody would be close minded about it. The other day I was with my mom and her, and my mom whispered to me that she thinks my sister might have some sort of autism. Which would never be frowned upon, but that same night she told me that I couldn’t stop crying. It makes me feel hopeless and she’s a little behind on growing up. A late bloomer if you will. I though about how she might get bullied at school because kids her age start to understand being almost completely mute to strangers is completely odd. I think that’s about enough, I don’t want for whoever to read this to get bored. All these factors really fuck me up on a daily basis.

I talked to my husband and it was a disaster. I told him I saw his sex tape and asked him if he was gay. He said no. I asked him how long he'd been sleeping with this other man, and he said they've been sleeping together consistently since they were teens.
He cheated on me, multiple times in our marriage, with this man. The conversation went off the rails, I was upset because of how cold he was acting and he just said the nastiest things to me. I didn't even know he was capable of saying such awful things.

I don't think he loves me. He told me he does, but he said he's also been in love with this man since the 90s, and the way he acts... The way he acts with this man... That's not my husband. My husband is quiet, gentle, shy, he's gentle and slow when we make love, and he doesn't have a high sex drive. The man he becomes with this friend, the man I saw in the tape... He's so different. He laughs and messes around and he's like some other creature, some loud, confident, sexual being I've never met.

I had to leave the house, I couldn't handle it. He doesn't love me. He defended his lover to my face, even though this other guy is marrying someone else. I'm staying at my mom's house with the kids, and I don't know what's going to happen next.

Thank you, everybody who gave me advice before.

TL;DR: Confronted cheating husband. He doesn't love me. The man I knew isn't the real him. I don't know what's next.


**ORIGINAL POST**
""
So... This is a long story.

My husband (36M) is perfect. I'm a 32 year old female. 

His old friend (also 36M) was in love with him and made it clear from how bad he hated me. When we started dating he would tell my husband don't marry her, ditch your girl, she's too dumb, you can do better, I hate her, she's just a pair of breasts, etc. 
My husband has never even indicated he liked men, or liked this guy more than a friend. 

They fell out and didn't speak for years when the friend cut off contact with him. 
Got back in contact a year ago. Husband is now on his phone a lot, taking sudden long trips to see his old friend, and when we were all together for a music festival he insisted on having time totally alone with his friend (who is engaged to a man). 

A couple weeks back I went to use his computer in his home office for work, and I clicked the wrong file. 

It opened up a pornographic video of my husband and this other man together, recording themselves having sex. 

It's very old, more than a 15 years old video which I know because they look the way they did as teens and I recognise his old house, but he's clearly been watching it because it's in his recently viewed section. There might be more but I was so upset I shut the file and left the room before he got back.

He has social media accounts where he talks to this friend but he always logs out every time he puts his phone down or leaves the computer so he must be hiding more. 
I'm a wreck, but I love him so much and he's so sweet and loving to me and our family. I don't want to leave him. 

What do I do? 

Do I confront his side piece? The friend is engaged, do I tell his fiance that his guy is a cheater, save the poor man the heart break of finding out by himself? I don't feel right knowing something is happening but keeping it a secret from somebody else who's going through it. 

Do I find his password and log in, get proof he's cheating? 

I've been married for over 10 years. My husband is the best, sweetest, funniest man I've ever met, and so incredible. I feel like I'm in a dream with him. He's an incredible father, treats his stepson and our little one like they're both his own, and the kids love him. 
I don't want to leave him. Please help.""",23Aug2019,2

315,"So around two years ago I got the job at my local corner shop, about 6 months after that they convinced me to move into the flat upstairs. It’s all been downhill from there. 

I moved into the flat with my now ex boyfriend and everything was good at work, the people there were great. But now I’m upstairs on my own I’m struggling to stay afloat, having to borrow money from my mum for the past few months because my hours at work have been cut significantly. Im unsure of what to do because it’s a small family run business and my landlord is my boss’ brother. 
For the past 6 months or so something has changed at work, I’m not the only one to notice it, there are about 5 of us on the team who aren’t happy with the way things are running at the moment and most of them are planning on leaving when they have something better lined up. 

I’m planning on going back to the family home for a while until i can save up some money and sort myself out without having to keep taking from my mum. I’ve been slowly packing up the flat and getting rid of stuff I don’t need so I can move out as quickly and quietly as possible when the time comes. 

I’m just unsure of how to time things, I have to put in notice within two weeks to not be stuck here another month, but I have to talk to my boss first so she doesn’t find out through her brother that I’m leaving. My boss is the reason we’re all wanting to leave, she used to be great but lately all she’s been doing is stirring gossip about others to everyone else and being generally rude about people behind their back, it’s turned a little toxic and it’s not been great for me upstairs. A lady who works has been saying for a few months now that she will be looking for extra hours somewhere else because she’s not getting enough here and our boss hasn’t had a problem with it, until the other day when she went to let her know she’s found extra hours and they’ll be around what she has here, she was met with ‘oh no you can’t do that I’m going to need you every weekend with ___ leaving next week and ___ having a week off soon’ so after hearing that response I’m now really nervous of saying I’m leaving and just want advice really on what you think is the best way to do it all as quickly and quietly as possible. 

TLDR: Toxic workplace I want to leave and flat I can’t afford above workplace owned by small family, best way to leave both as quickly and quietly as possible?

Sorry it’s jumbled my head is scattered a lot lately, thank you for any advice you may have for me.",23Aug2019,1

317,"Hello,

I posted a question for advice on a different sub (you can look at my post history), but this is the first time that I have posted on this sub.

My boyfriend and I had a pretty big argument (the biggest we'd ever have; But it wasn't yelling or anything, it was just very serious) since I posted it. He basically just told me that I was selfish that I couldn't find a way to stay for the extra year in our new city that we agreed upon and how he is making the sacrifice for me/our relationship and staying only 2 extra months.

Then, for the past 3 or so days, it's just been really weird with us. We'd get home from work and wouldn't really talk much and there was some tension.

Well, I am a *very* emotional person, so I've just been crying to him for the past 3 days and asking what can I do to be a better partner and person. He basically told me that I need to stop being selfish and less emotional, and more rational.

He also said that when he moves back in December, we'd still obviously be living together, but I need to have my own life outside of him (I don't here in our new city, I never made the effort to go out and make friends so we've just been around each other most of the time). He said that back in our old city, it can't be hanging out with each other every single night. I need to see my own/old friends and build up those friendships again. And if one of us is hanging out with friends, the other doesn't always have to join. And pretty much said that if he comes back and things revert back to me hanging around him the whole time and not having a life outside of him, he'll move right back to the new city and make it permanent.

Him and I are going to be away from each other this weekend on pre-planned trips (he is going on a guy's trip and I am going back to the west coast to see family). We agreed that we won't talk/text this weekend, only to tell the other that we landed, but that's it. I think it'll be good for us to not talk for 3 days.

I've known that I need to not be selfish and I need to stop being so emotional. I've just bought a couple 'self-help' books on both of these topics, but is there any other advice I could get on how I can 'fix' this?

I want to become a better person and grow, but the helping my relationship aspect is a side-effect of changing.

320,"&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR :** Had ""threesome"" but with no penetration. Smoked weed after a while to celebrate.  Had a deep talk with the other guy about the girl without her hearings. Girl slept already , both tired went to sleep on a big bed for 3 people, i woke up with a super realistic dream and also thinking was it real? Did he ""betrayed"" me after all the talk.

Obviously this is a throwaway account. I am also not a native English speaker but i try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

So lets begin with a little backstory of me.

I am a person that likes to party and of course to drink. But i am also a person that doesn't initiate any party's. That means i go only to partys if someone invites me (This month, 2 times). I dont do hard drugs, being a asian student and a non-smoker,addicted to video games, sometimes smoking weed but its suuuuuper rare and i dont smoked huge junks. To this day its been only 3 times as i can remember . And the ""third"" one is reason why i am here. 

There was huge gap between the second one and the third one about 3 months i think. And Thursday was the second day of the Gamescom. I came alone to Cologne, mainly because of a girl i met on the previous Gamescom, this year being the 5th Gamescom i visit. Over a year from the previous Gamescom to this Gamescom 2019, i met more people through the internet that associate with the girl. Yesterday i meet up with the girl and 1 additional Asian guy that i also knew. It was the first time i have saw him in real life.

Over the year i talked with her get to know her etc. I have no strong feelings for her. Because over the year the more the person you speak to the more she is willing to show her ""true colors"" . I saw the true colors and i knew she is THAT Typ of person. She is addicted to Asian boys and you can... u know.... this.... stuff..... as long you are Asian. And that sealed it for me, that i dont want a  committed relationship with her. BUT. **I could score.** 

We, having fun on the Gamescom with a group size of 3 people: Me, She, the other Asian Guy. Well the Gamescom was about to end. Along the way i met a new friend and he was a cool dude, we exchanged numbers. Later he contacted me and invited me to little party. I being the one invited ask the rest of the group and they agreed. About 30 mins travel, we met  with the guy and went to the party....

\&gt;We went for a goose chase and never find the party,  went for hours, my group was tired, my group wants to go home. I was in a Position and time that it was very hard to get to my AIRBNB from here. But the Girl lives nearby and invited me and the other guy to come to her place , the idea is that she can drive me back to my place.  IT would take more than 1 hour to get home from here. Conveniently i rented a AIRBNB place thats nearby her place. It was just a 15 min car drive from there. After the arrival at her place , we drove as a group back to me.  The AIRBNB was also too large for 1 person. I HAD 2 bathrooms! They of course wanted to take a shower just like me. So we did. 

ALSO conveniently , the girl HAD 2 Asian Boys beside her. She wanted a threesome. One thing lead to another we played on each other but there was no penetration because she was on her days. The atmosphere was out. AND I had the Idea to smoke weed to kinda celebrate this. I also was Hungry and hadn't eat much, the other 2 were Hungry too. So we drove  to first MC-Donalds to order food and THEN we smoke weed. The Problem is: Only the girl had some weed left, so we drove back get it and drove back to my place. Her house was not suitable because the parents were home.

There was not much left. So the girl sat out this joint for our sake and because she was the driver (this will be important later.). Only me and the other Asian had the joint. Being a low key smoker i was coughing, we had a really had a deep talk about the girl what to do next outside of her hearings.  After we came back being stoned, we noticed she slept on the bed. We also went directly to sleep next her, the bed was that BIG for 3 people. 

Then.... i heard my Heartbeat i THINK. BUT. Also i thought: ""Hey, IS it really my Heartbeat that keeps the bed moving? do they.... no that cant be... ar...are they fucking?""

I stand up to take a look at the situation. I didnt see her head besides me , she was sitting in the bed, i also saw a flashlight getting turn off quickly and saw her head moving fast besides mine. ""Pretending to sleep?"" i thought , i sat up very fast and was shocked after the fact me and the other dude had a really deep talk about this. I said : "" Why do you betrayed me?"" There was no Communication, no talk. The Girl went straight to her Clothes because she had my clothes on after a shower.

""After all the deep we had talk?"" ""Fine, just tell me did you do it or not?"" They dont know. They didnt look in my eyes, kinda giggling and said ""No we didnt do anything."" I was thinking: ""Alriiiiight prove it, i sensed a motion, even its a Handjob OR fucking just tell me and i am good."" ... They didnt. They are still pretending? i thought to myself: i saw a flashlight turning off, a quick motion and a awkward silence and she was packing her stuff fast. After being really aggressive about asking they prove me something like the tambon is still inside her and nothing was stained by blood if they did it. ""Hmmm interesting.""

""What about a Handjob?"" they are ""pretending"" that they didnt do anything and was packing fast because she needs to go home before her parents gonna wake up .....thats what i was told, by them. It was about 4.50 AM in the morning. There was some heated discussion. In the End i was super Angry and threw them out of my place while confiscating a expensive item that does belong to the other guy. I made a deal to give me 5 min to think alone. They thought i would destroy it and were afraid to go, i am not that typ of person i just **NEED** think. I said: ""Take my Keys its chained to my wallet there everything in it that i need to ""Life"" "". 

I kept the promise, laying the Item on a ground that can be spotted easily and so that they cant see me. They came back and looked after me, they saw me laying on the bed looking at the ceiling. Trying to convince me that they didnt do anything. I ""accepted it"" but they didnt believe me. 

After a while they said we gonna to you tomorrow. Not answering, they left. 

Thinking:

""Was it... not....real? Even i saw the flashlight turning off, saw a quick motion, there was no communication, no eye contact, a fast changing girl? Packing her stuff? And the Awkward silence? Was is it a Dream?! IT WAS SO REALISTIC THAT CANT BE! "" 

....I checked everything on the bed. Started to clean the room searching for evidence, the used clothes from me that the girl wore. I didnt notice anything significant.

323,"We were both drunk one night &amp; I was bored &amp; he was down so we hooked up, no sex but like clothes were off, he spent the night. It was honestly horrible, he was a really bad kisser &amp; just not good at anything. He &amp; I were good friends before. This was in May. He also was super super excited about the whole thing &amp; kept talking about “next time” while I’m like...this will NEVER happen again... I also told him at the moment it was just for fun.

Since then, he’s been acting weirdly. We were in different cities for the summer but now back in college &amp; we used to talk a lot before (as friends, I don’t think he’s attractive) but even right after I hooked up with him, he just started irritating me. He visited with some friends to my city, was very touchy to where I was scooting away from him, &amp; when he left, he texted me telling me “I can tell you’ve been working out” &amp; when we would FaceTime, he’d randomly tell me that I was cute or hot. I also HATE HATE HATE compliments like this &amp; my friends know that. I just feel so annoyed when I hear things like this. I pretty much ignored his calls or kept them short because I just have zero interest in talking to him anymore.

We’re both back in college &amp; he’s been trying to hang out. I don’t mind if 1) he doesn’t compliment me, makes me feel so uncomfortable, 2) he doesn’t get all touchy with me, 3) in a group setting.
He called me like 3-4x today &amp; I finally picked up, told him I was in the middle of a movie &amp; he kept asking when he was going to see me &amp; also about my class schedule. I told him I didn’t have classes Friday &amp; he was like “That’s good, you have more time to hang out with me!” Like dude back off lmao. He also invited me to a party &amp; was super offended that I only like to party with my two best friends, both out of town right now.

For some reason, overall I just don’t want to really interact with him anymore? Like yeah we were good friends before but I don’t really care for his friendship? That sounds so bitchy lol but just everything about him irritates me in a way that it never did before.

Anyways I don’t want to hurt his feelings because he is super sensitive, so I obviously can’t come out directly &amp; say that I don’t really want to hang out because he will take offense.",23Aug2019,1

325,"My coworker (m) and I (f) have known each other for about 6 months.  We hit it off the day we met and grow closer and closer everyday.  In such a short amount of time we've moved drastically from acquaintances to best friends.  We basically sit next to each other at work, so most of the 8 hour day is spent talking and getting to know each other better.  Our conversations always flow so naturally and I feel as if we are able to communicate with and understand each other in a way that nobody else does.  He has disclosed multiple ""deep, dark, hidden secrets"" to me that he claims he has never told anyone else before.  I feel as if we are soulmates, because the connection is so strong.  We are often finishing the others' thought or sentence and seem to be highly attuned to what the other is thinking or feeling.  I enjoy how we can engage in witty banter or playfully tease each other one minute, discuss a personal or serious issue the next minute, randomly break out in dance together and sing a duet to the radio after, then end up sharing childhood memories without any effort at all.  Oftentimes we question whether or not we knew each other in a past life.   I feel like the term ""work spouse"" would be the quickest way to define us, however our relationship is more than a platonic work relationship.  There is a lot of physical touching and flirting, and some days the sexual tension is next to unbearable.  Around 2 months ago we started hanging out outside of work more often (maybe once every week or so).  He has introduced me to his close friends during the one or two group outings he's invited me to, and I feel happy that he is slowly letting me into his entire life.  He is overall such an amazing person.  He listens to my constant rambling about life and seems to genuinely enjoy it, buys us lunch often, makes me feel on top of the world by always complimenting me on both my mental and physical traits each day, does small tasks for me when I'm too busy or overwhelmed with work, and just makes me feel very happy and lucky to have that support in my life.  Being the great person he is, he was recently offered a promotion.  It would obviously include a substantial raise and job title, but would also require him to move into his own office on the other side of the building.  He asked me what I think he should do.  I didn't want to influence his decision, so I responded by asking him what **he** wants.  He said that although it would be higher pay, he likes where he is now.  He said that he enjoys what we have and that he doesn't want to put himself in a position where he wouldn't be able to spend as much time with me.  He has told me before that it makes him very happy when he is with me, and that his life is so much better and happier now that I'm in it.  However, I know he could really use the money right now and his career would benefit a lot from this new opportunity.  I most definitely don't want him to move but I want him to do what's best for himself.  I don't want to hold him back from anything.  I want him to have a better financial situation and succeed in his career.  At this point he seems pretty set on turning down the promotion to stay next to me, and I can't help but feel the need to take action.  I feel like he's essentially throwing away this opportunity for me.  While this gesture makes me feel very appreciative and cared about, it also makes me upset that he would do that to himself.  He is a hard worker and puts his all into everything he does, so he deserves this so much.  I've thought a lot about what I should do but I'm stuck.  I love being with him more than anything but I care too much about him to let him sacrifice anything for me.  We will be in the same building so it's not like we will never see each other again, however time together and conversations would be cut to solely outside of work (seeing each other 40 hours/week to only 1 or 2 days per week would be a huge change on the both of us).  Or is 40 hours too much for friends to be with each other anyways?  I have thought about pushing him into taking the job but I don't want to nag him into doing something he doesn't want to do.  I even wondered if I should leave and work at a different company so he wouldn't have a hard time choosing whether to take it or not.  But at the same time I feel like this is sort of manipulation?  I'm a little torn.  I just want to do what's best for him whether that's making him go or respecting his decision to stay.  I just don't want him to look back one day and regret the decisions he made because of me, who by the way is hardly even worthy of such a good person.  Relationships and friendships may come and go but his career will stick with him for the rest of his life.  How do you guys think I should handle this situation?  Should I say or do anything at all?  What do you think is the right thing to do next?",23Aug2019,1

At one point she found out I liked her, and then mentioned about screwing other dudes when I thought she still didn't know. Things turned a little sour nearing end of college, when she thought I was not capable leading group projects, she said that i'm immature and I won't go far in life ""with that attitude."" She still sought help from me with some modules because she was failing, while I was doing alright. Now I've been working a FT job and I'm happy in life.

It;s been 4 whole months since graduation and I still think about her, she was kinda nice after all the arguments. It's just that I can't stop thinking about her, as if I genuinely care about her. I'm turning 18 in a week and I feel like asking her out for drinks even though we haven't spoke in months. I think I'm trying to seek closure but I'm not sure if its a good idea. What do you guys think ? Any advice ?",23Aug2019,2
333,"Hello! Thank you for taking time to read this. 

Situation:  I just began my first semester in college. So before that I have never taken an online class. And I'm seriously doubting my decision right now as I'm currently enrolled in an online class. Now, it's important to mention that by no means is this class as high-demanding as other online classes. All you need to do is turn in one assignment each week, and a final that is worth 50% of our grade. But, some of the prompts for the assignments that I've read are really scary, to put it simply. And I don't know if the self-directed learning, little to no interaction with the teacher (face-to-face) and my lack of experience with this different approach to learning is really what's best suited for me. Sure I don't have to do quizzes, exams, discussions, etc. Like what the irl class would consist of but, I don't know if the pros outweigh the cons in this situation. And there is one more available seat for the irl class ( don't know how long that would last)

I just don't know if I should just try it out online, risk maybe not doing so well. Or go to class and have to do all these other requirements.

I just don't know. I really need advice on what to do. Please help  : (",23Aug2019,1

335,"Growing up i always thought i would one day become a writer, musician, artist, or heck *all three at the same time*, and as a kid my parents encouraged me! until i got a bit older and they started wanting me to focus on more “stable” jobs. the reason these career paths spoke to me was because of how much of a real connection i had made with these art forms, and i wanted to be apart of it. i wanted to create and help/inspire others along the way! 

leaving behind my artistic pursuits, i recently went into studying natural nutrition, and its just not what i WANT. its a lonely, expensive journey that i dont feel inspired to take.

my MAIN question here is about the art industry/field. i think my view is too narrow, and im sure it doesnt have to be some “unstable pipe dream” like people make it out to be. For example, i like reading/writing, but that doesn’t necessarily mean i have to write my own book, you know? how else can i work in this field? Or for music, i like to play guitar, but that doesnt have to mean starting a band and writing a record... what else is there?

336,"I just found out (in an airport, mind you) that my brother’s dog attacked and killed my dog when he was living with my dad. And I’m super upset. My brother told me the dogs ahead a fight and that max( my dog) was hurt but he thinks he’s alright. This was almost a month ago. My dad just told me that my brothers dog actually ripped out my dogs throat and he passed away and no one thought to tell me. I’ve been living in Alaska for the past year and only saw my dog twice before this and I’m devastated. I can only imagine how scared and alone he felt when this happened. I’m also extremely upset with my family but that’s not what I need advice about. I need to know what I should do to handle the situation. Ny brother recently moved into an apartment with his dog and girlfriend and Im scared for his safety. As mad as I am I love my brother and don’t want anything to happen to him. What if his dog turn and attack’s him and seriously injures him. What if he attacks a child? Like, there are too many things that can go wrong here. I will say that my brother is very protective over this dog. He adopted him almost 2 years ago and they do have a great relationship from what I can see bur only them. His dog was a bait dog and is now super aggressive. So much so that he’s been kicked out of 3 training schools. I feel for this dog, and I understand that with his background my extra large dog looked like a threat but this can’t happens again. Is the only option to put the dog down? And if so, how do I anonymously report the dog so that animal control can come take him? Or should I talk to my brother to see if he will surrender the dog to a rescue? Sorry for such a long rant I’m just not really sure what to do or how to feel right now.

Weve been pacing back and forth and I say shit like I dont get to play enough video games or I dont do what i want enough. For the most part id say im a normal person but my internet thoughts just absolutely mess me up. I dont know whether I feel like we should just break up so I may continue back to my old life or keep working on life (Were 3 years together so far with a 3 month break) I love my girlfriend (atleast i think i do) but ever since from an hour ago.

Ive had problems with smoking pot, Gaming excessively, Masturbating, like... alot. at work, at home, fucking everywhere. I feel as if shes made me as a better person but i cant help but feel a depression for things that have molded me into me when i was younger. I have no idea where this is going cause im lost and im sorry but i needed a place to say all this and Reddit has always been there for me when it comes to getting any sort of information/answers and different views in any topic.

I feel as if im not mature enough or im just missing something that i cant fix in myself or if its just the withdrawals of addictions, It seems ive had a Epiphany on the fact that my mind is my own enemy and honestly i have no idea how or where to proceed forward from here, I cant just wake up tomorrow morning and forget about it, But i also cant continue with these feelings and im almost scared to feel the aftermath of it all..

339,"Long story short: I'm sick because I'm really not able to work and am supposed to keep low, no strenuous activity and stuff. 

Co-worker wrote me a message that he has seen me jogging, included also a small description of myself. I answered back that's not how I look, that's not what I do, if you see me that's probably walking slowly and even then not in your area (we're ~1h drive apart).

Should be finde but he then told me about his day, send a picture and made nice. I was still bitter and to underline that I spoke the truth I sent him two pictures, one when I was jogging at march, the other one the day he meant. 
He answered the person has looked exactly the same (what really can't be, my gear is truly one of a kind) but he doesn't care if I do this or not, it's not his problem.

340,"Basically, I am currently living in a pretty big (75% empty) house and I'm freaking out.

For the past 5 years I've lived in a house with housemate (friends of mine). The house is being sold in the fall so my housemates moved out two weeks ago and I'm moving into a condo in October. I'm not used to living on my own and it is making me very paranoid. The housemates used be gone for 2-3 weeks at a time, so I don't think its the being alone part that scares me, it's the empty house. I live in the ground entry basement so all of upstairs is empty. To makes matters worse, there's no carpet or drapes on the windows so I'm living in an echo chamber.

I thankfully have cats to blame (some) weird noises on and I can close the door to the upstairs to limit some noises. But I'm an anxious person. I'm not too worried about a break-in (there's a security system and there's not much to steal anyway!). I'm more worried about structural damage (a fire, a tree falling over, etc) and having to deal with it on my own (I know it's very unlikely any of that will happen in the next two months but I'm in a wheelchair and dealing with the property is hard enough not under emergencies). Two nights ago I heard some loud bangs and it REALLY scared me. I found out later a bunch of teenagers broke into the shed on the school property beside the house (I'm not sure if knowing that is a good or a bad thing). 

Every weird noise (even the dryer is now making a weird scraping sound) is freaking me out. I'm not falling asleep, I'm not sleeping well, and I'm generally just a rolling ball of panic. I've been listening to music, podcasts, TV shows and generally making sure I always have some background noise, but sometimes that doesn't help because I'll think I hear something or know I did but can't identify it because of the other background noise.

 Is there anything I can do to calm myself? I'm just hoping this stress doesn't carry over to when I'm living on my own in a condo.",23Aug2019,1
341,"Short story straight I’m something of a piece of shit and have been from birth. But it all changed when I met this girl who’s a few years older than me. 

I met her selling drugs lmao. But she was a college kid and was way more self aware and intelligent Than anyone I’ve met. At this time I was still in high school going through some rough shit and this was 2 years ago. I ended up getting kicked out of my home my junior year and had to drop out of school.

Me and her always had a steady text relationship I’d see how she was doing and she would see how I was which was wet comforting. Fast forward to this summer. 

She tells me she’s back in town from college and was looking for some acid. Being the mad lad I am I had that shit on deck. I sold her a bunch and that was the most insane moment of my life. She had her long majestic curly hair down and was just in a great skippity mood. I explained to her how it was and how to handle it. And she said something like “we gotta hang this summer dude”

This insane chick paid for my GED and drove me to it and didn’t care when I payed her back. I didn’t wanna take it but I had to get my education. 

So as it goes on she gets me job at her work because I quit mine and couldn’t find one fast enough. So I’m around her all the time. So far we went out to eat a couple of times and just talked and had a good time. It was amazing. 

I been an alcoholic and have had substance abuse problems for a long time. But somehow she’s helped me get clean from it all through comforting and guiding me. I’m in a much better place all together because of her. Like without her I’d literally be dead. My heart is Uber fucked because of my issues. 

So fast forward to now she leaves to school soon and we planned out another date except it’s not really a date since I didn’t tell her I even like her. Just seeing a movie we were both interested in. I know with a doubt I want and maybe need to pursue as far it goes respectfully. I got a high charisma stat but I just don’t know if it’s a good idea. 

No way to ever know if someone likes you back. Anytime someone cares for me I just let it go because I can’t recognize the difference between intimacy and friendship through care.

It gets weird once you confess your feelings. But this time it’s just too good to pass. I’ve been single off and on for years kinda just sticking with the same girls off and on since high school. But I think I need to do this for myself. 

I digress, thank you for reading if you did and I simply want to know what y’all would do or what advise or incite you may have to help me. Thank you",23Aug2019,3
342,"I’m 21 years old. I work warehouse jobs and retail. I wanted to be a nurse. But I can’t afford it.

344,"I moved into my own place for the first time in mid-July (18M), and while I love it in general, it gets a bit rough at times living alone. It doesn't help that my hopes of a relationship with my mutual crush fell through, and that I had to cut off one of my other closer friends for touching me in ways I wasn't comfortable with (something I'm also still struggling with heavily).

I just got myself a job on my campus to pass some time and meet other college students. It's definitely helpful; I've met lots of other cool people there already. Once school starts next week I think things might get a bit better, but I'm worried that it still won't be enough to make me feel whole, based on similar experiences from my past. Even now, I keep myself occupied but I'm constantly obsessing over how lonely I am. My medicine is helping, but not enough.

I was thinking of getting a dog (a long-time dream of mine) to have some permanent companionship in this empty silent apartment. That's pretty much what I feel I need at this point, as I'm admittedly pretty codependent. I don't want to make an irresponsible decision, though. I recognize that I'm still just a sophomore and lots of things could change. For instance, I'm looking at transferring into a major city, and it would be near impossible to find a pet-friendly apartment there without taking out a student loan. As far as medical expenses, I've run it by my parents casually and they don't seem to be completely against it. They just have similar concerns about me transferring and more importantly taking on such a huge commitment in general. Food is a non-issue, and so are walks and boarding. I just wanna make sure I can give a dog everything they deserve if I get one.

Aside from that, are there any shorter-term solutions to loneliness that I might be overlooking? It's getting really frustrating and I'm sort of afraid of slipping back into a severe depression. I wish there was some magical pill to make myself better.",23Aug2019,2
347,"So I've wanted the same tattoo for about five years now. A bird in flight and some flowers, neo-traditional style, kinda like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBG_u1EhyE2/?taken-by=onholliday), but on my shoulderblade. I'm super picky about artists and I've held off getting it because I couldn't get in with anyone I really liked.   


Finally, an artist I really like is coming to my country and... she's happy to tattoo me! Yay, right?! Except now I feel terrified, and like maybe this is some dumb teenage decision I'll regret, and the tattoo won't turn out right, and I'll hate it forever. I was crazy excited for a bit and then it was like a switch flipped and the excitement turned into fear and negativity.   


Do I listen to this voice or do I tell it to STFU? I have a history of coming close to awesome opportunity and then bailing because I have this negative voice telling me not to do it, it's affected my life in much bigger ways than a tattoo that doesn't matter (career mostly). It tells me anything good enough for me to get can't really be all that great. I don't want to let that voice win again. But then at the same time I don't want to be stuck with something on my body forever that makes me sad when I look at it, and what if this is my real instinct talking and not the negative voice.

350,"Any advice would be appreciated 

I met this guy on here and honestly need help deciding whether it's better to just never talk to him again because I guess he displayed some red flags at the start of our conversations but I just ignored them because he was someone to talk to and I was feeling very alone. I'll try to keep this as anonymous as I can but he said he was 17 so one year older than I was.Basically I think he has anger issues. After the first week that we started talking, he kept saying he was having these meltdowns. We were having this conversation one day and then he suddenly started going over the things he hated about himself out of nowhere. I was overwhelmed because he had told me previously that he was in a good mood so I was kind of confused. It all started with him saying he wanted to send me a gift which I said no because I didn't want someone to spend money on me because we had only known eachother for a week or so.  He didn't say anything specifically offensive to me when he was angry but just left and sent me pictures of a smashed wall the next day. Its kind of those situations where you have to control your every word because you don't want someone to go and smash something. I just wanted a normal friendship. 

I just tried to be as understanding as I could the first time but then it happened again and he was just impacting my mood. He was a good friend the rest of the time and we had talked for about a month every day for nine hours sometimes. We voice chatted on most of these days and he offered that I'd either visit him in a year or he'd visit me.Thats why when his messages started becoming sentences rather than paragraphs after the two week marker everything changed. He didn't text me for 3 days which was completely fine but when he did he was telling me that he threw something again. I just didn't know how to deal with the situation because this had happened too many times. So I sent him a text just saying politely that I had my own problems too and the friendship is becoming one sided. I was just being honest and wanted to solve the problem. In no way was I saying I wouldn't listen to him, I said I would actually. I was feeling very bad for those past few days and I just said the truth to him. Nothing about what I said was offensive. I was just trying to reach a conclusion of understanding each other. 

So he didn't answer me after that for about 4 days again so I just deleted him because I thought he was toxic. I've honestly been so depressed after all this because the silence was worse than him cursing at me or something because then I'd have a reason to move on. After three weeks of talking non-stop this was difficult to do as I felt like there wasn't that same person to talk to. So I was stupid and sent him a message again and said I was sorry for being selfish when infact I know I wasn't being selfish so I don't really know why I said that. I mostly wanted a reaction because he hadn't say anything since that day. I guess when I deleted him, I should have just gone on with my life but as I said that was difficult to do that so I just went back to the root of my problem. He finally sent me a message back and said that what I said impacted him and was just being very rude to me. I don't see how what I said could have impacted anyone because I was just trying to make him see what he was doing in a nice way. He doesnt even care about what an impact he had on me. 

Thats basically the full story and I was just looking for someone to try and guide me by telling me if the situation would improve if I never talked to him again. Does he seem toxic to you and would you do the same as me?",23Aug2019,1

Background: I’ve had anxiety all my life, and for some reason it has chosen to manifest quite badly in the form of exam anxiety. I have taken my practical driving test 4 times in the past. I failed each time to a mixture of severe anxiety and just not being ready. This has left me slightly traumatised and just the thought of my next driving test brings me to tears.

It’s been a year since my last driving test, and my instructor thinks I’m ready. I actually have a test booked for next week. However, I know I’m going to panic and make a silly mistake and fail yet again. I’m so so nervous and I’m really not sure I’m capable of passing in a test environment. Honestly I’m terrified.

I don’t actually need to drive for another 2 years as I am at university. On the other hand, this is my last chance before my theory expires, and if I don’t pass now I will have to learn to drive in another city and retake my theory.

I know we shouldn't compare ourselves to others, I feel such joy for my sister but such sadness for myself because I feel like that financial security if outside my reach, the fact she is younger than me, makes me feel like I'm failing or falling behind. 

Because my joy for her is shadowed by sadness for me, I hate myself. When we go wedding planning and I'm so full of energy on the outside, excited for her and making sure she feels like the most important person in the room (she is my baby sister I will always put her first) I can't even look myself in the mirror with the guilt of my own deep dark self pity. 

I'm with my partner a long time but having a child before marriage means finances goes to that life, we are also back in university studying.. this has put any engagement on hold for us even further away. Buying a home now, is a laughable idea. We also had children before we got married which has always bothered me. I'm constantly embarrassed to tell people I can't go out with them because I just don't have the money to.. seriously some weeks I have less than $10ers left after bills and food.

Another had someone's head skinned to the point that it was basically a red skull, and what really got to me is the fact that he was chillingly smiling and winking. Almost a month later these images still haunt me, I can still remember the little details in them. I don't have nightmares, but I think about them at most nights and I just really want to forget about them",23Aug2019,1

One of my closer friends who I introduced to skating really changed my life, he gave me so much time that was previously sitting st home bored, now, he’s moved on and found new friends at school (the more popular guys) and it just breaks my fucking heart to see this happen in so many situations now, I feel like shit because I’m always left out like this and disregarded as if no one cares about me.

366,"This is a long story and I’m not sure what to do. 

TL;DR our tweaker neighbor broke my roommates locks in her car and she got him arrested with the help of his brother and his girlfriend. He spent a week in jail and just got out. His former crimes include breaking and entering and trying to cut his girlfriends head off which he did 9 years for. I’m super scared he’s gonna try to break in and do something bad to us. I’m not sure what to do next.

I live in a house with 4 women and a couple who rents my roommates RV in the driveway. Occasionally some of our boyfriends sleep over.
The neighborhood we live in is definitely poor but mostly fine. There is one house down the street three houses down that is definitely sketch. The house looks run down and there’s a giant tarp over part of it. It definitely screams ‘tweaker’ house and they have busted cars coming and going all day long.
Recently some of my roommates had their locks been broken to their cars.
I’ve been house sitting for a couple weeks so I haven’t been around for what happened.
One of my roommates has a barely functioning car that she never uses which has been parked across the street from their house for almost a year. One day we get a knock on the door and it’s this big white dude who is saying that someone taped a smiley face to his car window and my roommates car window. He is one of the people who live at that house.
My roommate isn’t around for this so our other roommates boyfriend goes to investigate. Apparently whoever did this also put super glue into both of their locks. He then tells my roommates bf “I’m a white supremecist and I’ll kill somebody” (not the most reassuring thing to hear!)

My roommate eventually deals with it and it turns out there are two brothers who live at that house and one of them helped her get into her car. She eventually even offers to sell it to them for $100.

Time goes by and one day my roommate is outside and another neighbor approaches her and tells her not to sell the car to them because the older brother is the one who broke her locks. He’s known them since they were teenagers. She is actually not surprised by this since they are super sketchy and when the younger brother approaches to buy the car she tells him she knows his brother did it. He says he just found out and he’s sorry etc. and then she proceeds to say that if she sees that guy she’s gonna f him up(totally unnecessary)

Later that night they get a knock on the door and it’s a woman, the girlfriend of the younger brother I think. She tells my roommate not to mess with that guy because he’s dangerous and he just got out of prison, he did 9 years for trying to cut his ex girlfriends head off!!

The girl says to my roommate if she wants to call the cops she will back her up about what he did to her car.  My roommate being an idiot told her that she wasn’t afraid of him cuz she’s crazy too.

My other roommate was freaked out having heard this and convinced her to file a police report so that she at least has a paper trial. Instead of doing this she calls the police and the cop comes and apparently is a total jerk. He keeps asking her what she wants him to do and warning her if he goes to talk to the guy that he might retaliate.

Meanwhile the brother and girlfriend are watching from the sidewalk. My roommate tells the cop to talk to them and they corroborate her story and give him an address of where he’s staying (apparently he doesn’t live at that house)

The cop leaves and then comes back a couple hours later and just tells my roommate “you got what you wanted, I arrested him” and leaves without further explanation.

There’s a number on the sheet he left that you are supposed to call if you want to press charges or something like that but I don’t think my roommate knew that. She thought it was to get info. She called and they asked for her name and case number and just said okay.

My roommate then went out of town for a week and came back yesterday. She called another number to find out what happened with the guy and turns out he was in jail for 10 days and just got out yesterday! 
He was charged with criminal mischief and vandalism or something like that. And they said on the phone that they had enough evidence to charge him and that they were moving forward and my roommate would get paperwork in the mail.

I’m freaked out right now because we looked him up and he has a huge list of charges for breaking and entering and it turns out his parole was over in June. I’m afraid he’s going to get really mad and try to break in and hurt us. Right now none of our boyfriends are here so it’s just us 4 girls alone. I have motion sensor lights next to my window but I am keeping them closed and locked even though it’s hot out and I have a screen.

I know the cops really aren’t going to do shit and I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.",23Aug2019,1

368,"So here's some context: About three months ago, I (21M) found out that, we'll call her Cici, (22F) had a crush on me. Up until this point I had never kissed anyone or had any sexual interactions before. So I went out on a date with her because I wanted to get to know her a little better. The date was cool but I wasn't absolutely convinced yet. She found out about my sexual history through my friends and then offered to help me lose my sexual innocence. I was really conflicted because my brain was saying I should just leave her be and not take up her offer but my other brain said I should just take it... I wouldn't get this lucky again. Fast forward to about a month ago and I sit her down and say ""I don't think I could get into a relationship with you because I wouldn't give it 100%. I feel strange because I'm not gonna lie to you, I want physical intimacy but I don't want to use you. Just give me a week or two and I'll be fine though"" and she said ""That's cool but look... I'm alright my offer to you still stands"".""Are you sure? I don't want you to feel used or to catch feelings and get hurt. That's literally the last thing I want""""It's fine dude... I genuinely don't mind""

So three weeks ago, I'm working on an assignment and she asks to take a walk. While we're on the walk she says ""Time to give you that first kiss"" and then we made out.  We made out again about 4 days ago and it got pretty hot (at least by my standards). Throughout all of this I reiterated that if she feels like she's catching feelings then she must let me know. Yesterday she pulled me aside and said that she can't go on with our arrangement and I said it's okay and that I understand where she's coming from. I thanked her for helping me out and then I thought as a sweet gesture, I could give her one last singular kiss to show my thanks and end our intimacy. We had that small single kiss and then she went for another one and I stopped her.

Today I find out that she's very angry at me through her friends and she feels that I didn't listen to her at all when I asked for the kiss and she feels that I wasn't giving her 100% of my focus and attention during our arrangement... I now realize that my final kiss gesture was the completely wrong move to make and I need to apologise for that but surely I can't be blamed for not giving her attention when she was the one that insisted on the intimacy and a friends with benefits situation? How should go about making things right in this situation.

TL:DR Complete virgin and girl crushing on me was trying to teach me things. Went for a final kiss after she said that she didn't want to continue our arrangement as a way of saying thanks but she saw it as me not listening to her and not considering her.",23Aug2019,2

So my (20f) sister (22f) has down syndrome. We are currently living together as my parents have moved out of town. She has absolutely no understanding of the repercussions that our actions as humans have on the environment, and considering the current dire state of the earth right now I'm pretty damn worried. 
Its things like the plastic single use shite that she frequently purchases (which inevitably will end up in landfill in less than a year), or I'll come home and every single goddamn light in the house will have been left on (im sure you can imagine this boosts our electricity bill aswell). Thats not all of it but just some examples. Ive tried to explain to her why she shouldnt do this and how it impacts the earth but she honestly doesnt get it.

374,"Okay so, I have an infatuation situation that is absolutely ridiculous. I am currently in a committed relationship that is well into its third year. There is nothing about the relationship that makes me unhappy. The guy I'm with is the absolute love of my life. I never thought I would be so lucky to find someone who is literally everything I could ever want in a partner. That's not to say we haven't had our issues, but we always just talk about things and work together to resolve whatever the problem is. It's not perfect, cause nothing is, but it comes pretty damn close. 

So I am having massive trouble understanding why I am in my current situation. I have been dancing ballroom for about four years, but I have never been able to find a dance partner, so I have just been dancing alone and sitting exams. However, about three weeks ago, a male dancer came to my town for university and approached my dance teacher for lessons. So of course my teacher got super excited and paired him up with me with the hope we would eventually compete together. And I was super excited too. And he is super lovely and an amazing dancer, we dance so well together, and my dancing has already improved so much. But after our first practice I became completely infatuated with him and I can't get him out of my head and I feel so absolutely guilty. 

In the whole two and a half years with my boyfriend I have not even really experienced any kind of feelings for any other guy, so this is feeling very awful and strange. I know it's normal to find other people attractive when you're in a relationship. But I just still feel so terribly guilty. And being pressed up against this super attractive dancer for two hours every week is making the situation so much worse. 

And I just really don't even understand why it's happening. Because although this dancer is super lovely, and we have become friends, he is not the sort of person I could ever see myself being with. So I'm like, why am I doing this to myself?

I thought maybe it's because I'm admiring qualities in him that I wish I had? Like the fact he is such a great dancer and also super charismatic and confident. And those are qualities I wish I had, so maybe I'm just super idolising him or something?

It's just so hard, and I feel so guilty every time I go to practice and enjoy it, and also I keep thinking about this dancer even when I am with my boyfriend and I just feel terrible. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences, thoughts or advice?

Much appreciated!",23Aug2019,1
375,"So my boyfriend &amp; I have been talking about moving in together for a few weeks now. I live in a 2-bedroom house alone and have done since I split up with my ex last year. For context, I moved out of my family home when I was 18, I'm now almost 27 so I haven't lived as part of a family household for the best part of 10 years. 

He spends basically every night at mine anyway so naturally we were looking to move him into my place. However last night we were talking about saving together for some joint purchases/future stuff and he mentioned possibly moving in with his family to be able to save ""hardcore"". He's the same age as me but had to move back in with his parents after a breakup.

I pay over £1000 per month in rent/bills and even though I would obviously pay rent etc to his parents it would be nowhere near this much and I could save a decent amount of money. I would have to rent out a storage unit for some of my furniture but this would be around £120 per month. I'd also have to drive further to get to work but still nowhere near the £1000+ I could be saving.

Only downside is that my boyfriend is one of seven kids. So I wouldn't only be living with my boyfriend and his parents, but 4 other kids under the age of 12 (the older two have moved out). The house is big enough that they all have separate rooms but I don't really know if I want to sacrifice my own personal space for the sake of saving money? It's all shared bathrooms, living areas, kitchen etc.

So long story short I was basically wondering if anyone had been in a similar situation before? Whether it's worth being potentially uncomfortable/restricted for a few months in order to save a decent amount of money? Any success/failure stories? Any advice really appreciated, we're currently weighing up our options so all comments welcome :)",23Aug2019,2
376,"My younger brother (19) and I (26) both live with our parents. I work, help out extensively around the house, spend time with my parents and show them respect. 

My younger brother does almost nothing to help anyone, including himself. He usually doesn't even clean up after himself. When you do somehow recruit his help with something, he often deliberately does a poor job to discourage you from asking for help again.

My parents have accepted this status quo and never call him out on his behavior. He is by no means a mean spirited person; he is just extremely lazy and only focuses on his own stuff. I want to help him and see him succeed, but he does not respond to any types of motivations I've attempted.

I feel like I'm going to completely lose it. I battle clinical depression, which is why I moved back in with my folks. This situation feels so bleak and it is really pushing me to the edge.

381,"4 years ago I started my career in the film industry, (age 14) started a business, partnered up with successful people, and was on the way to open a production company at age 18.

2 weeks ago I recruited to the military to serve in a very intensive combat role in the military (mandatory military service), 
and now I’m facing the dilemma of sacrificing my role in the military for a more relaxed one in order to have more time for my career or going through 3 years of combat service in order to build my mentality for the future.


I have very big goals to accomplish, main target is getting to Hollywood. 

I want to stay in combat service because I feel like if I can prove myself that I can go through difficult training my mindset will improve and I will also be able to face the difficulties of having a career in the film industry.

On the other hand, every single day I think of giving up mainly because it’s difficult and I have 0 time for reading books, or learning anything at all.

Would you go through this “mentality test” and sacrifice 3 years of career progress or will you give up in order to have more time for your career but serve a boring role? That’s the dilemma I’m facing.

383,"I'm currently employed at an certain type of shop. I enjoy my work and recently had an exceptional review. 

However I feel that the management is defunct.  The shop manager is unorganized, contradicting, accusatory, belittling, argumentative, passive aggressive, gossips, complains of others and semi useless. I could go on and on, but those are the major points of contention. I'm fairly certain he steals cash jobs, customers, and products.  We also never see any of our tips. Instead he buys donuts bi weekly with our tips. (To which I have suggested he pull the recipient of the tip aside and discreetly give it to them lest offending other who may not receive tips) 

He portrays himself as this loving nice guy, someone who wants good morale and someone with all these years of experience, but I'm clearly catching on and wonder if he is one of those "" fake it til ya make it types"" except the guy still hasn't made it. 

I've addressed this with upper management and the very next day all the employees were pulled to discuss their feelings and experiences. I was a little uneasy with this process as the shop manager saw me at the office of upper management the day prior and was fishing for info as to why I was there. Of course I made up another legitimate excuse , but after the nexts day's individual meetings he could clearly put two and two together. Now he is acting bitter and passive aggressive towards me. 

In the middle of all this I applied on a whim to another position of the same type in the next town over. They called me and want an interview later today.  There was no salary in the ad. I plan on discussing this in person at the interview. 

Before I get to the advice part, I should add that I also feel that I am worth more than I earn. With or without the current shop issues.  My review reflects my work ethic and the quality of my work. Also if I land a job in the next town over I will need to earn more money to make up for the fuel expense to break even with what I am accustom to earning. ( I don't plan on mentioning that part to the potential new employer obv) 

The advice part : if this prospective employer asks me why I'm currently looking for another shop to work in, what do I say? I don't think it's professional to bash my current employer. But do I confess that I am uneasy there ? Do I confess that I think I'm worth more? Do I just tell him I am exploring my options? 

I should also add that once upper management talked with all the employees he called on our shop manager and had an hour long meeting. We all thought he was fired, but he came back all pissy and still has a job. I can only imagine how much I'll be ""punished"" now.",23Aug2019,2

hey, firstly, I'd like to apologize for my bad English (I'm Romanian) and don't make difference between preterit and past-perfect :x

I know I've made mistakes but please don't judge me.

I started to talk to an internet guy in march 2018. We met on Twitter. He's five years older than me, he's an adult and I am a teen. This guy is from Asia and I'm from Romania (i won't tell his country/city, I don't want him to see this post..and if you're wondering we use English to communicate). I was making depression and had no one else to talk to, so I kept chatting with him and we became friends (big first mistake). We were using Whatsapp, I gave him my phone number (how stupid). In the beginning, it was nothing ""important"", we were talking once a week to vent our feelings. 

During the summer of 2018, we've started talking a lot and he became very curious about me, he was always asking ""how are you? how about your friends/family? did u sleep well ?"", I was feeling very uncomfortable about him and tell him that he was scary. Then he apologized and sent me his ID card (with his whole name and city) to prove his identity and to show me that he wasn't a pedo or a psycho. Then i ""forgave"" him and we kept talking. 

With hindsight, I think he had a big crush on me.

When I restarted school in September 2018, I made another big mistake (I'm a silly I know), I gave him my address e-mail bc he wanted to save the WhatsApp conversation with our both acc. I gave him my main email address (with my family name) instead of my second one. I know he remembers the name. We kept talking but he was starting to get very annoying, we were chatting every day on WhatsApp but our conversations were very long and uninteresting. One day, he asked me to send a picture of me (bc we have never seen each other before) and I accepted. Then he started to ask for pictures very often and I refused, he took it well and said: ""I understood"". 

&amp;#x200B;

 

 

During this school year, we have not talked a lot because I was very busy and I tried to make distances with this guy, I was finding this friendship unhealthy because it was a ""one-sized"" friendship, we were only talking about HIS feelings, HIS life, and HIS problems.

That's where I started to want to stop this friendship. I made bigger distances, we were chatting six-seven times a month (i know it still a lot but we were used talking every day...). He didn't take it well, I mean he thought it was because of a boy and became very sad/jealous. He was always apologizing for his bad behavior but he has never changed (is he manipulative ?). 

This summer 2019, things went harder. My mental health got worse, I started to feel really deep anxiety (probably due to my loneliness) about everything, that's how I realized that I've put myself in a very bad situation with him. I started to panic when I googled my name (that he knew), it didn't show anything about me except 2 pages (they don't exist anymore but they still listed on google..so you can see the ""title""). On the ""title"" of one of them, my city and my mom family name's was written. It was about a diploma that I got. I also made some researches with my mom's family name and you can easily find my mother's job and the place she's working in (which is not in my city), it's a big place but I feel so bad about this. 

Then I made a request to delete those two problematics pages and it worked but it's maybe too late.. he may have seen them.

I haven't stopped talking with him because I'm scared of retaliation (even if he had never threatened or blackmailed me). I've blocked him on Whatsapp and said that one of my parents discovered his messages and forbade me to talk to a stranger. He was sad but understood, we keep talking on Twitter the social media we met on (but I take time to reply bc he thinks that I do it in my mom's back). I made a bunch of lies to cover up the informations he has about me (i told that I was moving out in another country (Moldavia) and stuff). I think he believed me but I can't be sure. 

He seems to be a very lonely boy who only needs someone to talk to, I don't think he realizes that our friendship is unhealthy. On one hand, I don't think he's able to come to harm me or something (bc he can't afford a fly and he really appreciates me and respect most of my decisions), but on the other hand, he's very attached to me (he's used to telling me his entire life) and I don't know how he could react if we stop talking. 

I know a lot about him tho but I don't know how much he knows about me (which makes me very anxious), I've made several nightmares about this and still have a deep feeling of insecurity (even when I'm at home). I've sometimes been contemplating suicide to kill this fear. I can't talk to my parents. I think I worry too much but I need advice (What else should I do ?) and I have no one else to talk to.

392,"So where I work my boss has her grandaughter as an employee. She usually just would go when she wanted and never let us know or anything and had to stay more time I'm the office. I used to go in the morning but now they put me in the afternoon because she had a baby. I was told that I was going to go back to my normal schedule on Monday actually but they put me on the afternoon. My other coworker had already taken her vacation and it was like my 3rd week of work so I was freaking out. Today my coworker that had taken the vacations is not going because she needs to wake up really early for her daughter at school and needs to rest because she will be driving to Mexico to go see her husband play on Saturday. TBH that is not my business and I could have easily said no I can't go all day. So today I have to go from 8:30 from 5. I was really looking forward to just 1 to 5. And now supposedly the grandaughter might not come back so I'm stuck with the afternoon shift. Because of school I will only be going 12 hours for $87. Also my coworker that is going to miss today is leaving more Early. It's been 2 months and I haven't been fully trained. She said she learned everything by herself which makes it more easy for me to learn, but up until now I have pretty much learned everything because I ask questions and when I would ask my boss for help, she would tell me to ask my coworker. Should I quit my job. It's just now they put me in the afternoon so they can have someone secure at that hour because one day I went my regular hours in the morning and I was the only one that could stay in the afternoon and I couldn't because I had something from school and since that day my boss supposedly gave me the afternoon schedule but she tries to work in other people's problems which I hate. Should I quit? If I do they are going to struggle and I would rather do it now that school is around the corner and say that it is too much.

But I feel that things are moving really fast. We're already having discussions about what our future is going to look like, and how we need to achieve our goals, potentially to have a future together. While I admit I fell for him pretty hard initially, I'm finding myself taking a step back and reflecting that maybe I made the wrong move. I have just recently graduated from university and looking for a job which isn't easy, and he dropped out after the first year and has been working in retail for 4 years. While I do not judge him whatsoever for doing that, he doesn't really know what he wants to do in life and although he is looking at different things which is a step in the right direction, I feel that we would both do better by slowing things down and focusing on ourselves. Yet, it doesn't seem that this is what he wants. I feel trapped - I don't want to lose him, yet I want to focus on myself right now. 

So my question is, if I'm having doubts, how do I express this? I don't want to hurt his feelings, rather I feel like the timing is off here and that we'd do better slowing things down and supporting each other as friends while we advance our careers.

They bought the exact same product as me for the exact same price, and yet received something I didn't. If I went into the store and asked for a charger because of this, would I be an entitled asshole, or do you think this is reasonable?

I call her anyways, bc they wouldn't even let me wait in the caf, she took my badge and told me to wait in the foyer. I was embarrassed enough and didn't want wait long bc there was people just staring at me wondering what happened(my trainer couldn't even look at me, just walked by like 6 times, like I didn't exist).

I call my brother back and he has my mom on another phone in background and I can hear her laughing about my situation (she didn't know I could hear her) she says she'll come get me. Calls me back because she can't follow directions and starts yelling at me over the phone. Then when I finally explain where I am, she finds me. I get in the car and the first thing she does is start yelling at me about not being home often (because we're moving next week), how the house is never clean Etc. (I don't understand how a house can be clean if you're going through everything and trying to pack up. I do my chores and pack my own shit yet still get yelled at. I asked for boxes and she didn't want to give me any, she said ""find your own"". That's great, pack with no boxes.) Anyway, she proceeds to call me selfish and other names. We get home and I stayed in the car for about 3hrs just crying.

Now my bf is no better, he finally finishes work acts a little concerned then proceeded to act like a damn fool. He acts why I've been crying? And I'm like are you serious. What else would I be crying about. I even told him that and how I was feeling and I still yet don't have a reply from him. The only person who cared really was my best friend, but she lives 3 hrs away from me and that only helped a little. Nothing from the ppl I'm surrounded by constantly.

Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here?

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it.

404,"Sorry if this sounds dumb, OCD always is...

I've struggled with OCD for most of my life, with my obsessions almost always involving my mind trying to convince me that I cannot read/watch/play or even create the things I love. I've had them under control through medication for a few years, but recently they've been happening again pretty regularly.

At the moment, I've spent the past three days freaking out over the same thing; I remembered an incident from when I was a young teen in Middle School, a time in which I was really into shit like Call of Duty, which I was admittedly probably too young for. There was a time in which I was at a campsite and there was apparently a criminal loose at the site. I was told to hide in my tent while the adults talked to the police, but I remember grabbing a knife and taking it to the tent with me. I was terrified, sure, but I also recall having a fantasy of me being the one to take down the guy, killing him with the knife if he found me, and being regarded as a 'hero' in school the next day if I did. I also had a legitimate desire to join the military at this point, fully believing that we were 'good' and that 'evil' people deserved death.

As an adult, I believe that it's never okay to take a life, though in self defense it's forgivable, if that makes any sense. Anyway, right now my OCD brain is desperately trying to convince me that I can't consume or create media that depicts hero's killing the villains, especially stuff that is marketed towards teens, as, according to mind, that would mean that some other teenager will do the same things I did, or that it will give them the idea that there are people who deserve death, or that it's okay to desire to end the lives of evil people, etc. Please help convince me that this is BS, I've been unable to write, draw, or even watch movies for the past few days because i've been freaking out over this. I'm going to be starting therapy soon, but I can't take this for much longer and really need some advice in the meantime.",23Aug2019,1
405,"So there's this girl that I have been classmates for two years now (idk if our education system is the same as other countries but I'll try to explain. Our system is that every  school year the school will divide our batch into sections and that sections will consist of usually 36 to 40 students,atleast in our school, and those students will be your classmates for the whole school year in one classroom every subject it is the teacher who changes classrooms not the students, so every classroom creates a bond, a community of their own, so a classroom of student can  be close to each other because community yeah).

I'm in highschool btw grade 11 now

So this girl, it was last year that we became classmates, we were just acquaintances, didn't think of her very much because well i had a girlfriend and she's great, she's kind, sweet, she's a great girl but then we hit a rough part in our relationship midsemester we were always fighting , letting our fights just go like that without a word or sorry from each other, then we'll be ""ok"", I was getting tired, i wanted to break up with her, but i couldn't , I wanted to fight for our relationship and so I did we got kind of better we made it to 1 year and then grade 10 ended it was summer vacation, we didn't go out that much for we did not have any money and my parents are kinda strict (well asian parents are strict you know)  so we just chatted every day i think it was just 2 time we went out on summer. Grade 11 started we were looking at our sections list and to my surprise that girl I was talking about earlier was my classmate again. My girlfriend got jealous not because of that girl ( ithink it's getting confusing so i'll just use a name like ""girl A"") it was because my ex was my classmate also. Soo weeks passed and my girlfriend was often jealous, not the serious jealous but a joking jealous know what I mean but sometimes she's seriously jealous because my ex and I were kinda becoming friend like that but we're both taken. Then here's were I am now confused. It was because girl A and I were getting close to, were becoming friends (my GF got jealous of her also last year long story tl;dr sumthin about cheerleading in pe and girl A wa involved (cheerleading is not really common here in our country and we were both raised in  a conservative household).
So then one day i tweeted and then girl A replied to that tweet so i replied and then a little while i also replied to one of girl A's tweet my GF  saw that she got jealous (kinda childish??) And she's also jealous the fact that we're becomig close. 
But then idk what why when I started to grow tired of us idk maybe because of our frequent fights again that are left just the way it is, I'm growing tired i wanted to be frequently alone, getting annoyed by her , I'm getting tired but then, I noticed that girl A is getting prettier for me, I know it was weird because all this time I never saw her as beautiful, everyday she's becoming beautiful to my eyes and also everyday I'm  growing tired of us. Idk what to do im just a confused teenager i don't what to hurt my gf because I know if I hurt her she'll turn to her ""deppressed"" self again with cuts on her wrist.

408,"So I'm in a WhatsApp family group and it's a constant stream of:

Misleading/outdated/false information supporting their point of view

Arguments like: ""The critics are hypocrites because [insert accusations], therefore their criticism is to be dismissed""

Olympic medalist mental gymnastics to justify the unjustifiable

Most of that comes from a few members but it is constant and it seems they influence the younger into becoming more radical.

The few that attempt a debate either do it using similar tactics mentioned earlier or cause a greater disagreement.

It'd take me hours of my day to politely point out inconsistencies or source them to accurate information, not to mention it'd just drive them further into a more radical point of view.

I'd rather they learn to be less trusting of information they see online, learn to fact check, spot false information. Also important is to be more aware of how emotional attachments influence their PoV and allow it to have less of an influence.

I'm in a good standing with my family, I almost never post on the group and have never started arguments in the group or contradicted them.

I'm not about to start to.

TL;DR important part

What I'd rather do is lead them to entertaining information that can plant the seed of a more questioning spirit. It's information that cannot confront conservative values, that's fun, that's accessible and useful.

I believe it has to be stealthy, because the moment it is identified as an indirect attempt to confront the kind of arguments they share, anything I post will be perceived as wrong/dishonest/etc.

I don't mind their political standings or disagreements with me, I worry about the inability to admit any fault in the actions of the group they perceive to belong to. So the stuff I'm looking for cannot be activism to turn someone left or right.

I'm not some enlightened being and I'd say through stupid internet arguments and luckily stumbling through great thinkers I learned to be more accepting of when I'm wrong and comparatively be more accepting to facts, though there's still work to be done.

I believe perhaps they haven't had the same opportunities as I had in this regard, and maybe I can in a way give back what was afforded to me by them.",23Aug2019,2

431,"Hello Reddit, i'm looking for some advice I was hoping I would never need to ask for.

Earlier today my girlfriend of several years told me that she is pregnant. First I should state that I have never wanted to have children, in fact the idea of having kids is my worst nightmare. Secondly before someone else says ""should have used protection"" yes I do not wear contraception but she uses the pill (at least I thought she did). 

Anyway, she is well aware of the fact that I never want to have children and i'm perfectly content with just having pets instead (furry children). She on the other hand has always liked the idea of having kids of her own but due to some health issues she has not been physically well enough to seriously consider it for a couple of years now. So because of this I have told her that once those health issues subside we would have a discussion about our future. The last thing I would want to do is stand in the way of her dreams of having kids, so I have always said that I would graciously step aside and allow her to find someone who wants to have children so that she can be happy. In a previous relationship she suffered a miscarriage about 10 weeks into the pregnancy, this is one of the reasons why she is so keen to have a child now to make up for it.

We haven't spoken properly about this face to face yet but when we do she will ask me what I think. When she does ask me, how do I tell her that I think she should get an abortion? I believe that due to her previous issues and her desire to have kids that she will not consider this. If I say what I feel but she decides to go ahead with the pregnancy then I cant blame her but I'm forever going to be a terrible person for suggesting abortion. 

This is a shit situation but I know it's 50% my fault and 50% hers. I just don't know how to tell her that I think she should consider abortion.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

We'll call them Zoe and June for simplicity sake. Now, for context. I've known both of them for about five years now, and Zoe is my girlfriend. Zoe and I have been going on for about a year now and it's been a happy relationship. June has been my friend for all of these five years, and I did have feelings for her some time ago but wasn't sure if I should act on it in fear that I may mess up and ruin the friendship we had despite the fact that those feelings were returned in some ways. As of recent, these feelings have started to resurface despite the fact that I'm still in love with Zoe. I've had some people give me advice that I should go after the second person I fall for because if I truly loved the first I never would've fallen for the second, but the problem is that both of them are really great friends, that have known each other far longer than I have. I feel as if following the previously received advice would all end in nothing because I know that she'd never do it due to their friendship. As previously mentioned I'm still in love with Zoe and I don't want to ruin what I have with her either. I'm caught in the middle of this and I'm just not sure what I should do so I figured this would be a nice place to start. If you have any questions feel free to ask.",23Aug2019,2

School just started up again and we have a few classes together and she rides my bus. It seems like being around each other so long throughout the school day has really amplified our friendship, and I started to realize I have feelings for her a few days ago. I am a bit scared to ask her out though, because we are both part of a super close friend group and I’d hate to hurt that group in anyway. I wonder if being together would hurt the friend group as a whole just because it would be a big change for all of us. Also I know I shouldn’t be concerned about this, but my ex girlfriend and I broke up two months ago, and I’d hate for her or anybody to think this girl I now have feelings for is just a rebound from my last relationship.

My friend, I haven’t known them for a very long time, but I consider us to be rather close.
They’re an attention seeker, and they’re fully aware of that, hack, they even say “hey give me attention” when people are having conversations. Anyways, now they’re faking that they’re trans, for the positive feedback and support I suppose. Now, I know what you’re probably thinking:
‘OP you don’t know Jack shit about them! You don’t know if they’re trans or not?!’
And to that, I can simply say, yes I do.
As a trans person myself, I know what makes a person trans. This person, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER complains about gender dysphoria, and a soft person like them would DEFINITELY complain about it. they’re NEVER EVER afraid that people are going to misgender them, and tons of other stuff.
This person, is NOT trans.
This is going too far, I’m not going to go into detail, but HOLY SHIT this has gone too far.
I know this person on a Semi-personal level, so please don’t tell me that I’m overreacting, I know what I’m doing, and I know what they’re doing.

449,"I have a problem I need opinions on, and need to be quick because she uses reddit, frequents the same subs and I’m 90% sure she knows my user name. 

I have a friend who I’ve known for a little over a year now, renting a room for 350$ a month. 

In my area, that is honestly unheard of. You cannot find a room to rent cheaper than $500-600. I will give a breakdown of the entire household expenses. 

Rent-1780 (80 of this is water, which I either get a balance forward or owed to me at the end of each year) 
Gas- 100 (still paying off the balance of 300- this is a long story, but basically the tank rental wasn’t included for 2 years, so they sent me a bill for 1400 which I’ve slowly been paying off-she was not here during that time so I don’t expect help paying for it)
Hydro- 50-90 depending on season
Internet- 65

Everything is shared accommodations. She has her own full bathroom and bedroom. She is not the cleanest person in the world, so I end up emptying her garbages and cleaning it when it’s gone for too long. I know I don’t have to, but I have moderate diagnosed ocd and it bothers me greatly. 

She is using the furniture we provided in the bedroom, which is fully furnished. There’s no tv in there, but I lent her my laptop so she can watch Netflix-which we also provide. 

She uses our laundry, including laundry soap. I’ve asked before to adhere to laundry times being after 7pm or on weekends to lower cost. This has not been followed. 

Shared kitchen accommodations-including using all our cookware and eatery. She also doesn’t buy her own food, will have no problem eating whatever I make, or eat our leftovers after we’ve gone to bed, and bring to work. Makes herself coffee and toast every morning, or if I’m making food, help herself to it. She will SOMETIMES offer to pick up items that are low-such as milk, coffee cream, usually stuff that would effect her if there wasn’t any left. She will buy food while she’s at work for herself. 

My husband and I will eat out maybe once a week, sometimes not at all for weeks on end, but when we do we always buy her a portion. Lately I have been wording it differently and asking “would you like to get yourself something, husband is going to pick up Chinese” and she will 9/10 say no thanks. If she agrees, she will send money via e-transfer for the exact amount of her meal. 

My husband vapes (we all quit smoking) and smokes a bit of weed at night to sleep. She uses both his vape juice and weed for her own use. 

Now here’s where things become... difficult, because I feel that there is an exchange of fairness. She will sometimes watch my son. I am not a fan of leaving him with anyone other than family, so this truly isn’t often. I don’t take advantage of her watching him, and leave whenever I feel like it. It was mainly when I was working weekends (away from home) which I stopped a couple weeks ago because I’m currently 38 weeks pregnant. If my husband also worked the days I worked, I would rather pay family to watch him than ask her. 

I am still working Monday-Friday 10 hour days, in my home daycare for 2 other children and one other child part time. So in total some days there’s 4 children here, including my son. It’s a lot. Sometimes my sister also likes to randomly drop off my nieces which puts me over capacity and poses a legal issue. In my Province you’re allowed no more than 5 children per building (regardless of how many adults are there to watch). 

She helps out with diaper changes and cleaning up toys. Sometimes she will help with meal times, but very very rarely. I don’t pay her for this. 

She has purchased some things for my son, and new baby without me asking or even wanting it. Sometimes she will do household chores such as dishes and taking out the garbage. She has cut the grass. Vacuum a handful of times. Honestly it’s more than my husband does, so I am grateful. 

That’s honestly the extent of the household help I get. I’m not expecting the baseboards to be washed, but even things like dusting, windows, and bathrooms. Nothing. No refilling the toilet paper. The water jug is an issue, as we have highly chlorinated water, so we buy water. She has zero problem filling her water bottle 19 times a day, using it to the last drop. I stopped purchasing it and low and behold, drinking tap water seems to be above her. She will purchase her own bottled water. 

She works a minimum wage job, and hours are varied. She is also on ow, and gets gst and hst checks, although I’m not sure how often, because I don’t get any so I don’t know when those come out. 

She has zero debt, as in school loans or credit cards, but has bad credit because “her mother stole her identity” and ruined her credit. Which brings up my next issue, she has an iPhone 8 Plus under my name, which has a remaining balance of over 600$. She is almost always late paying her portion of the bill, and I’m left paying the penalty fee of around 5$ on next months bill. 

She is currently working towards her drivers license (which poses another problem) sometimes we drive her in/pick up from her work. It’s not very often we do this. She chooses to Uber which she says costs 14$ each way. There is a bus stop nearby, but requires a walking distance of about 15 minutes first, and she would also have to arrange her time better to be able to make it to the bus on time. It also doesn’t run past 9pm and sometimes her shifts end at 9:15pm. 

I have offered to teach her how to drive, although we never have done so. She is paying one of those g2 drive test places to take her around a couple times before her test comes up in September. 

I am under the impression that she thinks I will put her on my insurance, or let her use my car. I can’t put her on my insurance because I already have my sister under me, who needed help. 

So her insurance as a new driver would be relatively high, questioning her ability to pay it. 

She recently went and got a money Mart loan because she was broke until her next pay. She makes it very obvious that it’s because she spends too much on Uber’s, and somehow tries to make me feel guilty. 

She lived with us from sep-dec and decided to up and leave and go live with her former roommate from Jan-March (or April I can’t remember) but decided to come back, because former roommate requested $900 in rent. She has a very weird relationship with that former roommate that borders on obsessive. She feels she basically raised former roommates 2 kids, and has an attachment there. Not that it’s important, but my roommate is a lesbian, and I feel that her former roommate has possibly crossed some boundaries with her, making her believe a relationship is possible... when it’s not. I on the other hand have established firm boundaries and it has never been a question of possibility to form a romantic relationship. 

She has since been in contact with former roommate again, and I feel she is just biding her time here, in order to get her shit together just enough to feel more independent to leave. Which is fine, she is entitled to do that. I just feel completely taken advantage of at this point. Her relationship with her family is somewhat low contact, but I feel her presence is needed with them, since they all seem to struggle financially as well. 

She has said she wants to help me out with the baby, yet complains about being exhausted after a 6 hour shift, requires 4 or more caffeinated drinks a day just to function. Pops Advil daily. Takes melatonin to sleep. Plus weed. Everyday she has a headache. Everyday her body is in pain. She sleeps on a bed we’ve provided and complains about it. One day I lost it and said you’re more than welcome to go back to “former roommates house and sleep on the couch”. 

I’m not entirely sure how she expects me to believe that she’s here to help, when she has planned all of her driving school and appointments, around the time of the baby’s birth. And then complains about how busy and broke she is. I’m sorry, but I don’t care. And I’ll certainly care less once the baby is here. 

I’m afraid once the baby gets here I will have exactly zero fucks and patience to give, and end up fighting with her. I don’t know what to do. Sorry this ended up being a lot longer and more of a rant, rather than a direct question.",23Aug2019,0
450,"I'm 32; a qualified teacher but got ill a few years back ( poisoning from a prescription med) and can't see myself ever getting back into teaching. The only positions that pay well enough are highly stressful with no room for your own life really.  My life literally changed overnight 2.5 years ago because of the effects of this prescription medicine and I've been effectively living in a room and experiencing what I can only describe as a disabled life for 2.5 years. 

The one thing that is keeping me sane during this situation is the thought that I have an opportunity to rebuild my life from the ground up; by figuring out what I really want and taking steps towards getting there. It's just the deciding on the direction that I'm having some struggles with at the moment...

**Health and my current situation**

Although apparently I will eventually make a full recovery, no one knows when, and nothing can be done to help in the meantime, except some painkillers.  Some studies do say a tiny % of people do have life-long issues with what I've been through too. I've not really had any support from anyone and have been taking care of myself, which to be honest has been excruciating both physically and mentally at times. Because of this I'm very much craving financial security going forwards. Not necessarily high wages, but just, security. I'm a high achiever and hard working but ending up in this position, despite doing all the ""right"" things in life, brought home to me how you can work hard but not necessarily end up with what you might deserve, and that maybe I need to work smarter rather than harder.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hopes and lifestyle aims**

My aim going forward is to have a secure income and career whereby I know I'll always be able to take care of myself, and never reliant on anyone else, whilst also having enough energy and time left over to enjoy life.  I think my concern though is wanting to achieve highly but not wanting to jeopardize my health as I don't know I will have to be extra careful health-wise from now on. Ideally I'd love to work in an environment that has integrity with the work it does, but also with each other - where your colleagues share your vision and value and there's a comradery in that. I've worked many jobs where I'm there for 2 hours, clock in and out and that's it - there's no sense of belonging or feeling part of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

**Job/career aims**

***Likes:***

* Working in small teams, feeling a sense of worth within that team setting
* Working on big picture problems (i.e social justice / environmental / humanitarian issues) 
* Autonomy - i.e being able to set your own schedule/agenda 
* Helping others in some way (directly/indirectly)
* Creativity
* Feeling like what I do matters / a sense of pride 
* Having some kind of status
* Ideal 'office' environment - smallish, creative, own space/office to work in OR academic / big respected institution

&amp;#x200B;

***Dislikes:***

* Big company/ big team set ups where you're just a tiny cog in a machine
* Handling data as the predominant task
* Dead end job with no career progression
* Working hard for little reward (i.e teaching)
* Feeling insignificant

**Personality, skills, attributes**

* creative
* empathetic
* driven
* problem-solver
* will work harder than anyone else if believing in the work
* very strong sense of justice
* self-motivated
* high standard communication skills and ability to relate to people

&amp;#x200B;

**Ideas so far**

The predominant ideas I've had so far are documentary film-making and psychology, which probably sound very different but the underlying values are the same  - being part of a big picture 'thing' / helping others / contributing to humanity / exploring new ideas.

***Film-making*** would be amazing (I'm currently working on my own doc and loving the process so far) but the biggest downside is the lack of financial security. It feels like the equivalent of riding out into the wild west and crossing your fingers you'll find food along the way.

***Psychology*** I feel I would be good at  - as there are many links between the work I did in teaching and I feel I've learnt a lot from the current situation that I'm in that could help others. I like the idea of possibly getting a doctorate and combining teaching with research at the same time.  The downside is it's a huge commitment to training. I'm worried I'll work as hard as I did for my teaching qualification, only to find that the reality of the work isn't what I want anyway.

Other ideas I've had but haven't thought about as deeply are photography, journalism and joining the forces (i.e working as a psychologist for the policy/navy/army).

I also can work part time as an artist/illustrator and musician. These are things I'd like to continue but am happy for them to be side hustles.

**Concluding thoughts**

I feel like I don't necessarily have to decide immediately what I want to do with the rest of my life, but I think if I can find a way to cover all bases without ruining options for myself that could be a way forward? Like working on the film AND studying psychology part time? I just don't know if that'll be too much to handle - if that's foolish.

It's also hard to make a decision when I just don't know what my health will be in 6 months, a year, 6 years :/

But I'd just like to figure out a pretty decent plan whilst I'm in this prison-like situation at the moment.

Would anyone have any thoughts on/experience in these, or maybe other suggestions? Honestly any advice and ideas would be really appreciated right now :)",23Aug2019,1

457," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

I'm not sure if this info is important or not: He's an ex alcoholic who's been abstinent for 5 years. A few months ago, he started having a drink here and there, but maintained he was in control. This seemed to be true - he only had a drink about once or twice a week, didn't drink excessively or anything, and had a good time. He seemed totally fine and promised he'd immediatly stop if things got out of control again.

His behaviour has changed though. I can't find a direct link between the drinking and this - he doesn't get drunk, and his behaviour is weird when he's completely sober too. Though it's worse when he's had a drink. 

He's not really a ""nice"" person anymore. He gets very impatient and ""short"" with me. He treats me like a child sometimes. He ALWAYS changes his mind. I can't make plans with him anymore, because he will absolutely fuck up everything by changing his mind last second. He frequently tells me ""I didn't do/ didn't say x"" but he did, and he refuses to believe me. He often feels accused or like I don't allow him to make his own choices. He is extremely unreliable now. Either he forgets to do something or doesn't feel like doing it anymore but doesn't bother to inform me about it. He doesn't seem to have a concept of how his behaviour affects other people anymore, even though he used to be very empathetic in the past. He's rather ""abrasive"" towards me now. Not a big deal for some people, but I'm sensible as fuck and all the ""teasing"" remarks hurt and he should know better. He also VERY frequently misunderstands me in a really weird way. Like, I ask him a question and he answers a completely different question that I did not ask, and when I point this out he insists I asked something else - but I know what I say! 

Examples:   
Me: ""Hey, did you buy cigarettes?""  
Him: ""No, I didn't see Frank this morning. He hasn't answered his phone either. I think I'll drive by in the afternoon to get a hold of him.""  
Me: ""Good idea, but I asked if you bought cigarettes.""   
Him:"" What? You didn't! You asked if I met Frank!""   
Me: ""... I seriously didn't ask about Frank.""  
Him: ""I know what I heard. That's not what you said.""

Me: ""Can we go home? It's late and I'm really tired.""   
Him: ""Of course. I'm tired too. Let's just grab a coffee at that bar over there, okay? 15 minutes and then we're on the way.""   
Me: ""Sure, coffee sounds good.""   
Him: \*orders a drink at the bar and gets comfy\*   
Me: ""Ummm, didn't we just want to grab a coffee?""   
Him: ""What, coffee? They don't have coffee here. I want a drink. It's still early and I want to enjoy a night out.""   
Me: ""But you said we could go back to the hotel and that you were tired too.""   
Him: ""Nonsense. I'm not tired. But I guess you can go ahead if you're such a sleepy baby. I don't understand you. Your moodswings are not fun.""

I'm not asking if I should break up with him or not - I'm just really worried that there's something wrong with him. I don't know what to make of this.",23Aug2019,1

461,"I’m 17, my mom has always been a “helicopter” parent. I’ve never been on a bus and I don’t know how to cross streets. So my dad walks me to school and picks me up (The school is a 4 minute walk away). ANYWAYS, yesterday two cops pulled up on us and one took out their gun. I was so scared because dad wasn’t a threat so I thought he would get shot for looking suspicious?? my dad was cooperating but I couldn’t stop crying because he’s my best friend. And then the police told me to go to school, i left because I didn’t want to hurt my dad by letting him see me cry. I ran trying to get there as fast as possible with barely any knowledge of the pedestrian signals (spare me) 💀 so I get to school and I’m crying HYSTERICALLY . Not so much because I was scared but because I felt sooo confused. So I’m sitting in the principals office telling him everything and he calls my mom, the LAPD, a counselor, and a therapist .. cause he thought my dad was getting deported even after I told him he was born in the US lmao.  So the school is small asf; 3 classrooms and about 160 students. They saw and heard a lot of it. This is my new school and nobody has even tried to talk to me (not that I need that) but I’m so embarrassed to go to school today because the students saw me crying and the semi scene I caused ..  do first impressions matter ? Lol :/ I’m walking by myself today, I’m so nervous. I am REALLY self conscious. Should I just not go to school today ? Should I be embarrassed? 
my dad might go to jail 🙄 it’s not his first time, he’s been in and out my whole childhood but it’s the first time I’ve seen him get arrested and he’s been out of trouble for more than 4 years, hence why I was confused. btw SORRY for rambling",23Aug2019,2

My interests are pretty uncommon as well, which doesnt help; i like philosophy, art, music. I want deep conversations about the meaning of life, better alternatives on this planet etc.
I want friends i can rely on so we can both help each other as human beings. And grow.

Ive tried socialising, going to a philosophical discussion group, a teenagers group, going out more at the park, swimming pool and such. Ive tried socialising with my colleagues. But it doesn't work. I want to move abroad someday, im saving up for that.
Ive been thinking moving to belgium as i got friends there, but these friends are also my exes friends, so i dont know if that's a good idea.

Im tired of living like that. Reddit, is there any way i can finally live a normal life with a decent social circle that values me, as much as i value them? Should i go to belgium where i already know people? Or is it a bad idea?

I uplifted myself by disconnecting from everyone but family and excelled in many exams. I joined the university and am in my final year. Now from some days I have struggling to stop thinking about certain past issues that are totally irrelevant today yet I can’t stop thinking about them, the people I messed up, the way I deceived those close to me. 
I am beginning to regret a lot of things including buying an expensive laptop/phone some years ago that I am using at present, clearly these are totally irrelevant but I don’t understand why I am thinking about these.
The past experiences have prevented me from making friends and as a result I am not social today. Even if I try spending time with colleagues and classmates, my instincts trigger a guilt feeling and I go away or stop chatting as a result at the end of the day I feel lonely.
I have excellent understanding and communication with my family except one person. That person has sunken to the lowest levels and I agree they have given enormous tension to my family and me and that might have affected me recently,

My only concern is that I have two work events (which I'll be handling myself) back-to-back and would miss the 'prep' day before the first one. Although, realistically, I can prep on the plane. I have the vacation day available, but I had to lie cause I know my boss would've said no to my request.  For context, I've had to work an extra hour of unpaid overtime for two months.

477,"Long story short, I have very controlling parents as an almost 19 year old female. I've tried reasoning with them in the past because currently, a huge topic up for debate in my household is university accommodation. I'm due to start uni in about a month or so and even though I'll be going to uni about an hour and a half away, they're trying to force me to stay at home. I've explained that it would be tiring and I'd feel extremely lonely/depressed because it would be harder to make friends not living in student halls (I know this because my brother lived at home during his time at uni) but their response was only ""Your brother survived not living in student halls"" and ""We need to keep an eye on you."" I've never been a rebellious teenager and I studied for all my exams, got really good grades (I got accepted into a worlds top 20 university but that wasn't good enough to them anyway and got called a 'lazy disappointment') etc etc so their arguments literally hold no validity.

Anyways, one of my favourite bands was doing a show in a town an hour away from me yesterday and I had informed my parents that I wanted to go with 3 of my friends. Not to my surprise, they said no. When I asked them why, they didn't offer me any explanation of any sort. I had everything arranged - a ride home, money for the journey, all the details of where the venue is etc therefore they were simply no for the sake of it. I reminded them that I'm 18, almost 19, therefore a legal adult here which they responded to with ""Not necessarily."" Making absolutely no sense. In the end, I decided to go anyway as I am sick of missing out on opportunities (trust me, there's plenty of things I hadn't attended because they refused) just because they don't want me to leave the house. On my way there, I texted them letting them know who I was with, what time I am getting home and how I'm getting home. Needless to say, the concert was the best experience of my life but of course, they weren't happy with my decision and told me that they need to talk to me later in the evening.

I just wanted some advice on what I could possibly say to them because so far, they're not listening to anything I've said to them. I've never rebelled against them before in my life but they have stated multiple times before that they don't trust me, again without giving me any reason why or how I could prove to them that I'm trustworthy. It truly is driving me insane and although I hate to say it, it makes me dislike my parents.

479,"Any advice would be appreciated

I met this guy on here and honestly need help deciding whether it's better to just never talk to him again because I guess he displayed some red flags at the start of our conversations but I just ignored them because he was someone to talk to and I was feeling very alone. I'll try to keep this as anonymous as I can but he said he was 17 so one year older than I was.Basically I think he has anger issues. After the first week that we started talking, he kept saying he was having these meltdowns. We were having this conversation one day and then he suddenly started going over the things he hated about himself out of nowhere. I was overwhelmed because he had told me previously that he was in a good mood so I was kind of confused. It all started with him saying he wanted to send me a gift which I said no because I didn't want someone to spend money on me because we had only known eachother for a week or so.  He didn't say anything specifically offensive to me when he was angry but just left and sent me pictures of a smashed wall the next day. Its kind of those situations where you have to control your every word because you don't want someone to go and smash something. I just wanted a normal friendship.

I just tried to be as understanding as I could the first time but then it happened again and he was just impacting my mood. He was a good friend the rest of the time and we had talked for about a month every day for nine hours sometimes. We voice chatted on most of these days and he offered that I'd either visit him in a year or he'd visit me.Thats why when his messages started becoming sentences rather than paragraphs after the two week marker everything changed. He didn't text me for 3 days which was completely fine but when he did he was telling me that he threw something again. I just didn't know how to deal with the situation because this had happened too many times. So I sent him a text just saying politely that I had my own problems too and the friendship is becoming one sided. I was just being honest and wanted to solve the problem. In no way was I saying I wouldn't listen to him, I said I would actually. I was feeling very bad for those past few days and I just said the truth to him. Nothing about what I said was offensive. I was just trying to reach a conclusion of understanding each other.

So he didn't answer me after that for about 4 days again so I just deleted him because I thought he was toxic. I've honestly been so depressed after all this because the silence was worse than him cursing at me or something because then I'd have a reason to move on. After three weeks of talking non-stop this was difficult to do as I felt like there wasn't that same person to talk to. So I was stupid and sent him a message again and said I was sorry for being selfish when infact I know I wasn't being selfish so I don't really know why I said that. I mostly wanted a reaction because he hadn't say anything since that day. I guess when I deleted him, I should have just gone on with my life but as I said that was difficult to do that so I just went back to the root of my problem. He finally sent me a message back and said that what I said impacted him and was just being very rude to me. I don't see how what I said could have impacted anyone because I was just trying to make him see what he was doing in a nice way. He doesnt even care about what an impact he had on me.

Thats basically the full story and I was just looking for someone to try and guide me by telling me if the situation would improve if I never talked to him again. Does he seem toxic to you and would you do the same as me?",23Aug2019,1

Two weeks ago his brother came into work to pick up a final check and  I had the pleasure of meeting him and grieving with him for a half hour.  It was a sad experience, but overall I felt that it helped me come to terms with that he is really gone.

His funeral is tonight at 7PM. (Latest funeral in the world I know) I was planning on going, but just feel weird about it for a few reasons. 1.) I don't know any of his family. The only people I know at the funeral would be from work. And to be honest, I'd rather not socialize with my co-workers outside of work. 2.) I get social anxiety in these kinds of situations where everyone is crying/sad. I just don't how to cope with other peoples emotions very well. 

The way I see it, he's already dead. I've already grieved, and I've already spoken to his brother. I feel as though going to a funeral will just be re-hashing something that I've already moved on from....

I dont know what kind of equipment i need. Extra batteries? More memory? some cable to hook it up to my laptop to stream live or whatever?
I also don't know anything about software to use. I do have experience editing videos and stuff but that was using windows movie maker years ago. But I have so much time and an extensive background in computers that I know i'll be able to learn the video editing pretty quickly once I know what direction to head in.

I also make/used to make music on my channel, a couple of my remixes have almost 200k views now which is more than the original soundtrack for the games have.. so I was also thinking of getting back into that maybe. But idk if it should be a separate channel or what.

I dont really any have subscribers. or friends. im really antisocial tbh and dont use any social media so my biggest challenge imo would be drawing in viewers. Any ideas how to do that?

Ideally yes I would like to make money off of this. Thats really the main reason for me to be trying to do it, so i'm not sure where to start.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",23Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

We’re both young last year of high school, and she don’t go out a lot but whenever she do I get a bad gut feeling and I can’t even describe it. It’s so weird I know it’s not jealousy or fear of her cheating i have so much trust and faith in her. It just a weird feeling.

493,"Hi Reddit, this might be a long one. Thanks for reading in advance.

I'm a Chinese-German 17 year old. I'm planning to study Mechanical Engineering at uni in a year's time and my biggest question mark at the moment is my destination. Having grown up abroad and with English basically being my mother tongue, my first choice would be an English speaking country. I currently have the Netherlands in mind due to its close proximity to Germany while being a more financially sound option as an EU citizen.

But here comes the problem. My parents have always leaned towards the idea of me going to Germany to study in uni. And I totally respect their opinion and take it with heavy consideration. However my German has never been fluent growing up. Furthermore given the degree that I want to study, it wouldn't make sense to study elsewhere than Germany. Over summer I've even come to terms with the idea of ending up in Germany. Along with the fact that I would have to take a gap year to tackle German through intensive courses before applying. I even had a few plans in mind for spending the year to its full potential (internships, earning some pocket money, etc). And most importantly, it would be a shame if I held a German passport but couldn't speak the language to a higher level. 

Conveniently, after the first week of school, my parents come up and say that its ok if I don't go to Germany if I don't really want to. Now everything is flipped on its head. The whole language struggle has been bothering me for years and this year it's the final one and the one that will matter depending on my decision.

Do I go to the Netherlands (or another English speaking country), where I would integrate language-wise relatively easily, or do I go to German, hunker down and dedicate a year to learning German and eventually applying to a German uni whilst fulfilling my parents' wishes?",23Aug2019,1

I have tried to stay up all day, but it's been hard, because I have been making plans with friends before I leave, and I dont want to be dead when I hangout with them.

496,"I'm a 21 year old girl, for reference.
Recently I have been trying to become a better person in all ways, and I have made a big improvement but I feel so frustrated and betrayed right now... 

A few weeks ago I got sick and was having dinner with my boyfriend, and his mom called to ask something and decided to give me advice (that mind you I did not ask for). She said, in short words, that I should be less sick (as if I had a choice) that I should smile more regardless of how I feel (I had been sick for two weeks but was just tired) she said I should tan, wear more makeup and dress up more often because if not my boyfriend would start looking at other girls, and some more things, but really all I could say was ""thank you"" and almost hung up on her. I started crying so much because in the last year and a half that I had been with my bf I never had problems with her mom, I never got mad at her, I live alone and my mom lives in Russia, so I even saw his mom as a parental figure because she treated me that way but I could not believe what she just said. My boyfriend said I shouldn't mind what she says because it's not true, hes obviously not going to look for someone else just because I don't wear makeup, and that she was just raised differently, but I can't see her the same way. She basically threw all of my flaws at my face and pointed out I should do something about it, and I never knew she saw me this way until recently. I'm not even ugly or anything, my skin is clear, I love makeup but recently I haven't had time because I am taking care of my house and my job..  but she just had to point this out for whatever reason. I never even had an argument with her, nothing.

Also my bf's best friend once did something stupid while I was in another country, and brought my bf's ex to a party at his house just to make him go through an awkward time. I was so angry at him when I found out because I considered him my friend, and friends don't do that type of stuff specially if they know I'm really sensitive to exes and stuff like that. My bf didn't really pay much attention to her and she left shortly, nothing happened but I told this guy he was an asshole for doing that to me, and that I considered him a friend. Last night he started talking about this and said he was never my friend to begin with...

Seriosly I haven't done anything bad, I have only been nice to everyone and am so devastated to see this is what some people's true colors are. I feel so frustrated, I don't know what to do or how to feel, I just want to cry and of course I can't talk about this to my bf because it's his mom, and I don't want to bring that subject with his friend again... I also don't want to tell my friends because I don't want them to have a bad image about my bf or his family and promised myself I wouldn't talk bad about anyone I considered close to me",23Aug2019,1
497,"I'm a sophomore in college and I met this new freshman a few days ago. We're in marching band together and he's SO sweet and handsome but he seems to have a HUGE crush on me. 

Ex: he asked me to hang out multiple times, asks me deep questions when we're alone, followed me around at a party, laid his head on my shoulder.

He's been super thoughtful and sweet and I wish I could date him but he's REALLY naive and I don't want to take advantage of him. At first he seemed really smooth by asking for my number and asking to hang out but then later he told me the only girlfriend he had he dated for 1 month. Also, he's a devout Catholic so I can't imagine he has much experience on that field. 

This kid has fallen head over heals for me in like a week but he seems vulnerable and I just don't want him to get hurt. I also want him to explore independence his first semester of college and I think I would be doing him a disservice by setting up a relationship.

500,"I should also point out, they know I am a scout, have my own garden where I grow my own vegetables, and am definitely informed as to how climate change is occurring 

So, in the light of the amazon fires, a relatively new friend I made has invited me to participate on a Fridays For Future strike to protest about the inactivity of governments about the huge issue both with the fires and climate change in general.

It was all fine and dandy until, while talking about it through text, they said ""Everyone should only eat vegetables"". I am not entirely a fan of this idea, but I also don't think it's wrong. Here's how I see it: We should be able to eat meat that was obtained humanely. Either by hunting or some means of farming that doesn't include cramping animals together in a factory-like facility and mass killing them for profit.

There is no need to get into the details of how industries harm the planet and such- that's not the advice I need right now.

I do however see the argument of not killing or hurting animals, period. We are humans, omnivores, and can choose not to eat meat. I understand that. I just don't share the ethics of not hurting/killing other animals. No real reason to back it up other than ""It's the circle of life"". Perhaps it's a bit selfish of me.

So, when they mentioned that idea, I simply said ""I'm not sure I completely agree with that.""

A rather long debate ensued where I was essentially trying to defend myself so as to not be seen as the devil incarnate. I explained my views, until at some point they said something along the lines of ""I understand. I don't share your opinion but I understand where you're coming from"". That was promptly followed by a long explanation that people who worry about the fires and eat meat are hypocrites. I didn't argue anymore because it was clear they weren't really able to understand what I was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's fine they have that ideology. It doesn't hurt me, and it doesn't really differ much from mine. We both want the same, we just think the consumption of meat has to be reduced at different levels, and have a fundamental disagreement in whether it's ethical to kill other animals or not.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, I still want to attend the protest, and I want to be able for us to be there and say hello to each other without it being completely awkward if not upsetting. It's not because I want to be friends with them, but we still share activities and I don't think it's right that we should avoid each other at an extreme level there.

I'm a very ""chill"" or ""tilt proof"" person so I know when to stop arguing against someone so as to not make them angrier. But in this case I think they were angry from the start.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also point out, they know I am an active scout, have my own garden at home where I grow my own vegetables and also grow trees, and am definitely informed as to how climate change is occurring and actively work towards reducing my own impact on emissions. It's not like I am not doing my part. They just seem to think what I do is not enough. The fact I am slightly upset about that is completely on me - it's a self esteem issue.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 20, he lives with my dad and has a great relationship with our immediate family. He broke up with his girlfriend and started a new job about 4 months back.  I got a call from my cousin (who is also my brothers close friend) around this time telling me that my brother had started drinking a lot and doing drugs and she wanted someone else to know because she had no idea what to do about it. 

I don’t know what kind of drugs he’s using but I know it’s harder than just weed and that he’s not injecting (at least in his arms because my family would’ve noticed) 
At first i just tried to keep an eye on him but yesterday he was rushed to hospital with blood poisoning (he’s on antibiotics) and he’s constantly borrowing money from family, who aren’t very well off to begin with, because he’s so deep into his overdraft. 

So, I don’t know what to do. 
If I leave it and something happens I’ll never forgive myself but I don’t know how my parents will react and if they’re angry/upset they might just push him away. They aren’t the best at talking when it comes to situations like this. I would talk to him myself but I know that over the phone would be no good, he wouldn’t take me seriously and he’d know it was my cousin who told me and would stop confiding in her.

505,"This is gonna be a long one but here it goes: I have always been and still am very interested in computers and anything technology related, and have wanted a career in computer science/programming/ AI since my senior year of high school. I had applied to many universities in Canada (I’m Canadian) and had received conditional offers for nearly all of them to get into their computer science programs, with the only requirement being to get a 4/7 on my IB Math HL exam (final math exam at my international high school) and for me to pass the international baccalaureate. My exams all went very well, surprisingly well actually, except for, you guessed it: my math exam, which caught me off guard as I had not anticipated the topics that were going to be in it, and should have practiced more for it instead of spreading my study time out between less important classes. Fast forward a few months, and I end up getting a 3/7 in math by a couple points, my offers all get revoked, except for one at Concordia university in Montreal for a degree in Political Science, which was a backup option my parents picked for me. I had also received my acceptance letter a week before school started, and I had been living abroad in Macedonia for nearly my whole life prior to moving here, so I left with just a luggage filled with just a few clothes, my laptop, and that’s it to find a place to stay urgently in Montreal and move in. I ended up having to stay at a really grimy tiny apartment with 4 roommates who were incredibly dirty and inconsiderate (I would shower at the gym because the bathroom was too dirty) and only eat out because the kitchen was a health hazard. I had been so excited when I graduated to go live the dorm life and make friends on campus and study what interested me, but i ended up in a nasty crammed apartment in a city i didn’t know, studying something i was neither good at or interested in,  and without any friends since i had missed the introduction week since i got my acceptance so late. On top of that, I found it very hard to make friends because people would just go to class and leave to go home and there is no campus where students hang out here, only random buildings in the middle of the city. Meanwhile all my friends and classmates who had worked far less than me in high school were getting settled in their dorms, making friends, and living the life I wanted to live because the universities I. Their countries had very easy requirements to get in. I felt incredibly sad, disappointed, and alone and depression settled into my life. I didn’t want to go to class anymore, I was not keeping track of my assignments, and was not motivated to study anything or do anything other than go to work so I could survive, and stay holed in my little room. Fast forward to the end of the year, and I had failed all but one of my classes. I nearly got kicked out of uni, but fortunately they gave me a second chance. I met a girl I fell deeply in love with who helped bring me out of my depressive hole, and I ended up moving in with her, which turned out to be quite great, and I have a far better environment to live in now.  I ended up deciding to take classes that met the admission requirements to be accepted into computer science, which are all math classes. However, that did not mean I did not still have problems with my mental health, and I still felt a disconnect between myself and what I was doing school wise. I couldn’t immerse myself in what I was doing, and struggled to see the bigger picture. However, maths were far more up my alley than essay writing was, and I was at least actually interested in what I was learning, so I ended up getting decent ish grades, although I could have, and regret not having put more effort to ace those classes. At the end of my second year (this year), I applied to transfer into the computer science program at my university for the winter semester (fall was full), and have yet to get an answer. However, my GPA was so bad during my first year, that my GPA now is still far under the requirements to get into the computer science program, and I know that there’s a 99.9% chance I don’t get in. I took the summer to reflect on what I want to do with my life, and considered just dropping out and trying to find a job with opportunities for promotions and build a career that way, but ultimately I decided that I really do want to pursue a career in what interests me: technology. I know i dug myself a deep hole and ultimately it’s because I fucked up multiple times along the way, but I’m ready to dig myself out and get my shit together. The problem I have, though, and the reason why I am asking for advice is that I really have no idea on what steps to take from now. My high school diploma is great except for the one class I need for comp. science, and my university transcript is absolute garbage except for 4-5 math classes with average to decent grades. No program is going to ever accept me with those marks. Maybe I could get accepted to a computer science program in CEGEP (Quebec schools in between HS and uni)? Would they even take me with my current transcripts?

510,"I've known X (female) &amp; Y (male) since high school. We're all now in our 30s. X and Y have been dating for well over 10 years, they started seeing each other just after high school. However, all friends and family have commented on the hostile nature of their relationship. Neither of them are willing to leave, I think they both feel trapped as they have been dating for so long.

During our uni days, Y told me that he had fallen in love with me. I did what I thought was right and went to tell me friend X. She was not surprised. She went to confront him straight away that day, dragging me and another mate with her. She told all of us that she'd had a feeling, and found it very creepy that her partner would go through the bins to collect my used lipstick stained tissues, random drawings and little knick knacks (e.g. hair ties). She had accidentally discovered them in his wardrobe some time ago, sealed in ziplock bags. I was shocked by it all. Y was apologetic but kept insisting he loved us both and we shouldn't be 'ashamed some honest feelings'.

They ended up staying together, and this incident was never spoken of again. For a period of maybe 2 -3 years after that, Y would only talk to me indirectly through someone else when we all hung out in a big group. X and I remained good friends. 

Overtime, the fracture in my relationship with Y healed, or we just got better at pretending there was nothing wrong. In the last 3 or so years, our group had become increasingly close; X,Y, me and my partner. We spent a lot of time together, camping and hiking. X didn't join us a lot of the time, as it didn't really interest her. My partner was aware of the history between myself and Y but it didn't bother him. It came to a point where my partner could no longer commit to so many camps, so I was often left camping alone with Y. 

It would have been fine. Except Y started opening up about his feelings. Telling me that he had never stopped loving me. That even if I decided to never talk to him again, he'd still have these feelings for me. Asking me if there was any chance I could ever love him back. Getting upset when I didn't want to share food from the same bowl with him. Getting upset when I spoke about my partner. He spoke of so many things, it was nauseating. At one point, I was so concerned, I asked if there was any chance he would push me off a cliff on one of our walks because he was scaring me. He said no but I really felt like I was in danger. During these conversations, there was a lot of crying on his behalf. A lot of pain. At one point he curled up in a foetal position and asked me to hug him (of course I didn't!). I told him he needed to get help from a professional. He said he's tried and nothing helps. That he only needs to be loved back.

I didn't know what to do. I confided in another friend, she advised against telling X as it'd only hurt her more and she wouldn't be willing to leave him anyhow. X is well aware that she is in a toxic relationship and she accepts it as it is. 

**In short, it would be really good if X and Y just broke up so I could continuing hanging out with X . I have no wish to speak to Y ever again however, I am concerned that he will hurt himself if he is isolated. I feel so trapped. The best scenario is if I just shut them both out, and give up my friendship with X. If you have a better idea, please let me know as I would really like to keep my friend.**",23Aug2019,2
512,"Right now I'm thinking of dropping and running as fast as I can from a class and switching to a section with another teacher. My roommate says i'm over reacting and to ride it out but I feel like this is already giving me bad vides.

The class is an introduction web programming class but you would never know if you sat in on the classes. The first 3 classes have been the professor rambling on about nothing related to the topic. He instead spends the time being funny and trying to be ""hip"" with the kids. Today he spent the first 15 minutes of class explaining font choices and layouts to us of web pages. Now, that would be fine, except this class is on multiple languages like html and python and he has yet to teach a SINGLE LINE OF CODE TO US.

The worst part though is the layout of the class online. In the next two weeks we have 14(!) things due. One each day. Yesterday we had our first project due that was to make a simple layout in html despite the fact no one knew html because he hasn't taught it.

When people approached him after class today to complain they never knew the project existed (He has not told us due dates on anything and instead dumps the info online and just expects us to check everyday to see when things are due. To add to this. He only has 14 days ahead put into the online program. We don't know anything else that is coming outside of the midterm and final) he told them that it's not his problem and that we should be doing what he puts online. Well, when someone called him out saying he hasn't taught anything that was in the book he god defensive and brushed her off

An hour later he sent an email that not only was riddled with a laughable attempt to be cool and ""connect to the kids"" it also said that it's not his job to ""teach what the book says"" and that we need to do the work on our own and that his lectures are only there to supplement the book and the massive amount of work he is giving us (this is a 3 credit hour class, the 5 credit hour class i'm taking is less work).

I'm thinking of dropping now to be able to switch to a new section that has a spot open but my roommate says im just being a baby. The only real reason I can see to stay in this class is for some of the people who are also taking it but it dosent seem worth it. What do you guys think?",23Aug2019,1

516,"We’re in our early 20’s and this was the first girl I ever loved and had a serious relationship with. The relationship wasn’t the healthiest as we would spend all of our free time together. I was also an asshole to her and criticized her for little things. This wasn’t an all the time thing but I would be moody a lot. I never got anywhere near physical but I still feel awful for how I treated her. I was also a little controlling. She owns a business and has a $10k expense coming up so I would just never want her or us to spend money. We lived an hour away from her fam so I would suggest she go after work (she worked next to them) instead of seeing them on her day off to save gas and miles on the car. 

We had so many good times and memories in between though. Hanging out and sleeping with her was the highlight of my day. 

If I could do it all over, I wouldn’t worry about the future so much and just live more carefree. I’m seeing a therapist now and doing other things to help myself be better. 

We hungout at first after and I was just asking to try again and stuff and she just shut it down saying no every time and that she didn’t think we had a chance in the future. She asked if I got with anyone else and I told her yeah to try to get over it and that I hated it. She got upset and started saying how she was trying not to but maybe she should now. 

I said I needed to block her and try to move on and she texts me a few days later saying she misses me and it’s her turn to be depressed. We hangout she says she still doesn’t want a relationship. We hug and both cry and now she’s saying let’s take a month and she knows there’s a chance in the future. 

So yeah I’m just sad, coming to grips with the fact that it might be over for good but still holding out hope that we have a chance to rectify things. I hope I get another chance and don’t regret this forever

521,"I am from a broken family. Everyone in my family has personal problem. For me is that i feel inferior to everyone, i am worthless, depression, suicidal, anxiety,no confidents, anti sosial,have no friends and i have always felt ignored so i have slowly stop talking all together. I could never stand up for myself. I am pretty much a pushover. These problem have forced me to always put on an act or a persona as a mask whenever i leave my room to hide my problems. My family always argues because we never see eye to eye. My mothers the type to never listen to the side of the story. My sister is the type to argue back while crying and my brother is the type to argue back and when they leave take out their anger on something(most of the time he punches a punching bag). The most recent fight we had made our family in worse shape then ever. I did not have a dad figure growing up so my brother has become pretty much my father since he was 6 so he is actually pretty protective of me(this is for context). My mother is a perfectionist but aspect everything to be done to 50 percent of her standard but her standard are extreme because even compared to a perfectionist she is still over the top. Me and my sibling are usually tired and try do our thing to the best of our abilities but that is still not enough. My mother was in particularly bad mood today due to problems at work causing her to be easily irritated.

I am now here asking for a way to fixed this problem in families. I just want my family to be happy family even if its without me . Nobody is the bad guy sometimes the others start the argument .

523,"(I'm 20) I've had this weird tension around the topic of babies for a couple of months now. I never used to think about children or pregnancy before. And then all of a sudden I started thinking about it and worrying about it a lot. It started out with me really feeling dislike for children and people who decide to have children. I spent some time on  r/childfree. I convinced myself I didn't want children and that it's a waste.


 Somehow the topic of children came up between me and my boyfriend. He said he didn't want children (anymore). I said the same thing, even if I wasn't sure. 


Ever since then the feeling of a strange bitterness has grown. This is unfamiliar to me, I genuinely never thought of myself as someone who wanted children. But now I'm pretending I don't want them when actually I'm scared that I really do?? My boyfriend doesn't and I love him so I'm trying to make myself accept that I won't be a mom. 


The annoying thing is that now everything that has to do with the topic has become """"""triggering"""""". Everyone on Instagram seems to be pregnant, anywhere I see someone talking about pregnancy or children I just feel this huge annoyance in me and quickly look away. I used to brows a pregnancy forum but I stopped that because I've decided I just don't want to think about this anymore !!

530,"All  my live I’ve kind of struggled with social relationships, in my (early)  childhood that was no problem, simply because I was extremely  introverted and I didn´t wanted to have friends, because I was totally  fine alone.

In the 5th and 6th  grade I was bullied and as a result of that I repeated the 6th grade, to  have new a new class. Because of this bullying and other things that  happened in my childhood, **I never really had friends,**  only “colleagues”, mostly because I simply couldn’t make friends, due  to my past experience, but also because I honestly and sincerely  believed that I don’t have the need for friends and social contact,  apart from the normal contact that happens in school.

This  was until the beginning of this year, when –with the help of  psychotherapy- I realized, that I (obviously) had the need and the  desire for social contact, and the feeling of being accepted,  appreciated, and loved by other people. (like every human being)

This  was a big step for me, but because I never really had any friends in my  live and because I also haven’t felt loved by my parents for years, I  ""suddenly"" felt an overwhelming feeling of loneliness and the incredible  need for the feeling of being accepted, appreciated, and loved by other  people.

(which caused me to fall into a depression..)

Now to my actual problem:

One  could now think that, with this incredible need for those kind of  feelings/situations, being at least partially fulfilled (for example by a  night out with a “friend”, or a nice talk with a new coworker), I would  feel like in heaven, especially considering that I wouldn’t have  imagined in my wildest dreams half a year ago, that I would have for  example such nice conversations or nights out..

But  unfortunately pretty much the opposite is the case, after such  situations I have an incredibly strong negative feeling, which I sadly  can´t really identify or think of the cause.

It’s  kind of like the need/hope for those situations to go on forever,  obviously that kind of feeling makes sense considering my “tank” for  such feelings/situations is as empty as it can get, but this feeling  makes it impossible for me to enjoy and appreciate such situations  afterwards, because the feeling usually remains for days or weeks after  the situation.

When I attended college, I was required to get a Tb test because I had to work with children (volunteering). I went to my second doctor and she said, “it looks like you haven’t taken the test yet” and started looking on the computer saying, “you took it back in 1999 (4 years old) and tested for positive.” I told her that’s not possible because I wasn’t in America yet and she brushed me off saying I got tested tb positive in 2005. Every time that happens, I had to go get xray (always come back negative) and even drank medication for 9 months. I was skeptical, but I didn’t want to pay $80 for a Tb test to see if I was positive or negative. She wouldn’t let me do the skin test because “it’s a waste of money/time and if you’re tb positive, you’ll be Tb positive for the rest of your life.”

536,"Two months ago, I was diagnosed with a serious illness that doesn’t have a cure. Basically, I have to be on strong medications and try and force it into “remission” (periods when it’s not active). I went from being completely healthy and fine to in the hospital in a span of two weeks, so it’s been a huge shock, and I’m still dealing with it.

Some background on my parents: My parents have always believed in homeopathy, and growing up, I was given homeopathic “remedies” for everything. Once I grew up and realized they were just giving me sugar pills, I stopped agreeing to take them. They think anyone who doesn’t use homeopathy is just choosing to be sick. I’ve tried to explain why homeopathy doesn’t work to my parents many, many times. They don’t care about scientific studies, or the foolishness of the idea that water has “memory” (yup, that’s a central homeopathic tenet), or any of it. 

So now that I’ve been diagnosed with this serious illness, my parents once again are convinced that their magic pills will save me. While usually I just ignore them, this time I’ve been really upset and frustrated about it. In my mind, they’re basically negating the severity of my illness because they’re convinced it can be cured. This isn’t helpful to hear when I’m trying to psychologically grapple with the fact that I have to live with this awful illness for the rest of my life. 

Luckily, I’m now in my early thirties, and I live very, very far away from my parents. So I could just ignore them and keep on with my life — though they have texted and called me incessantly and begged me to take their homeopathic cure. It makes me feel sad that I’m going through this traumatic thing and I can’t turn to them for actual support. I don’t want to hear that I’m choosing to be sick, so I recently lied to them and said that I was taking their homeopathic concoctions, just to get them off my back. That’s been the only thing that’s shut them up, but now I feel angry and frustrated about having to lie, and I’m sure once I go into remission they’ll use that as another example of how homeopathy is brilliant and life-saving. My mother already messaged me saying “you’re healing”, and every time they message me about it, I feel like I want to break something. 

So Reddit, what do I do? Should I keep up the lie? I can’t confront them anymore, it doesn’t work — and I’m supposed to be managing my stress. How do I find some sanity in all of this mess?",23Aug2019,30

To summarize, the first is a young guy in the military who swiped right tens of thousands of times on girls over 3 years and got nothing from it. The second is an average woman who swiped left on 99%+ of men (tens of thousands) picking in her own words ""the most handsome men only.""

For the past few years I have been reading everywhere that ""looks don't matter"" and ""incels are wrong about everything."" Now if you read those threads it seems there has been a total shift. Everyone there is saying ""incels are right about everything"" and most men are doomed in modern dating culture.

The graphs on male celibacy show 28%+ of young men are now celibate in the US which is triple 10 years ago. And male celibacy is rising exponentially.

What is society going to offer all us hopeless, lonely, disillusioned men? What actual options do we have? Let's say we've already got fancy clothes and have exercised for years and have proper pics (most of us have tried this obviously). What then? In my case I have a good job and more hobbies than I can count. I've had lots of friends. It doesn't help. Every day I feel crushing loneliness and zero self worth from the endless rejection. I didn't start that way so no - the lack of self worth is a symptom of the problem not the actual problem.

I am beginning to wonder if men who are short/ugly/ethnic/autistic should be offered suicide booths like on Futurama. I just want to get off this ride. I can take antidepressants which boost my mood artificially temporarily but the same emptiness is always there and there is nothing meaningful to me without sex/love/affection. Telling someone to ""find meaning elsewhere"" doesn't work because pairbonding and sex are among the strongest basic human drives.

The job market for this is highly competitive but is projected to grow 7% in the next few years, though this is not reliable. 

I am most interested in curator jobs and am willing to immigrate. Which would be the most wise path? Is it unrealistic to hope for a research job with the anthropology degree, I am not suited to be a teacher and would be disappointed to have to enter into social media, marketing jobs. 

Thank you for any advice or thoughts! I knew someone would know more about the job market than I do and what to expect.

543,"Because this guy gives out more red flags than a fucking communistic parade. 
A couple of weeks ago she met this guy on a datingapp, met eachother at her house and basically he's been there eversince. 
I've seen her twice eversince, before I saw her basically every day but I get the ""honeymoonstage"". I met the guy but he seems off and absolutely not the type of guy I'd see her with. He's being manipulative and has been pretty dominant as in telling her what to do and what not to do. They've been in multiple fights already, about pretty serious subjects that could be a dealbreaker for many. For example, my friend wanted to invite a friend (also male) over to meet him, but he didnt want her too because he felt jealous about it (even though the other friend is in a relationship and nothing ever happen between my friend and him). He got verbally agressive, demanded her not to invite the friend so she told him not to come over.
A couple of nights ago they went out together and I get a very distressed call from my friend about how her new boyfriend was only talking to other girls and hugging them, stating he did that to ""make them more approachable for other men"" (which defies all logic if you ask me). Also he's into ""playfull punches"" which apparantly are bad enough to give her bruises. She brushes everything off like it's nothing but I'm really scared for her mental and physical well being. When I talked to her about it she's being very defensive about him and saying he doesn't mean it that way, yadayada. I've talked about this with another friend that's also very close to her and she feels the same way. My guts are telling me to wait it out for a bit, but I just know he will hurt her but on the other hand I don't want to be the one that interferes and be her parent or something.

Thing is, he was never in love. I knew it at first, I knew it because he wouldn't do those cute ass things that other people do, I thought maybe he just was like that. 
It wasn't the happiest relationship, we fought and we didn't fully understand eachother sometimes but we stuck together because the good times felt really fucking good. 
At last it ended, we actually both agreed on it. 
The hardest part is: I miss him. I miss his comments, his way of talking, him. This led to me calling him. We talked about how actually everything is going well. I asked if he missed me.

545,"Hi everyone.

Basically, two years ago I split from my ex-fiancee (her decision). I wanted to stay in our house rather than sell and scramble for a place to live, so I had to buy her out of the mortgage. I wasn't able to afford this on my own, and my brother in law was kind enough to loan me $35,000 in order to pay her out. The bank had to do a whole new mortgage application and refused to approve me as the sole person on the mortgage. So, my brother in law went onto it in name as guarantor (note: I am the sole person paying for the mortgage, he is on there in name only).

&amp;#x200B;

I've slowly been sending him as much as I can per month for the past little while, which feels like hardly anything considering how big of a loan this was. Having this big debt looming over my head is really starting to affect my mental health, and at the rate I'm going it's going to take forever to pay him back. The only quick way I would be able to pay him back in full would be to sell my house. I would make a pretty good profit given what my mortgage is at vs what the house would likely sell for. By my estimate, I'd still be walking away with about 90-100k after lawyer fees, real estate fees, and paying him back in full. That would obviously be a nice down payment on a new place. However, I'm not convinced that I'd be approved for a mortgage on my own even with that kind of down payment.  The idea of trying to find something that's in as nice of an area and as affordable as my current place is also really daunting. I am starting a school program soon until April, and it would probably be smartest to wait until after that to consider selling because I don't think I'd want the added stress.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think is the best plan? I really don't want to have this debt to him anymore, and know that selling would resolve it. But, selling wouldn't guarantee me being approved for a new mortgage on my own. Any advice would be appreciated. TIA",23Aug2019,1

549,"We were best friends. But with the way she’s been acting, our relationship has been strained. I feel like I have to lie to get along with her. I have to pretend she’s not disrespectful and rude to me on a regular basis. I have to pretend her criticism, “jokes” and casual homophobia (knowing I’m bi) don’t hurt me or I’ll be written off as sensitive. I have to I have to pretend to agree with her and keep my opinions to myself (which I often don’t) , I have to smile in her face when I really just want her to get the fuck of my face. 

Last week was the nail in the coffin. I told her how I felt about something she said 3 months ago that hurt my feelings. As calm and respectful as I was, she lashed out at me, claiming she shouldn’t have to explain herself or kiss my ass. After seeing I wasn’t gonna get through to her, I left the room. 

Then she came to my room a few minutes later and tried giving me a life lesson about needing to forgive even for apologies I will never receive. After her little speech, she said she was gonna take a shower because this fight was “too much” for her. I just stared at her with my mouth slightly open. I was so dumbfounded and appalled that she had the audacity to come try to give me life advice after what she just did. I wanted to spit in her face. 

Fast forward to the present: she has this delusional idea that we’ve come back from that. We haven’t. I get so irritated by her presence. And even when I’m not exactly irritated, I genuinely have nothing to say to her. All that comes to mind when I look at her is the stuff that’s happened. And we can’t have a real conversation. She just wants to sweep everything under the rug and pretend stuff is fine, and demands (through her actions) that I do the same. So, I answer her when she talks but do not initiate conversation. I can’t bring myself to. 

She tries to joke around with me and dance around, but I don’t find her remotely funny and just wish she’d shut up. So I ignore her and I don’t laugh or smile. I can’t. I get angry inside during almost every conversation we have because she always has to correct me or argue. I find myself praying during our conversations that she won’t say anything stupid and rude. And when she gives me advice, I don’t want to hear it. 

I dont want to be like this toward her. I’m sure it hurts her feelings and more importantly it’s bad energy and doesn’t help our relationship. But acting any other way with her wouldn’t be genuine. I’m not able to get a place of my own because I haven’t been able to find a job yet and don’t have money saved. Advice would be greatly appreciated.",23Aug2019,1

553,"Okay so I dated my husband off and on since highschool (10 years of that) and then we got married and been married three and a half years. So roughly 13 years we have in some way or another been in each other's lives even when dating others we would stay in contact. I knew he had addiction problems and have even been there and helped him through a bad pill habit and he has been clean for roughly one and a half to two years. We have had major issues. I have chronic illnesses and because of that mental/mood disorders. I am absolutely trying to fix things I can and can't help. Just got cleared to work part time again after a few years for health reasons. He feels like since he makes the money he has every right to treat me like a child, drink, make messes, and not do any house work. He use to be so sweet to me. We split up about six months ago and he said he wanted to change even went to anger management. He uses what he learns to tell me my therapist is wrong and so in turn my choices are too. I'm so done, but I truly do love him. His family has a history of alcoholic tendencies and manic depressive disorder. He always does the bare minimal when he gets ""help"" then claims it doesn't work and in turn tells me I'm crazy. How would you get around getting out? I have tried for a year or more to make this work. I want to stay, but I know we are a toxic together. I got him from jobless, doing drugs to a IT guy at a great place. Everyone praises me for it. He says it is me, but he would have eventually done it by himself. I'm never good enough. Even when I'm in the hospital, ""So you going to get a job and clean the house when you're out?"" I'm trying everything medication wise, mental wise, and job wise I can. I'm still shit in his eyes. He holds a grudge over I'm ill and he has known this forever, things I can't help like when I broke my foot, and when I was badly depressed after a miscarriage and when I was told by my Dr to stop working as a teacher because I was on my feet too much. I worked so hard to get an education in early childhood. The good times are great, but he doesn't value me as a wife. I'm trash in his opinion. I don't want this anymore. I love him so much, but I know my worth. Would you go for divorce, legal separation? I'm also only cleared for part-time work too so I can't afford even my medical cost let alone bills. I don't want to stay to just use him because that's so wrong. I am just so lost and have tried to so hard. I'm so exhausted in every way. I'm not asking what to do necessarily, I'm asking just any advice on any part of what I've just spilled my guts about. I'm at my absolute breaking point but am not sure where to go from here.

556,"I have a really bad sugar addiction and I really want to stop eating so much, or cut it out altogether if possible. I know it’s an addiction as when I think about not having sugar I feel like the day is ruined (I know this is ridiculous for an adult but I’m just being honest!).

I have had a sweet tooth as early as I can remember. I can go all day without eating hardly any refined sugar, but after my evening meal I crave sugar really badly. The issue is that a bit of chocolate or a small dessert doesn’t satisfy me, I’ll have a load of chocolate, some icecream, more chocolate, some sweets. If I’m on my own it’s especially bad.

Last year I gave up refined sugar for three months. I was really impressed with myself for not having any refined sugar during that time. However, as soon as I started eating a bit of sugar again I fell into old habits and eating it excessively.

I find it really odd that I can’t get my habit under control. I successfully quit smoking in my 30s, plus I decided not to drink for 6 years and managed to go from social drinking 3-4 times a week to nothing. So what do I need to do to kick this habit? And why am I finding it harder than smoking and drinking?

564,"Having to use an alt because some work friends know my main account.  I guess I'll begin with some background.  My boss (who I'll call Norma) and I have worked together for 13 years.  We have a great working relationship and we're I guess what I'd call ""work friends.""  We shoot the breeze about what's going on in our personal lives, eat lunch together pretty frequently and occasionally get beers together after a bad week.  She's been very supportive of me through some health-related issues and I've covered for her when she'd had family emergencies.  It's a good symbiotic relationship I guess you'd say.   

Until the past few months.  She has a daughter that I'll call Sue.  Sue is 21.  I won't go into her background because it's not my place other than to say that she's got some severe mental health problems.  In May they came to a head and have been sort of a slow-rolling disaster since then.  This has resulted in Norma being on the phone with Sue for hours at a time trying to support her.  I can't avoid overhearing one side of the conversation because our office walls are paper thin and I really can't tune it out because it's....loud.  Sometimes after these conversations Norma winds up sitting in her office and crying for hours.  Sometimes she just leaves early without saying much and I have no idea if she's coming back.    
This has resulted in me having to pick up some of Norma's work which I'm fine with on a general level.  She covered for me when I was out for emergency surgery and when I made a bit of a mess on my return (don't go to work while taking hydrocodone kids, it's a bad idea).  But today I came in to discover that she managed to miss something that resulted in a colossal fuckup.  Like huge.  Like we're probably going to have the company auditors knocking at our door because of it which is going to completely derail everything for about a month and I'm probably going to miss a deadline on a major project unless I put in a crapload of overtime on it.     
Also being stuck overhearing these emotionally charged conversations every day is starting to really affect my own mental health.  I've tried leaving the office for a bit while they're going on but that hinders me being able to actually do anything.  I can't put headphones on because I need to be able to hear what's going on (which I can explain if I need to but it's a bit of a long digression.)  But usually by 10am my nerves are completely shot and I go home nauseous and exhausted and wind up taking a Xanax and wiping out.

Supposedly, followers are able to discuss politics and current events from all sides. However, most of the content is just recycled content from alt-right accounts. (Although it also contains anti corporation and anti government content too. It’s not all “bad.”) I don’t like that he’s intentionally contributing to dividing people or upsetting people and I don’t know how to get him to understand it’s a shitty thing to do. He doesn’t see it as a problem. 

For example, he’s anti ‘super feminist.’ (As most people are too. Just like we’re also all anti sexualizing kids.) He’s against these crazy ladies who hate all men and want them to suffer, get accused falsely of rape, lose their jobs just bc they’re men, etc. But most people are also against these outliers. But when he’s posting stuff that’s anti feminist, even though he has a point bc these outliers are nuts, he’s putting himself at risk for coming across as a sexist. This is where I’m struggling to get him to understand he’s only setting himself up for harm. It’s ok to be anti-outliers but it’s dangerous to post something that, as a society, we’ve already deemed is unacceptable. He’s coming across as ‘anti- movement’ instead of ‘anti-outliers of movement.’

I have spoken with him numerous times letting him know he’s coming across in a way he may not mean to, (sexist, homophobic, racist, etc.) and he says that’s not the way he feels, that I’m interpreting it wrong, or, he’ll ask me why I think something that is blatantly homophobic is homophobic. It’s almost gaslighting at this point and it’s frustrating and exhausting to go round and round with someone who just wants to argue. 

For example, there is a video going around showing why conservatives are justified in being afraid of gay marriage. It shows the worst of the worst raunchy LBGTQ kinks, pedo’s and overly sexualized kids. But we know that gay people are against sexualizing kids, they are not pedo’s, and many have spoken up against the overt behaviors shown in this video. For whatever reason though, he posted this video. Then when he received backlash from gays and straights alike, in the comments, he says these are not his views, these are outliers and he thinks anyone should be able to marry who they want. ??

So then what’s the purpose in posting something so biased? If you say you’re not against gay marriage and you acknowledge the video is showing something gay people condemn, why are you posting the video? And why act like there’s nothing wrong with posting it? This is what I don’t understand. We know, as a society, if you post something that says “Christians should fear gay marriage” that means you’re agreeing with said message. Or am I actually wrong? Can you post something inflammatory but then say that you don’t agree with it? If everyone in the comments gets upset that you’re being homophobic or spreading inflammatory information, shouldn’t that be a good indicator that you’re coming across as a homophobe? 

When he included in the comments that this is not his view, I was glad that he clarified it bc he needs to protect himself. I explained that whether the ultra left is right or wrong in their actions, we are living in a time where sometimes people’s lives are effected unfairly following a public outcry. I took the approach of ‘life is a game so you have to play it a little smarter.’ He said he understood and he’d put some thought into in. I suggested he further protect himself by posting things that are controversial or conversation inducing from the other side to even it out. He said he’ll think about it but he doesn’t want to post anything that goes against his views. So did he accidentally just admit to agreeing with the message or did he miss understand my suggestion? (I plan to ask him for clarity on this.) I don’t think he can keep saying he doesn’t feel this way then reaffirm he does. Or am I actually reading into it? Am I letting my views influence my reaction? 

I asked him to stop listening to certain podcasts that are ultra far right and I stopped watching liberal late night shows that demonize white men. I do not want to force my views on him but I do not want him to just keep reaffirming his biased views either. I do feel like he’s putting too much time into this stuff and that’s contributing to him getting sucked in farther. I just need a better way to communicate that I’m not coming from a political side, that most reasonable people would find his comments/posts/topics offensive and that whether he sees it or not, he’s coming across poorly and no good can come from it. 

And worse, what if it’s not a phase or what if he gets sucked farther and farther into this alt right crap. What if he actually turns into a racist, sexist, homophobic jerk? Or one of these mean, nasty people who spews hatred just because? At what point do I say, “You’re still my responsibility for now and this behavior won’t be tolerated and politics has nothing to do with it. It’s about being a good person.” Where is the middle ground? I don’t want to stifle his personal growth but I also don’t want him to get any worse.

He’s highly intelligent but has ADHD and, at times, his behavior can be off-putting without him realizing it. He’s always lacked interpersonal skills with people his own age but thrives around adults. People regularly go out of their way to tell me how impressed with him they are and what a great job I’ve done raising him. Aside from this issue, he’s been an absolute joy to raise, has a great sense of humor and is fun to be around. It makes it difficult to rationalize who he is becoming. 

I don’t know the best way to proceed and am looking for solid, middle ground advice please. If I’m in the wrong, I’m willing to hear it. Ideally, I’d like to get him focused on something else but it’s been difficult bc he’s pretty wrapped up in all this. 

Thank you for reading this.",23Aug2019,7
577,"So, a week ago me and my friends went out and we had some drinks, one of my friends had too many. I advised her to stop drinking as she seemed drunk. I then requested a Lyft and we were on our way home. I sat in the front and she was in the back with my other friend. She was passed out drunk in the back seat, suddenly she started throwing up and it got all over the passenger door, she didn’t attempt to open the door while vomiting so he driver pulled over and my friend had to open the door for her. I kept apologizing to the Lyft driver and told him she was really drunk. The vomit wasn’t too bad it did get on his back window. The next day they charged me a $100 damage fee, but I didn’t have enough funds to cover it so it didn’t take out the money. I let her know it is possible they may take out $100 from my account and she laughed and told me to let her know if they did. They took out the money today and I told her and she kept telling me to call my bank and just report it as fraud and I did, but they didn’t believe me. So I told her, and she kept repeating to try again and that “it’s a lot of money for her to give me” I told her well how do you think I feel I’m the one that has been charged. After pleading to her that there’s nothing else I can do she finally venmoes me $100. She then tells me to try again to report it as fraud because she wants the money back. I’m feeling really disappointed in her for her to act this way towards me as she’s the one that got too drunk and vomited in the car. If I was to blame I wouldn’t hesitate to pay her back if I vomited in her Lyft. What do you guys think about this? How should I react when I see her tomorrow? Because she’s going to want to talk about getting her money back again",23Aug2019,5
578,"Hi all

I made posts a few months back asking for help in getting an old roommate to pay back utilities he still owes me on, around $260 at this point

Quick backstory, we had a house together, didn't know each other prior to moving in. Utility bills started coming in and it was impossible to get enough money from him and my other roommate (irrelevant to this post) to pay the bills in time. They both were still in school, and I was working full time, so I could afford to keep lights on, water running, etc. I told them that I can handle paying the bill in full, and I will keep track of how much they owe me on an excel spreadsheet. The agreement was they would pay me back as they were able to. 

We have all since moved out, and he has been dodging my texts and ignoring our past agreements to pay. For example, we agreed on $40 every two weeks, and two weeks has routinely come and gone with no payment. 

Yesterday he seemed to get tired of me bothering him, and sent me a slew of texts saying things like ""LOL I could pay you back right now in full if I really wanted to, but I am enjoying the relationship we have right now"", ""You've always been a small fish in my pan"" and ""You can't even take me to small claims court, your legal fees would be more than what I owe you"". Stuff like that, seems to think he's totally untouchable and that I am 100% at his mercy.

He's a real piece of work, but that's besides the point.

I am currently in the process of obtaining all invoices of bills I paid that he owes me, and I am going to organize it so he can see exactly how much he owes me.

He has royally pissed me off, and I really want to show him that, at the worst, he can't just push me around as he sees fit. According to people who know him he has a history of doing similar things to people and getting away with it. He seems to be relishing in the ""Power"" owing me money gives him. I want to know what the best course of action would be.

The amount of money isn't huge, so I'm not sure which of these I could realistically pursue.

1. Take the spreadsheet with all invoices laid out clearly, send it to him in an email and say ""You have until the end of the month (or whatever time frame) to pay me in full, if you fail to do so I intend to pursue legal action""
2. Just straight file in small claims against him
3. Turn it over to a debt collector

There is some evidence that I have that he has the money to pay me. One being the texts he sent me, he explicitly said that. Another piece could be that he constantly posts videos of him smoking weed on some page (friends words there), so he obviously has money to afford his smoking habit.

The thing I am worried about is that he is paying me back. Purposefully and painfully slowly, but he is. I am not sure how much of a case I would have against him because of that. He's told me that he'd much rather drag this out than pay me quickly. I've tried to be reasonable with him for months, and I am 100% at my wits end with this.

582,"Ever since I was little I had yellow crooked front teeth. My smile is ugly and I try to hide it as much as possible. It is my number one problem when meeting new people and when laughing while hanging out with friends.

When people see it for the first time, what will they think? I can be pretty talkative and social but I can't bring myself to meet new people and therefore do not have many friends. Being in engineering doesn't help, where there are mostly introverts. So meeting and talking to girls rarely happens.

I never had a girlfriend because of my self-esteem issues. Compared to most of my friends being in relationships now, I feel like that is a problem at my age? Dates did happen but being insecure and doing stupid things always got me rejected by girls that I wanted to get to know better. I can't find a girl that I would like to be with (mutually) and I'm not sure what to look for in a relationship.

I dislike having photos taken of me. As for online dating, the numbers are stacked heavily against men and I'm very insecure as to how I would go about telling a girl online about my bad smile.

I'm 24 and have one more year in college. I just imagine one could think of me as a wimp. A loser that can't even earn money to fix them. Incompetent, and stupid. I'm very indecisive, insecure, and I don't know what kind of goals to set or where to lead my life.

My family doesn't support me fixing my teeth. They claim it is all in my head. I hate my family because of that. All I can hope for is when I finish school to earn enough money to solve this problem. But I'm afraid that my life has been already damaged a lot? I tried talking to my parents, getting them checked out, earning some money but I failed.

So here's out it goes, This happens once a day. The round trip from the pickup location to the campus is 22 minutes. I load the car. The driver arrives. Then we drive to the campus, stop at each house/dorm and I deliver to each person.

**Where would I find really cheap drivers, people with a car and are free anytime between 7-12pm?** Craigslist? College Clubs? Ask Postmates/Doordash delivery people when they stop by?

**How would you handle compensation?**

I'm planning on paying the drivers $11 plus $1 for each item (not order) they deliver. I think it's a good deal for the driver because if there's only one order, the round trip from campus to the pickup location being 22 minutes, that's maybe 30 minutes for $12. I'm expecting at least 4 items a night when we start out, and maybe 20 once we get going.

When we hang out, we laugh constantly, touch either playfully and just get each other you know? We fit so well, so honestly I was quiet devastated when she said no coz I genuinely thought there was something good here.

It literally took me 3 attempts to ask her out, evrrytime I started the sentence, I changed it midway coz I got too nervous, but at the end I thought 'fuck it, let's do it, whatever happens will happen'. I asked her "" hey I know this is a bit random, but I was wondering if I could take you out on a date sometime"" , and she was taken by surprise, which made the situation pretty awkward coz there were a few seconds of silence. Then she said "" A date? (Silence) , ummm I think I prefer being just friends"". Now she didn't give me any reason why she didn't wanna go, and I didn't ask her either. I just said 'okay sure no problem', and changed the topic and we continued walking and talking.

Later that night we texted, didn't bring it up again, and as if everything was normal. She was asking me if I could take her to an Indian restaurant (I'm originally indian) coz she has never eaten Indian food, and we spoke about other things. We still tag each other and send memes so things are normal. We still text (although I have reduced it now since I have less incentive) , but idk if there is a chance anymore of us dating?

(So she can’t just walk to town or anything) 

My friend is struggling with extreme mental illness as well. It’s really bad and she’s getting no help for it, she tried going to therapy but her mom never drove her to her appointments.

Her mom does not work but I believe gets disability(if she does, it’s not a lot). My friend’s boyfriend works at McDonalds but does not make a living wage to support two other people and he doesn’t have money to save up so they can move out of her mom’s or even afford a cheap car.

My friend and her boyfriend both have no family members or friends willing to take them in for a while so they can get on their feet. I would take them in but I live in Wisconsin with my mom and there’s no extra rooms or anything.

So the prospects for her situation are kind of dim. I really want to help her because she is suicidal and she is such a beautiful person inside and out and she has such a kind soul. She deserves to be happy and so does her boyfriend.

I have taken the steps to move forward, ordered new i.d., social, looking for work (cant get one without social or i.d.) and started volunteering for a birds of pray facility. Idk what to do at this point. It's been a week and at my lowest of lows. I wish I could just talk to someone that understands. I've gone to therapy, I've gotten medication. I just need to figure out where to go from here. How to pay Bill's. How to move forward. Money is essentially the root of all these problems. Idk where to go or what to do. If anyone can help.

605,So basically over the past 2 days I have found a total of 4 to 5 wasps in my house and after a bit of research I think I figured out that they are red paper wasps and I have no idea what to do with them or how to get rid of them. Any suggestions?,23Aug2019,1
606,"So my boyfriend and I do a lot of drugs easy shit like weed and shrooms then harder shit like cocaine and dmt. He's been doing drugs a lot longer than I have and he's seen a partner od his OD. I tried this new drug, which has dangerous interactions. 

I thought because it was a low low dose it would be fine, and it completely wasn't. I got lucky because my body purged most of it and I survived. But my boyfriend was pissed because I nearly ODed in front of him. We said he needed a week break. 

The next day we were gonna hang out and talk but on the drive there, someone crashed into my car and totaled. I called him and he came and I stayed over at his place and he helped me get my phone fixed. I went home and started to deal with the shitstorm that was the night before. 

I was texting my boyfriend throughout and joking with him to let off steam. When he said ""I hope you know we're not chilling, you've been a terrible partner and I need a solid week from you. But I'm here for you if you need."" I felt bad but I understood I really fucked up, I gave him his space and started working on sobriety.

I stopped using Psychedelics my Drug of choice for 14 days, and in that time my boyfriend and I didn't talk. I dealt with the concussion and the constant fights with insurance everyday plus keeping myself sober. I felt so isolated and alone when after a week he said we're good now and we could talk. 

I didn't know how to feel I value quality time and in one of the shittiest moments in my life, he was nowhere to be seen. I get it was for his mental health because I triggered his old memories for his last partner and overlapped us. But I realized maybe we aren't the best for each other. 

But I saw him again and we went out and I forgot it all. I kept sober and we were doing good until this monday when I was thinking about doing coke with a friend. He was around and heard, I asked my friend for the plug thinking I would do it later that week with them. But they said they called the dude up and he was on his way. 

Realizing I fucked up I paid my friend since he was on his way eith boyfriend judging me. I didn't intend to do any that night and I didn't, but he rolled up a dollar bill and handed it to me and left looking disappointed. I apologized in text and said I wasn't gonna do any. He said ""its like what I told you when we fixed your phone, I've heard it before."" 

That rubbed me the wrong way, I tried rebuilding trust before but it never works. But what he told me is that even tho I listened and worked on it, he still won't trust me. Next day he asked me out to lunch and texted me a bunch but I didn't have it in me to respond so I kept quiet. 

Until eventually after 9 or 10 texts in one day he said ""ugh fine I get it I'll leave you alone."" That was 3 days ago. He's going to california tomorrow for a week so we probably won't talk either. Every time I want to reach out I decide not too because it feels worthless. I don't know what to do other than focus on my other problems, I am dealing with identity theft because someone stole from my broken car and they stole over 13000 from me and my mom's savings account. 

I am still fighting insurance everyday to cover basic shit like my concussion and I haven't even received my car check yet to get a new one. I have too much in my life to start a new project of rebuilding trust. I do really love him but I'm not going to hurt myself for nothing. I'm wondering if my doubts are valid.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I's rocky relationship got worse after he treated me like an addict, and I don't want to try to rebuild trust with someone who doesn't trust me. I have too much in life to sustain a strained relationship. Are my doubts valid or distorted by hurt?",23Aug2019,1

608,"Work in social work, we hired a lady who doesn’t have a degree or a certificate to practice and bill what we bill for. She lied to HR but we are so desperate for people, after finding out and the fact she’s “trying to work towards her degree/cert they are letting her stay. 

One, they offered her 17/hr which is more than we were offered last year and she claimed she had an associates but she didn’t up passing a class she needed so she didn’t graduate or get the degree. She has no experience at all. She doesn’t even have the certification she needs by the state to sit in groups/bill for groups. 

Two-our official website says REQUIRED-Bachelor’s or higher and the certification we use.

609,"The past two years I found myself(26) drifting from my childhood best friend(26) of 14 years. The main reasons is because she's very childish, mean, negative and not a great person to be around. She doesn't put any effort into her life whatsoever. I use to make so many excuses for her like she had a terrible childhood with abusive family members and she just doesn't know better. I've been through just the same if not more and have grown to constantly strive for self-healing and improvement. I've tried to help her or suggest positive things like therapy but she refuses. Fine, that's her own choice but all her poor choices have taken a stem on the people around her. She always aggressive, controlling and just plain mean because she is so insecure. Everyday after work (with her parents in a takeout place) locks herself at home watching tv all day, eats junk food, goes to sleep, repeat. She has no self care, healthy diet or habits what so ever and refuses to change. She says she likes it this way and theres nothing wrong with it, but complains her parents don't cook her any food (take mind they're 65+ working 10AM-12AM to provide for HER) yet she's going to the supermarket hot food table everyday. Just pick up groceries and learn to cook for yourself?! You are 26 years old now.

 My little brother passed away this year and she ghosted me for months. I'm always the bigger person, I decided to say I'm sorry for not being all present because my mind was not all there in hopes she may say sorry for not being around, also I missed her. Her response ""yeah I haven't been there because I never been through what you have, also you've been around your boyfriend a lot."" She has ALWAYS been jealous of every boyfriend(2 both 2-3 years) i had/have because I have healthy loving relationships, which she has never had due to how she is. Every since it's been tension and awkwardness between us. I've spoken up countless times mentioned does she want friends who's scared to speak up to her, especially when she's mistreating them? But she takes it all too personally and throws a temper tantrum, it all goes no where. There is no talking to her.

Originally I planned a trip to Asia two years ago but I could not go due to school/work. I put my foot down and decided I'm going this year and she decided to join me. I was hesitant but decided it could be what we needed, maybe also the trip will help her growth a bit. I was so very wrong. All she's been doing is ignoring me, complaining and just plain out being a child. The country we are visiting I am very knowledgable on and I've travelled many times around Asia in my life. I am mixed ethnicity which a lot of the people here find attractive and i get many compliments and stares. The women here are also very slender, classy and well groomed. The combination of this both has made her insecurity spike and guess who she's taken it out on; me. She does childish things like tell me not to wear certain things because it's not suitable for temples (i've been to many temples and also raised buddhist) yet wears the said no-no things herself. I tell her it's going to rain later so you should bring a jacket or umbrella, refuses and fights me saying her app says its not. I tell her it's always best to be prepared. It obviously rains and she gets mad because I only have my one rain coat for myself, rushes us home and is mean to me for the rest of the day. Everything I say she has a negative snide remark so it's gotten to the point I don't even talk at all. I stay smiling, looking around and taking in the sights while she's bitter, I also noticed this bothers her. These childish things happen every hour. I'm pretending she's not even here most of the time, trying to not let her ruin this trip, everywhere we go now is mostly in silence. I ask her if anything is wrong and she snaps at me with attitude saying ""no why would there be?"" She's jealous my father, boyfriend, friends, work are all in contact with me (before bed/morning) checking on me while she refuses to call her own parents who's worried about her and is on her phone all day long. She is never present, only to post what's going on then constantly check who's viewed her story. I'm sick of it and I'm sorry but I have to give up on her for my own sake. I tried to branch out and go on my own and she threw a temper tantrum. 

I guess I'm just realizing I'm really outgrowing her while she's going backwards, I can't help her and I refuse to stand for this anymore. All our other friends admitted they never liked her but just went along with it because she was my friend. They feel so bad for me because they truly know how she is. We have 4 days left on this trip. I'm trying so hard not to lose it on her because she will definitely not understand and create a huge mess. We are also sharing a hotel that's already been paid for and all places are booked unless I'm paying extremely high amount for a new place. I'm trying to be civil with an uncivilized person. Any tips to stay sane or deal with the situation? Maybe I just needed to rant, I'm so bummed I've been dying to go here and she's shitting all over the place.",23Aug2019,1
610,"These situations happen to me more than often and don't really know whether I should be concerned or not. As far as I know, I'm pretty happy with everything around me and the way it turns out.

I'll start off by saying that I've been on a two-week long trip in Canada and have seen a lot of new things. Nature, people, buildings, etc. It's been absolutely amazing and really allowed for me to take a small break from home. I've been with my best friend for the whole trip and we have been planning on moving together as soon as we get back home, which I feel will allow me to grow as a person. I will need to confront my parents about it which should be a situation of it in itself since they're kind of over protective, but given the right facts and set of words I know they would be okay with it.

Relationships for me has been weird for me. I was dating a girl for seven months back in April. It was really nice but really put a lot of strain on me afterwards breaking up with her. It was mutual but I think it could've been avoided if I had opened my eyes a little more. I had just found out she was essentially leading me on by comforting me as she saw fit, which was nice but it was purely out of pity (almost) on her end. She started not liking me as much as she did in the beginning, the more she got to know me.

Since then I've moved on, so I think. I used to date a girl back in high school (3-4 years ago) and we were the typical cliche relationships that were super duper cute, did everything together, took pictures, etc. It was wonderful but this has been my longest relationship lasting 2 years and a coupe of months. She was absolutely wonderful and I really thought we could've made it longer has it not been for her ""shift"" in interests. Not to mention she also moved states. Not a big deal, life happens and we move on. 

I don't know if it's something about me, but it just fucking blows. I've moved on, but again it really crushes my spirits when I think about how these relationships have kind of gotten ""out of my hands"". I always think about what I could've done to make things better but find myself at a ""roadblock"" most times upon reflecting. I believe that back when I used to be happier, I had more time to focus upon school and my friends around me. Don't know if I should be applying this mentality nowadays since I know I don't want to end up alone. 

I've found a really nice job for myself, still in school, have great friends around me, and am not financially incapable. But yet I still find that there's a little nagging feeling in the back of my head that misses them (or maybe the idea of them?) and don't know what to do. I try to talk to other girls but mostly feel scared and insecure. I frequently have dreams about either one of them and I know it's purely out of the fact I miss being loved by someone, but I know that's not a reason to be ""unhappy"" or feeling this way. I'm scared for some reason and can't understand why. I know that there's someone out there for me. But I hate having all these dreams and feelings about girls I know I shouldn't be dating. Please help me.",23Aug2019,0
611,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and as I slowly walked in a girl I work with thats kinda new to the left of me who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm tightly (around my upper arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery on the chest high cabinet  she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the  cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",23Aug2019,0
612,"My father is 87 and has recently lost his ability to walk. He was an alcoholic and he physically abused me and my mother pretty good when I was a kid. He's never admitted to it or apologized and I don't expect him to do so. I learned forgiveness for my own good, learned to forgive him and moved on. We had a fairly decent relationship afterward, traveled together as adults, no animosity, but I can't say it hasn't impacted me in life. I'm almost 50 years old now.   


In the past few years as he aged and needed more help living alone in his two-story home and handling his daily tasks I was the only relative there for him. My brother and mother had stopped speaking to him and his sister lives about 80 miles away.   


He became a hoarder worse than you see on TV (pics attached) couldn't walk through his home. Has a dog he can't care for and was living with dog feces all around his home. He drives an 8 cylinder pickup truck and was in a fender bender once a month. I'd get calls in the middle of the night from his neighbor saying he found my Dad laying on the hood of his car with the alarm going off at 3am because my Dad was hallucinating that he was dying. I would take him to the doctor, bring him stuff he needs, run errands for him and we'd go out to eat. The last time we spoke about 4 years ago I was there to remove his hurricane shutters by myself on a two-story home, and for some strange reason his neighbor was there cleaning my dads guns... which were for some reason loaded...and before I could stop him a double barrel pistol went off about two feet from all of us and ricocheted off his front porch. I don't know if my nerves had ever been so shot. We couldn't hear for a few minutes, I had PTST and would recoil from sudden loud noises for a few months.  


Also during the visit when the gun went off, I went inside his house to do something and found a stove burner had been left on high with no pot on it for 3 or 4 hours since we and came back to the house that morning.   


So afterwards we argued and I told him I can't help him live like this anymore. It was hugely overwhelming for me but I realized I was also enabling him to kill himself. Because of this he started telling family that I couldn't be trusted, that I had serious psych problems so he would be removing me from his will, and that I was out to get his money.   


My family on his side, my Aunt and a bunch off cousins have all taken his side and cut me off. They believed him. so I just said the heck with it, it was my chance to move on instead of battling him or trying to prove anything to anyone. I was literally and physically exhausted trying to help him like that. My life was falling apart and no one else in the family was around to see what was really happening. I gave up and it was the best thing in the world for me and my health.  


Then I found out the worse of it. In addition to explaining to family how evil I am he explained to his attorney that I was after his money, he removed me from the will (which honestly was the hugest relief because it wasn't worth the psychological torment that came with it and this wasn't about money) The last time I reached out to him he told me to go fuck myself. He wouldn't speak to me but he left a vile, lie filled, hate filled video taped last will and testament for me to watch in front of other family members after he passes away. This information was accidentally revealed to me by his attorney.         


I didn't think of it much until now, but I lied to my school teachers about marks and bruises on my face and body to protect this man when I was young. Nobody told me to do that, I just did it instinctively and didn't think twice about it.  
Here I am as an adult pretty much the only person trying to help him and being psychologically abused and gaslighted to my family for it. On one of our last times peaking almost 4 years ago he went into a fit of rage while I was driving and theatened to kill me while acting like he was pulling a gun from his pants... he didnt have a gun but still almost made me drive off the road.  


It was already getting tough to stick around with all the brushes with death and threats , but once I found out what he was doing with my family and what he was doing with his lawyer and stuff I finally said good riddance and wrote him off from my life, not in anger, I dealt with it though and I'm in a better place.  


Now, 4 years on I've learned he recently lost his mobility and can barely walk. He started calling me recently and left a few messages sounding fairly jovial as if nothing's ever happened. He randomly needed something and couldn't reach anyone else so called me out of the blue.  


I haven't answered the calls. I'm not ready to open pandora's box again and that's always what it is with him. It's most likely because he needs something and has had a few years to deal with his anger. It's definitely not like he's calling to apologize. If anything from experience it will be downplayed like not much happened, yet he made half my family believe I was nuts and out to hurt him over money and property and such, and that hasn't been corrected. He did all this because he deathly does not want to go from his home to a nursing or assisted living home.   


I'm not prepared to try and be friendly with someone who has left a vicious, deceitful attempt at a psychological punch to my gut from beyond his grave via this horrible video will and testament. He recorded at the time we stopped speaking so the plan is pretty clear.  He doesn't know that I'm aware of the video.

619,"My younger cousin died of an overdose either last night or this morning. He was found this morning.  When we were younger we were inseparable.  Up until I was about 15 we were absolute best friends.  Then he got a gf.  Everything was cool until he got put in some camp for using marijuana.  It was at this point that I fell into drug use and had sex with his gf.  This ruined our bond.  He was always much stronger growing up. He was ripped with a crazy talent for bmx while I was just good looking and witty.  I was young and dumb and fucked his gf while he was in boot camp.  This ruined our relationship ever since.  We were civil and still said nice things, but it was never the same.

Today he died of a drug overdose. Heroin.  It's oldest 3 cousins have struggled with opioids for many years. They got raped detox treatment and I got whatever I could afford.  I came out clean.  I thought he did to, but had doubts abhor his sister.  We had dinner together last week and he looked good. We had a good time and he shook my hand and told me he enjoyed hanging out with me again.  Today he was found dead from heroin od.

I'm crushed and want to fucking destroy everything in sight.  I never should have betrayed him, hormones be damned, and I regret it so much.  If I hadn't done that we might have been close enough that I could have saved him.  He was younger but sideways blessed as the more attractive, athletic, and outgoing person.  I hate that I resented him for that stuff now.  I just wanted to be liked by everyone as he was.  Now it doesn't matter. I just want my cousin back.

620,"Like I just graduated a few months ago and just started looking for work within the past two weeks. People with my degree can make decent money if they're competent, but starting salaries are around $40-50k if you land something decent. On top of that I'm buried in debt, have a car ready to explode, and all my family members are in pretty bad situations right now.

Then out of nowhere I get a recruiter offering this position to fly me thousands of miles away that will cover airfare, a $2k moving stipend, my vehicle, gas, and cell phone will be covered, because the position will be moving around all the time I'll get a $4500/month per diem, and then on top of that I'll pull in $75k of hourly pay. There's a hard immediate start date that is soon and I'd be out there in two weeks.

He's going out of his way to berate and belittle members of our family. If he sees someone post something he doesn't agree with, he lashes out. He's giving our side of the family a ""toxic"" representation, and I can't get through to him exactly how bad this is. It's already gotten to the point where my father's sister has blocked him, and our uncle has been publicly calling him a ""bad kid."" My parents don't use facebook much, so they have no idea what's going on. 

Most recently though, he's taken to calling another of our aunt's a ""fucking idiot"" and stating that she's ""to dumb to have kids."" We've never been close to this aunt in question. But she does show up at reunions and cookouts. But after this, all of our family events are going to be, at the very least, awkward. If not much worse.

It's an 800-mile drive from here to New York. I did just get a new (used) car. So I'm confident my car can make it. However, it is a stick shift and I'm still getting used to driving it. I have about a month to practice before I leave. I'll probably be making the drive by myself until I pick up my sister. Any advice you may have is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",23Aug2019,1

631,"On a seemingly uneventful night two days ago my brother began randomly texting me.  I had just seen him this past Sunday and he seemed relatively fine.  The texts began with a ""take care of my child"" tone.  When I asked if everything was OK, he began sending rambling texts that were feeling related (""no one likes me"", etc.).  I got the tone that he was potentially suicidal, and my fears were confirmed when he sent me a pic of himself with a plastic bag on his head.   I panicked and tried calling my mom (I'm about 40 mins away from where he lives), but then immediately called 911.  Thankfully he is OK.  

The issue I am having now is post-attempt, my parents don't seem to get it.  They think it's because he was drinking and are taking the approach of ""no one should talk about this"" and it needs to be swept under the rug and he should stop drinking (which I agree he should stop).  Overall I keep telling them that's wrong.  I know my brother is not happy with his life for multiple reasons and it extends beyond drinking.  The drinking is a coping mechanism.  He has alluded to things before that made me wonder if he was OK but I regrettably never asked.  My brother and I aren't that close and I keep wondering why he reached out to me in particular (I'm one of many siblings and he also has a sh\*t ton of friends).  People I've confided in me tell me it's because he knew I would do something and wouldn't ignore it.  I don't know if I should try and talk to him (he's messaged me saying he doesn't want me to tell anyone and I know he's embarrassed).  However, if I don't try, I know my parents won't.  I know that if there is a next time, he isn't going to reach out to anyone and that scares me.  I don't want his kids growing up without a father.  I know right now he is in a delicate state of mind, so I don't want to push for him to talk to me, but I know he needs help.  I just don't know what kind of help.  To complicate matters my brother is fairly connected, so when the police, etc., were dispatched he somehow shut it down.  However I think the State Police have to follow-up.  Any advice is appreciated.",23Aug2019,1

633,"***I posted this to r/askwomenadvice aswell***
This is going to be a very long post but I need someones help urgently. 
My friend has been in a relationship for 1 and a half years now.
A while before she got in the relationship we would always talk about things and she would always ask for my advice and basically vent out her thoughts to me. I heard her out and helped her in any way I could. During last summer break our contact as well as the contact between her and most of her other friends was mostly cut off. 
We would only talk every now and then, pretty briefly. I still considered her a close friend(if that even matters). After last summer we had caught up a little bit and she mentioned how her boyfriend had stopped her from meeting her friends from our school. (Her Bf doesnt go to the same school). She also mentioned how things have been getting worse and worse between them the previous months and how she isnt as happy as she used to be. He doesnt comfort her when shes upset and calls her ridiculous/says she is exaggerating when she cries over anything(including when she cries over him yelling at her over small things). 
She told me how almost anything can turn into an argument and that he usually disregards her feelings. Another thing she mentioned is how he threatens to go out and meet with another girl if she meets  me and a few other mutual friends (one of which she had a very small crush on a few years ago). He also threatens to break up with her very often over small things. I've been telling her that their relationship is bringing more harm than good from what it sounds like and told her that there is nothing stopping the situation from escalating if she doesnt do something about it. She tells me 'but he still makes me happy sometimes' and 'I still love him' but to be honest I think she is just really scared of change. She even admitted that alot of her friends are mutual with him and that she is really afraid of what would happen with them if the relationship with her boyfriend ends. 
To make things worse, they recently planned a vacation that they are going on in a few months and her bfs dad is paying for her and she told me a few days ago that she cant break up with him now because of that and she will have to wait a long time etc. Then like a day after that she mentioned how he got angry at something and threatened to break up with her and said that he could easily find someone else to take with him on the vacation instead. 
(Also wanted to point out that this bf knows about me and she has mentioned to him how I have helped her with alot in the past)
Recently she also told me to be careful what I write because he might look through her phone.
Im really worried things are going to escalate further. Not to mention he might isolate her even more to the point where she cant get help anymore.
I obviously couldnt include every detail but I really need any help I can get because it seems that something isnt clicking inside of her and she needs someone to help her.(I ofc dont blame her I have never been in that situation)",23Aug2019,0

've been a stay at home mom for about 15 yrs. I got pregnant unexpectedly at 22 and was horribly ill the entire pregnancy. I had just started college and my husband and I  decided I should stay home with my baby.  I finished out an A.A. shortly after having my second child at 25.  I continued to stay at home and did a tiny bit of transcription work for a few months.  I had my third and final child at 31 and haven't done anything since. Now here I am a 36 year old lady with all my kiddos in school and I am terrified on what to do next.  I have no idea how to get a job, I have no job experience outside the home.  I basically haven't worked since I was 21.   I was offered 5 hours of work a week basically as a receptionist because I know the manager.  I said yes as I thought it would be a foot in the door but then I proceeded to have a panic attack bawling my eyes out in the kitchen and finding it hard to breathe.  I just don't know if I can go back into society. The anxiety is unreal. The idea of being someone's employee has me terrified.  My husband is very supportive but assertively told me I should take the job just to get my feet wet since it is basically a teenagers job.  I'll be working with mainly very young adults/teens.  Regardless, he doesn't understand anxiety.  I feel paralyzed.  I don't know if I can do it. I keep looking for at home jobs but idk where to start.  Any suggestions on how to deal with my anxiety, job ideas for someone with no experience, life in general.  Help!  Sorry if I rambled and my grammar isn't great.  Just trying to get my thoughts out.

639,"I have been friends with this girl for well over five years. We have been through everything together, every trauma or pain we both have ever experienced, we were able to talk to each other about it. I only ever had feelings for her once in our friendship, and I had told her that, turns out she at one point had feeling for me too. 

But we both had liked each other at different times, and when we talked about this we were both in our own relationships. So for almost 3 years, I had feelings for her, but I put it in a box. My feelings for her never went away, they were always there, but I pushed them to the side. 

I spend at least four to five days out of the week with this girl, we do everything together. Just recently I had left for three weeks on vacation, and being away from my best friend for three weeks wasn’t very fun. The night I get back, I get a 20 minute slideshow of all the photos and videos that she has of me, I’m not even kidding you I watched it all the way through and I couldn’t stop smiling. I started to feel like our friendship was going to become something more. 

From Monday (today is Friday) to Thursday I have hung out with this girl until around 3:00-4:00 AM. Monday and Tuesday consisted of subtle flirting, and I didn’t know if it was just me but I really felt like something was happening between us. 

Wednesday was when she confessed how she felt about me, and I had told her that the feeling was mutual (and she’s bad at hiding her feelings). We end the night on good terms, and we part our ways.

Last night (Thursday) we were together again at her house, and we just talked about our feelings, Wondering if we could make it work. We are both very honest with each other and it really made the conversation easier. We both know that we want to be more then friends, but she leave for college in four weeks, and if she’s 954 miles away from home she doesn’t know how that would affect her feelings toward me. I feel so bad for her because there’s so much going through her mind, but her heart really just wants to be with me. 

After a long conversation, we both just gazed into each others eyes for at least an hour. Then I kissed her, and kissed her again. It felt odd making out with my best friend, but it didn’t feel dirty. It almost felt right, perfect if I’m being honest. 

Moral of the whole story here is;

Should we try and make long distance work, or should we just put our feelings in a box?

(Should the box be re-opened when she’s back home? Or should we just throw the box away?)",23Aug2019,3

643,"So I've been together with her for about a year now. I truly love her and we are happy together. 
About six months ago, however, she started smoking weed with some of our mutual female friends. That's not a problem for me, as long as she's happy. Now here's the problem:

Her dealer doesn't only sell weed but all kinds of drugs. Literally all of them. The past month, her casual smoking has slowly been turning into a real addiction. She craves to smoke it not because of her company but because she needs to. I'm really worried for her and sie won't stop. Like I've told her several times that I'm very concerned for her health and well being, but she shruggs it off and tells me not to worry ""it's under control"". 
It is not. Definitely not. 

The main problem for that is her dealer. He's getting more and more pushy and basically urges her to take hard drugs like LSD or Cocaine. 

That also wouldn't be a problem, but she says, that she's ""curious"" and that she ""wants to try it for fun"". But I know, that once she's tried it once, her dealer will make it cheaper and more attractive for her in order to get her and her friends addicted. 

As you can see, she doesn't appear to know how easy it is to get her addicted and that her dealer isn't ""friendly"" and giving her a ""discount because they are friends"". They're not. He just wants to maximise his profits on her cost. Literally and figuratively.

A while back she told me his name and now I'm in a conflict with myself. 
Neither she nor her friends listen to me. I've literally tried everything to help them. I really don't want to have to go to ne girlfriend's funeral because she overdosed. That's why I wanted to go to the police and give them an anonymous tip on who one of the biggest dealers in town is. Our town is fairly small, so that might cripple the whole drug business here.

Now what do you think? Should I get him busted so he can't sell her drugs anymore? I'm really desperate and his disappearence would make it impossible for her to buy drugs from him. She would never find out that it was me who told the police. 

Thank you very much.",23Aug2019,8

646,"This is a throwaway, I’m on mobile, and is my first ever time posting but I’m desperate for advice so please bear with me. 

Some backstory about my sister: my sister we’ll call her Liz, has been with her husband for 7 years married for just 9 months. Liz is absolutely gorgeous, charismatic, and an overall good person. She does have a problem with lying a lot. Not with malicious intent but little white lies like for getting out of things like work and events, to get attention, etc.. She also has extremely low self esteem and a need for people to like her.

As for her husband, Dan, he wasn’t always so bad. For the first couple of years he made an effort to be close to our family and he seemed like a great guy. Although now, not so much. He’s extremely smart and motivated. His family is very well off as is he. Over the years that they’ve been together my sister would lightly mention things about how he would call her names, scream in fights, and this eventually lead to her telling of times where he has physically abused her. Pushed her off a bed, scratched her, spit at her, although she never calls it “abuse”.

The mentions of this would come out when she’d rant about him, but when I’d say something to the effect of her needing to leave him or tell someone she would freak out and say that she is fine. I really believe that her low self esteem and comfort she has being with him from financial security make her too scared to end their marriage. She is also extremely close with his family. (More so than with our own) I don’t think she believes that she could start over and be fine and she is scared.

At first I wondered if the incidents she talked about might be some of her white lies.. but then the few times she has answered a phone call from him around me and I can just hear him screaming through the phone. I hear the way he speaks to her when he thinks no one is listening and it definitely makes it seem possible.

And it even gets just a little more complicated... I work at a company his family owns. As do my other two sisters. (Not the one he’s married to.) Dan in particular is not around much because he runs another business owned by their family that’s a ways away from where we live. You can see why me making any accusations without evidence could really affect a lot of my family’s, and other people’s lives..

Onto the incident.
Last night around 3am I received a text from Liz saying:

“Seriously. If I ever end up dead, it's because of Dan. I'm confiding in you with my life. We've gotten in a lot of fights because he's so stressed, he's threatened to kill me. I'm confiding in you. And you only. Delete this text please” 

And then, 
 
“I'm not trying to scare you, this is for if anything ever happens in the future. He's asleep and I'm just letting you know”

Obviously this freaked me out. She had talked before about the things he would do to her, but she never seemed scared before. I replied saying she needed to get help and all she responded was “no. I’m okay.”

I left it at that and have not deleted the texts. 

Another scary thing is that Dan’s family is very religious and in their religion you can NOT get a divorce. Liz and Dan did not sign a prenup so when I’m thinking over all of this my wildest scariest thoughts run saying he would probably just kill her when he gets tired of her or if she finally pushes for a divorce since he cannot and will not ever divorce her.

I of course talked to my younger sister about this, because I HAD to tell someone and needed advice on what to do. I told my younger sister that if I heard ONE more mention of him abusing her I wouldn’t stay quiet anymore. (I honestly don’t even know what I’d do.. go to the police? Tell our families? What COULD i even do?) 
She then brought up a point to me that scared me. She said, “okay but what if the next thing that happens IS him killing her? Could you handle that with having known?” And that really messed me up. 

I know the easy thing to comment is “OMG out this scumbag!!” But it’s so much easier said than done. I feel like even if I have the best intentions that Liz will resent me.. she will say I ruined her life and marriage. My sisters and I would likely be fired from our much needed jobs. A lot of family relationships would be ruined. This will flip all of our lives upside down. 
Not to mention what if these are some of her exaggerations she’s telling me to to feed her need for attention/sympathy? 
 I’m not trying to sound like I’m blaming the victim but if you knew Liz you’d know why I worry about this. 

So should I keep waiting and watching or should I blow this whistle? 
And if I do, what exactly should I even do?",23Aug2019,187
647,"A little over a year ago I met my best friend through an app. 

At the time she wanted more friends and she was even in a relationship but we instantly clicked. We texted each other non-stop and even tho she was in a relationship I respected it. 

She was single for a while and still is but I started coming over and that turned to sleeping over and that turned into making out and cuddling every other night. 

She didn’t want to date because she was moving to another state. She moved and in that time I realized I need to work on myself.

I know I love myself and that took time but I don’t have a lot of confidence in my ability to do anything and I know that’s a big part of loving myself too. 

I visited her a lot and one thing led to another and we had sex a few times. I came back home and her and I would FaceTime every single day a few times. 

Recently she decided to move back over here and while here visiting her family, I decided to tell her how I really feel. 

Last night we talked and she told me that she can’t date me right now because her mental state isn’t the greatest with everything that she’s going through at the moment and I matter too much to her to mess up our friendship. 

She also said that if things with her were different, things between us would be too and we could be something more. 

We decided that we would remain friends and work on ourselves and then proceeded to cuddle while I played with her hair in the backseat of my car. 

She’s all I think about, and she makes me want to be a better person. I can’t even bring myself to hook up with someone else. I love her to death and she truly is my best friend but I’m starting to think it might possibly be a little harder to focus on me because of my feelings.",23Aug2019,8

So here's the seating arrangement in work:

Red are taken

Blue are free

Pink is me

Green is where I want to be


I want to move seat because even though there are 2 seats taken by me, they come in once a fortnight at best and I feel completely isolated and honestly, lonely.


Thing is the left side of the room is 'technically' a different team although we (or I) like to see the whole room as our team really.


I guess my problem comes down to the fact I'm a bit awkward / shy. That spot is kinda reserved as a snack spot. I'm kinda paranoid that the girl I'd be sat next to would rather not have someone sat there but wouldn't actually say anything and feel awkward or something.


Then theres the problem of 'the other teams' manager. She likes the idea of ""this is team A and that is team B"" and generally likes to keep things a bit more professional than is ever required within the office space.

655,"So I want to give a little background info on this situation: I am 19 and currently live with my parents. I got my dog when I was 8, and since that day my parents have had an undying hatred for him. I’m not really sure why. I have a fuzzy memory of having a puppy when I was around 5, and I remember we ended up giving it away after a few weeks (they hated this dog too). I’m surprised we made it so far with my current dog. 

My dilemma is my dog is going on in age and his health is deteriorating. Pretty much he’s going completely blind. We finally took him to the vet a few weeks ago, and the vet said we needed to take him to an eye specialist ASAP. The problem is, my family really can afford it. We all had to pitch in for the vet bill, and this eye bill might be even more expensive. I thought about just sticking it out and trying to pay for it by myself with what money I had, but that won’t work out in the long run (idk of this information is relevant but I’m currently not working and focusing on school to fix my grades from the last year). 

I know putting him down in an option but I really don’t want to. I have a really selfish reason but it’s just my whole life my parents always talked about how badly they wanted my dog dead. All the time they would tell me they wished he’d run away or get hit by a car or anything so he would die. I don’t want to give them the satisfaction of him dying. But I don’t know what else to do. Is there a way I can give him away? I know there are senior dog sanctuaries in a state away but is the process difficult? If anyone has given their dog to a senior dog home I’d appreciate any advice you’d have.

I have administrative experience and have an MA myself, which I thought would give me a particular edge, in that I would know the issues postgraduate students are likely to face etc. (the job required A-levels, but an undergraduate degree was desirable). I also currently work at the university, albeit in quite a different role.

Since the automated email receipt, I have heard nothing about it, and the job advert specified that the interview date was last Tuesday, so it's a pretty safe assumption that I wasn't shortlisted. Obviously I'd like to find out why, but I'm not sure how to ask for feedback when I haven't formally been rejected. Every email I've drafted has some variation on ""as the advertised interview date has passed, I assume that my application has been unsuccessful"", but this seems a tad accusatory/rude, particularly the ""assume"". I'd rather not annoy them, as there's always the possibility that the hiring process has been delayed (optimism to the point of folly, I know).

I'd appreciate any advice on how I should contact them.",23Aug2019,1
659,Okay so I should paraphrase this by saying I have a branch of OCD called pocd which essentially makes you fear that youre a pedophile. Lately I've been feeling like my pocd has turned me into a bad person. Whenever I read about pedophiles I feel like I cant judge them because of a compulsion I performed about a month ago. One day when I was in the bathroom masturbating I heard my 8 year old cousin and 10 year old brother playing in the other room. I suddenly became anxious over the thought that the sounds of them sexually excited me and I tried masturbating to the sounds of them to see if I liked it. I didnt like it and after about 6 seconds I was immediately repulsed but now I feel like a monster for even doing it in the first place. I feel like I'm no place to judge perverts who take advantage of children because I'm scared that I took advantage of a child myself and im a horrible person. I dont know what to do and I don't know if it's my OCD or I'm actually a terrible person. I love my cousin and my brother and I would never do anything to hurt them which is why I'm so scared. They're coming over tomorrow and I'm scared about how much guilt and shame I'm gonna feel. I feel wrong over the fact that I'm gonna be around them and I need to get past this or I'm gonna explode.,23Aug2019,1

I found out though that I would be moving from Michigan and i told her so we never ended up actually dating but we still hung out a bit. This summer i moved and it's been hard. I thought it would get easier and it has a little but today i remembered all the fun things we did and how perfect she was and I almost cried. She was perfect in every way and she actually liked me. I didnt think anyone would like me but she did. I dont really talk to her much anymore, after the move weve been kind of quiet.

I have always been a shy/retracted guy and I'm very silent around people I don't know which caused me to have around 0 social life. Through the years I have learned how to be a bit more social and even though my social life is still minimal atleast I have something. When talking to a friend I realized that just about everyone atleast had one if not more romantic partners at my age which kinda puts me behind when it comes to what to do as a boyfriend but also things like kissing and sex.

When I was in college about 3-4 years I received a tuition waiver for being a teacher. I ended switching majors and the tuition waiver turned into a loan. Now that I finished grad school I called the Illinois Student Assistance Commission to find out more information about it. Yesterday I was called by TSI, the collections agency with their spiel on voicemail.

What do I do to move forward? Is requesting a validation of debt a good option? Do I call TSI (the collections) back and arrange a payment plan?

669,"Gear in for this fit of emotion of mine. 
I had always wanted a dog when I was a kid. After a lot of whining around, my parents got me one. I developed a very deep bond with him in a very short period of time. Within 2 years, this unruly brat of mine had created quite the notorious name for himself in my building which I am fully to be blamed for. Due to repeated complaints from the neighbours, my parents gave away the dog to someone in the outskirts with a large farm where he could roam around freely.

Initially I used to visit him frequently but the pain that accompanied each time I left it made my visits rare. He was happy there but whenever I would visit and play with him and get ready to leave, he could kind of sense it and would bark in a very sad way. This used to break my heart so I stopped visiting him completely after a while.

Now my dog is about 13 years old and I hadn't seen him for the last 4 years and the owners have told me that he may not live for long. This struck me hard and I am not able to come in terms with it. I can't decide whether I should visit him one last time or just not visit him and assume he is living on happily without me.

It would cause me a lot of pain to see my baby look old and watch it walk with difficulty. Don't really know what kind of answer I am looking for but my heart feels heavy writing this post.",23Aug2019,2

672,"This is a problem I've had for a very long time and a problem which I thought stem from my insecurity. So I worked on it for years, found hobbies, became proud of it. About to graduate with a computer science degree. Did many internships and projects since high school that always wow's my employers so my future looks really bright for me. I was always ashamed of my body so I have been eating well and working out and got in shape. I used to be socially awkward but I overcame that overtime and became pretty good at socializing with most people. 

But I always had an issue. I'm *very* considerate of others. Because of that I'm always on time and never holding back the people around me or be an inconvience to them. I would rather wait 2 hours for my friends then them waiting 5 mins for me and I never bring my problems to other. 

This worked against me because I'm aware I'm ugly. I'm afraid to talk to the girl I'm interested in because I feel like I'm just a bother to her or that I'm stepping out of my place, also she's very nice so I'm afraid she'll say yes because she couldn't say no then put this pressure or burden on her. 

I've known her for 2 years from one of the internship and I've liked her for a year. Not much has changed besides very casual conversations. She's going to be gone in 2 weeks for med school so my time seeing her in person (potentially ever) is nearly over now.

674,"My ex and I dated for 3 years. We broke up due to a long distance thing not working out. He was the love of my life and it took me years to get over him. It’s now been a few years since we broke up and we are both in committed relationships with people we love and live with. 

We both reconnected and started talking just to find out we are both frustrated in our relationship, especially sexually. We haven’t talked about doing things but we definitely reminisced about old times and the amazing sex. 

I don’t know how he feels but I know him as a person and I have this feeling he feels the same way as me. And I feel so heartbroken. He was my absolute best friend and I don’t think I’m over him yet even though it’s been a years. 

I wouldn’t normally use words like this but I feel in my heart he’s was soulmate. Everything worked so well with him and we were perfect. And we broke up because of circumstances, so I don’t think either of us fell out of love. 

Last night I was talking to him about how my boyfriend feels very distant and I don’t know what to do. And he told me “tell that man if he loses you he will regret for the rest of his life, like I am”

He asked me to get drinks and go see a concert with him that’s coming up in two months. And I know this is so dangerous. I worry we will both end up cheating. 

And I know this sounds selfish but I don’t want to break how with my boyfriend until I can figure out if I’m just being insane and trying to find something in him that I’m missing right now, or we are supposed to be together. 

I genuinely love my boyfriend. With absolutely all of my heart and he does so much for me. But I don’t want to break up with him just because I’m frustrated and confused. But I also don’t want to cheat on him if something does happen. 

We also both live with our partner so even if we by some slim chance fall back in love together, it will be messy no matter what we do. 

I’m so confused and know I am being selfish and a horrible girlfriend. But I don’t know what to do with these feelings of love for these two guys. 

So I’m first of all ready for the critical remarks about how this is wrong as I’m fully aware I’m being selfish. But I’m never been selfish for my own happiness before and feel like right now I need to be. 

But I’m looking for advice on where to go with this situation and what the hell to do. Am I really about to risk my relationship with this good guy who I do love, just to see where things go with this other guy who hasn’t been in my life for years.

I had a very atypical high school experience. I was in a private high school for ~1.5 years (I'm not super rich, had good scholarships, my parents wanted me to go to after a bad public middle school) then I dropped out because of mental health. I was super depressed and did basically nothing (no school) for more than half a year (I'm for the most part fine now, therapy etc helps a lot). Then I went into a credit recovery high school to basically just get it over with and go to college. I did ok there but classes were all online and it wasn't really a place where you talked with anyone else because they were all doing different things and mostly didn't want to be there. I did alright there but it was all self-motivated and I didn't (don't? I don't know) really have a lot of self discipline, so even though the courses were pretty easy I went through them fairly slowly up until this summer when I was admitted to college (engineering school of a large ish university) when I realized I was going nowhere near quick enough to finish the high school courses in time for college. Basically through the end of the summer I did nothing when I should have been doing a lot, I wanted to get my driver's license, buy a car, finish high school classes, go to college events before school starts, etc. My plan is now to instead just complete the GED which should be fairly easy as opposed to many more hours of high school classes while I'm doing more advanced classes in college anyways. And through all this, I've had zero real life friends. I'm a little ashamed of that but not too much, I have some good online friends that I've known for 5+ years and I've met up with a lot of times, and also I'm an introvert in general and not super social. It definitely isn't something I'm proud of though and I hope to change that in college.

That probably wasn't all too coherent but hey it felt good to type out. Anyway, the point of all of that is that I feel like I'm isolated in a completely different world, living a completely different life than all of the people around me. I've only been in this school for 5 days (I also commute (on the bus) so no roommates) so I don't expect to have 500 friends already, but I've only talked for more than a couple seconds with 3 people. One I knew from college orientation and have a class with, one was a random encounter that I have no idea who they were, and one was someone from my class that I talked with for a couple minutes after. 

There are a ton of socialization opportunities all around me. I'm typing this out sitting in a building with a bunch of people everywhere in it. I don't go home right after classes end, every day this week I've stayed until at least 5 or 6, but all I really do after class is find somewhere to sit and work on schoolwork. I've applied to a couple small clubs through my university's website for it but haven't really heard any responses yet. There are a ton of events going on around campus but a lot of them are for dorm residents, more are speakers/lectures which I'm sure would be interesting (and there's a couple I'm planning to go to) but I wouldn't really meet or talk with anyone there. And I've read all about how freshman are open to talk to whoever for the first couple weeks and that's where a lot of college friends are made (not that I'm worried about never being able to make friends after the first couple weeks), but I flat out don't have the social skills developed to utilize that. I don't know what to talk to someone about; I didn't take any AP classes in high school, I don't really listen to any music, I just have no idea what to say besides ""hi"" and ""whats your major"" then unless the other person says something interesting I have no idea how to continue the conversation. Even though it might not sound like it, I do have some hobbies (although I'd like to spend more time on them than I am), but they're somewhat niche and there aren't specific clubs for any of them here. 

Also, the irony of saying I don't have any social skills, then listing a bunch of social opportunities and shooting them all down for various reasons is not lost on me. I know that I'm never going to learn and it's not going to get any better without action. I just don't know how to start. I feel intimidated by almost everyone around me, as they've all (most) finished high school the ""right"" way and they've gone to prom and probably had girlfriends/boyfriends and friend groups throughout high school and a lot of them have their own cars and are always texting their friends and talking to people they've only met this week like they're good friends and maybe live in the dorms where they have to basically live on their own and cook and make sure they have basic living supplies WHILE juggling college courses and friends and SOs and sports and working out and jobs and parties while I'm commuting from home (only a couple minutes away) and doing next to none of that, and still doing worse. I've never so much as touched a crush or gone on anything that could possibly be construed as a date (I haven't gone out and done anything with friends besides a couple times early in high school), much less something even as simple as holding hands and a lot of people (I know that a lot of people are in the same boat as me in that respect but still) are in years-long relationships and kissing and having sex and hooking up at parties. Not that I want to hook up at parties even if I could go to them. I feel like my life is slowly wasting away in front of me when I look at how involved in things everyone around me is. And I know it's my fault. Girlfriends or friends or even accomplices or study partners aren't going to appear in front of me out of thin air. I know there are a lot of people around me that could be these things, and I want that to happen (probably best to get myself in order before I go looking for a girlfriend though) but drawing a line from one to the other is impossible for me even though I see people doing it all around me. Even before I started college a couple days ago I had a feeling that making friends was not going to be effortless and out of thin air like it appears to happen for someone with much better social skills. Now, 5 days later, I know I'm still at the very very start of it but that obviously proved true. 

I know there's some stuff I forgot to write, I'll probably edit it in after this but hopefully if you read this far you get the idea. Any advice you have for giving feel free because I sure as hell need it.

TL;DR No social skills, no one I would even call an accomplice after 5 days at college, intimidated by everyone around me's accomplishments that I can't compare to, don't know what to do about it or how to start talking to anyone about anything, want to work on that before everyone's formed friend groups and it gets a lot harder. I'm probably already too late, who knows.

So this summer has been a mix of great and absolutely horrible. I started off by going back home to Peru and I live in Canada. My girlfriend and I of two years(prior to this we’ve known each other coming up 6 years) had some issues while I was gone. When I got to Peru, I got to see my family, my old friends and so much more. I felt really happy and I got offered to come back to Peru and live there. I was quite happy about that but of course I couldn’t say yes because I have a life here in Canada and her here but everyday while I was there I kept telling her how happy I was being there and that it would be great living there. Of course something from my stupid mind that I missed is that I completely disregarded her feelings. I love her and it’s undeniable answer that I do. When I got back to Canada I told I would work on being happy where I live and being more appreciative but then fast forward a couple days later she was going to see her family on the east coast. So collectively this summer we maybe saw each other twice before I left and she left which sucks . One thing I was noticing is that she was becoming a bit distant while she was there and so I asked her the other day and she told me yes she was but because of what I did in Peru, which was ignore her feelings in the process of saying all of these things about Peru. She told “you honestly broke my heart and I lost a bit of feeling for you but now they’re back” and that she also does forgive me but when she said that to me my heart sank not because of what happened but because I did that to her. Fast forward to today, we woke up and went to get Tims and I kept thinking to myself maybe it would be better if we broke up because I’m hurting her. So I brought the conversation up and immediately regretted it but we did talk sensibly and realized that we were becoming a bit toxic to each other. A lot of it I feel is because of me and I don’t want to lose her because she’s been my best friend and my partner for so long now. I want to marry me her one soon and I was planning on proposing soon this year but I can’t now because of this. I’m not really sure what to do or where to go from here. We both agreed we would try to work on it so we could try to move forward and “fix” what’s happened but I don’t know where to start or how to go forward because honestly I can’t forgive myself for breaking her heart like that. It was so selfish of me. I’m really lost and scared that I hurt her and I’m losing my best friend and my partner.",23Aug2019,1

689,It was the second day of school and I was pretty nervous. My teacher told me to write my name so I grabbed a pen when I opened the cap around twenty or so ants crawled out they were small and had a yellowish-clear color. This was while I was fully awake. I don't know why they were in my pen because my pen had been in my pencil pouch for a while. No one around me acted like they also saw the ants and like everything was normal. I checked my bag my pens and my pencil pouch after (because I had to do a test) but I couldn't find any of the ants. Many of my friends say they see me do random things but I don't know if that's just me going crazy. I don't know if I was hallucinating or those are weird ants. I am 14. I don't take drugs or drink or anything. I recently had to leave all of my friends without saying goodbye so I was messed up for a few days but otherwise I don't know why I would be hallucinating ants. How would I know if I was hallucinating,23Aug2019,3

692,"So that winter January 2017 night it was 10 pm and i was returning home from my hostel of collage for a weekend and i was happy watching everything around me and feeling good about it and when i was almost 30 km away from home i was unable to find any bus or carriage to go home and i stopped and waited for some bus going toward my hometown so i could ask him for lift and after 10 minutes of me standing there waiting for bus, this man in his 30's with black beard looking spiritual and religious, skinny dark circles around eyes, wearing a kurta and jacket over it appeared out of nowhere near on a bike asked me where i was going? told him just casually about my hometown. He said he was also going there he would drop me if i want.. Being tempted by the wait and also in a hurry to reach home and surprise siblings with gifts I got for them i immediately told him YES!! We were going and he started bragging about himself and his connection and asking me what i was studying where i was studying? to keep me distracted from smelling anything unnatural and unusual and after riding for 6 km he got some relative near there and he had to get some package from them so we would stop there and i said I was okay with it...and then after a while he turned the bike toward an earthen abandoned road and i just started smelling the danger and telling myself imagine what if this man turned out a robber and also comforting myself everything will go fine don't think like that... and that man just kept telling me while driving bike deep into dark they were just living there.. and then after a while he stopped and we both were off the bike and then he hand cuffed me with his hands and i just got blind lost myself didn't knew what to do.. He also squeezed my throat with the muffler scarf i was wearing  with one hand and asked for a hand  job and then he molested me sexually later.. and after that he robbed me off my phone wallet stuff and went leaving me in dark with no one else there and then i ran in the fields crying and reached a highway there was police checkpoint there told them that i was robbed( kept secret of that i was sexually molested) they gave me few bucks and then i reached home from there... In home i just told them i was just robbed and it was not much serious....and

701,"Hey everyone,

Last Thursday, my uncle passed away at the age of 53. He had been fighting stage four colorectal cancer for the last 4-5 years and he could no longer continue fighting.

His biggest concern was leaving his son (11) without a father, especially because of his young age and how much older the  myself and the other cousins are (I’m 21). My cousin is incredibly shy and we have been really worried because he has been incredibly overwhelmed and has been isolating himself for the last 8 days. 

I completely understand that he is most likely in shock and just can’t begin processing it, but we want to be there for him as best as we can. Does anyone have experience with losing their parent at such a young age and what do you think might help in this situation. 

Our family is incredibly close and quite large and I fear we are overwhelming him.

712,"A little backstory, I am 53 years old and I worked at a leading computer/printer company in the world as a senior sales director, I was over all of Latin America.

My finances have thankfully been great and I don’t really have debt, I was really just saving up as much as possible to retire as early as I can. Unfortunately, they have been doing massive layoffs and I was given the boot about a month ago after working there for 23 years. I saw it coming, and corporate America tends to shun people my age as well due to cheaper labor in younger employees.

I have a few rental properties for passive income, it’s not quite enough to live off, but I have plans to purchase more (I just need a little more savings to be comfortable with the purchase)

I was moved by the company from Florida to Idaho 3 years ago, after living in Florida for 14 years, and I have really enjoyed living here, the quality of life is good and it seems to be a city growing super fast. 

My end goal:

Live off rental income and afford to travel and chill (I’m 2/3rds of the way there).

My current options include: 

- open a franchise (currently looking at, and analyzing all sorts of options). 
Purposes for this would be to not have a direct boss, have more free time, and I would be doing this for a few years to enjoy doing something different, plus generate some sort of income. I would do this where I live now in Boise, Idaho. 

OR

- I have 60 days to find a job within the same company I worked at, I just got an offer today for a position paying fairly the same, the only thing is it’s in Houston, and I just moved to Idaho 3 years ago, and don’t really want to move, as I have really enjoyed living here. 
If I was to take it, I would probably fly back and forth on the weekends for the first 6-12 months, so my family (wife and 2 kids; one of which just moved back in with us 2 weeks ago, and the younger one just started his senior year in college) wouldn’t have to move as well, as they’re not in love with the idea. Then convince them to come or figure it out from there.

The benefits of this job, is that it’s a very good paying one, which would help me move closer to my retirement goal. And I would still keep my seniority with the company, so I still get the early retirement package for having worked there 20+ years. I just don’t want to move.

I also was pre approved for another somewhat large rental apartment purchase in November, and I’m worried that without having the job I was preapproved for the mortgage with in May, I won’t get it, and that will really mess with everything and set me into panic mode. But I’m not sure how lenient banks are to lend to technically unemployed people with decent savings.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Or things to consider? I’m completely torn about the idea of having to leave Boise, my oldest son just moved back in with us after 6 years of living literally thousands of miles apart and seeing each other 1-2 times a year, thinking we were going to be here for a medium-long term, and now the plan has unexpectedly changed and I hate the idea of leaving my otherwise happy family just because of a stupid job I would probably do for absolutely no more than 5 years. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any help is super appreciated. Thanks!",23Aug2019,1

714,"So a little back story I have a nephew who is now 8 years old. We have been having many many issues with him the last 4 years that involve my daughter who is now 6 years old. Things he’s done in the past involve , pushing her down the stairs intentionally, punching her, kicking her, pinching her etc. now that he has grown older he has been subjected to pornography, satan, rated R (extremely gruesome) and devil worshipping music. He also takes pills for behavior (ADHD) I guess, but my sister doesn’t give them to him. He has also been kicked out of a school already for behavior and bullying. 

Fast forward to June 2018. My mother has a yard sale and we all like to help out. All kids and parents involved. As the day goes on, the kids end up playing around in the yard. I noticed my nephew was throwing a frisbee into a tree. I walked over and realized that he was throwing it at a birds nest with baby birds inside. He ended up killing them both due to hitting it with the frisbee. There was no disciplinary action there. He blamed it on his sister who was not even near him. She was in the garage with us. 

Fast forward to thanksgiving 2018. We all end up at my parents house again to eat and have family time. After dinner we all sat down to relax and hang out. My daughter and my nephew went into the basement to play. Time goes on and it’s been quiet. So my husband now, fiancé at the time wanted to go check on them downstairs. He quietly sneaks down and looks through the glass pane window and noticed my nephew pacing around stacking all of his toys in a pile. He then catches him flipping off my daughter and that is when she notices him at the door. She yells in excitement  and runs towards the door. ( my nephew hasn’t noticed my husband yet) my nephew cocks his hand back like he was going to slap my daughters head off of her shoulders. That is when my fiancé busts through the door and in a stern voice says “ Don’t you fucking dare put a hand on her!”  He grabs my daughter and comes up stairs and tells me what happened. While my sister goes downstairs and coddles and protects her son. All while the father is sitting at the dinner table on his phone not doing anything about it. When my husband explains to everybody what had happened, instantly my sister became outraged. Calling my husband a psycho, and saying that nobody even saw what happened downstairs that her son would never do anything like that. Again no disciplinary action taken. We left immediately and cut communication from my sister and her family for about a year. 

Fast forward to June 2019. We reached out and reconnected trying to put the past behind us. Come August it’s my youngest daughters 1st birthday. We have the party at my mothers house and invite my sister, her family and some friends. My daughter has a girlfriend with her and they were all playing outside and my mom has a small cabin at her house. After the party ended my daughter came to me and told me that my nephew had asked all of the other children to leave the cabin so himself and my daughter could be alone. My daughter said he made a bed for them to “sleep” in because he wanted to play house with her. Naturally I was already pissed at the fact that he wanted to be alone in a room with her because my daughter and him have had these issues in the past. Stupid on my part to not watch her completely at the party. So I called my daughters friends mother that evening and her daughter confirmed the story and also told me that my nephew tried to get her to eat a berry off of my moms tree and he told her it could possibly kill her but she should try it anyways.

        So now I have confronted my sister and brother in law about the situation and all she did was attack me and call me horrible names and blaming this all on my daughter. She also contacted the police to make a statement because she has a guilty conscience about her son. I have cut all ties with my family because they all have taken my sisters side and tell me that this is “normal 8 year old boy behavior.” PLEASE please please give me advice or tips on what to do!!! Thank you for reading.",23Aug2019,2
715,"In recent times I’m not comfortable with who I’ve become. I’ve never really thought about who I am and I’ve no clue how to set out myself!

For example In sports and politics I have always had more than one favorite team/person but now I end up cheering/defending one team/person. 

In the past few months, me and SO have conflicting opinions on what’s best for our newborn so I have tried and given up on logical factual discussions and am now pretty much giving out orders. I’m highly uncomfortable with this but there seems to be no other way to change my SO’s behaviour about little things like steaming a feeding bottles in stead of just washing it with tap water.

I also used to be someone who’d go against personal preference and go with the group thought around me. In the past few months I’ve noticed I’ve been taking a stand but I’m not comfortable with confrontation even though I find myself in such situations quite often because of taking a stand against the group thought around me. 

That said, I fear losing my friends, so I still try and find the middle ground. I recently figured that due to my upbringing I used to feel entitled to things and expected friends and strangers to people me out. I also procrastinate a lot and I’m lazy but I mostly manage to get the job done. 

How do I figure out who I am, how to be more mature at life and get comfortable with who I’ve become/becoming?

716,"As the title says. I last self harmed over 10 years ago, got the help I needed and life was good. 

A couple of months ago, my anxiety takes a nosedive again and I’m back in therapy and back on medication. 

It started out with just a few thoughts here and there that I could ignore. I hated the thoughts and they scared me and obviously I didn’t want to hurt myself because why on earth would I do that?

Then, a few months ago, I bought alcohol (I don’t normally drink and haven’t for a couple of years) and got wasted and ended up hurting myself. It was only minor, but it was noticeable unfortunately. 

Since then, it’s been only an occasional thought and I’ve been able to let it happen and then move on with my day and occupy my time doing something else. 

But tonight, at this very moment, I have an object next to me and all I can think of doing is hurting myself with it and feeling that release. 
I don’t want to think this way, I don’t want anyone to know I’m feeling like this and I want the anxiety to just stop!

I’ve tried so many things to make these thoughts and feelings go away and despite my best efforts, they haven’t worked. What else can I do?",23Aug2019,1
717,"*First I want to point out that this post will seem somewhat sloppily written. My thoughts will sound disjointed at times. I’m very tired as I’m writing this and I’m having to type it on a phone.*

I’m going to be 27 two days. I still live with my parents. I work a 9-5 and make only 11 an hour. I was super depressed throughout college and could never bring myself to try and make anything out of my degree. A lot of my free time is spent watching YouTube or playing games. 

My parents and I get along very well. We watch movies together; talk together, laugh together. They seem fine with me being here. I also have a severely disabled brother. He’s 37 but he has the mental age of, roughly, two or three. I mention this because it’s one of the reasons - along with money - that I can’t move out. It would put a huge burden on my parents. Watching him more often than not just involves being in the house with him since he’s not prone to get in to any trouble. But we can’t leave him along at the house. So any time someone wants to go somewhere we have to make sure someone will be there for my brother. 

There’s a huge stigma against living with your parents at this age where I live. I suppose it could be worse. But it’s a very conservative part of the US and everyone likes to give their stories about how they left the house not a moment later than the age of 18, struggled super hard but came out on top. And anyone who doesn’t struggle like they did just has it easy and is somehow part of the problem. Good for them. And I mean that. But I feel stuck in life and I’m not sure how much of my own failures are to blame. And I wonder if those people saying it’s a problem that I live with my parents are right. I’m weighed down by the scrutiny of others. My extended family (aunts and uncles) don’t seem to think too highly of me either. They were married and living in a nice house by age 20, and rant and rave about why millennials aren’t doing the same thing. My parents, brother, and sister, have always made me feel at home though. I’m grateful for that. 

I work. I pay my own car and health insurance. I bought my own phone. I pay for the data. I buy my own clothes. I buy food for the household every Friday, and sometimes more throughout the week. I can at the very least say I don’t just sit around doing absolutely nothing. However as I said my free time is largely consumed by YouTube, anime, or games of all varieties. If someone watched that part of my life they’d assume I’m just some NEET who wastes his life away on front of a computer screen. But maybe I am a NEET in a sense. 

I keep thinking back on what I could have done different in life. There’s a huge list of things. My depression in college was so bad I could hardly function some days. But Im telling myself these days that maybe I should have just tried harder, sucked it up and all that.

I’m overwhelmingly awkward. I’ve been at this job for over 2 years and I still can’t bring myself to talk to anyone. I sort of walk up to them if I need anything, mumble their name or just stand there till they notice me. Ive grown to hate myself over how I still can hardly function out in the world. They treat me as the designated quiet guy. “Hey how come you’re so quiet” and all that. It gets tiring day after day. 

On one hand I’d love to date. On the other hand I wouldn’t want to put a woman through that. Sometimes I can’t even tell what my own motivations are. So I’d hate to just date someone for comfort. My last girlfriend was in high school 11 years ago. I tried to date here and there but in my 20’s I just decided I wasn’t boyfriend material. Besides...idk...would a woman even want to date a 27 y/o guy living with his parents? I mean maybe they would, I’m not trying to speak on behalf of anyone. But I’ve always heard the answer to that question being “no”. 

I’m not sure where I’m going with all this other than to just say that my life has been well enough, I guess, but it just feels lacking. I feel trapped. I feel useless. Should I be ashamed of this life? Part of me thinks I should aim higher. Another part thinks this is just what was meant to be.",23Aug2019,1
718,"This is a throw away account, I don’t want people to think that I am writing this for karma. 

I’m a sophomore in high school (15m) and I never felt like I had problems making friends. Freshman year I went to this high school knowing no one, I was extremely nervous but throughout time I made some friends. Skip to this year and now it seems like no one is interested in me, I’ve stopped doing drugs because it seemed like people were only using me. Turns out I was right. All I’m left with are my “geek” friends that I would rather never talk to. I’ve never really tried approaching a girl and starting small talk with them because either they are talking to their friends or the small talk never goes anywhere and they forget about me the next day. Whenever I try to talk some people I know to try and get a friendship started, they start talking to someone else and forget everything I say and ignore me while talking to them, meaning that they just walk up and drop any conversation I was having with them and start talking to them and if I try to renter that conversation they just completely ignore me. No one ever approaches me, I always have to approach them. No one is interested in me. I’m 15 and this one of the very few times I have considered suicide, all the stresses gone, the school work, trying to make friends. I want to so bad but I don’t want to make my parents sad and I also don’t have the balls to, yet. I’m just so sick of this shit. I know life gets better, so they say. I’m good at school and have a good work ethic but what’s the point of all of that if I’m never going to get married, or make friends? That’s the way it feels right now and seems like the probably outcome. I’m so sick of this shit.

I tried to just ignore him, even saying ""why do you need to know?"" and ""I don't want to talk about it"". He kept asking things like ""how many girls have you slept with?"" Or ""what was so-and-so like?"". The assistant just egged him on.

Sex is kinda a personal topic for me. I feel like it should be between me and whoever I'm doing it with. I didnt appreciate how this guy kept pushing for information. Should I report him to HR, or just write it off as 'guy talk'",23Aug2019,2

721,"My friends and I (16 - 17) were planning on having a party at a parents house while they're away and drinking there because why not? At first I was really excited, but the party is tomorrow now and I just don't feel right about it.

My friends and I have always been the more responsible kids in school, we all get good grades and everyone stays out of trouble. I want to believe everyone will just chill out and drink a little, without getting drunk, because if I go I certainly don't plan on getting drunk.

I asked my brother to drive me to and from the party today and he seems reluctant as well. I should add that my parents are also away this weekend. 

I don't want to skip it because I might miss out on some fun and regret it later, or be made fun of (though I don't think my friends would do that). But I also don't want to go and do something I'll regret. What should I do?",23Aug2019,0
722,"I have my own startup I’m working on but i joined this other  one simply to get a paycheck, but then i realized how much i can learn from the CEO and how much I’ll grow learning from this other startup. 

But with one evening job, this startup, and my startup and the gym, i find myself being absolutely exhausted by days end.  The CEO has given some daunting tasks and seems to bicker at me if it’s not completed or done throughly. Seems contradicting as a person as well. I know it’s a lot more than i can handle. But I’m trying to overcome the stress. 5 days a week, not sure what to do.

723,"Everyday that I come home from school, I'm so incredibly irritable and up tight that it hurts. Everyday school completely sucks the life out of me and it's mainly because of being forced into social situations and so, but the minute I'm home, everyone wants to bother me about whatever the hell it is. Everyday after school, I'm left just sitting on my phone trying to keep my mind off of everything, but it's honestly becoming way too much.

725,"Ok so this is a long one. About two years ago a friend of a friend started working at the same company as me. We became friends, I introduced her to one of my closest friends they’re now a very happy couple.

Fast forward a couple of months and I get the distinct feeling this girl doesn’t like me. A look here and there, and what seemed to be one sided effort on my part to keep the friendship going. 

Now this could be a complete coincidence but I think it’s important to note that her apparent dislike of me increased around the same time I decided to work on myself. Lost like 30 pounds, became happy within myself after coming out of a depression and began a relationship with very handsome foreign guy.

Fast forward another couple of months and we’re out for drinks. We’re talking deep after a couple of beers and I tell her there’s no need to hate on herself. She often makes derogatory statements about her figure or personality. I tell her I’ve noticed and that she should concentrate on the act she’s got good friends, a great bf and she should believe in herself. Well shit, I should have said nothing. She essentially spends the next few months bullying me at work. Dirty looks, walking away when I’m around, ignoring me over lunch all the while being really warm and sweet when we’re in our group of mutual friends. I heard back that she had interpreted my pep talk as ‘I know you’re fake, I see right through you’ 

It’s also worth a note that during this time her boyfriend and I lost contact. We used to be the best of friends.

This obviously messed with my head. I couldn’t figure out what was going on, spent a long time questioning myself and thinking I’d done something terrible. 

Long story short, our mutual friends have not believed me throughout this. I’ve tried to confide in them as they’ve known me longer and it’s been a pretty stressful situation. They’ve told me I’m either paranoid, or need to get over that some people just don’t get along. I’ve tried explaining that I have no issue with clashing personalities but this is bullying. 

I want to tell them that I’m really disappointed in the way they’ve handled this. I didn’t want anyone to take sides but they clearly have. I recently messaged this girl trying to clear the air and she fobbed me off. My ‘friends’ scolded me for trying to start more drama. I also just broke up with my boyfriend and I’ve had close to zero support from them. 

It’s all very confusing. 

TL;DR I’ve somehow got a bully in my twenties and my friends have offered no support. I want to let them know I feel let down by this.",23Aug2019,1
726,"So basically long story short, me and this girl have a history, never romantic but we've always had a lot of chemistry, the timing never really was right for us to be in a relationship together. Crazy part is that i've never ever felt this way about a girl pretty much ever. I hadn't spoken to her for quite some time and then had an oppurtunity to talk to her again, expecting it to just be friendly, and assumed i for sure didn't have the feelings i had years back. After spending a day with her i realized that these feelings never really went away. Her presence just makes me happy, she's not even really my type in terms of looks (she's pretty just not like a 9/10 or anything like that) but being around her just makes me feel happy. It's the kind of schoolyard crush sort of thing that I sort of thought i was incapable of ever having..

Anyways, the issue now is that despite our chemistry and my feelings towards her, she still currently has a boyfriend, they're long distance at the moment however i can tell she's in love with him. But there are times when i feel like there's no way she doesn't feel at least SOMETHING for me. 

A little bit of context, back when we were younger, she also had another boyfriend when we became close (this one sucked though, he was a dick. the one she has now is good to her and has his shit together) and i made it clear to her how i felt, she told me basically in summary that she had thought about it but she wasn't going to leave him for me. That was when our relationship kinda dwindled and i separated from her for my sake.

Now, in the present i'm sort of in a predicament. I have a lot of strong feelings for this girl, i would even go as far to say that i love her, i genuinely care a lot about her even if we weren't romantically involved. But the only problem is being around her while not being with her really bums me out. It's like i'm incapable of having a normal friendship her because of how strongly i feel about her. We're talking a lot again, and i'm feeling super conflicted. On one hand my feelings are undeniable and i feel like our chemistry is strong, but on the other she has a great boyfriend, and i'm not sure if i should be selfish and try to disturb that just because of my feelings. Also i'm not 100% if she feels remotely the same.

727,"Okay so I am a Realtor and I have a listing for an apartment for rent. I get a call by someone who wanted to see it.  I had the owner open the door for him and told him to call me after viewing it for feedback. He says ""So call you after I move my stuff in?"" I said well that's not how it works. If you like it, you can put in an application along with proof of income, credit check, etc. So he says OK and we hang up. Next thing I know I get a call from the owner saying they are moving things into the apartment. At this point I'm already almost there and I call them up pretty angry because I specifically told them NOT to move in there. They told me they were from China and they recently gotten accepted into a University nearby and need a place asap. They only have 1300 dollars with no job or other way to pay. Upon arrival, my anger turned into me feeling horrible for them. They were sitting outside the apartment with  a bunch of boxes that were shipped from China, and suitcases. They were so young, maybe 18-20. Two girls and one guy. I asked them how they planned to pay for future rent, they didnt know yet. They had all these boxes with them so I asked how they got there and they explained that an uber dropped them off. I asked if they had anywhere to stay, they answered no. Anywhere to go? No.. I felt so bad and I didnt know what to do. I didnt want to leave them there but they were clearly embarrassed and insisted they'd be okay. I said I can give them a ride they declined. I just felt so bad leaving them there and I can't get them off my mind. They looked so lost. I just want to help them so bad but I just dont know what to do. Should I start a GoFundMe or something? I feel horrible. I wish I had more space I'd let them stay with me until they're on there feet. I just dont feel like anyone will rent them an apartment due to them being so unstable at this point. I can tell they will make it, they are so smart. But I just feel for them. I can't imagine being dropped in a foreign country with nothing but boxes and 1300 dollars with no where to go.

730,"TLDR:

- I'm overworked as the only developer for a small company

- My bosses can't remember my recommendations for longer than a week

- I'm worried that their poor decisions would hurt my reputation


I'm working as a programmer for a small company that supplies hardware and software to a niche market. I taught myself how to program, and I'm approaching my second or third year as a programmer for them. The code base I started off with was likewise written by someone who was learning as they went. So our main products have poor version control, and even poorer overall design. There's always a push to add on a new feature or offer a new product. 


As our customer base has grown, its gotten harder and harder for me to maintain current product, make new product to be sold, and develop new features. Back in December of last year, I told my boss I'd reached my limit; that I was physically incapable of doing Everything he was asking me to do. I created a document and outlined all the shiny things that he and the sales team were requesting, everything in our systems that needed to be fixed (including security risks), and what solutions were at our disposal to solve which solutions. He didn't know our main programming language very well, but he had other knowledge that was very useful. 


Within maybe two months, I got to pick from two canidatates. Both recent CS graduate students. I picked the one that I thought would be the better fit for us, and would help us out in the coming changes. 
However, not long after bringing the new guy on, it was made top priority that we finalize this other new product that the bosses son cobbled together in his free time. 
So, there went 5 months trying to make that Frankenstein code base work well enough to be something we could sell. I was promised that the new product would generate revenue long enough for us to be able to focus on these concerns that I have had... but instead there were a handful of embellishments it needed for it to Really sell.
Fast forward another 2 months: I've finished the heavy lifting for creating the new product with the new features, while the new guy has redone our customer site, helped develop in house scripts to use as tools, and been a useful partner in discussing and planning how we go about rewriting the codebase to do everything the sales team wants it to do. We work on in house stuff, and try to produce results, but given that they're abstract concepts and intangible results (software results when the boss is a hardware guy), the boss wasn't as please as he wanted to be. He interpreted my stress as the new guy not pulling his weight, when it was in fact him and the sales team constantly making a promise, and then reneging.


For example, those goal posts for where the new guy and I get to refactor and clean up the spaghetti code and fix security issues, gets sent back into January of the next year, because the main product doesn't have the features he wanted it to have, and we've got new competitors gaining on us. I'm not happy about it, but if its a choice between keeping the doors open, or fixing the issues... then I guess I'll have to make those features happen.


Meanwhile, my wife convinces me to apply for an online Masters course in Machine Learning, and I'm waiting to hear their decision. I got recommendations from my boss, a coworker, and a professor I worked for a couple years ago. If I'm accepted, that'll be roughly $7000 expense to pay for two years of courses. With it being an online course, I figured I could manage now that I had help with my job. 


Fast forward up to last week: the boss wants a demo of an in house tool that should show us the status of our customers products, helping us trouble shoot their issues, and hopefully be proactive at catching those issues. The boss wants to see if the display updates runtime after rebooting a customers controller. I recommend calling the customer and making sure someone is on site first, but he goes ahead and restarts it remotely anyway. It didn't come back up. So he's not happy and has to either send a tech out to fix it, or get a hold of someone on site (the latter happened in this case). Again, he wants to see it update, so he tries Another controller without calling ahead. This one goes down too. I think he managed to get a hold of a customer on site to fix this one too. 


So, the boss mans not happy, and he thinks the new guy isn't pulling his weight (when really, he's been doing the intangible R&amp;D leg work so he didn't have to struggle to learn our spaghetti all at once), since this new tool doesn't look like it's working. He takes him aside for a private conversation, and when they come back into the office, HE'S MAKING HIM CLEAR OUT HIS DESK. 


After the new guy leaves, I have to patch our new security risks (as well as I could...), and Then meet with the boss about why he was being fired. I explained how he was doing good work, that I believed the tool was working, and all of my other feelings on the issue that I'd be back to being the only programmer. He explains that since we couldn't get him the new features he wanted in the timeframe he wanted, he was instead going to outsource it; don't ask me how he expects an outsider to develop a feature for us and have it integrate nicely into our spaghetti... The boss man has the gall to ask for me to hang on for three more months, while he finds outside help. 



If I quit today, I'd imagine they'd go under. If I gave them my two weeks notice, they might find someone to do my job, but its a dice roll for whether they could learn and adapt to our spaghetti code fast enough. Not to mention, I doubt they'd find anyone that could do EVERYTHING that they try to get me to do. 


I'd say that I like the people here, and they're generally all good people, but I can't keep doing this to myself:

* I'm tired of working 8-10 hour days. 

* I'm tired of being the only person that can fix a customer's product in the off-hours.

* I'm tired of being promised where the goal posts are, only for them to be moved two weeks later.

* I'm tired of telling them what NEEDS to happen, what we SHOULD be doing, and having it forgotten soon after. 

* I'm tired of predicting issues, not being allowed to fix them ahead of time, and then dealing with the aftermath. 


What do I do? Is there anyway to get them to understand? Or should I start job hunting in anticipation of our company not being able to keep up?",23Aug2019,2

732,"sorry for confusing post, im just really confused myself. for reference, im diagnosed with major depressive disorder, ocd, and anxiety. i have a history of self harm and suicidal tendencies. trigger warning for all of those.

ive always been an introvert. i loved being alone and sometimes around a friend or two, but i needed to recharge very often. being alone was never an issue.

for some reason, the last few weeks ive needed to be with my only close friend or my mom. whenever theyre even in a different room i get incredibly depressed and relapse into self harm and suicidal thoughts. when im with them, for the most part, im fine. its incredibly strange and my only theory is that i started prozac a month or so ago, but i cant really imagine how that leads to me not wanting to be alone? the only other effects ive noticed of it is more energy and better sleep, which is obviously good.

what do i do? i dont want to constantly be with someone (well i mean i do, but i dont want to ask that of them, thats be outrageous and selfish), but i also feel like much more of this and it could escalate. any little thing makes me consider suicide, and i dont know what i should do.",23Aug2019,1

734,"I’m not sure if it matters but throughout this entire summer I’ve been willing to take days off from work to spend time with my friends so we can do the summer plans we’ve been planning and getting hyped up for all throughout our senior year. They haven’t been really willing to do the same as they say money is a little tight and that they are busy a lot . I’d hate to sound like a rude person by saying this, I completely understand the money situation and I truly hope that things turn up alright, on the other hand, please forgive me I’m sounding selfish but i certainly don’t have all the money in world and I’m certainly not free 24/7 but I was willing to take days off from work in order to do said plans. I feel like I’ve been putting a lot of effort into our friendships by trying so hard to do stuff and they don’t seem willing to reciprocate. 

Last night I asked them they were willing to go a water park that I have been wanting to go with them for a long time. Long story short they indirectly said no and an argument ensued between the three of us. I 

After the argument was over, one of the friends apologized and said that he understood where I was coming from. He suggested that we go to the mall because it would be cheaper for him. I said yes.

Looking back, I want to say something as I’m curious as to why he was he was willing to go the mall but not the water park. The mall is only 10 min away but it wouldn’t matter as I was willing to drive all of us to the water park. Also, it costs only 35 bucks to get it the water park. I’m sure shopping at the mall would cost easily 3 times more that spending a day at the water park. Keep in mind that the park is only seasonal and closes in like 2 weeks. We could go shopping at the mall any other time. 

Do you guys think I’m trying too hard and being selfish about this? Do you guys think it’s worth saying something? Like I said I  wholeheartedly get that work and money can be an obstacle but I don’t think one day would hurt that much. I also don’t think it’s right of them to make up excuses or to avoid the question when I asked them if I wanted to go.",23Aug2019,1
735,"I just finished my first week of high school, and boy oh boy did it not go as I had hoped. To start things off I have looked unusually bad this week, I like to think of myself as average but this week I felt like an actual bag of crap. Monday was bad, tuesday was pretty good, I spoke to most of the people in my class and I developed a crush on one of the girls in my class, but now I find myself in sort of a dead end. 

You see, most people have already made friends by now in my class (15 people) and I really haven't. Tuesday I spoke to almost all of the guys in my class, as well as that one girl. But now I really only talk to one person, another guy in my class who has already made another friend who he hangs out with more. I would talk to them both if I had an opportunity to, but everytime I'm about to say something I just can't. Not only that, but in my school there aren't really any places to sit with more than two seats.

That's not to mention that on fridays and thursdays, two thirds of my class have different schedules so they all leave earlier. This makes it a lot harder for me to approach my crush, which I've been wanting to do for three days now, because she's either not at school, I feel like crap, or she's with her friend.

The problem is snapchat, we still have a streak and we regularly send each other snaps. Plus I can watch her stories and everything. 

Now I’m not sure how to go on about removing her from over there. I can either just remove her and be done with it. And hope it doesn’t cause any drama. Or I can just keep sending generic snaps and try not to open the snaps she sends or watch her story.   

Lastly, I think she won’t notice if I removed her from Snapchat. I usually get generic snaps that she sends to everyone. Plus we don’t have any other interaction on Snapchat other than sending each other one snap a day to ensure the streak doesn’t break. 

Any advice would be really really helpful? P",23Aug2019,1

Somebody told me that regular classes bring down your GPA if you’re taking honors classes, which I now know is true.

749,"First and foremost I admit blame in this so that is not the question. I was divorced in 2007. I have not dated, been more than social, looked twice at another woman after my divorce. My wife was right to divorce me. I was an addict for over 27 years. Everything I touch turns to shit. So I was happy being alone. In 2017 my mother died. I was clean the last 8 years. In 2018 I began smoking weed again. I was a much much worse addict before. The weed is much stronger now. But I have no friends now. I had a bunch of recovery friends but they won't smoke weed.  What to do? 
 
I get the app. High There  and check it out . It was crap. It basically was just a bunch of kids looking to buy weed. I talked to a few people and 1 girl from California was in Columbia going to college there. An hour  away  so no worries. I go  and she bails. No show. I was angry but eventually things got straighten out. We sent a few texts but nothing really. So I think who else gets high? I'm an old man  - escorts. I meet a girl. I get high. I'm nervous and 50. If I service her I'll be damned but I don't get paid. We don't do anything else I can't. Too nervous 


Time goes by and out of the blue one morning I get a phone call from the girl from Columbia. She had moved out and tried to move in with another person but they brought her to a motel 6 and were doing heroin. They stole her stuff and she was stranded. This poor girl was just here for a few weeks and wow was left out in the cold what do you do?

I went and got her. Now what?  A 20 year old and a 50 year old. I tell her I can get her a room but I don't know what that would do. So yes I know I took her home. We were perfect. We smoked we cooked I took her all over. When we first met again me and my damn tongue. But I didn't do it but she let me do that and I'm sorry but it usually means something when you do that. I got attached quickly and we were open she said 6 months but she still let me caress her. I was a mess.


It's not about me though. I didn't know what she had going on? I'm confused I'm not a boyfriend I'm allowed to caress her we are just friends. She is always on a her phone maybe I'm not sure. I didn't know what the hell. I vented to the escort that I had seen. She vanished. 

I didn't put 2 and 2 together. I am totally to blame as I stated. But I would have never thrown her out I just sent some text messages. Anyway one thing the reason she had left California is because her previous boyfriend tried to strangle her with a bag. I am trying frantically to find her and the only stuff I have is a phone number. 

She sends me a text a week or so later and says she was trying to be my friend and referenced a text. Then blocked from everything.. I just saw yesterday that on her Facebook she was already back in California and in a a relationship with her ex.  Before she even sent me the text. 

I just want her happy and it won't be with me that's for sure but I don't understand why we can't be friends? We actually had a great time together. She is funny 

I have lost everyone. My ex and son don't communicate with me. My mother is dead. I don't talk to my brother and I just have my dad. I know I being selfish but do you think there's a way to fix this?",23Aug2019,3
750,"My SO and I moved into this complex 3 weeks ago, one selling point being well insulated walls/carpet so that we shouldn’t be able to hear upstairs neighbors. Since our move in day, every single day, all throughout the day, it sounds like our neighbors are dropping bowling balls on their floor until around 11pm when they finally go to sleep.

Yesterday they were causing our entire apartment to shake by running a washing machine that sounded like it was extremely overstuffed (we could hear it over our tv and it lasted until around 9pm. I recorded it) and this morning it seems their laundry had broken something in the walls that caused water to flood down into our apartment. I had to go upstairs at 8am and ask them to stop doing laundry so that the water could stop pouring into our hallway, only to be given a blank stare and it not to be turned off for another hour. Maintenance is currently handling the damage done.

We tried bringing up this problem to the office and were told “we’ll call you later today”, only to not hear back from them at all. We are on a 18 month lease.

752,"Context: Recently turned 18 f, I work at a Chick-fil-a and entering senior year of high school. (Early birthday, never been held back.)

So recently (about a month) I requested a raise at my job. My 1-year is on December 6th, but i’ve noticed our owner handing out raises to those who rise to the plate. I have a disabled mother and a 13 year old sister, so I figured eh what the heck, I’ll give it a shot. Low and behold, I got a promotion to “Team Captain.”

I talked to 3/5 managers before the promotion was official and they all agreed I definitely deserved one. I didn’t talk to the other two, one of which is the Manager in question (MIQ).

I got my promotion about a week ago officially and ever since then, the MIQ seems to be making my life a living hell. I threw up at work on a Tuesday because I forced myself to go when I was sick. I decided i didn’t want to get others sick so I asked to be sent home about 30 min early, and the MIQ called me “unreliable” and “untrustworthy” in front of the customers.

On Wednesday after resting up I felt better and came in to work. the MIQ was running breaks. I got diagnosed with Chronic Tension Migraines at age 14, and I take a medicine when I feel it coming on before it gets worse and it begins to cripple my work. 
After a lunch rush, I quietly tell my coworkers i’ll be back and i run to the bathroom to take my medicine. I pop the pull, drink some tap and come back. The MIQ demands to know where I was, I said taking medicine, and she shakes her head and heaves, “You are expected to stay at your position until your break. You can’t run off wherever the hell you want.” I wasn’t gone for more than 45 seconds.

On Thursday the MIQ wasn’t working, and I got complimented by the owner on my speedy bagging skills and my interactions with the customers (prior to my promotion I got three hand-written compliments.)

And finally today, friday. It’s the peak of lunch rush and i’m secondary bagger next to the MIQ. She asks me to run a mobile-curbside order that she says has been sitting there awhile. I take the bag and begin to put all requested sauces in there when patrons begin coming up asking for refills. I strain a smile and nod, getting 4+ people refills. Its policy to NEVER say no or make a patron wait after they’ve gotten your attention. In the middle of one, I ask a team member who doesn’t seem busy to run out the curbside I had finished but hadn’t run outside yet. My thought process was, if my team member wasn’t busy, I wanted to make sure the person outside didn’t have to wait longer than necessary. After refills, I return to MIQ, who demands to know why I didn’t run it. I simply said, “I asked Joe to,” which admittedly is a pretty bad response. She says she obviously can’t trust me with even the simplest of tasks and tells me to just run register the rest of the day. I explain to her what happened but it didn’t seem like she cared to listen.

What should I do? I’m at a loss. I’m terrified that this manager is going to make me lose my promotion, and the monetary raise is much needed because now my father doesn’t have to pay child support. A lot is riding on this job.",23Aug2019,2

761,"Alright, so I'm 18/F. The cowowkrer in question is a girl who is about to turn 18 herself, and for a little while I sort of considered her a friend. She has a tendency to go to far with playing around, and will often insult people and call it a joke later. 

Now I don't really entertain her much, because most social situations just confuse me at work. I'll be trying to do my job(McDonalds), and then all of a sudden people will start getting aggravated with me because I'm not doing anything to help the front when I'm supposed to be in the back taking orders. It's a little weird, but apparently she got aggravated with me for it afterwards because she kept trying to get me to do things, and if I didn't do it immediately she'd sit there and get more frustrated. She is in no position to be telling me what to do like that, she's not a manager. It would've been different had she just asked instead of demanding I do it. 

The above is kind of irrelevant, just to give some context to what was happening. She later apologized saying she didn't mean to be mean or anything, and I told her it was ok and that I understood her frustration. 

But then something weird happened, I had to go to the bathroom to take a shit. I've had a few incidents at work where I just broke down and started crying out of frustration/stress, and she was there the last time. It honestly isn't a frequent thing for me, and only happens when I've got a lot of personal stuff going on because I just get overwhelmed with literally everything. My managers are understanding. But it seems like every time I go to the bathroom, they think I'm either crying, or trying to get out of doing work. Which, no, I just had to take a shit. But this same coworker followed me into the bathroom, just to ask if I was pooping and to tell me to hurry up. I told her I wasn't done and to go away. She came back a second time, and I told her to go away again. 

When I was finished, she was the first to say anything and she started teasing me. ""It's about time!"" And then she got closer to me, and started asking if I had a boyfriend. It was a weird change of topic, but I shrugged it off. But then her dialogue went something like this, and I hadn't even said anything: 

""Hey, do you have a boyfriend? Is [friend] your boyfriend?"" 

""Um..no?"" 

""Oh so do you like girls? Do you think you'd ever date me?"" 

And again, I told her no. 

To which, she started laughing, and started to move away. But as she moved away, she got closer for a split second, and literally grabbed my ass and holy shit I do not appreciate it. It was pretty uncomfortable for me, and I'm not sure she was really joking because it wasn't funny to me. 

This same girl always seems to be picking on me, and I'm never in on the joke. It's small stuff that I just shrug off, because when I do stand up for myself I get told I'm too mean, and that I have an attitude problem. But I'm just not sure at all how to feel, or what to do if it happens again.",23Aug2019,5
762," 

Hey guys,

so, I am kind of in a difficult situation. It would be too much to start at the beginning, but if you are interested there may be a small post in my profile about it.

The thing is that the situation with my parents didn't get any better; my father recently broke my mother's tailbone, they are still constantly fighting, beating each other, insulting each other since 30 years probably. My father denies what he did, tells me that my mother has beaten herself to get him into jail. But I also know how my mother can be; he assaulted him so many times, on a physical and mostly mental level. He abused me mentally when I was still living with my parents, too, and my father was very passive all the time. Since I moved out, those fights got worse. But they never made a serious attempt to change this situation. It's still the same.

Both my parents try to win me over to their side; telling me that either my mother or my father is just lying and making everything up, telling me how manipulative, impulsive and terrible the other person is.

Mostly my mother tries to make demands. She often wants to spend time with me, I listen to her problems, she calls me. I also wrote a resume and a motivational letter for her so that she can find another job (she's has a restaurant with my father). She basically wants me to be responsible for her. I try my best, but I am just not enough and I feel like I need alot of space for myself. And I just feel suffocated. Since three weeks I can't barely breathe, I am in a constant state of panic. I just don't know what to do and how to behave. I just feel so helpless. But it feels like I am not allowed to feel that way and keep it all in because my parents have it worse and I just feel so sorry for them. Mostly for my mother.

This situation probably won't get better. It never did. And I feel like I am the only person who can make it better and change something about it. It feels like I need to make those decisions for my parents. 

What to do?

TL;DR I feel like my parents - who are in a constant conflict - want me to be responsible for their decisions and for their well being. I don't know what to do about it and how to help them.",23Aug2019,2

I have absolutely no issues getting approached by guys or being asked out. I live in New York City and there are so many opportunities for me here in terms of dating around, but I am not interested in getting to know a single person and I can’t figure out why? I even use dating apps to further put myself out there instead of just meeting at bars, but I still don’t even care to continue a conversation even if I find someone attractive. It’s like I only like guys that are in different states from me. For example, when I was in college I met this guy that became a friends with benefits situation for about a year. I “was in love” with him but only when I knew I was transferring back home to New York for my junior year of college. I talked to him for YEARS, literally, and we finally ended things back in October 2018 because there was no point. Another more recent example is this guy who I met on vacation in May 2018. He lives four hours away from me in Boston, and he’s the only guy that’s even taken my attention off the first guy. It’s very odd because it didn’t necessarily stop me from talking to guys that are within reach. I’ll go on the occasional date and hook up with guys, but there is such an emotional connection to those guys and for everyone else it’s extremely ... surface level. It’s like if I have the slightest interest in someone close to me, and then they reciprocate I’m over it. I’m not sure who I can turn to to talk about this with or if it’s some type of complex I have.

Hey all I'm back with another question what advice from a weightlifter or poeple who have bulked successfully. 


And please note I don't believe In taking stuff like creatine and shakes that's shit stupid. I want to build it 100% natural blood sweat and tears. 

Without taking any enhancements or anything like that.


My understanding of It Is this.

If you want to gain muscle and wieght you gave to wieghtlift alot don't run often or for long.


And you have to eat like 7-12 meals a day designed for bulking up. 


I've heard the rock for instance I don't know if its true will eat loads before and after workouts and in normal time?


Question= Is thier anything cheap and easy you can bulk up on and have lots of?


So you have like 4 main meals a day designed for gaining muscle and weight. 


And you eat loads a few hours before and a few hours after the workout. 



And training wise I can only think of like this using different wieght sna d different techniques.


For example I once asked someone I knew how 59 cent for example looks so musclely. And she said he probably spends 5 hours total time In the Gym. So he probs wieght lifts from 9am til 7pm taking long breaks and doing repetitions.



So for example If you ate 10 meals a day designed for gaining weight and bulking up. 


Got 6-7 hours sleep a night. 



And spent as much free time In the gym 10-20 hours a week per say would you gain alot of muscle. 




Can someone educate me on this?",23Aug2019,1
784,"So I (16M) am friends with this guy who goes to my church (23M) we'll call him Cole, we've hung out on and off from time to time, I introduced him to one of my best friends Bailey (15F). Now the day that I introduced her to him he started acting weird around her; trying to hug her, be alone with her, calling her sis and just generally making her uncomfortable. I was a bit uneasy about this so I made sure to stay close to her and made sure he didn't try anything. Fast forward a few hours and we are at the local nerd shop and were just playing some Video games, when Bailey started to not feel so good, she went outside for some fresh air and Cole offered to go with her, and left me in the shop for about half an hour, after a while I'm a bit concerned so I went outside and their just talking so I suspected nothing. Well after the night was done, Bailey called me and told me that Cole had offered to ""drive her home and leave me at the shop.' she refused and they kept talking. Bailey at some point told me that she showed a friend of hers, who we'll call Kayla(17F) a picture of me, Bailey, Cole and his now Ex-girlfriend riding in his truck together. immediately she started talking about how he was creepy and attempted to ask her out and date her with the full knowledge she was underage, in high school, a lesbian and in a relationship already. However, the main part of this happened about 5 months later, when a mutual friend of me and cole came up to me and said that she is no longer talking with him because he tried to r@pe her, she is 14, because of what he's done in the past I have reason to believe her but I'm not going to throw out accusations until I get the full story. But besides that here's my main question, he and his girlfriend (19), who have been in a consensual relationship for about 4 months, should I tell her about his ""Tendencies"" or should I just stay out of and hope Cole doesn't do anything to her?",23Aug2019,6

I have never opened up to them and this was the first time I ever told them about something going on in my life.

With certain circumstances the insurance company would be obligated to disregard the step therapy route. Like : the person was put on black box warning drugs that did not work and attempted suicide. Would that not be enough for the insurance company to stop the “step therapy” route?

804,"Hello!

I just recently moved to the city of my dreams to go to graduate school at a school with the program of my dreams. I start Monday, and had my first day at a new job today, so everything is all set and is wonderful and great.

I am, however, feeling the effects of leaving behind what I had built over the course of many years.

I moved from a city I didn't like living in (went to college in this city), left friends (some who were staying, a lot of my closest were also leaving or planning on it within the next year or so...), left a job that wasn't my endgame and wasn't at all in my field... so of course, everything seems great.

But recently I've been feeling sort of down and feeling like I left something behind, even though I didn't. I am having a hard time moving on from who I was and where I was and setting myself on my future.

I think a lot of my down-ness comes from social media and seeing old friends post on social media and all the ""fun"" they are having in my old home (duh, social media is the root of a lot of problems, I know).

So I guess what I'm asking is how do you move on and look forward instead of backwards after a big, huge, voluntary life change? How do you deal with a sort of sadness knowing your life can go on without you?",23Aug2019,2

Now there are **two things,** *every fucking thing seems slow to me with normal speed, in shows obviously and so I can't watch any live things or something which comes up in TV because those feels boring.* The second thing is good tbh, *I can read or catch any fucking text or something I listen faster than anyone else.*

807,"I have a history of problems with my family, which I won't get into but from events that have happened in my past, I know suffer from CPTSD. However, this is just asking for advice about my mother who is making me want to cut off contact with her and my entire family (when I do leave, she probably would be the final straw  anyway) I do plan on leaving my family at some point but that somepoint isn't for a while and I just need some help and advice on how to deal with her so I don't rip my hair out and leave before I'm ready.
My mom suffers from depression and all that jazz and I accompany her on a lot of the same issues so I do know what it's like to get through a day and I can and have excused a lot of things she's done but it's getting to the point where I can't take it anymore. She'll do various things such as;

Purposely ignore me then get pissed when I try and correct her on what I said and then blame me for making it up. 

I'll be upstairs and she'll be downstairs with the dogs outside and when they start barking, she'll wait for me to come down and deal with them even though she's in the next room.

She'll lie about letting the dogs out to be clean at night before bed and i get woken up by whining/barking dogs begging to be let out so I have to get up at ungodly hours and wait not even ten minutes until they're finished. Then it takes me a few hours to fall back asleep while she just sleeps away.

I was away for a few days and came back to the garden covered in dog muck and one of the first things she told me to do was go pick it up.

She'll sit on the sofa for hours, hinting at me to go get her stuff from the kitchen even when I'm busy doing my own stuff. She'll smack her lips, look around and go 'I'm wanting something sweet/crunchy ect' and then look at me.

She basically refused to contact my dentist for excruciating pain I was getting in my mouth and four about five months of her promise and saying she would contact them, I ended up having to as my teacher to phone up because the pain was getting too much (I have severe anxiety about talking to people of the phone, I really don't know why)

She'll come home from work and not ask me about my day, just jabber on about hers and then saw her iconic line 'I'm going to go put on my pyjamas' She'll even come in the shopping and leave me to put away everything while she waddles up stairs for an hour to put her pyjamas on and then have the cheek to come down and say 'why haven't you put the shopping away?' (it's a job that I normally do anyway but it would be nice if she offered to help or just stayed in the room with me since I do it all the time no matter if we've shopped together or alone)

She's recently begun to brush off my intense thoughts and feelings of suicide (something I've been struggling for years) and after multiple attempts of me begging her to remember that I'm scared shitless about being left alone, she'll continue to leave me and disregard everything I say. She's told me to my face that she was disappointed in me feeling suicidal and that it was all about her because she didn't want to know if she was coming home to a kid who's just tried to top themselves (that felt very nice to hear BTW if anyones curious...) 

There's so much more I could and would say but it's like half eleven at night and my dog is barking to be let out.

I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with her before I can leave",23Aug2019,1

811,"I’m female that lives in the US, originally from the Middle East where my parents live. I’m 2 years out of college haven’t had much luck looking for jobs related to my undergraduate degree. This results in my having to take on pretty undesirable jobs since I’m young and have no leverage and experience as of yet. This has been taking its on toll on me. I don’t know if it’s about finding the right job and company, but working all these crappy jobs makes me wonder if it’s all worth it. I’m trying to find part time jobs that would allow me to live and self-study programming on my own, but even PT jobs are competitive to apply to. 

I did my undergrad and business and recently have been looking into computer science and programming since it’s in-demand and can lead to working at top companies with more leverage, good work cultures, and flexibility in one’s job. Which is what I ultimately want. 

I have the option of going back to my country to pursue a computer science masters degree at the university my father teaches at. So I could do it for free. However, by doing so I’d lose all the freedom I have gained these past 6 years living in the US since I’d be living with my parents. Especially since they’re conservative. By freedom I mean the freedom to go out and return whenever I want, not wear hijab (head cover/scarf), wear whatever I want, smoke weed, drink, speak out in favour of religious etc (basically all frowned down upon in the ME). So I’d have no real freedom whatsoever, besides hanging out and going out with my friends (who know I’m irreligious but not the extent of it). 

Is it worth it go back and lose my freedom by studying for 2 years to possibly (likely) get better job prospects in the end? Or would maybe the CS field have changed and become oversaturated by then anyway?

Or is staying here and trying to find the “right” job, or possibly even staying with crappy jobs for who knows how long...yet I’d have my freedom. Would that be better?

Maybe ~5 minutes  after getting finished, she suddenly perks up and goes beneath the clothes that I've got hanging in there. She's almost not visible, just kind of hiding in there. 

My cat is a nice cat. She's timid and mostly stays to herself.

But I kid you not, she full on GROWLED at what seemed to be the air.  I kneeled down and started petting her, saying her name and trying to comfort her while simultaneously trying to get her out. Maybe she didn't like the closet or something? Even though that's never happened before, and we've been doing this for months with her being perfectly comfortable. 

I managed to get her out and tried to pick her up again to lift her out of the room, but she just did that whole slow-blink thing a few times and started pacing around. She kept rubbing her face on stuff and eventually rubbed her tail basically all over my legs, (was sitting against the door) and then growled again, louder. 

I actually got scared she was having some sort of... I don't know, episode or something. So I lifted her out and she ran away very quickly. This sort of left me confused because of how abnormally affectionate she was acting. 

Any cat people know what this means? I'm quite religious as well, and part of me is scared that she reacted badly to the cleansing (even though we've done this countless times before...)

We’ve almost been here a year and we don’t have any long-term friends or any family here (work and travel has been busy). We basically just have each other.

He’s nice enough to live with and he’s been a friend of mine for about 5 years now. But the little things are starting to get on my nerves and he’s quite messy and tends to be quite moody and will often complain about the flat being too small for his hobbies (he plays guitar and there’s not a lot of room for him to setup, aside from the living room) 

My fiancée and I get married at the start of next year and we’re starting to wish we had a bit more privacy. When we watch movies together he often tags along and it’s hard for me to spend quality time just the two of us. He’s always generous with how much he chips in for food and rent but he doesn’t cook and mostly just hangs about. 

We also live quite far from my work (it takes me 2 buses and a train to get there) but we chose the place because it’s close to our roommates work outside of the city. 

BUT... he doesn’t have anywhere else to go. He could probably afford to live on his own, but he doesn’t have any family or friends in this city.  My fiancée and I are on the same page that we want a house to ourselves. I just don’t know if it’s justified to end the lease and move away from our roommate, when he’s really done nothing wrong and would have to live all by himself in a city where he has no family or long-term friends.

I don’t really have an amazing talent because all my “hobbies” I can’t stick with doing them for more than a few days in a row. 

I really want to stop that though. I want to actually do well in school, work out, and explore my hobbies but I just don’t know how to break the habit. Every time I’ve tried something that could break it I just forget or don’t want to do it after a few days. Thanks for any advice.",23Aug2019,2

831,"I have lived on the same residential street for 7 years. About a year ago I'm bought the house across the street in order to stay in the neighborhood. I have had my dog since I originally moved in 7 years ago. 

Not long after I moved into my current house I received an anonymous letter with a fake return address complaining that my dog was barking too much. I was surprised because I did not leave my dog unattended because my fence was not complete yet.

I was pissed. Not because of the complaints but because I couldn't ask for details. Was the dog barking when the kids were home and let the dog out,  I don't know.  Does she bark at joggers? If  I knew there was a problem, I could address it.

Since I wasn't able to respond I just put the letter aside. But today I got another letter what the fake return address again complaining.it's actually kind of creepy because this time they have my name where is the first time was just addressed to resident. Public records I'm sure would disclose my name but it's still weird.

Any suggestions? I'm mad at the anonymous nature. The dog is not outside for long periods of time where she could cause a disturbance. Since she's older, she stays in most of the time.

835,"So, to paint the picture of my situation, let me explain. I’ve always had supportive, caring parents. But they had busy jobs and weren’t really able to be there a lot for me school-wise, so i never really cared about the consequences of my grades. I did really good up until high school. I never really had to try until freshman year, and I had a pretty average gpa. Then my life got really rocky in between then and junior year. A lot of anxiety, depression. self-hatred and loss related to an incident in my life left my gpa slipping. Here i am in senior year with a 2.1 GPA. I know it’s bad. A lot has changed over the past few months and I’ve started caring about my future and really want to do good in school. I have high hopes for this semester, but i’m absolutely terrified of not being accepted into college. I have a huge passion for kids and helping them succeed, but a teaching profession and my grades don’t mix. My sat score is 1400, and i’m taking it again this fall. My family keeps saying to stop worrying and i’ll get into college but i honestly don’t believe them anymore. is there hope that i can get into an average early-education college? extra: i’ve never told my high school counselor, i’ve always been afraid to tell people my problems and often just shoved them away. i fell like i could talk to them about it but what’s the point now this late into high school? i can explain more details in the comments if needed.",23Aug2019,1
836,"Sorry in advance for my English.

Now I know that letting go employees is not easy for the boss but just read my situation and just tell me if i’m seeing things in another way or if I’m wrong etc.

I’ve been working for my boyfriends parents Bakery. Over all the people who work the most is My Boyfriend who is always in front attending costumers same as me, the girl that cooks and the guy that makes sandwiches. The other employees spend their times in the back on their phones.

I am more than thankful that I got this job, I got it after a hurricane and they needed all the help they could get, first I started helping keeping in order the line of people that form almost everyday after the hurricane and then I stayed there working, before the hurricane I was unemployed so I was more than happy to have a job.

So after almost 2 in a half years of working there I finally found another job in the biggest Bank of where I'm from, so yeah big deal for me since I study photography and is $11 the hour, a lot of money for us where I live. I'm staring this job next week so I told my boss a few days ago (few days ago was in the interview) that I got hire there and I'm gonna be working full time blah blah. He didn't sounded happy at all, not even a ""congrats"". whatever I told him the details, he asked him if I worked on weekends, I said that I didst know, but I don't work on the weekends, but I know he asked that to see if I could work on my only 2 days off. I was thinking about working some Sundays to help and have a bit of extra money, but that all change today.

Today I told him:

Me: Hey! My work probably is close on thanks giving and since I know that that is one of the most busiest day here (cause people make turkey orders and we make them) maybe I can help that day?

Him: I don't know, we'll see.

I found it weird but okay. And finally today I was making an order, my boss gave the customer a 2L coca cola from the fridge, when something is cold you usually see the bottle or can fog up when taken out of the fridge but the 2L didn't so I thought that maybe the 2L was put in the fridge not long ago and was still hot. I asked because a cold drink 2L has a different prince than the one that is not cold.

Me: hey did the 2L was cold or hot?

Him: I took that out of the fridge I don't know.

I was like... da fuq is with this attitude? You grabbed it so you're supposed to know... Whatever the day went by, I told him that I start on Monday and he just stayed quiet and talked about the days that my boyfriend works.

I really want some extra cash, but should I even work on my days off (even if is just one) to put up with his attitude and ungratefulness? (He's not there on Sundays, Sundays are his days off, but for sure he was to go to work now since I'm not working there anymore) My Boyfriends mom is more than happy for me, everyone at the bakery is really happy and supportive but him.",23Aug2019,1
837,"I have been friends with three boys my age for three years now. They were with me through the shittiest stuff. And I am annoyed and mad at them right now.

We hang out every weekend and go over to each other’s houses. Mostly they come to my house.

Today I’m with two of them who have been friends for maybe 8 years. I always feel left out when the two of them are hanging out with me, but today it’s so much worse. Today, they were being total dicks to me, making fun of me for not being athletic, calling me fat (when one of them is as fat as me), and calling me gay and saying that they all think I’m gay and that they all talk about it. One recently got his license and always drives the other around, and today they wanted to go out and get food. I asked to go along and the driver said “Nah you can’t I don’t have my six months yet.” He has no problem driving the other around and I asked him a while ago and he said “It’s cause he’s white so he can pass off as a relative.” I find that extremely stupid because if he gets pulled over a cop will ask for ID anyway.

840,"Hi there everyone, I was wondering if I could get some advice about an issue (duh). Whilst I know what I'm asking is probably very it depends on what you want I feel I need an objective out look from people who aren't connected to the problem (and thus asking strangers on the internet 😅). So my question is I currently have 3 decisions to possibly pursue in university but I have absolutely no idea which is the best.

A little background first: growing up as a kid (from around 7) I always wanted to be a forensic scientist / the person who did autopsies. At 12 I found out that to get there I actually had to become a Dr and specialise in pathology (and also that there were absolutely no jobs in forensic science) so I decided that's the route I'd go. I failed to get into med school and started a degree in paramedic in instead... But I'm honestly hating it so much. I'm not bad at it I don't think, but the idea of working in it for the rest of my life if I can't get into med afterwards / the idea of working my ass off to get into med with a job I'm not sure I'll enjoy and then only potentially being able to go into pathology is terryfying. So my thing comes here where I've got 3 options I could possibly change to.

1. Veterinary : from this I'd aim to go into veterinary pathology instead. It seems more interesting that human. 6 year degree, graduate salary is around 55k but I've read alot about burnout and that vets have to deal with alot of emotional blackmail from patients. Also that the suicide rate is 4 times that of the general public . I've had animals all my life and whilst I wouldn't say I was passionate about the-as in their not the be all and end all of my life. I love our pets and I do do quite a bit of petsitting as my job- I do find them interesting. With this I'd hope to go into a combined field where I could do some pathology and some epidemiology stuff to track disease and outbreaks. But still have the option to actually work with the animals if purely academia gets tedious. Nice balance. 

2. Initial back up plan after not going into med was to go do radiography and then work when I came out whilst trying to get into med school. Even if I fail with this one I can still build a career from it? Problem is I'd have to move interstate to pursue this and completely fend for myself (work, live alone.. Etc.. Kinda thing)) which I'm not completely against, other than I haven't don't physics since year 10 and this degree obviously has a large physics component. I did well at bio and chem but I barely passed higher maths (combination of calculus, statistics and trigonometry) with a 55-60% average so I'm worried if I pursue this I'm setting myself up for failure? Starting salary with this would be 70k and it's currently a highly in demand job where I could work wherever I want. I didn't manage to get into our states program for this but I have garuntee entry into another university for it (which is better than our state one, but yeah the moving??) 

3. Say screw it all and go pursue a double major in ecology and biochemistry. This I figure sets me up for the possibility to do both vocational stuff with science (e. G soil testing on mines etc...) or research. My initial back up instead of radiography was this but everyone I talked to who works as a research scientist or have a degree in science says to not bother. The jobs are apparently all contract based for only a few years so there's no garuntee you'll have a job year to year, pay vs amount of study is bad, and there's alot of competitiveness in academia. I loved all the research subjects at school, specifically the reports and practicals (last year of highschool I scored 100% on all the design own experiment and write reports components, as well as on a large year long research task we had to do) and this is something I would love to do, but when everyone who works in the field is telling you not to do it, and job stability is something that matters (I really want to buy a house some day), I don't know if this is something worth risking?? I know with this one I'd have lots of opportunities to travel and I'd get to apply with all the universities to volunteer on projects through the summer (and possibly get paid), as well as doing mining placements to get vocational experience if analyst was where I decided to go but yeah. I'm not sure if the risk is something I want.. Especially since it's so different to my original goal.  I'm an absolute homebody and all I really want is to be able to buy a house in the country one day and have some dogs. I don't want fancy cars or to be famous or anything, just content. 

Sorry for the long long post. I just really think an objective point of view for this might be helpful. I'm currently stuck in the thick of it and its just making me miserable honestly.

Any advice greatly appreciated. 

Thanks.",23Aug2019,1

So we all masturbated once I guess, and the majority of us already had sex I guess, so I hope I’m not the only one...
To be honest, I discovered masturbation at the age of 16, and I had my first time with a girl like a month ago. It was terrible, I was in trouble after what happened... when she pulled her clothes off, and when I put the condom on, I immediately cummed... (but i arrived to penetrate her later...)
I noticed since my firsts masturbations that I was cumming very quickly and I was scared to be early at bed, and I am apparently. 
I am very very mad because I have a good size and plenty of girls around me who liked me, but I’m scared to try again now because it’s always like that (less than 30sec)

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22F and I live by myself. I pay all my own bills and work full time. I have my GED and until recently have subscribed to the idea that not everyone needs to go to college and I am one of those that doesn't. I still believe that not everyone needs to go to college. Recently I have been longing for financial and career (I guess?) freedom. I've just been wanting to strive for something more than slowly working my way up in the industry I work in now. I want to earn more money (don't we all, I know) and I want to be in control of what I do. I want to pursue something that I love to do. I want to make a business maybe? I am not completely sure. I just know that the monotony of my life now will swallow me whole and I will never amount to anything if I don't take control.

Now I have no idea how to begin processing all of these thoughts and turn them into something productive but I am trying. So I understand that maybe I should take business classes and maybe get a degree and that will help with the business end. But the thing that I am struggling with is that I don't know what I am good at or even what I care about all that much. I have some interests that maybe I could use but I'm just not sure. 

I love music, I love to sing but I don't feel that I am good enough to do anything with that. I have always kind of entertained the thought of doing music therapy but really I don't know why because I don't even know what that entails. I just know I love music, helping people, and psychology. 

 I also love makeup but I know I am not talented enough or creative enough to do anything with that and I feel like that market is just so saturated at this point. 

I used to really enjoy writing but I haven't done anything like that in a while.

I know that I can practice these things and get better at whichever I choose but also like... when? My work hours are honestly the worst and I am thinking I just need to sacrifice sleep and some comforts that I pay for in order to accomplish what I want. But then it's like- Cool, I want to go to college. Now with what time and money?? This is so hard. I wish I had made better decisions when I was younger but I had no idea what I wanted and I can't go back. I do want to take advantage of the time that I have now, which is why I come to you. 

Do you relate to this at all? How did you find what you wanted to do? How did you go to college with a job and no extra money? Just tell me what your experience is and any advice that you have, roadblocks I should expect in trying to do this, or whatever else. I am open to anything and I am happy to answer any questions you all have to get a better feel for my situation.

My parents were supporting me in that time and it’s really put a strain on our relationship. I was at a school and in a sorority I couldn’t stand and I was overall miserable. That 8 months by myself was a privilege but also completely detrimental to my mental health and where I’m at today. They don’t really understand that. They bitched at me to get a job and get back in school and I did and now they’re bitching about helping me with school (even though that was part of the agreement) since they make too much for me to get really anything from FAFSA.

862,"I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years and have recently been staying with him at his moms while we look for a place to live.

His mom has been dating this guy for a few months and we both really liked him, thought he was a nice guy but I noticed he had an ankle bracelet around his leg and was told it was because he got a DUI. That answer just wasn’t enough for me so I decided to google his name and he comes up on our states sex offender registry.

He raped TWO YOUNG CHILDREN in 2010 and was in prison for 8 years. He has the ankle bracelet probably because he is on probation. 

I don’t know if my boyfriends mom knows this and I told my boyfriend that he needs to tell her immediately. If he can hurt children, he can definitely hurt women. His mom might be unknowingly sharing her bed with a convicted child molester. 

It’s been a two days now and my boyfriend hasn’t said anything to his mom yet! He said it’s because he wants to talk to her in person and she hasn’t been home (she’s been sleeping at her child molester boyfriends house) and that’s why my boyfriend hasn’t mentioned this to his mom.
 
I’m so disgusted because if this were my mom I would have told her immediately! Should I call her and let her know or should I let my boyfriend handle it? I’m just really worried because he STILL hasn’t told her she’s literally dating a pedophile!

He is a really chill guy but I’m not so much. I have MDD( major depressive disorder) and GA(General Anxiety). This started a year into our friendship(unrelated). We don’t always talk about our feelings but he knew the troubles I was going through and helped me by good times. Right now I’m a whole lot better than I was a year ago(suicide attempt). Over the past few months we haven’t hung out as much and I’ve found it’s almost always me making the effort to form plans. We definitely have fun when we hangout but he’s gotten a tad bit colder to me. A couple weeks ago I found out that he took two of his other friends( also mine) to the beach( a trip we were planning on going to together). This has really been messing with my head and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared he only kept being friends with me bc of my poor mental health. I suspect he doesn’t like me anymore. I don’t want to say anything to him bc I don’t know how to bring it up and if I did I think he would just deflect it. Am I being paranoid or what? Please help.,23Aug2019,2

865,"So I just got home from an awesome week (Monday to Friday) at the beach with 4 of my best friends including my girlfriend. We all stayed at my friend's grandparents house. 

To start out I do have really bad anxiety and sometimes depression (idk if there's a name for this specifically I just get really REALLY sad sometimes). And especially separation anxiety from my gf (it had been getting better before this week but now that I spent a week with her in the same house, cuddling and doing normal couple stuff while we were out and at the house we were staying out) I feel like complete shit now that I'm home, I have a mix of missing the beach and my girlfriend. I normally don't feel this way after saying goodbye to her after a day back at our hometown and I've never felt this way about leaving the beach before. I don't know if it's my brain missing waking up with my friends and especially my gf every morning, or getting to see her everyday for a week (which I don't normally get to do). 

I want to mention also that I did have a great time with the rest of my friends too and I feel like the trip strengthened all of our relationships, including me and my girlfriend. 

Other than this horrible anxious and depressed feeling I'm having in my chest and anxious thoughts I had an amazing time and I'm exhausted. Anyone have any explanation or tips? Thank you. 

Sorry for the bad grammar too I'm really tired. Long car ride home.",23Aug2019,3
866,"I'm a 15 year old junior in high school about to turn 16 later this year. I live with my mother, younger sister and my cute little dog. We have a lot of family problems so there's no one at home I can talk to and I'm too embarrassed to ask my friends for help.
Okay, I've recently been thinking about what to do with my life. I knew that I wanted a career in art but I wasn't sure where. Suddenly, it hit me that I wanted to be a character designer. This made me evaluate my life and what I should do with it.
Evaluating my life made me think of my sexuality and who I was. I've always identified myself as cis/heterosexual and that's always worked out for me. However, I knew that I wasn't just cis. You see, my family and I are Christian and my mother has absolutely no tolerance for lgbtq+. Today I realized that I'm pansexual and I don't really care about gender when I'm attracted to someone. The problem is that I am a Christian and I hate myself for who I am. At the same time, Everytime I see anything lgbtq+, I'm filled with so much pride. My head tells me no as my feelings tell me yes.
I really want some help getting rid of my pansexuality. I know the world will love me for who I am but I can and I know that God won't. I honestly just want me religion and my sexuality to be friends, ya know? Any advice would be nice.",23Aug2019,5
867,"I go out summer pub/ birthdays / holidays etc I never drink when it isn’t a social event. I used to be fine when I was drunk (before 24) but now (just turned 26) even if I don’t drink that much I act unpredictably I might send loads of drunk messages, cause arguments, sass everyone, might have a nap or might break an ankle. I don’t know how it switched like this but I do have a lot of bad stuff happen when I’m drunk (all my own fault). Do I sound like an alcoholic ? Should I just quit alcohol ? Has my brain just switched into alcohol Intolerance? Not sure how best to tackle the situation",23Aug2019,2

873,We have had several big events and unplanned big events at work this month. I’ve also had a big medical emergency this month but have missed no time at work for it. The people I work with are stressed out and I’m constantly being called out and blamed for not “planning” better or communicating when in all fairness I’ve been told several times “I can’t think about that right now” or my planning meeting was cancelled because they needed to focus on the immediate event in front of them. I feel like the punching bag for their unresolved emotions and lack of self-care in the midst of my own medical emergency that no one has shown any care about. Is it wrong of my to think about leaving? This is a cycle at work in high stress times and it just seems lately we are never not in high stress mode. It feels toxic and slightly abusive (I’ve worked almost every day this month and when I mentioned going shopping on a Saturday morning the response was well I wish you would’ve been doing this work thing instead) it’s only a few people but it’s the core team I work with and my boss. I have the hardest time determining if a work place is toxic or adaptable and if I should stay?? Any thoughts?,23Aug2019,1
874,"A while ago I started seeing a girl from Tinder. We have been meeting up, flirting and doing *stuff* for about 4 months. 

I told her that if we survived the summer I would officially ask her out. However, I have encountered a problem: I'm not sure whether I like her or not, and I don't think we could last a lifetime together. I'm definitely not in love with her and it's messing me up to think that I have to start a relationship that I know won't work. I know for a fact that she will be the one to end up hurt as i'm pretty sure she has fallen for me deeply.

But there is a second problem: part of me values experience and thinks it would be good to at least attempt to work it out, to give it time and hopefully let myself fall for her, eventually.

Should I give it a try and risk breaking her heart?",23Aug2019,1
875,"Currently I have an automatic transition car. My father near two winters ago bought a '98 jeep he fixed up, and the idea of learning how to drive it, and take it out on dirt roads for outdoor adventures was something I wanted to experience. It even has a indicator of when to shift into higher and lower gears. This has been a goal of mine to start, but due to circumstances I can't

However it is old, the second gear takes skill to shift due to age as it doesn't work well. He has an old '03 Tacoma he used that he bought in place of our beloved '04 Ford escape with was our family vehicle for years. It was getting very old and we sold it for a very low price. My Mom did take me out to a dirt parking lot to learn how to drive it, but I felt uncomfertable due to the tone and sharpness of her voice when ever I shifted wrong, even though she in fact trying her best to teach me.

She has told me it would not me a wise idea to learn in either as both are very old, and learning on them would result in accedentaly breaking and wearing down the transmissions further. I had the idea of asking a driver instructor who teaches semi truck driving who could teach me how to drive standard. But I need to provide a vehicle to learn on.

I had the idea of asking my Dad, but I don't know how too. He suggested I get a standard to learn on, but I am fine with the car I have and don't have the money or need for one (it can do well on nice flat dirt roads though). I just want to have the experience of driving the jeep, and proving to him I can. They then had the idea I could rent a standard car to learn on, or even a driving simulator to learn this I don't know either would be good.

What should I do from here? I really want to drive the Jeep next summer to experience driving in the outdoors. I don't know if he would trust me with that either.",23Aug2019,1
876,"*long post, kind of venting*

My dad called me like he usually does every 2 or 3 years. I think he either finally realized how shitty he was as a parent and needs to apologize or just feels bad in general and wants to have someone to talk to. We usually have a therapy session for him when he calls. He calls me his best friend rather than his daughter so therapist was always my role.

Some stuff that's happened over the last 24 years
•met him at 4 years old when he got out of prison

•he barely wanted to look at me because I was never an outgoing child to show off to his friend, usually left me with his mom when he got his weekend

•showed me scary movies so he could jump from behind corners to scare me and I would jump more easily

•made me drink jack n coke to entertain his friends

•leave me at his house alone when I was around 5 or 6 to do all the drugs (when his mom didn't want to babysit), come home, pass out, 

•put me in a pin with 7 puppies he was training to fight and kill, just leaves me with them for what feels like forever, they bite me, pull me to the ground, scratch me up pretty bad, screamed for adults I knew were on the other side of the house, no one came, still afraid of dogs

•would disappear every 2 or 3 years, when I say disappear, I mean NOBODY knew where he was and no phone number worked, he would just be gone, his family doesn't even try to contact me, that side of my family just stops existing, the first time I was 6, I was 8 when he called, I didn't recognize his voice and I told my mom a stranger on the phone knew my name, he talked to me like he never left

•liked to take me to parties instead of leaving me at home, would leave me at the party to go do God knows what somewhere with high and/or drunk adults I did not know to babysit me, I have a habit of hiding in bathrooms and pacing when I'm stressed in unfamiliar places, the fact that i was never raped or molested still amazes me

•buys me GUCCI PURSES AT 10! I was the definition of a tomboy and gave all of my jewelry and bags (there were several) to my sister, 2 years younger, she didn't mind

•hates to hear me refer to anybody as my dad other than him, literally cant stand it, yells at me for calling my sister's father dad, I cry, he cries because I cry

•always made to say I love you, dont actually feel it, doesn't really mean anything, only my dad's side says it, everyone around me just says the words, have to be reminded to say it at the end of every call and when leaving a house

•says he'll come and get me for the weekend, never shows up, sit on the porch for hours until he calls to say he'll come next week, I know he's drunk and just woke up when he called

•now leaves me with my older cousins when the adults go clubbing at night. . . . coming back in the morning, looking back on his family I can see how very unhealthy everything about them was, get bullied for 2 days by cousins for drawing, being a girl with a gameboy and bringing books to read, dont see my dad once, this was pretty common

•one of my favorite older cousins is shot and killed in an argument at school during one of the disappearances, nobody talks him afterward, I forget about him until I see a picture of him 9 years later, gets laughed at for crying

•gets mad at my mom for not forcing me to dress like a girl, takes me to buy a dress for the weekend when he sees I only have Nike shorts, very homophobic and doesn't want me to look like a dyke in front of his friends

•dont want to see him but mom makes me do it for money, it's so difficult for me to say no to him, when I say I dont want to go, he always asks why not, if i say nevermind, it's cool, if I say i dont want to see him, he'll burst into tears, I'm his best friend how could I not want to spend time with him, I always went

•gets mad at me for not wanting to talk to his friends, men who have all done some jail/prison time and are actual gangsters, I'm shy and awkward, if he took me with him anywhere during my middle or high school years, I was made to sit in the car, especially if I brought my gameboy and intended to play it, I got really good at keeping track of my charger and making sure it was fully charged at all times

•asked him to call me when he disappeared, when he did call me, we'd talk about his many adventures in other states, the elderly strip clubs he went to, my other brothers and sisters he decided to talk to me about when I was 12, shows me pictures of him with them, apparently he leaves the state when he disappears and just travels, gets a different phone every time (explains the 45 phone numbers), I've never known what he does for work other than dog fighting, training and breeding

•tried to get more into my brothers and sisters, he doesn't want to talk about it, I tell him he needs to be a parent to all of us not just me, he gets pretty pissed off and hangs up, never learned about them, just know they're in several states from Philadelphia to Florida on the east coast, I'm from Mississippi

•tells me he's coming to one of my football games (i played trombone), calls me to find out where I am, wants me to find him, I leave my band in a very bad neighborhood in order to find my dad, there were several members of the band missing that night because their parents didn't want them to go missing, get shot, stabbed or anything else bad to happen to them, he asked me to meet him under the bleachers, I just walked into the pitch black darkness UNDER THE BLEACHERS, A 16 YEAR OLD LOOKING FOR HER DAD, there was a moment where I realized he could literally get me killed, I was risking my safety to meet this man who barely spoke to me every other month of my life and when we spoke it was about him, that was when I officially gave up

•ignore calls from him, refuse facetime, asked if he was going to my high school graduation, says he's in North Dakota and is ""busy"".  . . . so no, the last time i was physically near him, I was 16

•gets intensely interested in me college around 19 or 20 years old, still only talked about him, would give 2 hour lectures on facetime about being an adult and making ""stacks on stacks on stacks"", cant interrupt because I still dont have the guts to tell him I dont care anymore, does this once a week, I asked about my brothers and sisters, he makes an excuse to go and hangs up

•starts calling at 2 or 3 am while at work to entertain himself, I give him my class schedule, ignores it, calls at 3 am, wakes up roommate at least once a week, at least she's understanding

•Calls one night, I tell him to stop calling me, he says he just wants to say I love you (the usual gateway to a conversation), I tell him I haven't loved him since I was 6, I dont love strangers who float in and out of my life expecting me to wait patiently for them show up and have time for me, time that will be spent trying to please them, being a yes man, being secondary, being talked at not to, forever complaining that I'm something other than the average black girl, I told him he treated the phrase I love you from me like it was permission to ignore me as a person and be as selfish as possible, like i lived and existed solely for him, I was done with him, I said dont call me again, ever

Here we are, 4 or 5 years later, and he does the same thing he's done all my life. But now, there's more crying. It's still the 2 or 3 am stuff but he just sobbing when I hear him, saying he's sorry for everything. Nothing specific, just everything. Just apologizing and wanting a do over. I listen for a few minutes and hang up because I know it'll go on forever. He did that in 2017 and a few days ago. I don't even know how he got my number. None of my mom's side would bother talking to him if they knew who he was. 

I tried bringing this up in my real life, but most of the people in my everyday life have actual loving families on both sides. They just tell me to give him a chance while not at all acknowledging what he's done. ""He created you. You owe him forgiveness."" ""He messed up, but he needs you in his life."" ""You'll regret it if he's dying."" It doesn't feel right.

I was just wondering what I should do. Just take the phone calls and hang up? I never know his phone number anymore and I dont answer to area codes I dont know. For all I know he's been calling me all this time, figured that out and got a phone number I knew. Should I try explaining to him to stop? He usually just wants to lecture while crying when he calls so any attempt to talk on my part means getting yelled at. 

Did this belong on r/rants? Just wondering.

Tl;dr
My dad was shitty at best and I told him off for it. Now, he calls me trying to have any kind of relationship and wont accept that I have excommunicated him from my life.",23Aug2019,1
878,"Hi guys,

Over the past few years in college, I've gone through a lot. I've been battling depression since my freshman year, and as a result, I haven't made many friends over these last two years. I came into college with a group of high school friends, but I feel as if I've slowly been drifting apart from them.

I really tried my hardest sophomore year to better myself, but it was really tough, and I ended up becoming more isolated. 

It feels as if I can't relate to anyone. I've noticed myself becoming more awkward with my friends and more apathetic to things anyone else is doing. It's hard for me to laugh or become genuinely interested in someone else. I feel like I'm faking my entire personality, and I don't know what to do.

It really feels like I have very slight interests in things, but not enough interest to ever have something in common with friends.

I just want to enjoy myself again. It feels like I'm being robbed of my life.",23Aug2019,1

I'm 26 and now I like to add gaming as part of my pastime and as my hobby. The thing is, can I still manage time with stuff I usually do? With gaming, I know it's gonna be addicting and I might not control myself with it. I usually read book as my pastime and it's way productive than gaming.
Would I still be able to read a book and won't lose an interest to it?

881,"I bought two graphics cards last week one on Amazon that were identical so I could run them both in my computer. One was faulty so I organised a return. 

I accidently sent the working one back (realised as soon as I got home from the post office when I turned the computer on. But a bit late by then) and informed Amazon, they said to return the faulty one and they would inform the returns department so i did. So both got returned.  

I contacted them when I saw it was delivered and they said they had no way or returning the incorrect item and they would just be disposing of it in the bin. This is a thousand pound graphics card. 

They said there was nothing they could do, and as I sent the incorrect item it would just be thrown away. 

I told them I would happily pay for shipping but they just refused and said it's not something they are able to do. I asked if I could just create a return for the working one so I could get a refund (as they already had it obviously) but they said they would need to receive a product after I place the claim and that product would already be disposed of by then.  

Is this legal?  Is there nothing I can do? 
Apparently the item is ”sidelined"" at the moment and will stay that way for a week. Meaning it's just sat there waiting to go in the bin. 

One customer service manager has agreed to email them and ask them to return it to me as he has know it happen before. But several others I have spoke to have (very rudely) told me I should have been more careful and it's basically tough shit. 

I know I made a mistake and wasn't thorough enough. But is this really going to cost me a grand because I wasn't paying attention? 

I now have no graphics cards and am a thousand pound down (as only got refund for one )",23Aug2019,2
