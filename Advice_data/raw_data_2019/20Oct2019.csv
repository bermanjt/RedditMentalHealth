1,"first post :)

There's this girl I like and I've only met her once. Usually I just text her because she had a really tight schedule but she seems to be becoming more flirtatious with me. I really want to meet up with her and hang out because she is such a cool person. 
Only issue is that drugs have brought out a lot more of my anxiety and I don't feel comfortable being around because I'm so worried I'm gonna fuck something up and ruin the chance to connect with her. I always tend to freeze up in these situations and don't act like myself, so I need some advice on how to be happy with who I am.",20Oct2019,2
2,"I’ve never considered myself to be a bad friend or a bad person regardless of how self-deprecating I can be at times. Although, recently I’ve been noticing that all of the friends I either left behind or who left me behind are much happier than they ever were when we were friends. Yet, I’m still just as unhappy as before. If not more unhappy. Am I the problem? I feel guilty for my role in past friendships, like maybe I held them back or perpetuated their sadness. Even though my current friends have told me that I can’t blame myself for our lives going opposite directions, why can’t I be happy now?",20Oct2019,1
3,"Basically started talking to someone, I really like her and we get on well.

I'm still a virgin, and haven't kissed anyone yet. I have no idea how to bring this up, we almost kissed but I backed out making an excuse.

I have a small penis, like 3 inches. Should I tell her before hand, obviously wouldn't just randomly tell her, but if it gets to that point.. I don't want her completely disappointed or expecting some 6+ inch penis.

I've avoided sex and relationships due to my small dick, however I want to atleast try once, then if that fails, then I know for certain that's my dating life over, or atleast my online dating.

I just don't know how to bring up the fact that I still haven't kissed anyone, had sex before and that I have a small dick.",20Oct2019,0
4,"Hi, I work in a kitchen and have bruising on the bottom of one of my feet. It never heals and always bothers me and just makes me feel miserable. I work full time. I want to just quit work and take however long to let my condition heal. I've talked to doctors several times. They just gave me insoles that do nothing or make the pain worse. I don't want to quit but I'm getting very irritated by the chronic pain that's haunted me for several months now. 

If I quit my job and heal, would future employers see my brief stent unemployed as undesirable in a candidate? Would employers even care if I had gone unemployed to heal my foot? Is there a way to heal this wound without hurting my future job hunting prospects? I have no idea how to handle this situation. Any help is appreciated. Thank you all.",20Oct2019,1
6,"I was raised in a middle-class family, and my parents worked hard so I could have a good education. I was fortunate enough to land a great job with a lot of amazing perks, especially travel related. As a result, I often enjoy travel experiences way above what my parents could ever afford. 
I’m conflicted on if I should share my experiences with them. On the one hand, it seems like bragging, and I feel guilty for having these things they don’t. On the other, they worked hard so I could succeed, and maybe would enjoy knowing their hard work has paid off.

8,"Call me a spoiled loser all you want IDGAF

My parents are buying the house next to us and wanting me to move into it. I am very lucky and blessed to be able to move into a house free of cost at my age (19). My parents monitor me a lot (ask who I hanged with, what I did, etc every time). It's annoying and I do not like it. I have always wanted to move to a place in the area, but NOT right next to them... I can not imagine being in my 20's living next to my mom and dad. I just want freedom, I don't want to be asked what im doing or knowing they can look out the window and see friends cars in the driveway. If I do not move into that house, they will no longer help me pay for insurance, etc...

What do I do?",20Oct2019,2
9,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat. 

Edit: I’m ugly so I don’t believe she likes me

10,"Recently found out that one of my friends (M) basically threatened to release nudes of another friend (F) if she wouldn’t do as told. The pictures got sent with consent on both sides but after the male friend ended their „relationship“ (basically was friendship+) they agreed to delete the photos(they both sent some) The problem here is that my male „friend“didn’t delete them. I certainly don’t want to have contact with him anymore but I’m just wondering if I should confront him about this. Because this is not ok at all. I also have, what I consider a real friend, that knows about this and we both don’t want to make anything worse. Please don’t say stuff like „ThEY ShOUld‘nT hAVe SEnT NUdEs!“ It happened so it’s not helpful at all. But I’m open for any criticism regarding anything else in this situation.",20Oct2019,2
11,"Our Roxie passed away Oct 7th. She was a (stray/mutt/mixed) dog that my husband found sitting on the side of the road 7 1/2 years ago.  We loved her dearly and she was the sweetest gentle dog we've ever had. She was selfless and was super responsive to our requests/commands. She was our baby. We have another baby (Luna, Corgi) who is kind of spoiled and has youngest child syndrome. Roxie was great with helping us raise her (she's 3 now) and they always played and did everything together. I barely have any pictures of them separate. They were best friends and sisters and they loved each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Roxie got late diagnosed with CKD (mess up on the vet's part, though it wouldn't have really mattered too much in the end I think...) and by the time we found out it was too late to really do anything other then let her sleep... Luna has been lost without Roxie, which hurts because we are also lost. We lost our baby Ali (cat, 13-14 years old) July 24th so I've already been on the edge. With Luna being so sad and my husband grieving so hard we decided a puppy would be good so she'd have a friend to play with. 

&amp;#x200B;

We brought a puppy home and now Luna is having some food aggression (she's never been like this before). The first day she just pouted and the puppy didn't do much either, so it was just some sniffing around and avoidance. The second day they played a bit and I was thankful, and I thought 'maybe this was the right call'. Today is only the third day, but now Luna won't really do anything with the puppy and she is actively avoiding her. The puppy came near her food and she growled at her.  She won't play with her even though the puppy has tried to play. I'm admittedly over thinking it and nervous/anxious/on edge.   


We've been making sure to give Luna the same attention she got before, we still play with her and give her cuddles. She wasn't much of a snuggler before Roxie passed, but now she's very into snuggling and seems more needy. She gained extra weight and so we aren't free-range now, she gets the recommended amount and we had been taking her on walks. Maybe the new food aggression is tied to her getting rationed food? I don't really know, this has been extremely hard on all of us and I don't really know what to do. Is there anything that I can do to help Luna bond with the new puppy or should we just wait and hope? =( We've had other pets before and we've never had issue with aggression of any kind. She does act concerned when she cries and runs over, but as soon as she sees that she is okay she runs away from her and goes back to avoiding her... Sorry for rambling, mind hasn't been working right for a few months now.. Thanks for your time.  


tl;dr: New puppy (8 weeks old) after losing our other puppy (8 years old). Our other puppy (3 years old) is having a hard time. How can I help them bond or comfort her better?",20Oct2019,1
12,"Hi everyone ive been with this amazing girl for a while now weve gotten into kind of a road block.
You see im Christian and she is a Muslim and we live in a religious country where marriage is only same religion type thing but i really like her and dont wanna let her go just because of her religion and neither does she.

The biggest problem is her parents they dont know about us yet and she want to tell them at some point and she wants them to like me and accept me despite being christian. Its haram to  marry someone of a different religion in Islam and they thinks so too. They are backwards thinker and im 90 percent sure they wont approve.

How do you guys and gals think i can get them to approve of our relationship and get them to like me despite being Christian",20Oct2019,1

14,"So basically we’re in a great long distance (closing the distance in &lt;100 days) but some guy who I’ve had a bad history with started messaging her. This guy flirted with my ex a few months ago while we were together still, asked her for nudes within 24 hours of us breaking up, and now has been jokingly asking my girlfriend to meet up and “give him head.” This guy lives within 20 minutes of her for reference. 

I trust her of course but it just makes me uncomfortable, what should I do? I’ve told her that he’s a weird guy and people know him for being a bit of a fuckboy but I haven’t gone into detail about my experience with him. She sees nothing wrong with this which I don’t judge her for it’s just a bit weird for me.

16,"So i have 3 friend groups: people from high school, university friends, and friends made through my current partner. Problem is all three friend groups consist of very different people, and 2 from 2 different groups actively don't get along. 

I have a fun idea of what I want to do for my birthday , but I know that if I invite everyone, there will be 3 distinct groups all night, and not really a mesh (which had happened before a few years ago and just felt awkward).

If I invite everyone, they'll a come and do their best to mingle and be supportive, but I know it'll be forced and I don't want people to feel uncomfortable. But I can't just invite one or even two groups... Because it'd feel incomplete.

Last year for my birthday I just didn't do anything because I felt so awkward the year before and it just felt too hard. But I WANT to do something this year. 

Anyone else have this issue? How did you deal with it?",20Oct2019,1
17,"I've always had trouble focusing on a single task; I tend to fall into rabbit holes very easily. When I want to research a specific topic or complete a task, I inevitably come across a term that intrigues me, leading to a digression into researching that topic, and so on. By the time the digression is over and I'm back to the original topic, a significant amount of time has passed. 

For example, today I wanted to pick a new wallpaper for my computer. I noticed a wallpaper from the show Mr. Robot, with the ""Red Wheelbarrow Poem"". I remembered the scene from the show, and I became curious about the significance of the quote in the show. This led me to reading the summary on Schmoop, where I encountered the sentence, 

""Think of 'The Red Wheelbarrow' as a painting, rather than as a Where's Waldo puzzle.""

I was doing some work with template matching in computer vision earlier today, and the mention of Where's Waldo instantly brought my mind back to the topic. 

""Is it possible to use template matching to solve Where's Waldo?"" my brain asked. 

This led to another google search, another article click, and another chunk of time being allocated to this digression. After reading about that for a good chunk of time, I went back to the Schmoop page, finished reading that, and now I'm finally back at the original task. It's been over half an hour since I wanted to pick a wallpaper (which I still haven't done, suggestions are welcome :). I realized this happens to me pretty much every time I've ever tried to do anything, and here I am writing a post about it. 

It really reminds me of recursive functions in programming: when a recursive function call is made, the current operation is paused, and resumes only when the recursive call has returned. Does everyone experience this issue, or do I have some form of ADHD? How do you prevent it from interfering with your focus?",20Oct2019,2

28,"Up until about 3 years ago, I wasn’t very confident or sexual with myself at all. I didn’t view myself as a sexual being and refrained from engaging in any intimate relations. I declined sex with SO’s. I was (and still am) extremely insecure with my body (eating disorders, trauma, abuse, etc. you guys know the spiel. It’s all led up to this.) and have been working hard to feel otherwise.

For the past 2 years, I’ve known a wonderful guy who has been trying really hard to make me love myself and feel good with him. And for a long time, I did. When we first started dating, just knowing how attracted he was about me made me feel crazy confident in myself and suddenly seduction and intimacy were things that I was happily embracing. He couldn’t keep his hands off of me and I couldn’t have been happier about it.

Fast forward to current times.

I’ve gained about 20 pounds since the relationship began, which has caused me to take a hit on my confidence. I had some serious health problems that made my libido drop and my ability to even comfortably have sex drop as well. I’ve been fighting relapses with my eating disorders. I got pregnant, then had a miscarriage. I’ve found myself in a dark place. I have never felt less sexy in my entire life.

And my boyfriend, while wonderful, has also made comments that have worsened that. He’s made comments about porn, which make me feel like he’s enjoying that more than he is with me. We have sex maybe a third as often as we used to, and it’s almost always a quickie that I get nothing out of. When we do have sex, I immediately want to cry afterwards because I feel so disgusting and I don’t want him looking at me. I usually just go to the bathroom and cry and don’t bother mentioning it because he’ll feel terrible for something that’s out of his control. I’ve been covering my face during sex. I’ve been avoiding changing in front of him now. He hasn’t made much effort to show that he’s still crazy about me like he used to be and it’s only made me feel like those securities nagging at the back of my mind are true. It’s not him, it’s me and I know that but I still can’t shake the feeling that I’m just not what anyone wants anymore. Every little thing has just been eating away at me more and more.

I guess what I’m trying to figure out here is how on earth to go about regaining my confidence back and rebuilding my self esteem. I’ve never been the most confident person in the room, but I’ve felt comfortable in my own skin for at least a short while and I want to get back to that so bad. I want to be able to take charge and be sexy and feel like I deserve to be wanted. I want to be wanted. I’m so tired of being trapped in this toxic headspace and feeling so useless.",20Oct2019,1

For me, it's like a band-aid: if you remove in one push, it hurts a little then it's fine, but if you push slowly you will feel way more pain.

Although it's possibly instead of that once incident being the sole cause of the money shortage it is possible I just miscounted over the span of my shift, I had a concussion not even a month ago I don't think and my heads still been kind of fuzzy since this so it's totally possible my dumbass just miscounted lol. I'm most likely getting written up and possibly fired due to having a verbal warning from some bullshit that wasn't even my fault. I do indeed very much dislike this job, and I suck so bad at it.

31,"Alright, so let me give you a quick run down of this year and how i got to where i am. 

Was with a girl for 4 years, known her for 12 however this year we had a falling out i was an absolute mess however i pulled myself together and accepted what happened was for the best. This happened in March, now roughly in early August i hit up Tinder and i matched with a girl and now Tinder is freaking horrible i hated it but this one girl well i connected with almost instantly. This was so strange to me as i'm really conservative on feelings and i hide emotions. 

We met up and honestly even after i told myself "" No feelings, no falling and definetly do not be that typical guy and be a creep "" so anyways, second date swings around and i kind of told her what my plans in life were and where i stand because honestly i don't want to play around with people anymore i'm 24 and just want to work my ass off and settle down ( rare to find these days )
She had the same ideas, however there is an issue that stands in the way her ex shes unsure where she stands him in the sense of if he improves she would most likely go back. And my reply was "" What if it goes well for a year then the same shit happens again "" 

Anyways, she had to do a bond clean on her old apartment in which he lived in and he done a really bad job on cleaning it. I volunteered to help her because hearing her on the phone crying made me feel like shit, i went over after i purchased more cleaning products and we spent a few hours cleaning and i gave her all the advice i could offer. And it was at this moment i failed my first piece of advice to myself "" DO NOT FALL FOR HER "" well, i failed miserably and now i tell myself "" we cannot help who we fall for "" 

Anyways, i guess what i'm asking for advice on is what do i do? I suck at these waiting games i know thats the whole point in life but is there anything more i can do besides just live my own life until things start to settle down? We are on date #4 this week and that is cooking food for eachother, hella excited and honestly i don't want her being a rebound and i definetly do not want to be a rebound.

The thing is, he literally bullies me, i mean as friends but he's a bit over the top and i'm kind confused with myself since i've decided to deal with it. He always hits me, and not softly , mostly in my head and even tries to choke me like those UFC fighters moves, yeah kinda weird you may say, i never really try to fight back. Also he keeps telling me i'm dumb or shit like that. I deal with all of this since i want to get closer to him and get to know him deeply, like his interests and views in life and society. We have fun conversations but he avoids the ones with deeper meaning (like personal life stuff), i don't force it on him but i want to understand him better.

I don't really know if he likes me, it could be (let's say yes to have hope) . I have asked him why he always tries to annoy me and he tells me is because i am funny, but he does it way too much so there's perhaps a deeper meaning to it.

35," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",20Oct2019,0
36,"(Long post) So as the title says, I had a workplace injury a little over 2 years ago. Basically a coworker accidentally dropped something on my foot and hurt it pretty good. It was all swollen and purple and I couldn't walk very well. Limping super hard, crawling up stairs, couldn't put my shoe on the day after, you get the picture. The night of the injury I went to urgent care, they did xrays and told me there weren't any fractures and that it was most likely a bone bruise, and it just take time to heal. I filed for workers comp cause I was out if work for almost 2 weeks (I'm a truck driver) cause I couldn't safely drive. So, I go back a week later, urgent care says to come back at the end of the week cause it was still swollen and i still couldn't walk well. Another week, they released me to be able to work again and told me to come back in another week or two for a check-up. I did just that. It still hurt, I was still limping pretty good, but I could at last walk where I needed to. They still said it was just a bone bruise, and could take months to heal. With urgent care saying there's nothing they can do, I stopped going and my workers comp closed and I just waited like they said. Now here I am 2 years later and my foot still bugs me every day. I can walk a couple miles, but usually after 10-15 minutes of walking i get discomfort and some pain in my foot and i just end up going back home. I haven't been able to keep up my cardio with running for years, and like I mentioned walking alone hurts, so i can't do that for a significant period of time. I havent worked for that company in a year and a half now. So I'm unsure what I should do. Just use the insurance I have now and see what's going on and see if there is in fact a fracture, and use my own insurance for treatment? Seek legal help since it was a workplace injury (even though I havent kept up with any regular doctor appointments since the month after it happened)? I'm just at a loss and I'd like for it to be healed before it causes any issues later on in life.",20Oct2019,1
37,"I cannot say what and who I'm talking about because I don't know who uses Reddit and I could expose myself, which is very dangerous in my situation. But do you remember that popular post about the guy who broke into a pedophile's house and found a bunch of CP and turned himself in to the police and gave them the CP?  It's not this but a bit similar to this.....  So anyway, I wrote about my desire to commit a minor crime to expose someone for a bigger crime in a notebook (big mistake) my mom found it and read it, she called me to her room and started to cry and started a rant to discourage me from doing this saying,  among other things, that I'm too innocent to go to jail, that I'm gonna destory my life and that it's not worth it. The reason I want to do that is because there's a fucking criminal sitting in a fucking golden throne,  walking with impunity and the self assurance that nobody besides a select group of people know of his crimes. There's a victim suffering because of what he did, a victim who is not believed in because of lack of evidence.  But I can change that, I can change this forever. I can prove once and for all who he really is, I know exactly what he did and I know exactly how to expose him. And time is running against me, I only have two months to do this before it's too late.. But If I decide to do it I'll have to sacrifice myself, there's no way around it.. there's an almost zero percent chance of me not going to prison for 1-4 years. This criminal I'm talking about.. is not your average Joe, he's a rich,  powerful person and he's very vengeful. So yeah.. only a miracle would save me from commiting this minor crime and not get caught.. 

  I was sure I was gonna this but now my mom's rant discouraged me and I have serious doubts.  If I don't do it... I think about his victim (or victims) but I think about the victim I know.. What if **** committs suicide? How could I live with myself knowing I could've done something but didn't do shit? If I do it... I think about what my mom said and the documentaries I watched about jail life, I imagine cops handcuffing me and taking me to jail, my mom panicking and crying her eyes out, I imagine suffering a lot in jail... I mean I'm a short, spoiled, 18 year old white boy so imagine the amount of suffering I'd go through...  Imagining both of these scenarios make me cry.   As you probably have guessed, this a life changing dilemma. I need some serious, well thought advice. Thank you in advance.",20Oct2019,1
38,"My husband has been struggling for the last few months but has finally hit a wall - he is experiencing really bad burn-out (anxiety, chronic stress, cognitive issues, etc.).

This week, he’s gone on a leave of absence at work (starting with two weeks but may extend), is seeing a therapist and has an appointment to see his doctor in the next few days. He’s having a hard time getting out of bed to shower...but we are committed to working through this and he’s going through the steps to beat this thing. 

I’m struggling with how to support him. We have a six month old, and I’m on a year of maternity leave. I had a traumatic labour and have struggled with some mild PPD. If I keep on top of things (exercise, sleep, keeping social, eating well), then I’m great. But keeping on top of anything with a baby is tough...and it already feels like my plate is overflowing with managing a household, raising my son and just generally keeping my head above water (I also have two step children, we have them 50%). 

So, what can I do to support my husband while staying vigilant and aware of my own needs? How can I work on not taking his mood/behaviour/actions personally? Should I be pushing him to get outside and do stuff during the day or is it better to let him rest?

I feel like I don’t have much left to give, but I’m determined to be the best partner I can be for my husband...so any advice is really appreciated.",20Oct2019,1

Taken advantage of by tinder date

Kinda a long post but here it goes. Last night I (23F) went on a tinder date with a guy (25M). We’ve been taking for 3 weeks and finally decided to meet up. We met up for drinks and right away had great chemistry. After a few hours he invited me back to his place (I knew what was going to happen). We put a movie on and soon after began to have sex, which went great. After we do it for the first time, he asked if I wanted to spice it up. I asked what he had in mind and he suggested that he tie me up to the bed and blindfold me. He said anything goes, and whatever happens happens. I liked him a lot and agreeded to it. So he tied up naked me blinded folded me and left. He then came back and began to finger me and eventually he got on top and began to have sex. This lasted about ten minutes and he finished. He then asked if we can go again and I agreed. He then began to have sex with me again but then it felt different. I’ll admit it was better in a way and I came quickly. Then, my tinder date pulled my the blindfold off and I realized it was his roommate who was fucking me. I was confused and said asked what the fuck is going on. My tinder date told me to just let me roommate finish, and I said okay. After he finished my tinder date untied me and we began to argue. He said he’s so sorry and he thought by whatever happens meant that. I told him it was a misunderstanding and that I guess I didn’t know what that truly meant. He apologized and stupid me accepted it and agreeded to stay the night. 

The roommate also apologized and we just all drank and chilled and watched Netflix in my tinder dates bed. At this point we were really drunk and we all fell asleep. 

A few hours later I woke up to someone fingering me and I thought it was my tinder date. I enjoyed it, and soon after he pulled my thong down and began to penetrate me which I didn’t mind. After 5 minutes or i opened my eyes and realized it was my tinder dates roommate inside of me. I didn’t do or say anything and he kept going. I ended up cumming which is partly why I feel guilty. 

The next morning I woke up and the roommate was gone and my tinder date was awake. We ended up having sex before I left. 

I’m not sure how I feel about the entire situation, and I wouldn’t say I was “raped”, maybe I’m just being naive. I agreed to hangout with him again this weekend as long as we go back to my place. Thoughts?",20Oct2019,1
44,"I've been married for over two years now, been with my wife for over six years. 
I joined the military a few months after we started dating. It was always in the plan and I was up for a relationship. Fast forward to me being out of the military, married now and living together. 
Her and I are experiencing this for the first time, we'd never really even spent more than a week truly together before I got out. It's been about a year and a half since we've been living together now. We have had tons of fights that ultimately end in an apology, followed by ""it won't happen again"". Then it eventually happens again, or something relatively close to the same issue... 
We are in marriage counseling now after I went for myself and to simply seek advice. We don't seem to have any common interests anymore and it's like we are just completely different from one another. We have different standards and just different outlooks on life all together. I hate to seem like an a**hole by saying, but I am more driven, I want more than she does. She sees a future staying where we grew up close to family, doing 9-5 things. I have huge dreams, that I'm constantly getting closer to. And it's the fact that she wouldn't want to travel or live that lifestyle. She wants kids sooner than I do now, even though I used to want them sooner. As I got older, I realised how completely unprepared we are on many levels. I've grown up a lot over the past five, almost six years we have been together and she still has a similar mindset as when we started dating. We've grown apart in maturity, we don't have the same sense of humor. To clear it up, if we met today, I don't believe we would end up being married. I'm just really not sure what I'm supposed to do. I believe firmly in making a marriage work, but I don't know what to do or how to even make it work. Counselling was good for myself, but when we went together it ended up to the counselor telling me how sensitive she is and questioning me about how I went through ""bootcamp"" and the military, insinuating that I am too strict like a drill sergeant. This struck a deep nerve with me because the counselor told me in previous solo sessions that ""this would be tough to fix, if at all possible. A long tough road ahead"". 
It made me feel targeted because I, as a man who generly wouldn't go to counseling or cry there, literally broke down balling, and she even wanted to put me on anti anxiety meds. Then when we come back, it's like she completely forgot everything I'd told her. Our sessions now are me just trying to survive them. I now dread what was supposed to help me and homelife could be better. 
I'm at a loss and need advice.

46,"So recently my girlfriend has started hanging out with a girl that in the past has been nothing but trouble, And since she started hanging out with her she has been lying to me about who she has been with and they where guys. She drink almost everynight now and she continues to lie to my face.

We have been together for 4 years, and have been best friends since we where 11. I am 21, and she is 20 now. And we have never had problems until she started hanging out with this girl. 

Shes going out to parties and find every excuse in the book to prevent me from going with, And now she's been talking to a guy behind my back and hanging out with him and constantly tells me that he is just a friend. 

I'm not stupid, But again maybe I am for trusting her. Do you think she is cheating on me with some other man? Either the one shes ""Freinds"" with or people at these parties she is going to a hour away from home?

I'm very lost in life right now and it's just making the situation worse. I recently tried to take my own life because of all the stress and emotional pain that I feel. 

She is not the main cause to this state of mind, But it definitely does not help that I feel like I am alone in this world. I'm a great guy and I always try to be an amazing man to my girlfriend. But it seems she doesnt act the same recently.



Is she cheating on me? Or am I just paranoid?

47,"Me and them dated for 2 years and because how young I was it was considered remarkable how long it lasted. it was honestly amazing and I miss every part of it. Everything was wonderful up for a year but then they wanted it to be an open relationship, and me being insecure and stupid said yes. She then used dating other people as a way to cope from the stress that I come with, since I have mental issues and come from a bad home. My mental issues got worse and I became a clingy jealous person because how little time she was spending with me, that drove her away more. She honestly was amazing and she's saved my life but she just could only put up with so much and her feelings weren't set in stone. Two months ago I broke up with her feeling like I was ready to be on my own. Since then school started back up and ive been really happy working on alot of my issues. Recently my crush freindzoned me, I found out that my ex has a new relationship, and me and them got into a fight. All three of these things have been taking a toll on my including nightmares, everything from my ex and their partner having children together and their partner being nice to me about it (why the nice part is so bad is because I'm a logical person and also one that trys to live with little to no hate for others and so him being nice to me points out the hypocrisy of my negitive feelings towards him, thus invalidating my emotions, Jesus only my dreams are this well handcrafted to fuck with me) to my ex saying still saying they still love me. I've just been feeling so negative, I'm not even enjoying school anymore and I'm having awful thoughts about them making love and just awful things that make my brain want to catch fire. And yes I do understand that I shouldnt have to worry about that she's her own person and she can do whatever with whomststs ever. There are broken fragments of my soul that are still running on old programming from when we were together, and its ruining me. What do i do, I know time is the ultimate cure and its the only thing that can fix this but I need something to make sure I can get through this. I dont have many freinds the only friends that care enough are my freinds which I consider brothers, they hung out with me yesterday and I can count on them. They both work tho and I can't always go to them and ive been looking for freinds at school but people have there own lives and everyone already has a best friend and I've been trying to force myself in that equation but no one will let me in. My ex was my bestfriend and now there gone and I have no love no friends no bio-family and barley any real family.

Despite all of this I'm optimistic and hopeful for the future, I know I'm going to make through this because I'm strong and wonderful and ive been through so much.

I’m currently applying to med school so I am also in the middle of a gap year. In high school I never had too many friends, and then in college while I did have some friends, they are from other states so I don’t see them.

61,"There are a few introductory bits of information I need to put here first:  


I (22M) have had the same group of friends since 9th grade, give or take. some of them I've known for over a decade. We've grown together, done tons of stupid shit together, partied together, etc. However, while many of them still thoroughly enjoy partying and whatnot, I'm sort of on the downslope in that regard. I sort of prefer staying in or having chill nights. Occasionally i'll go out to drink but overall, I just don't really enjoy it as much as they do anymore.  


Also, I'll be leaving the state I live in soon for something, and I'll likely be gone for up to 5 years doing different things, closer to 6. So these next 8 months will basically be it for me and this group of friends for a long time.   


So, here's my issue. I know I only have 8 months or so left with them before I leave. I love most of them, but I just don't relate with them the same way I used to. They want to do things I dont have much an interest in - they want to party when I'd rather stay in - I am constantly working and studying so often times I'm too tired to go out.  


When they ask me to come party with them, the only thing that drags me to go is that I haven't seen them for weeks or more, and I feel obligated to go see them. I also am not in a position to be making more friends outside of them for the time being.   
   
I guess my question is, is it normal to be feeling like this? Does it make sense I'm just drifting apart from my childhood friends? It's a shitty feeling and part of me thinks it's natural but the other part of me is pushing myself to keep them in my life even if we dont relate much anymore.",20Oct2019,1

67,"I’m gonna warm you, this is kinda long. 


I have a really cool boss, let’s call him Frank. Frank is a super chill, doesn’t stress about a lot of stuff, and as long as everyone gets their work done, the job is pretty cushy. Frank is also a very heavy drinker. After working at the job for a little over six months, Frank started inviting me and another coworker, Sarah, out to his house to party. Sarah and I usually go, hang out with Frank and his partner James, drink a bit, smoke a bit, and generally have a good time. 

Franks house is kind of known as the party house in our small town. Everyone knows Frank and knows that if they want to have a good time, they just need to show up at his house on a Friday or Saturday night and they will be welcome. Because of that, each time me and Sarah have been to his house, there have been quite a few people there. One of the regular visitors is Jane. Jane is in her early to mid 50’s, is clearly going through some things, and is a very heavy drinker as well. 

James and I have gotten along really well. We seem to have a lot in common personality wise, as well as our general love for putting on a performance. Since the first night at Franks house, we have fallen into a pattern of getting cross faded and then yelling songs at Alexa until we find one both of us know and then going all out, singing and preforming the songs as if we are in a music video. Since the first night of that happening, it’s been a running joke that I just go out to Franks house to sing with James. And honestly it’s pretty true. 

About a month ago, Frank invited me and Sarah to a drag show. It was the first show I’ve ever been to, and I was super excited because the club it was at also happens to be a hangout for the local lesbian population. I am bi, but have been in a women phase, and so I was ready to go out, have fun, and possibly meet a cool girl. The night went well until towards the end, after the performances ended. Music was playing and everyone was up dancing except for me, Sarah, and Frank. James sees me sitting down and comes over to dance on me. He basically gave me a lap dance, grinding on my legs while I was still sitting down, then pulled me up to dance with him. I’m not a dancer, so I just kind of stood there and moved a bit, but James was being very over the top, bent over, hands on his knees, grinding is ass on me.  I was getting really uncomfortable so I told him I needed to get some air. Me and Sarah left soon after, but I just felt uneasy with what happened. 

Fast forward to last night. Frank calls Sarah and invites us out to his house. As we where leaving, Sarah let me know we had to leave by 11 so she could pick up her boyfriend by 1130. We get to Franks house and see James and Jane outside talking on the back porch. When Sarah got up the porch, she said ‘Hey lovely!’ And opened her arms for a hug. She was taking to James, but I guess Jane thought she was talking to her so Jane opened her arms to hug Sarah. When Sarah hugged James, I could tell it hurt Janes feelings so I opened my arms and said ‘Hello lovely!’ And pulled her into a hug. I could tell she was already pretty drunk. 

We all went inside, fixed our drinks, rolled some bud, and were talking about our day. Our job recently had some new policies put in to place and Frank wanted to make sure we where not having any issues with abiding my the new policy. We talked work for about 20 minutes, and during that whole time, Jane was mad that she wasn’t a part of the conversation. At one point she wrapped her arms around my shoulders and rested her head on my shoulder. I laughed awkwardly, Jane backed up and apologized, and me, being the most passive person in the world, told her she was okay, trying to brush it off and get on with the night. She then grabbed my hand and held it for an uncomfortable amount of time until something happened and she had to let my hand go. 

At that point, James was on a phone call with someone so we were just kind of waiting for him to get off the phone. Once he got off, he and Jane went inside to take a shot, while I opted to stay outside and smoke some more. When I got back inside, James and Jane where ‘preforming’ a song that I didn’t know, so I just stood off to the side and was taking with Frank and Sarah. Out of the corner of my eyes I could tell that James and Sarah where trying to get my attention. They where coming up behind me and playing with my hair, touching my shoulder, pulling on the bottom of my jacket, but I was in a discussion with Frank so I just kind of let it go. 

At that point, Sarah had excused herself to the restroom and the song had ended. I stepped outside to grab my drink and when I came back inside Pour Some Sugar On Me had started playing. I just so happened to be wearing a Def Leopard shirt under my jacket, and knew that James and Jane had saw it earlier before I put my jacket on. I yelled ‘hey I love def leopard’ and pulled my jacket open so they could see the full shirt. Jane then said, “oh my god, I love that shirt, let’s trade!” Then proceeds to take her shirt off in front of everyone. She got the shirt up just below her chin before I could process what was happening and said very sternly “I’m keeping my shirt on.’ I could tell it hurt Janes feelings, but not for long. 

Frank and James where dancing/singing with each other, so Jane and me start singing together. But then Jane crosses a line. She started running her hands down my body, then pulled me by my neck closer to her. I pulled back and she ran her hands down the front of my shirt. She was going lower but I stepped back. I laugh when I’m uncomfortable, and I have a terrible habit of trying to make people feel at ease. It was obvious I wasn’t into it, and she stepped back and started apologizing to me. I tried to reassure her that I wasn’t upset with her, but I told her “it’s okay” and she said “ok!” And grabbed me by my hair at the nape of my neck and pulled me closer to her. I pulled back again and she started apologizing again. At that time I see Sarah come back in the kitchen and give her the ‘I’m getting the fuck outta her’ face and I turn to the back door. Jane starts to apologize profusely, saying that she made me uncomfortable and she was sorry and she didn’t want us to leave, that she was just going to leave. By that time I was already half way out the door, Sarah right behind me. Sarah tries to calm her down, saying we are just going outside to smoke. 

Once Sarah shuts the door behind her I told her, “I was basically just molested by Jane.” Sarah kind of brushed it off by saying “Oh yeah she is being really handsy.” And I said no, then started to explain what happened. Before I could finish, Jane came outside to make a call. Once she got off the call, me, her, and Sarah sat outside taking for a bit. Jane was telling us about where she worked, which is at a women’s clinic, and how if we ever have any ‘kitty’ problems to let her know. By this time it’s almost time for us to leave, so Sarah goes inside to get her stuff. I go to follow her, but Jane blocked the door and stated apologizing again. At one point she said ‘I want you to know I’m straight, but I just find you very attractive and I just can’t help myself.’ She then grabs my hand and pulled it up to her lips and kissed it. I didn’t know what to say, so I AGAIN told her it was fine, and gestured to the door. 

We went inside and everyone was talking to each other. James put another song on that I didn’t know but everyone else did. They where all singing, James was yelling at me to sing along, and I yelled back that I didn’t know it. Jane then says ‘that’s ok baby’ and grabs me by the nape of my neck again and pulled me towards her. I pulled back, and stepped to the door. She immediately started apologizing, I motion for Sarah to come on, then yell bye and go out the door.  I get half way across the porch before James catches me to tell me bye. He give me a hug and said ‘I love you girl’. Because I was turned around giving James a hug I saw Jane come out to the porch and I immediately made a b line for the car. 

Now I’m not sure what to do. Frank has been calling me all day, both on my personal phone and on the work phone. My coworker who I told everything to make an excuse each time he called wanting to talk to me, but now I don’t know why he wanted to talk to me and I am afraid he is going to ask me about Jane. Why am I afraid? No idea. Maybe because I don’t want to make it into a huge deal, but I am also afraid to not tell him. But what if I tell him and he just brushes it off? Is that worse than him not knowing? I just don’t know what to do and need some advice. Am I overreacting? Am I a prude? I know I’m stupid for telling her that it was okay, but my body language clearly said I wasn’t in to what she was doing. And she kept doing it. Help!",20Oct2019,3
68,"So I’ve been in the market to buy a new car and I saw a 2006 BMW 330i with 118K miles on it for $6,000. I’ve always wanted a BMW, but I don’t know much about how to fix cars, etc. my cousin said I should probably not go for a BMW because they’ll cost a lot to maintain, but on the other hand I have a friend who says it’s a solid car.

72,"I know I’m young and from an outside perspective it may seem like my life is just beginning. But I feel so lost and I have no idea what to do with my life, I am currently in university but it’s school that’s my second choice. I’m in first year and my mom is pushing me to transfer to my first choice university because of how good of a school it is, and yes I want to transfer too but I don’t know anymore because do I really want to transfer to a “better” school just for the name and have the same degree? Also I have no idea what to do with my degree in the future I feel like it’s a dead end, I do want to switch programs but I’m not good at anything else and I feel like if I do switch I’ll ultimately fail out of school. I also have no idea what job I want because I don’t really know what I like or what I do like is pretty unachievable. And my social life is ultimately going downhill I have a toxic group of friends who are very competitive in the bad way, and I am trying to make to friends but it’s kind of hard to join a group when you’re the outsider. It just seems like life is meaningless right now and I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m going to school just for the sake of going to school not because I actually enjoy it or anything, I thought leaving high school and entering university would make me happier but so far it’s the same.

73,"I remember being twenty years old and being very depressed. I had only one friend and I felt like I couldn't really relate to her. I had never been in a relationship, had no idea what career path to take, and spent all my time at school, work, and home watching TV to try and forget how behind and lonely I felt. I started antidepressants and therapy to get myself in a better place- which I did mentally and developed a routine- but it was a place of comfort and that's how I spent the following years.

Now I am 25 and I am so embarrassed of how behind I am. I've still never been in a relationship and I can't related to all the other people my age who are so much more experienced than I am. It's embarrassing and I'm too anxious to put myself out there and date guys anyways. I feel like through dating apps most guys just want to find a girl to have sex with, and I'm not experienced with that at all and would actually like to get to know a guy first.

74,"So this is my freshman year of college and it’s been about 2.5 months here. I’m at a small liberal arts college with lots of international students. My roommate is from China, and doesn’t speak much English. This makes it almost impossible to communicate with him. Our only interactions are hello and can I turn the lights off.

Anyway the first month or so was going well but then the smell started to hit. He hasn’t washed his sheets since we got here (yes 2.5 months) and doesn’t take full showers. He just rinses his hair in the bathroom and common area kitchen without any product and that’s that. It was fine at first, but it got to the point where I was on the verge of throwing up when I went into the room one day. Now there’s a fan going 24/7 to try to air out the room and keep the smell away from my side. 

Another issue is his phone calls/gaming. He frequently is on the phone with his friends from China (which I totally understand and appreciate because he needs to be connected with his friends back home) but he’s incredibly loud and this goes on for 3 hours a day in the night. While on the phone, he also plays a video game which requires lots of mouse clicking and he often gets REALLY loud while playing. 

Anyway I don’t know what to do. I told my RA about it but I’m not sure if he’s doing anything about either situation. I also asked some people about the process of switching roommates but it’s complete hell and they make it almost impossible on purpose. What should I do?

TL:DR My roommate who doesn’t speak much English doesn’t shower and makes the room smell awful. He also is on the phone for around 3 hours a day and is extremely loud. I let my RA know of the situation but nothing has been done yet. Any advice on how to deal with this?",20Oct2019,1

Anyways, last night we where all prepared to got up to the city, and even though one member basically sacrificed the night for all of us we waited for him for over an hour and by that time it was too late to do what we wanted. However tonight they all went and did somthing without me, without telling me when they where going to leave. I'm not to good at explaining things but TLDR I'm the 4th wheel and the most expendable clearly. Is it petty for me to no longer to hang out with them?

77,"I took my driving test (Washington DC, USA) for the 2nd time today. The last I took it was last April. 

A bit of a backstory on my experience with driving, just for context: I would say I am a good driver and so would everyone in my family that’s trained me (who’ve driven in multiple states and countries for many, many years). I’ve been practicing ever since I got my permit about a year ago. Except, I have a bit of a problem with nervousness during driving tests. The first time I took my driver’s test, I was so nervous that I failed in the first minute by not checking my blind spot and almost getting into an accident. I admit, that was totally my fault and I didn’t deserve my license back then. This time, I was MUCH more confident and less nervous after months of practice. And today, I felt really wronged by my driving examiner. 

We started off the test really well. I was driving really smoothly. At an intersection, I admit that I panicked a bit and hesitated at a green arrow when the light about it was yellow/red, so I stopped. My examiner said this should be an automatic fail but that he won’t count it. He kept telling me to stop panicking. I told him I’m not usually like the; that I’ve driven with others through multiple states and I’m just a bit befits because of the test. And that I’m much better than before and not usually like this. He also kept asking me questions during our casual chats, like “who taught you to drive” and I said my brother he was like “oh you’re brother can drive” like dude, why do you care. He was quite annoying rude. Anyway, I ignored it. 

The second apparent mistake I made, was I rolled a little over the stop line into a crosswalk (he later said to my sister that I stopped in the middle of the intersection, which was a total lie). 

Finally, the examiner really tried to fuck me over. As I pulled into the parking lot of the DMV at the end of the test, I asked him if I’m still at 18 points (one more mistake and I fail, have to be under 21 points to pass) and he said yes. I pulled into the first DMV parking spot right by the curb/sidewalk and he asked me if I’m sure I’m within the lines. I was sure but he made me doubt myself asking this, like a total asshole. I know he said it on purpose, like reverse psychology to fail me. So I reversed and tried to fix it, even though there was nothing wrong with it. He then told me he couldn’t pass me because I did that, that I’m only allowed one chance to park on the test. So why ask me then if I’m within the lines?! He gave me
permit back and I out of the car and burst into tears. He really mislead me with what he said; and I could’ve passed if he hadn’t done so. 

Another interesting thing to notice is that, and I kid you not, my sister watching the testers the whole time I was gone, said all the non-black people were failed, and that the only person passed was a black girl. We are not racist. We have black friends that we love and also come from a country that has black people too. So I don’t know if this is assholery of the examiners or also racism/powertrip on their part. 

Was I in the wrong or was he?",20Oct2019,1

80,"Bit of context: I'm 17 from Australia (NSW), currently attending a selective school (had to do some dumb test in 6th grade to be accepted) and I just started year 12. If I continue with school, i'll be doing my HSC (Final exams) this time next year. 

At the moment, school seems completely useless to me and i'm not really learning anything at all. I'm just getting through each subject for the sake of finishing and not really motivated to top my classes or even be competitive among classmates. I got into 3D design and animation about a year ago and have gotten pretty good at it. I have also been producing music for about 5 years now and love every bit of it. I could definitely see myself doing one of these for a living, and I hope I really do get into one of them in the future. (if not both)

Recently, I have thought about dropping out and starting a 3D animation course at TAFE as opposed to finishing school then doing the exact same course at TAFE or a similar one in uni. I've spoken to my parents about it but all they say is ""you're wasting your potential... finish school, go to uni and get a proper job."" Now I don't want to sound up myself at all, but i'd be lying if I said I was dumb so I get where they're coming from when they say that but I can't help but use that as fuel to pursue animation and sound design even more. I honestly think i'd benefit a lot from dropping out and getting a headstart into my career but everyone I've asked (aside from friends) just tells me to finish school and go to uni even though I genuinely think this is a complete waste of time.

I came here to hopefully receive some unbiased advice and just wanted to see if anyone else here has experienced something similar and how they dealt with it or anyone else that may be in the same boat as me and what they are thinking of doing.",20Oct2019,1

103,"I am disabled with PTSD and work in a union environment. My boss has a kind heart, but at times she can be very overbearing and stressed out. She has been known to yell and get upset. Earlier this week she pulled me aside after saying something in a meeting when I was ""just there as a note taker"". I only spoke up because she said anyone can put anything on the table for management to consider during the department reorganization. 

Anyway, after the meeting she pulled me aside to apologize for being harsh in the meeting in front of people, and I was ready to drop the issue saying I was just voicing my eagerness to grow professionally... but since I was stressed I got tearful and then she pulled me into the meeting room. I voiced I was ready to drop it and go to my desk, but because I was teary she felt she needed to fix it. I felt like I was trapped in the situation and unable to leave because despite my saying I wanted a break or to stop talking she wouldn't give a pause and was blocking the doorway so I couldn't leave. Since my disability is related to being kidnapped it caused me to cry, and I started to yell and swear since I was in distress and honestly not in my right mind. The situation was very triggering and upsetting and made my symptoms flare up.

Afterwards I left to go to my area and my coworkers were worried, so they offered me Kleenex and were asking if I was ok and what happened. My boss then came up behind us and interrupted our convo completely and made me feel very weird connecting to others after the incident and trying to calm down. After I calmed down I explained to her that I was sorry for what happened but I was feeling unwell and trapped and that had set off my disability, and she didn't seem to understand.

My disability isn't going anywhere, and I feel management has never taken the time to learn about it or figure out how to avoid situations like this. It is up to me to try and learn to better control and get better, whoch I am, but I also feel management should try to learn about what not to do (yelling, raising their voice when admonishing me, not letting me take a timeout/break from a convo or meeting etc.) so that I can stay effective and functional at worse.

106,"My mom has 2 dogs.  One of them is a 14 yo Yorkie (Star) and the other is a mixed breed (Leelou - Cairn/Jack Russell/Chihuahua).  

I have extensive history with Star - I lived with my mom for a couple of years and we got closer than close.  We were also both involved in a multiple dog attack that almost killed her and left me scarred all over my face, legs and arms.  We are tight to say the least. 

My history with Leelou is much more limited. The most I have with her is a handful of weekends that my husband and I have cared for her and Star, that include a couple of weekends from when she was a puppy (like fresh from the breeder).

I usually get them every few months for a night or two.  However, this past month my mom had a close cousin pass away so she needed me to care for them for a week.  At first, it was cute albiet a little annoying having them around. But after the 3rd night I not only got used to it, I really started to enjoy it.  I am super close with star but I also really bonded with Leelou.  I got home tonight after dropping them off (with a whole escape room and dinner in between mind you) and just bawled my eyes out.

110,"Had a day off work and another manager from another area 20 miles away called me to ask if I could get to their site, and they would pay both me and my brother double so i said hell yeah!

Proceed to get there and there is a peice of mechanical equipment we had to use, none of us have been trained to use. I told her while I haven't been shown how to use this, I have used it prior at a different site.

We look for the remote control and we have no luck, so she says she will call the site manager to ask him what to do, whilst outside myself and my brother find the control, and proceed to get it working.

About 2 minutes in she comes into the room asking us to stop using it immediately. We do and it gets jammed, turns out it's broken and the site manager informed her of this while she was out of the room.

She then calls us both out of the room, and then says ""why did you use it? I asked you to wait..."" I said ""no you didnt? You said you would call the site manager... before this goes on do not try to blame this on me.""

She then takes a minute, comes back and says ""I'm sorry I took my anger out on you it's just gonna cost a lot of money"" where I replied ""fine, but do know we did nothing wrong and that isnt fair to blame us"" she, again, says ""I did ask you to wait though, and you haven't been trained so I would never let you use it..."" 

I politely but firmly told her how wrong she was, why there is no training in place at our company for this and if we would have found the remote first before calling the site manager this situation would have happened anyway.

She said ""I'm going to ask both of you to go home, and I'll pay you for the hour you've been here..."" it was a 40 mile round trip and we dont have a lot of money, an hour barely reimbursed the trip. I told her how inappropriate this was, how we are university students taking time out of our day to help her as her staff let her down, and that this is not our fault its hers and sending us home for saying that is unfair and unprofessional  and that I would be calling the regional manager to complain.

She said fine, that she would to and she would get him to call me to which I left. 

It has really pissed me off, mistakes happen and that's fine, but it was clear she was trying to pin this in us by claiming we had not listened, when that was not the case at all, but I'm at the bottom of the rung at this work place and the regional manager is yet to call me, so I have no clue what she's said or how she has spun this, but I know who will be believed.

Guess I'm not sure what advice can be given here, felt massively hard done by and maybe just want to know I was in the right?

I have been uncomfortable working there with him and i was going to stop working on those days he was there and just work at another store. The owner of the store comes to me and says that sometimes you have to be uncomfortable it is a part of growing up. He then goes on to say that he doesn't want me working at the other store he wants me working there. That really didn't make any sense to me at the time, but today one of the workers that works at the other store was outside of the store( in this store there is only one person working there at a time) in his car he didn't bother to get out of the car or anything he just sat there. I found it really strange that he was there on a Saturday after the store had closed and everything. I went in the plaza to do some other things and was stilm there for another 10 mins or so and he still didn't leave so i get in my car and drive a way and so does he.

114,"So basically, i used to work with this girl. We never really talked at work other than a hi or whatever. She eventually quit and we didn't talk to each other again. One day she posted something on her Instagram story about one of my favorite singers. I thought i would reply to it because i didn't know she liked him (the singer) as well. So we basically talked a bunch that night about the singer, and eventually at the end of our conversation, i got her snapchat. 

We snapped back and forth for a couple days and she asked me how im always happy (probably because i smile in all my snaps lol).  Then somehow we talked for a couple more nights after that and eventually it was an everyday thing. We also exchanged numbers one day and then at that point we were texting each other all day and night. We would facetime too every once in awhile. We hung out once shortly after that and we both enjoyed it. Over the next few weeks, it was the same thing, talk everyday and night. We have seen each other around our town (we've both been to each others workplaces, etc). We planned out to hang out a couple more times but things kept getting in the way. 

So at this point, it has been couple months since we started talking. And obviously we were not in a relationship or anything but we we became really close. 

Then all of a sudden, she would take forever to reply. First it was a couple hours, and i didn't really care too much. But then she started taking like a whole day to respond. And one day, i don't know why, but i was in a really horrible mood. And when i checked my phone, she left me on read. I was already in a bad mood so i messaged her again saying something like ""did i do something? you're probably not gonna f\*\*\*ing reply anyways"" 

She obviously got mad at the fact that i swore at her and she still gave me an explanation about how shes been busy lately or whatever. I texted her shortly after that, apologizing. in which i did not get a reply so i texted her again saying that i feel terrible. She said it's fine. I knew it wasn't. I had a feeling that she didn't want to talk to me anymore or anything, and i didn't want to sit around all day hoping she would say something, so i blocked her number and snapchat, which was really stupid. 

Eventually, i unblocked her and i texted her 'hey' or something just so she knew that she wasn't blocked anymore. She did not reply to that and I'm pretty sure she did not add me back on snapchat. 

We started talking in January and all this went down in like April. I think about this girl a lot, like A LOT. We had so much in common and i just don't know  what to do. 

And i know this sounds like a stupid teenage story but its really not. 

Should I just try to forget about her? Or what else should I do that would make sense. I just don't wanna lose her like that. Any advice really does help.",20Oct2019,1

120,"So last night I ( f, 15) went to a sleepover at the place I take martial arts, we had pizza, a bunch of games and I even played dodgeball for the first time (I'm homeschooled).

It was the first time in a long time were I actually felt accepted by my peers and that i could really be myself. It was the best goddamned night of my fucking life!

But here's the thing, the moment I had to leave the next morning I felt so...empty and sad. I had to go to work an hour after I left and I sat in the back of the shop and fucking cried. I kept thinking about what a great time I had, how I wish I could spend more time with those people (they take an after school program that I can't go to bc I'm homeschooled). It made me so fucking sad knowing that they all went to the same school and then to the same classes, that they were all friends and saw eachother frequently, that they would have funny school stories to tell (which they did) while I'm stuck at home all the time, no friends, asshole parents and no one to talk to about it.

 The other thing is, while there I learned that the boy I like has a girlfriend (not surprised, he's fucking amazing), this didn't upset me... (well, maybe a little) it just made me... confused, because I catch him looking at me and he has gotten nervous around me and everyone I explain the things he does to says that he likes me, but how can that be true if he has a gf? I feel like shit for saying this, but I can't help but kind of hope they break up. I feel like such an asshole for thinking that, and I try not too, I just want him to be happy and if they're happy together (never met her) why am I thinking this???

Please, I really need help, why do I get so depressed after something fun? Does he like me or not? Is it selfish of me to kind of hope they stop dating?

Tl;Dr: had the best night of my life, finally felt accepted, next day was SUPER depressed bc I knew I'd never really see those people again. Crush has a girlfriend, acts like he likes me, low-key hope they stop dating and feel like an asshole for thinking that.

126,"I’m about to sound completely insane, but here goes.  About a year and a half ago, I realized I (22F) had feelings for a longtime friend (22M). Ever since then, I have formed an unhealthy attachment to him.

He is quite literally all I think about. My productivity at school and work has nosedived because I’m unable to focus on anything. My mood depends almost entirely on how well my interactions with him are going, and I have become hypersensitive to his actions. Did he reply to my messages? Is he watching my stories? I once had a complete breakdown at a party because I saw him (single, and unaware of my feelings for him) getting overfriendly with another girl.

You get the idea: I’m overly attached. I often exhibit symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks, but only in relation to him. I’ve yet to notice myself experiencing this otherwise. 

Everyone is telling me to drop him and move on, but I disagree. I care deeply for him and I feel we may have a shot at something real - there’s just some growing up to do. And to be honest, this feels more like a “me” problem than a “him” problem. What’s the guarantee this process won’t repeat itself with a different man?

Then he started hanging out with the person I hated the most wherever he went. My friend is going over 3k into debt to go on a school trip with this person. My friend then just stopped talking to me altogether and whenever he says anything it’s to try to put me down. 

When I stopped trying to talk to him was the other day. We decided to hang out and go play basketball at a local park. I got their and played by my self for over a half hour and he wouldn’t pick up my calls to see where he was. He then shows up with this kid and I said “are we going to play basketball now”. He then said “I started walking but then I invited rob and I walked to his house so I could walk him here”. Rob then said “we aren’t going to play that” and he left to play something else with rob. I then left because they wasted my time and my “friend” didn’t even care. 

I know for a fact rob is the reason why because I have overheard rob telling my friend to not talk to me. I have no reason why but my friend went from us hanging out so much that he practically lived at my house for a few days on end. And now all of a sudden he’s being an asshole and now only hanging out with rob.

I know my friend is making a wrong choice since he always talks about quitting smoking or drinking and I’m the only one of his friends who actually tries to help him accomplish that. And not only that but at one point I would have stuck up for him even if it meant me getting mugged.

I’m just unsure and I actually want this to be permanent, but I don’t wanna leave it too long before making a move in case they move to get a replacement lined up.",20Oct2019,1
147,"So at this point I don't know what to really do so I wanted to see if anybody could help me. This is super long btw.

About 2 months ago three boys in my math class started to harrass me. They would yell my name in a mocking tone when ever they saw me, it started in the math class then when I was in the hallways and they would follow me and yell my name mockingly, and even when I walked to my bus after school where one of them screamed out my name half-way across the parking lot. I would ignore them because the one time I did respond to them they laughed at me.
 So I told my mom that I was freaked out and felt intimidated ( I'm female btw and these boys easily weigh more than me and are taller then me, we are all seniors In high school) so she emailed the math teacher about this. my math teacher suggested that I write down times and dates when this harrassment happened and to let her know immediately when it happened during class.
At this point it had been happening for a month and nothing was being done and my grade in the class started to suffer as a result. What really made me take more action was when we had a substitute in class who was not paying attention to anybody. On top of still harassing me they made prank calls saying they lost their dog and if the person on the phone had cooked their dog, yelling allah akhbar ( which means ""god is good"" or ""god is great"") and talking in Indian accents, but what really tipped the ice was when one of them talked about rape and what he would do to a women ""take her to a basement, gag her, and shave her hair"" this was his exact words with other boys around him agreeing. Quickly I requested an appointment with my counselor but she never got back to me until another teacher stepped in to help (more on that later). Later that day a close friend of mine over heard 2 of the boys talking about me calling me stupid and deaf because I never responded to them when they yell my name. 

Eventually I told my english teacher Mrs.P because I couldn't not tell another teacher and I trusted her to help me. And she did when I was in English class about a week after the rape comment I asked to go to the bath room and when I was walking back to class the same two boys that called me deaf followed me in the hallways and yelling my name, sadly no body was their to see this happen, when got back to class I was terrified I told Mrs.P who called the counselor's office and demanded that I talk with my counselor. 

This is about a month and a half in I had talked with my counselor who said I could not leave the class without having an F for the class and on my transcript because it  was too late into the semester to switch.

I went to one of our assistant principals and told him, he said he will talk with the boys, later that week I talked to the other assistant principal about it and he said roughly the same thing as the other AP. Again I have still been writing all of this down in a little notebook with names, dates, times, and had my friend write out what she heard the boys say about me and presented it to both  assisntant principals, counselor, and teacher and still nothing had been done. According to one assistant principal ,one boy did get ISS but they still continue to harass me even with one of them was in ISS.

Honestly I don't know what to do it's been 2 months and I'm still having this issue and have expressed so many time that I was extremely uncomfortable and that I don't want to be in this classroom to multiple people, even when my mom called the actual principal one of the assistant principals called her back and not the person she wanted to talk too. 

Please if anybody knows something that could help me get this resolved that would be amazing. Everybody I have told this too agreed that more should be done to resolve this and that the school is ridiculous.",20Oct2019,1
148,"So I just moved out of my old apartment(was there for a couple months after moving out my parents for the first time) into a brand new apartment on the highest floor. I've got my office and gaming are setup so far. I'm about to buy a brand new car perhaps nice bmw or mercedes coupe. I've got multiple online businesses which require little time to maintain weekly so my schedule is practically free 24/7 or easily modifiable.

I wasn't really looking for a girl when I was at my parents house or old apartment because I felt uncomfortable with who I was and what I had. I always wanted a girlfriend but felt embarrassed to actively seek one because of who I was and what I had. I certainly couldn't take a girlfriend out without a car and definitely couldn't take her back to my parents house. And my old apartment wasn't exactly up to the standards of where I would take back a girlfriend. I've actually put off approaching girls because I used to have a shitty android phone with a cracked screen and was afraid to pull it out. I knew I am capable of having better things and so to present myself as I was obviously felt extremely weird.

Now that I am my ideal self and live my ideal lifestyle I'd like to bring a girlfriend into the picture. I spend most of my time exercising, watching movies or playing video games. I typically go for random bike rides everyday when I feel the urge. I'm physically fit already and very aesthetic in the mirror. I get looks at and smiles from women all the time however I've yet to come across a girl who really woes me physically and with her personality.

I'm keeping a lookout for her but in the meantime figured I'd post this for input on ways I can improve myself for my future girlfriend. I've got everything I want for myself along with cool friends so I'm not desperate or anything. I just figure since I want so much in a girlfriend as far as standards that my dream girlfriend would want something similar.

So tell me women of ways to improve myself to meet and exceed girls typical standards of their dream husbands. I'm looking for as much input as possible please. Thank you.",20Oct2019,1

156,"I’ve been a restaurant/entertainment venue manager for 6 years, and have been in the food and beverage industry for nearly 13 years. Although it is not difficult to become a restaurant manager, based on my experience, great managers are few and far between. In my pursuit to become a great leader, I have tried to become more self aware by asking the team members I manage for anonymous feedback after I have leave a position for a new job. I have been surprised and motivated by the thoughtfulness and number of positive responses I received. It reaffirms the effort that I have put in and makes me feel like I am in the right business. Would it be egotistic if I shared these responses on social media? I will always cherish this feedback, regardless of whether I make it public. I suppose I am just proud, but don’t want to come off the wrong way.

An example:

***** is the most fair and consistent manager that I have ever worked with. He was the only manager that I worked under that would always listened to what anyone had to say. He always knew what was going on throughout the building and was present for whatever needed to be done the most. I constantly looked up to how he handled guest problems.

161,"A current Senior in HS right now who’s contemplating on his future.... (*Post is long; go to TLDR for the summary)

I’m a Procrastinator! There, I said it. I don’t have anymore time to waste. I had 3 years in High School for that and here’s the real deal, Senior Year. I have a lot to accomplish in the next couple of months and yet here I am procrastinating on many levels. My grades: not the best; My motivation: not the best; My attitude: not the best.

I don’t know what happened! Last year, my grades improved dramatically: A’s and B’s every quarter, which made my HS career GPA rise up to 2.8 GPA. Last year, I said that I wanted to get to a 3.0+ HS career GPA if I work hard enough. Now, I don’t have any motivation to go to school. I usually can stay home 1-2 days because I don’t feel like going and that I’m a ‘burnout’ High School Student. 1st Quarter is not well &amp; now I’m procrastinating like crazy!

5 factors that I’ve found that are the cause of my procrastination 

**1) Video Games**
I’m still playing them even though I agreed that I would stop for a while 

**2) Lack Of Sleep** 
I can get around 4-5 hours of sleep on a school night from staying up to long from Video Games and such. I’m more motivated into my game more than my School Work
 
**3) Self-Esteem**
I’m not going to sugar coat it. My self-esteem isn’t the best &amp; I honestly feel like shit anytime I have a Low Self-Esteem moment. It overwhelms me to see everyone getting what they want and I’m still living my 14-year-old life of not doing anything. One day I can feel great for my accomplishments; next day I can feel like a whole other person. It’s a terrible feeling that I haven’t really be diagnosed with.

**4) “You are what you eat”**
Kind of a weird way of putting it, but I eat slot of fast foods. I can go for a Salad once in a while, but then I can go for Chic-Fil-A every other day. Sometimes if I eat too much, I can feel the feeling of eating too much fast food. My metabolism is high, so I don’t gain a lot of weight. But I don’t want my metabolism as an excuse to go crazy on fast foods 

**5) A dirty room**
I keep my room clean. My room is my mood. Once in a while, my room is dirty which makes me procrastinate on cleaning it which also makes me procrastinate more on my other responsibilities (Ex: Chores, Homework).

There’s my list that I’ve labeled myself by. Help me!

TL;DR “* I have a Major procrastination problems which has taken over my life in a way from dramatic drop in School performance to lack of Motivation. I found 5 things that could be in the way of my procrastination. I, also, point out solutions to those 5 things*”",20Oct2019,4

164,"I am 30F. I have always (since about age 5) had a tendency to crush on other people. I almost never find myself without one &amp; it has not changed with age or (unfortunately) relationship status (I don’t cheat—that I can control—but I’ve been infatuated with people other than my boyfriends at the time). It could be someone I know well, an acquaintance or a celebrity. It can last a week or last around a year. It generally only stops when I find a new love object—-and I do realize I am making them objects of my obsession. 

It is embarrassing to think of all the hours I have wasted in my life fantasizing about and “researching” (social media stalking) men I got obsessed with. I have pursued certain hobbies just because I know that would make me more desirable to that person. Like, I was infatuated with someone really into art, so I started an art criticism blog. 

Frequently I even end up dating my crushes which I think is dangerous because it fuels my future infatuations and fantasies—I know I can sometimes make them come true.

I do believe this might be a form of OCD because I end up having obsessive thoughts and it feels almost completely out of my control.

There is a positive part of it: when I have a particularly intense crush, it really fuels me to be the best version of myself I can be. I’ll exercise and work hard and pursue hobbies. When the crush wanes, so does my motivation for the rest of my life.

168,"I'm in a band.  We aren't very good but we make a bit of chump change performing small gigs.  I just haven't been feeling it lately. 

 The band members sometimes unironically make racist jokes; they're all old men so you can't blame them too much.  The sax player is often rude to me when I make mistakes. Last practice he made a gross sexual joke about me.  He also often not so subtly tries to ask if I have a boyfriend.  And he's twice my age - I'm in my twenties and he's in his 50s or 60s.  

They don't really listen to me half the time when I have opinions about things.  Sometimes they do but often they don't.   

I find myself dreading practice and hoping it's cancelled.   However once I get into the practice and start singing I find it fairly enjoyable.  But I'm still looking at the clock and silently hoping the practice will be over soon between the songs.  The main reason I stay is because I love singing and it's my only outlet for performing.   

I wonder if I would be happier doing another band or activity every week instead. I don't rely on this band for income so quitting wouldn't be a big deal.

Tonight I was at his house and planning to crash for the football games tomorrow. I think it's important to understand in all of what I'm about to share that my dad is an alcoholic, and in his past has used drugs such as meth, crack, and other heavy substances. Back to the point one of his friends showed up tonight at his house and apparently had meth? I really don't know because I told my father that I was leaving and had no interest being around that environment. Being that I had gotten dropped off I did not have my car to leave on my own so I had to wait for a ride. While waiting my dad came down stairs to tell me that he was kidding and he wanted to know how I would react. Apparently he had heard from my step mother's daughter that I was into meth. She apparently heard this from someone who knows me through Facebook or something? This completely took me back because I have never done anything in my life except smoke weed. (I don't even drink alcohol as a 21 year old due to alcoholism and mental health problems being very prominent in my family.)

I really don't know what to believe. I also have a lot of issues dealing with paranoia and now I don't know if someone is out to get me or if my father is being sincere (he has a very well known past for being a pathological liar) in what he was saying about wanting to make sure I don't take the same path.

I don't really wanna say what she said but it was something SUPER personal about me in front of my friends. I kinda passive aggressively told her ""you can leave now, no one wants you here."" But then she kept going saying very embarrassing and personal things about me, I swear I wanted to break her effing jaw when she started running her mouth like that, I took a deep breath after my friends seeing me getting more and more angry. I told her that she could go and that no one wants her here. She got pretty pissed at that and called me a pansy who can't take a little teasing. I saw red at that point and basically screamed ""FUCK OFF"". She seemed pretty pissed and was about to say something but then I think we both realized MY friends were over and she just stormed off to her room.

But I really love medicine and health care and just everything about health care and medicine appeals to me from an academic and values perspective but I am worried I wouldn’t get into med or that I would burn out or it wouldn’t be right for me. I also really love practical health care like paramedic or nurse however nursing follows a more caring model and I prefer the medical model and paramedic I worry that I would be always wishing I could stay with the patient after they got to hospital and be more involved in the patients long term care. 

But I also really love the structure of uni and studying and teaching so I considered a neuroscience or related field but getting my PhD and then doing research and being a professor but I’m worried I would get bored and I would like a more practical hands on medical application. 

Essentially I’m an anxious stressed mess and I don’t cope well with not having a plan for my life and I can’t deal with uncertainty in my personal life and job goal (I can deal with it if it’s part of the job) 

What do I do ? I’m 19 how am I meant to know what to do with my life at 19?",20Oct2019,1
178,"I am a nice guy in public, cheery and usually of light disposition. Very polite and rarely confrontational. But I have an explosive anger inside me, it seems like I let it all build up until im at home or in the car in traffic and I just start yelling and cussing and steaming until im red in the face and sometimes results in self harm. And Im a total asshole to my dog, who I love with all my heart and who deserves a much much better owner than me. (Im never abusive, I can just be a dick to him if hes 'staring' at me or wanting something from me. Ill yell at him or some terrible shit like that.) I live by myself (thank god) but Ive let my anger totally derail my everyday life and when Im home im usually yelling at the tv or video games or cussing at shit around the house. 

I hate myself for this and dont know what to do about it, everyone thinks I have my shit together but in reality Im a total asshole. Its ruined several relationships, ruined my confidence, and almost every night I think about killing myself just to give myself the ending I deserve. I want children eventually but am absolutely terrified of still having this anger in me and potentially taking it out on them, I just dont think Im fit for kids or for that matter, a good woman. It makes me want to die, or go live in the woods by myself like a hermit. 

I desperately want to conquer this anger, I dont know what to do about it. I know its wrong and I know its a fucking awful problem, but I just cant seem to get a grip on it. Its ruining my life. I want to find a healthy relationship and create a happy family but I know I cant do this with this anger controlling my mind. Please help.",20Oct2019,1
179,"When I was little (maybe 6 or 7 or 8), my best friend would often want to play a game where she would undress in front of me, then undress me too - fully naked and lightly touch me playing out sex scenarios. This went on for years and I had no idea how to feel about it at the time. She would do this to me while hiding in her closet.

I was curious about it but it made me feel very dirty and ashamed. I never told a soul but I have been dealing with issues from my childhood in general recently and I wonder if this is one I should be addressing. I have been to the same therapists for 7 years and still haven't told her about it out of shame. I still feel too ashamed or as though I am overreacting. Is this normal behavior for children? Am I overreacting? Can a child molest another child?",20Oct2019,1
180,"I’m not quite sure where to ask this but this seemed to be the best subreddit. Im just wondering possible causes for what is described below. 

Ever since I was a kid if people besides myself touched my face I would feel shocks(for a lack of a better term)down my spine. They’re pretty unpleasant and kind of hurt. My back would also sometimes twitch. Situations where this would happen were varied: during lice checks at school, whenever I got my face painted, the one time I got my makeup done; basically anyone anytime touched my face or head. And if you touch my hair, particularly lightly, it feels like things are being slowly dragged across my back causing this painful sort of tingling. 

I’ve never known why this is, but it’s very odd. Any ideas as to why this might be?

182,"Hi. So my name is Zack and I'm a sophomore in highschool. I'm 16 years old and I am just a year or two older than some kids in my grade just to clear up the age gap. Anyways, I've never been the hot guy or the popular kid or the athlete in my school. I've always just been that kid that is friends with everyone and should be popular but I'm not. I don't want to be popular, but recently I got very popular because I got super tall and got really good at basketball. This one girl I have been friends with since about 4th grade is my girlfriend. She has been for about 5 years now. Everyone does not like her but she is always different around me. Everyone calls her slutty or say she's mean but I don't see that. Recently she got mad at me, so she started telling everyone how we had sex when I was around 12-13. Which is true. My school is notorious for beating people up, and recently my closest friends have stopped talking to me and now my girlfriend has stopped replying to me too. In school people never talk to me anymore and it's weird. But yesterday night we had a basketball game and right at the end, the game was forced to stop after she spray painted ""FUCK YOU DRPHIL223"" on the walls in the school. I called her about it and she acted like nothing happened even she was caught on camera. Everyone realized how crazy she is, and today everyone started telling me in school how I should break up with her. She is my friend, and I love her a lot but she has been acting so different these past couple months, it's hard to tell. We usually have fun time like 3 times a week, but the last time she even came over to my house has been 3 weeks. She turned into another person in a short period of time. Please help me.

183,"I dated a girl for almost 3 years and she recently went out to a club and had sex with another man. 
A bit of backstory I started dating this girl in 10th grade she was 15 I was 14 we had a love for each other since the 8th grade but I wanted to wait because I didnt want to waste us on a stupid middle school relationship. When 10th grade had rolled around we started dating I was a virgin she wasnt she had gotten some ""experience"" the previous summer it always bugged me a bit but she told me she had alot of mental health problems and didnt think we would ever be together so she didnt care I knew I had no right to be upset at her since we weren't dating so I didnt hold it against her I just wanted to share a moment with her. we shared alot of our first ""big"" milestones together like turning 16 getting our license out first high school party things that dont really matter in the long run but seemed very important at that time I loved her so dearly and she loved me at the beginning at least as the years went on our lives got increasingly harder I had to move in with my sister because of troubles with my mother and I didnt deal with it in the best ways I got drunk as much as possible and stopped focusing on school and even fucked up a few of my teeth when i was drunk which was a big wakeup call for me to get my life together. During this time her grandmother who she was very close with had died around the same time that her uncle died. I was a bit of an alcoholic at this point while being 16 I didnt know how to console her she was so important to me but I had so much going on and I was not handling it all well. We moved on and after I broke out my teeth I had a bit of a wakeup call I went on trying to get my life together and moving towards a future with her and I would talk about how I wanted to buy her a house and have kids with her and how I couldn't wait to spend the rest of my life with her she would tell me the same. In our 12th year she started taking birth control and that made her very anxious and sporadic in one of her anxious sporadic episodes she told me that 2 times over the summer she had sent nudes to guys she met online. This hurt me very dearly but it was a very tough time in out lives she had to go through the death of 2 family members and I wasnt there nor did I know how to support her so I stomached the pain because I loved her and was so committed to her. After we moved in together things would often be tense I had alot of stress with school and she had stress with school we would take it out on each other and sometimes we would fight and she would break out in tears. When it would get to this point I would try to bring myself down and hold her and tell her I loved her (I never abused her physically or emotionally it was just fights about stupid stuff like the dishes but seemed like the end of the world at the time) I always tried to make her feel very loved by telling her that she was very beautiful, sexy and calling her by her cute nicknames that I knew she liked when she would come home from work I would pick her up at the door and hold her and carry her to our bed because she liked it and she would tell me about her day I really tried to make her feel beautiful in times I know she wouldn't believe me like when she woke up I would tell her about how much of a beautiful woman she was to me and about how loved walking up next to her because of how beautiful she was and how much I loved her. We didnt have sex as much because i was always stressed and tired. She started going out bar hoping with a friend from high school and I encouraged her because I knew she enjoyed it I didn't really like the way she dressed I found it was a little too much skin but I wouldn't say anything because i wanted her to feel free and like she could do anything with me because I trusted her and she trusted me. One of the nights she went out clubbing i had gotten a little high around 10 because I knew they probably wouldn't be back for few hour when I woke up it was about 3:30am so I texted her and she assured me that she was safe 4 rolled around so I texted her. No response I texted her around 5 again. No response I periodically texted her for the next hour and when I didn't get a response I called her until she answered me. She said she was sleeping on some guys kitchen floor because her friend wanted to have sex with his friend I got in an uber to come get her but I could tell something was wrong I could tell in her tone and even more so when I saw her. We held hands in the uber and I gave her water and fed her pizza before she went to sleep which was practically a routine at this point. She went to sleep and I did the same when she woke up and her friend had left she still seemed like something was wrong so I pushed her assuring her that I'm always here for her and she can tell me anything. She told me she wanted to break up. I was okay with it I loved her and wanted her happiness more than anything so if that's what she needed to be happy I was happy to make it smooth on her. We agreed to have ""one last Saturday together"" which just meant I would order food and we would sit up in bed all day holding each other and watching movies before the food even arrived she told me that she cheated on me. The way she described it she made it out to be that a man took advantage of a drunk girl by trying to put his penis inside of her but she refused and went to sleep in the kitchen. 3 or 4 iterations of the story later she told me that she wanted him to do it and while i was texting her she went from following her friend to the apartment to having a shower and sleeping in the mans bed even after he tried to put his penis in her mouth. After he put his penis in her vagina she went to sleep in the kitchen. She later told me that she wanted him to do it because he made her feel loved and feel sexy by calling her ""radiant and gorgeous she told me that she still loved me and wanted to get back together but needed some time and she still wanted to see me she encouraged me to get a tinder and I encouraged her to get one aswell we had sex for a bit but when we weren't having sex I was often depressed about the situation and the fact that she almost instantly started talking to new guys  sometimes the sadness would result in me breaking into tears. after a few repetitions of this she told me that she was ""tired of feeling sad and tired of me bringing it up all of the time because we've talked in circles enough"" this was incredibly difficult for me to hear I wanted to tell her that I hated her and that she was a whore who fucked a guy to fuck other guys and be allowed to do it. I didnt because I still cared and even if she had no compassion i still did. We're taking a full ""break"" now even though there is no way I'm going back to her even if she is going through therapy. I'm starting therapy this week but I feel like I need to tell someone the truth about what happened because its frankly killing me. I know she has some mental issues and I always said that no matter what happened between us I would always keep it between us. She however has broken every promise she once made I don't know what to do I can't tell anyone in my family because I'm still a good person.

186,"So a bit of backstory, my \[19M\] best friend \[19F\] have known each other for 8 years, and we've even dated 2 years out of those 8. These past couple months we started our freshman year of college, and it shook up our friendship quite a bit. We love each other, but we're not dating anymore, and we probably won't for a long time--if ever. However, we remained the best of friends despite our breakup. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the actual problem. She's been feeling horrible at college lately. It's kinda too far from home, she's not making any friends (even though she's amazing at making friends) and she's just generally stressed and having a horrible time at this college. I've tried to make it better for her, and I even ended up making it worse at one point because of severe oversights on my part, but that's not really the point. Point is, she's decided that she's going to transfer to a college closer to home. I should note that I'm not trying to be selfish here. I really, truly want her to go wherever makes her happiest. We're on fall break at the moment, so we're back in our hometown, and she's gotten a small taste of what it's like to go to college back here at home over fall break, and great news: she loves it! She literally went to one cool little concert and made friends easy, found a bunch of people she likes--totally different from the college we're currently at. And so now she's pretty much decided she's going to transfer. Now I should also say that I don't want her to transfer, personally. I don't want her to at all :( She means the absolute world to me and it's so freaking hard to imagine life without her. We've been through thick and thin, and so much of my life is made up of her at this point. However I haven't told her this, and I don't plan to either. She's not going to stay if I ask, and I want her to be her happiest anyway, so telling her would just make her feel even worse. So I've recently been coming to terms with the idea that I will probably lose her as a friend, and most likely as my best friend... I feel so freaking awful. I've been in physical pain all fall break just thinking about not having her in my life anymore. My heart literally feels like it's being crushed. I'm not doing so hot at this college either. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do. It's been impossible for me to make friends, and everyone in my dorms gets crossed every weekend or goes to frat parties. (just not my crowd) I feel so freaking lonely and so lost and I just don't know how to deal with any of this. Of course I want to make friends, and I want to have new, close relationships with people in college, but that doesn't change the fact that my best friend means more to me than anything. I love my family, my sister, my mom, my grandparents, (love my dad but he's an asshole) but I really freaking love this girl to death. I love her romantically, sure, but I also truly love her as a person and I'm gonna miss her so much that it's physically hurting me, and she hasn't even transferred yet! I guess the point of this is to ask how to cope? Or what to do? I've been sad before, and I would go so far as to say that I've been fairly depressed for a long time in my life, but this is like nothing I've felt. It feels like she's dying to me lol. UGH. I just don't know what to do. Help?

My moms definitely been acting strange lately, but I always just assumed it was from stress (new job, new house, new family, hip surgery etc). Turns out it wasn’t from stress, it was from Coke. She’s always been a bit out there, like trying weed a couple times with me and my buddies and drinking a lot but never in a million years would I have guessed she has a coke problem. It all started at a friends party supposedly and spiralled downhill since. She says she’s doing it about 10 times a day now which seems like a lot but I’m no coke expert. I called her husband, my step dad  after finding out and he seems really supportive but I’m still questioning how he let her get to this point if he’s known for that long. I don’t know what to do besides be there for support. She’s admitted she needs to get help and go to rehab but I just want to hear from someone who’s been in the situation before.

This my first reddit post.

I meet a guy n dating site. We were dating for 2 months. I wasn't really open up to him about my past and about myself. And he was also like I don't really care about ur past.

One day while talking about meeting my friends i told him few things about my past which i thought he should knew before going ahead. But after that things got awkward between us and he asked time to think about it.

His reasons for breaking up with me was ""he don't trust me becoz i m not open to him"" but after breakup we thought we will stay friends.

But after we both went on a small trip with his friends we hooked up but i thought it was a onetime thing.

He showed interest in hookup with me again. But i said no.

I don't know what is in his mind. He still treats me like his girl care about me and everything. It's like nothing has changed except exchanging I love you. He s not forcing me but he s right there and it's hard for me resist given my feelings for him still there.

195,"I had a co worker who would verbally harass me with sexual statements at work. This continued for about 4 years. Random times, sometimes with co workers there, sometimes not. I already know I should have reported it early so it wouldn’t happen to others, but I wanted to advance in the company and didn’t want any trouble. I just didn’t say anything or sometimes would go along with it to avoid confrontation, but I’ve never been comfortable with it. 

A month ago he left to work somewhere else. I was relieved. A week ago, he came into the store. Someone said he got fired for sexual harassment. So I finally told my manager about the harassment. La di da, it was fine, he’s never gonna get hired again. I told a friend I trusted, who told his girlfriend. Yesterday I heard from my friends that the gf was telling other people about what happened to me and that I reported it to a manager. I confronted my friend and he said the gf won’t tel anyone else. 

I’m torn. I want this to be over and forgotten and I just want to move on with my life.

196,"I'm not a manager/employer and I don't know this kid well or his family, so I'm not sure what my best approach is on this.

I was working today when I overheard this kid talking and goofing around with another coworker when he suddenly asks if the other guy has ever hated himself so much that he ""wanted to just blow his brains out."" My other coworker just laughed it off and said he's never felt that bad.

Cut to a short while later, the kid in question asks my other coworker if we have a nail because he has a shotgun shell in his car. I know next to nothing about guns so I'm not even sure what that means. Before I could even think of something to say, they resumed goofing around. The rest of the shift he would make small comments like how his favorite football team is the only thing that makes him feel happy, and domestic issues at home. Everyone at work already knows he recently had a bad break up and struggles with saving money. 

I always take things like this seriously because of personal experience, but this kid has always been known as immature and obnoxious. He likes to be loud and makes fun of everyone and everything. He's not a bad kid, but like I said he's just really immature, so I have doubts my manager would take it as seriously. She's a little immature herself and avoids responsibility where she can. I feel like she would just say it's just a joke and let it go.

I'm not sure when I'll work with him again, but I'm not even sure how he would handle it if I talk to him. He usually ignores people who aren't his friends in general. He'll just look straight through you and do whatever he's doing.

Honestly, what leaves me the most unsettled is that a week ago, before he made any of these comments, I had a dream that I went into work and found out that he killed himself. I had never entertained a thought like that before and I hadn't worked a shift with him in a couple of months.

Next week is Intramurals and I’m doing scrabble since all I want to do is use my wide vocabulary and spend the week walking around, eating ice cream, and cheering my friends on during sports competitions. I’m an A student and I’ve come to the point that I don’t study for Algebra anymore. Maybe if you could give me a really good writing prompt or another weird but not expensive hobby (cuz I’m broke) then it would help. But for now I’m just staring at this phone screen doing nothing and I hate doing nothing. I woke up at 6am today and I haven’t done anything useful except chores. I want an obsession, it’s nice to live for something. I’ve never had a crush or an Idol to look up to and as much as I love my parents it’s complicated so I lost my view on them ages ago. I’m not in any romantic relationship whatsoever so I spend my time being a guidance counselor to friends and strangers because I’m bored. I love debates but no one really wants to put up one atm since were resting from a stressful week. (Random fact: I laugh hysterically when I’m anxious and only ever curse when I’m at the brink of insanity so when I had to go up stage to act I was the incarnation of swearing backstage, everyone was surprised since I almost never swear unless it was really bad... good thing it was only my close friends who were back there with me)

Anyways so yeah any weird hobbies that don’t cost much is ok for me (is already a DM btw I do it with my sister and brother when they got nothin to do usually during sembreak or summer but we do it every Saturday)

I know I may sound like I’m ungrateful I am not I love my life I just want another purpose again. I’m the kind of person that sticks by something until I’ve reached the highest level or the highest position or if I feel like I’m ok with it and I’m ready to move on to the next one, but I swear I’m loyal to friends the sad thing is I’m the one that always gets backstabbed but I’m ok with it I wear a shirt with a big target at the back that says “stab me” 😁. Anyways so yeah whoever finished reading this thx and I hope you live a good life most people won’t read this far (I would though out of curiosity and/or boredom)",20Oct2019,1

Hey guys, I’m having a problem when it comes to moving out.

I (18M) want to live in the pacific north west since I like the outdoors and the quietness of it. Right now I’m living with my parents in Virginia. The problem I am having is deciding on how I am going to move out. I would like to move out fall of next year. 

I’m thinking about going to community college for a semester, get straight A’s, then go to a university somewhere out west. I’m hoping that community college will cause them to pay for half of my tuition because my parents don’t want to pay for it because it is too expensive.

However, I would feel bad if I made my parents pay for a higher education when all I want to do is move out and meet new people in a new town, and not for educational reasons and to live that “college life”.

My parents are going to move to Tennessee in 2 years and I don’t want to go with them this time. I’m currently just working a part time job and saving up. I feel like I need to start building my individual life.

Any advice? Thanks in advanced, and have a great night!",20Oct2019,1

205,"This is kinda dumb because I'm always writing these same posts. But I don't understand why I have zero ability to motivate myself or have passions. The only time I enjoy myself is when I'm doing something with my friends- thus I can't be happy while alone, I can't entertain myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

I used to like programming, I wanted to learn the guitar, I play video games. But I can't force myself to start or finish projects, I can't force myself to learn to play even though I own the guitar, and I only play video games to distract myself- it's not really fun. I can buy a new game and actually feel like its fun for a good few days, but the appeal wears of and its not worth that kind of expense. I cant want to get ahead in school- I always do the bare minimum to turn in assignments on time every night and then fuck off for a while. I had a project due in my computer science class that I didn't start until three days before it was due, I had a month to start it. I am supposed to love this class, it's literally just make a project you pick every month or so and turn it in. But I lack motivation to cut up my work and just do it responsibly even. It's not affecting my grades, but it affects my stress I guess. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every time I post something like this I'm always told its depression. And sometimes I'm in a really bad place and can believe it, but at the same time its so fleeting and confusing. I've been happy for a few weeks now, or at least not upset I guess. I don't understand what a therapist or doctor could do to fix me. I don't have traumas, my parents are supportive and frankly my life could be perfect- I'm very lucky to be in my position. And fuck it I dont really want to ask my parents for help. I dont understand any of this. I dont really know what to expect for advice but thanks for any help anyways.",20Oct2019,2

208,"Hey Reddit!
I‘m in a strange situation right now, where I‘m noticing how I‘m slowly turning into a mess, but I don‘t know what to do. This is a rather long one, maybe someone can find the time to read through.

So in the past couple of months I always felt kind of left out from my friends (like they‘re always making plans amongst themselves, doing inside jokes and texting regularly etc.)
The strangest thing was when we had a last evening together before a very good friend of mine and I were moving to Berlin for university. My friend got various small gifts form them as a departure gift. I didn‘t get anything they didn‘t even know I would be there.
So that’s why I‘m already feeling left out.

But now university started of course I tried to find new people and I did get to know some. However I also feel kind of let out, because again I‘m never really invited to something. And when I do get invited I‘m kind of left alone. (no one to talk to etc.) But also I‘m not really a party person like I feel self conscious to dance or talk to other people.
Meanwhile my friend is always invited to house parties or birthday parties of people she doesn’t even know.

So yeah I really feel left alone right now and got serious worries about wether I‘m going to find any new friends or just staying with those few at my home town.

Does anyone know, how I could work this out and stop worrying so much?",20Oct2019,1

213,"So I've been trying to adopt a cat and a local rescue has a couple cats I'm really interested in. I filled out and submitted an application on September 20th, got an auto email that said they would take around 5-7 days to process the application, and to contact them if I didn't hear back after 10 business days. I had made a mistake on my application and sent an email letting them know, got a response to that email on the 28th just saying thanks for letting them know. I assumed that meant they had at least gotten to looking at my application. Didn't hear anything back until October 5th when I got an email saying sorry for the delay and asking if I'm still interested in adopting. I emailed back within 10 minutes saying yes. I've heard nothing since then. I sent an email on the 13th asking for a follow up, and have gotten no response. Each time I've gotten an email from them, it's been around 8-8:30pm on Saturday. 

There is no phone number listed for this place, and no physical address, so I can't call them or go to the business. They have a Facebook page, and have pretty high reviews so I guess this isn't a common issue, but they haven't posted in about a month and Facebook doesn't give me the ""this place usually responds in \_\_\_ hours"" message so I don't know if they would be any better about responding to messages there. 

I'm starting to get pretty frustrated with the lack of response, and I'm very tempted to just drop this whole thing with them. I've put in applications/asked about adopting at a couple other places (and no response from any of these places either...), but this rescue has some really great cats that I really want to at least meet. Should I just keep sending emails and hope they eventually respond or at this point is it likely they just aren't going to at least anytime soon? Any tips for getting my email answered, like what time of day I should send it or what I should say in the email? I was thinking of at least including my phone number so maybe someone can call me if they want to. I use gmail, so I can't mark it as a high priority email, but would putting something like ""response needed"" in the subject line be appropriate? I just want to know what's going on so I can either plan to adopt from them or start seriously looking elsewhere. Thanks!!",20Oct2019,1
214,"Im at my wits end with one of our dogs.

We have 2 dogs, ones the mumma dog who gave birth last year in feb and we kept a female pup. 

6 months ago I had a baby. She arrived 12weeks early so her and I spent 3months in hospital away from home. 

Since being back the mumma dog keeps escaping our property. We have a 1.8mtr fence and everytime we thought we'd figured out how she was getting out, there would be a new way. We've since found out she is actually just jumping/climbing it.

Fortunately we live in a small town and she comes back or someone phones it in that she has arrived at their place. 

With a ""newborn"" with complications I dont have the energy for a Houdini dog. Then when shes missing the other dog is miserable, and I wreck myself with worry that she will get hit by a car or shot by a local farmer if she heads towards their sheep. 

Ive grown to a point where I resent her. I find myself hoping she just wont come back home. Then I feel terribly guilty, because I love my fur babies.

We have purchased an invisible fence, but I have to wait till my partner has some time off work to install it. 

This has been happening for the past 3 months at least once a week. 
Any outside time has to be supervised or on a chain otherwise shut inside. No way for a dog to live.

I'm 16 now and have social problems and a hard time communicating because they never really brought me up right, I honestly feel like my girlfriend is better to me than my parents ever were. Every so often I would end up having random bursts of anger but this in no way compares to the anger issues I faced when I was in elementary school and I think that I get my anger issues because of something from how my parents ""raised"" me. Now that I'm older I can now properly understand and read through my parents and I can truly say that my parents are pretty much complete scum of people, my dad is always drinking and talking about how many girls he fucks and is like always checking out girls no matter when or where we are(I know this because every so often he takes me out along with him to hang out with his friends) and my mom is always really ignorant and locking herself in her room singing, pretty much through my brother's 3-5 years I've had to take care of my brother and my sister because my parents would ""have better things to do"". I've come here to ask for advice from some other people who may have come from similar situations and see what I should maybe expect for the later bits of my life after coming out of such a bad parenting situation.

226,"Hi I really hope this uploads because I don't trust my wifi connection right now. 
Anyway my mom sister and I are currently at a family vacation in egypt. Our hotel is pretty cool. There's lots of activities you can do and there are pools and a beach. These activities are lead by so-called ""Animators"". 

On our first day I was asked to play waterball by one them (J) . There weren't enough people who wanted to play so he got another animator to be the goalkeeper (M). During the game J started calling me ""Shakiera"" (i have no idea how to write it) for no reason. Since then J only ever calls me ""Schatzi"" (something like the german version of darling) and M only refers to me as Shakiera. 

This caused some confusion because T (who teaches arabic lessons) thought it was my actual name and was really confused when he found out it isn't. Even though M knows my real name he insists on calling me by his nickname. Everytime he sees me he smiles or waves and yells Shakiera. I actually think it's funny and also kind of cute. 

So yesterday evening we went to watch the show which is every night. Before the shows start there's always a singer and all the little kids are dancing on the stage or infront. Suddenly M comes up to us, pulls me with him to the stage and wants me to dance with him. I'm a really bad dancer but he's pretty good. He is smiling at me the entire time and after the show he pulls me with him again for the Bolognese (when you make a line and grab the shoulders of the person infront of you and then walk. I only know this word for it) and the group dance afterwards. It's pretty funny actually but i'm a really shy person and being in the spotlight like this makes me kind of embarassed so I'd never participate voluntarily. 

I'm aware that his job requires him to be friendly to the guests and to animate them to participate in activities but i haven't seen him act like this with anybody else. I don't want to do anything wrong because he is really nice and i dont want to seem like an asshole or an idiot.

228,"The context is really long, but it's really important to understanding why I'm so upset. I do have a TL;DR, but it might not be sufficient to answer the question.

In late 2015, My grandmother (my dad's mom) passed away. I was very close to her and going to stay with her and my grandpa were some of my best childhood memories. Then, in May of 2016, just over a month before my 16th birthday, my mom passed away. She had MS for almost 15 years and breast cancer for almost 4, which ultimately took her life. She was only 50 years old when she died. She was my absolute best friend in the world and I love her so so much. She was such a beautiful person, and a great mom.

So that kind of shattered my entire life, losing two of the people I was closest to in my family in less than a year. And it shattered the lives of the rest of my family, too. I have two older sisters (we're all 2 years apart), 3 living grandparents, and an uncle. The rest of my family is not in regular contact, or not at all in contact, with my immediate family and I.

My dad. He loved my mom very much. He was basically her caretaker when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. He begged his job to let him work from home 24/7 for her. He basically lived for her. And when she passed away, he'd lost both his mother and his wife within months. It's fair to say we were all kind of, like, not really people at that point. Just shapes floating around, going through the motions. But my dad was still my dad, and I was still a kid.

So fast forward about 5 months, and my dad is talking on the phone 24/7 with a woman. He's making health-tonics and stuff. Being kind of normal, I guess, but not the same. Around the 6 months post-mom's-death mark, he tells us about this woman and how he thinks he might have feelings for her.

This is where the problems start. See, I don't know about anyone else, but 6 months does not seem like an appropriate amount of time to go from losing the person you planned on spending the rest of your life with, to wanting to date again, and talk on the phone all the time with someone, and, get this-- this is really the kicker, so strap in: move across the country for someone.

My dad was going to move to Arizona. We had lived in Illinois our entire lives. I had just started my junior year of high school, I wasn't trying to uproot my whole life to a hot, dry desert just because my dad wanted to go there for work. Oh, yeah, he lied to us about it, too. He said it was for work.

But you know who lived in Arizona? The woman he was talking to.

So lots of arguments, fighting, crying. A family meeting that ended in my middle sister driving her and I to Target just to get away from him. Snooping and finding out more secrets and ultimately just being miserable and also trying to survive at the same time.

My dad packs up his car and goes. 

My oldest sister did not live at home at this time, so it was just my middle sister and I at our family home, which our dad was still paying for and everything. The plan was that he would send us grocery money and take care of us, just from afar.

So I basically lived alone for Junior-Senior years of highschool. My sister spent 6 days and nights a week with her boyfriend's rich family. The day that she spent at the family home was spent taking me to the grocery store.

I struggled so much. Teachers had me forge my dad's signature so they didn't have to fax back and forth with my dad and stuff. My dad missed so many things because flights didn't line up.

And I was the only one who suffered for it. My sisters had their lives going on, they had distractions and support systems. I had a dog that eventually got taken away from me after 6 months because my sister didn't want to deal with it anymore. They didn't understand my anger. They thought I needed to get over it.

After I graduated, I was forced by my dad to live with him in Arizona for over a month. He told me it would be a couple weeks, but no, it was over a month. I missed out on so, so much to sit in my room and sleep for over a month. We fought nearly every day, and I begged my sisters before I went and while I was there to talk some sense into my dad, but they didn't care. The first week I was in Arizona, I met my dad's girlfriend. Not the woman he moved there for. And then at the end of that week, he had broken up with her and began dating the original woman. (I would later find out that they had dated and broken up several times within the time he was in Arizona. She was also a crazy b\*tch and I do not say that without meaning it.)

I finally made it home without killing myself, and I was pretty content to just live with my oldest sister and her boyfriend who ended up buying our family home from my dad.

Then my dad decided to move back to the area and get a home nearby where he used to live. As soon as my sister knew she could, she kicked me out and forced me to live with my dad. I couldn't say no, because my dad is the only reason I can afford to be alive. Without him, I would not get necessary medical treatment. I would not be able to live.

TL;DR My dad left me alone at my childhood home in Illinois Junior year, 7 months after my mom died, so that he could go fuck multiple women in Arizona. After I graduated HS, my oldest sister bought the family home and a year later kicked me out when my dad moved back to the area. I was forced to move back in with my dad, and I'm so angry and upset and confused because nobody in my life seems to care about what he did or be angry about it. I have to act like I'm so grateful to have my dad and everything when he was a shit parent before he left and is still a shit parent. I rely on him heavily due to illness and am just stuck. I learned the hard way that nobody cares about me enough to help, and now I can't even help myself.

Am I wrong to feel so angry? Am I wrong to be so, so mad at my dad and everyone in my family for letting my dad abandon me? Am I crazy or is this really fucked up? I feel like I'm the only person in the world who cares. And I have no idea how to deal with any of it. I mean, therapy obviously but like Jesus Christ, why am I the only one who is so hurt? I don't know if I'll ever be able to recover.",20Oct2019,2
229,"Huge wall of text coming, so bare with me.

I was very close friends with Hope for many years. One night, about 8 years ago, we were talking about future weddings and I told her she would be my maid of honor. Flash forward a few years, and I start to notice patterns of behavior that weren't super great. She would take her anger and frustration out on me often and I would have to walk on eggshells to avoid making her angrier. We lived together and I was constantly on edge. But she was my best friend. I knew she didn't mean it so I just let it go. 

It's important to mention that I met her when she was dating her (now) ex-boyfriend Jacob. I got to be extremely close friends with him and he's like my brother to this day. Well, after they broke up, I stayed friends with him. Eventually he met a new girl, Serena, and we connected from the second we met. While initially Hope and Serena got along, there was a lot of tension later on. I ended up getting roped into some drama that was between them and as usual, Hope took it out on me instead of talking it out with Serena. It permanently damaged our friendship and I told her I didn't want anything to do with her. I didn't speak to her for nearly 8 months. All I wanted from her was an apology and it took her 8 months to say ""I'm sorry for taking it out on you."" I forgave her, but have kind of kept my distance since and kept our interactions to a minimum. This happened around 3 years ago. Since then, we've only hung out a bit and I don't speak to her much.

In the meantime, my friendship with Serena grew. She married Jacob and I was even in their wedding. We created a real bond and she has treated me better than any friend I've ever had. She treats me nicely and is there for me when I need her. She doesn't expect me to worship her when she does something nice for me. I started seriously planning my wedding and I asked her to be my maid of honor thinking that Hope would know that wasn't going to be the case.

I was wrong. She mentioned it off handedly in front of a bunch of people at a totally inappropriate time and the absolute silence that came over the room was deafening. Serena later told me that it was okay if I picked Hope and she would understand but I told her that's not the case. The shit Hope did to me was so wrong. She missed my graduation after she promised she would be there. It took her nearly a month to even ask if I was okay after my mother died. She posted on FB for my birthday but didn't bother sending a personal text. She never comes to visit at my house and I'm constantly expected to pick her up at hers if I want to see her. I told her I found my wedding dress and showed her a picture and then 20 minutes later she said she told her mom that we could all go dress shopping together. It was like what I said didn't matter. 

I don't know how to break the news to her. I know that in my opinion she hasn't done anything to ""earn"" it. She has hurt me over and over again and Serena has been my rock for years. I know Hope is going to lose her shit over this.

How do I tell her without completely destroying whatever is left of our friendship?",20Oct2019,1
230,"My psychologist asked me this in our first meeting. I immediately said no even though I have thought about ending my life every day since I was 8 years old (20 years ago). I once hinted at my depression to my boyfriend many years ago and he told my boss, who then asked me if I wanted to die because if ‘if this was true, she’d be forced to have me committed.’ I told her the boyfriend was lying to her and then promptly broke up with him. 

Disclaimer: I am not actively suicidal. I simply think about it when I am depressed. 

I want to make the absolute most of my time with my psychologist, but I do not want to say anything that will get me put away. I’m in an extremely competitive graduate program where every hour is vital and I can’t afford to miss out on days or weeks. 

Could you please tell me what a person can expect if they tell their psychologist that yes, they have suicidal ideation? I’m in western Canada, if that matters. Not sure if psychologists have different requirements in different regions. 

Thank you in advice for your thoughtful comments.",20Oct2019,4
231,I was texting this girl and she asked if I was a Virgin and I said yes and she left me on seen. We’ve been friends with make out benefits for a while now I thought it would be fine. Someone got a guess on why she left it on seen?,20Oct2019,2
234,"Especially with friendships. Every time I start believing that I actually have a friend, the same thing happens: For no reason at all, we kind of start drifting apart.

It always starts the same way: they don't respond to one of my messages for a couple days, so in order not to be annoying, I stop texting them. Then they come back, with some excuse as to why they didn't talk to me. I just ignore that and keep on talking to them as if nothing had happened.

It's all downhill from here. It starts happening time and again. All of a sudden they no longer make excuses. They just answer as if not paying attention to a friend's message for days and days is something completely normal. Sometimes they even see it and answer a few days later. Afterwards, inevitably, comes a day when they see a message of mine only to stop answering. And they never come back.

It's as if everyone just kind of tolerates me. Nobody has ever taken the first step. I'm always the one who has to look for friends or talk to the ones I have and haven't talked to in a while, etc.

And I'm tired of it.

I'm also fed up with seeing how people in general seem to make ""friends"" (at least superficial friendships) so easily. It's sincerely heartbreaking to see how most people react way more positively to others in contrast to how they react towards me.

I guess the question is... What do I have to change so that people actually want to talk to me? I'm apparently going to become friendless again. The last time I became friendless was because I wondered what would happen if I stopped taking the first step in talking to the ""friends"" I had. The result?

He still kept his spirits up and believed he could achieve remission. He never complained. Not once. The cancer never took his will to live, not even in his last moments.

240,"I recently transferred from a community college to a 4-year school an hour away from home. I studied computer systems and worked for two years in a local school district IT department. For about the last four weeks, I've been feeling really down while I'm on campus and I lack motivation to do much of anything. 

My social life here sucks; I only talk to two people regularly, not counting my roommate or my friends back home. I feel unwanted most of the time. I feel like an outsider because, while I'm a junior, I know almost nobody in this school where there are already well-established friend groups.

I'm visiting home this weekend. I have an essay due tomorrow, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going back in time to finish it, by my own choice. In that class, I already have a D and I don't see myself improving enough to fix it. I have two other large projects due Tuesday that I do plan on completing.

I had this thought twice before, and it came back on Friday. I think I'd be better off dropping out of this school and going back to finish my Associate's degree then getting a job. I can live on the wages of jobs posted in my area with an Associate's degree. Most jobs which require a bachelor's degree are managerial jobs, something I am not prepared to tackle at age 20 with just 2 years of experience. To add to this, I'm learning skills very unrelated to my intended career. 

I'm starting to doubt that all this stress and debt are going to be worth it in two, four, or even ten years from now. What are some things I should consider to make a well-informed choice? 

TL;DR: I have an essay due tomorrow at 5 PM and I don't plan on doing it. I've lost faith in this class. I want to drop out and go back to get my Associate's then get a job. I'm not sure what to do.",20Oct2019,1

243,"Alright lads, so I(16f) work part time at a family owned diner with less than 20 other people. Front of house we’ve got my boss, A(19f) my friend B(16f), another gal, C(18f),and the person who made me cry, D(23f).
So D is dating B’s brother and lives with them, and about a month ago started working at the diner.
Five minutes into her first shift and she’s acting like she owns the place. She suggests a ton of new systems, from closing checklists to how we clean things, and even though I’m above her in the chain of command, she gets mad at me when I try and suggest things. For example, at one point she stacked baskets of food on top of each other and when I suggested that she use a tray she dismissed me. She constantly uses “that’s how we did it at McDonalds” as an excuse for her screw ups. 
Of course my boss loves her. Since she’s the only other front of house worker who doesn’t go to high school, she works five nine hour shifts every week. Every time she messes up she’s excused. A few nights ago she messed up on till and wouldn’t admit to her mistake, the  started yelling at the kitchen staff for getting annoyed with her. Rather than apologizing to the chef she yelled at, she apologized to me and then turned around and said she’s just tired from commenting 5 hours a day. No one asked her to commute that much, and it’s not like there aren’t more job opportunities in the city (the diner is on a small island town). 
Ive also been informed that she talks about me behind my back! And not the normal “god, today Milo wore the ugliest shirt!”, she told B’s mom that I’m a bad worker.
It’s kinda funny, the 23 year old juul addict is making fun of a 16 year old with the same job as her. 
But regardless, it hurts. I have a really severe social anxiety disorder and can’t stand knowing that the same girl who smiles at me and treats me like a friend goes home and lies about me. I’m not a bad worker. There’s a reason I’m the one called first when someone can’t make their shift. 
Now everyone knows A really really adores D. What we didn’t realize was how much she favored D. Earlier today, I broke down crying in the middle of my shift because someone asked me if I was ok and I guess hearing about D talking badly about me to strangers was getting to me, because I started sobbing. The friend who asked if I was ok, asked A about D and I and, quoting directly from that friend, “Because Mili doesn’t work as many hours as D, she doesn’t really deserve to feel disrespected by her.” So finding that out hurt A LOT. Knowing my coworker didn’t like me was manageable. Finding out my boss doesn’t think I’m allowed to feel disrespected hurt so much more. 
So after crying in the bathroom for about half an hour, I finally grew a pair and talked to the owner of the restaurant. 
Of course I was dismissed. “A really does respect you”, “we can all learn from D”, “I think we all need to put our egos aside”, “being 16 is rough”, and my all time favorite “all of us have anxiety”. In a about a week, or would have been approximately a year since my last panic attack. I was really happy about that. A’s comments caused a really bad one. 
But anyways, sorry for the long read, I just want to know if I should quit and find work somewhere else? There’s another job opening at a sandwich shop and they’re pretty desperate for workers. I’m really considering going there. 
TL;DR, boss doesn’t think I deserve to feel disrespected, owner of shop doesn’t care, and coworker is just really, really, mean and fake.",20Oct2019,1

He goes to my school so we often see each other the days where we both have school. During our first vacation I found out that he was gay but not out. I waited until after our vacation to tell him I knew about his secret and he was completely shocked. I didn’t tell him that I was gay until weeks after when he heard a Grindr (gay app) notification sound from my phone. From that point we became even more close, now sharing our gay experiences with each other. He’s been on and off (2.5/3 years) in this toxic relationship with this guy who’s extremely abusive and manipulative and has threatened his life multiple times. Being a good friend i of course let him know that this isn’t worth the trouble regardless of how amazing the sex is. He agrees but somehow always finds himself back over there. Anyways, during our second vacation we ended up getting super drunk one night and hooked up. The next day we acted as if nothing happened and continued on enjoying the rest of our vacation. Till this day we’ve never spoken about it, which is no issue for me at all. So here’s my problem, I being the dumbass that I am developed a strong liking towards this guy and I’ve tried to ignore it in hopes that it’s fade but I just can’t seem to shake this feeling. He calls/texts me basically everyday, we know each other inside and out. He tells me EVERYTHING about his on and off again situationship and stresses that he despises the guy. 

So basically my question is, should I pursue him which might ultimately damage our friendship? Or should I just let it go and not say how I truly feel? Or should I express how I feel and leave things in his hand?

At the beginning of the year I was enjoying it well enough and doing alright grade wise, but now there’s only a few weeks left, I really dislike studying it and am honestly very likely to fail. 

I have been researching other majors and minors I feel interested in, mainly in the biology sort of area. Biology is something I genuinely enjoy, both being in the class and learning about it, I even kind of like studying biology. Seeing as I am likely to fail chemistry I will almost certainly move onto a biology pathway where chemistry isn’t a prerequisite (there’s multiple I can choose from).

I’m doing well enough in other classes to be able to fail chemistry and still meet the requirements to be allowed into my university of choice.

My problem is, the time I have to put into chemistry right now and the stress is also making my grades suffer in other classes. Would it be a bad idea to essentially put chemistry aside (will still make a little bit of effort for it) to focus on my other subjects? Is it stupid to choose something I enjoy over something which could lead to more success if I managed to pass?

275,"basically a few months ago, in april, my school counselor had recommended me to go see my doctor to talk about my symptoms and to see if i can be prescribed medication since her therapy along wouldn't help. i went to the doctor to talk to them about it, and i guess due to my previous medical history, they wanted to see if there could be anything that would have been causing me to feel the way i was feeling. after doing a blood test, and receiving the results, we find out that i have iron deficiency so i get given iron tablets to help with me feeling tired. 
i took the tablets for the recommended time, and did not end up feeling better, but didnt exactly say anything due to me thinking therapy would help me, which it didnt. these past few weeks specifically have been absolutely terrible, ive been feeling like shit and i had an attempt/s at taking my own life last week, my friends being the only people who know. 
after this happened, and me telling my friends, they recommended me to go and see my therapist (i stopped seeing him because i wanted my family and such and such, to believe i was better, but that didnt end up working out). and i ended up doing that. 
last week i saw him, and told him i was having suicidal thoughts, which took me around 5 minutes or so to actually say the word (i didnt tell him about my attempt), and i was going to talk to him about seeing if i can start taking medication and recieve a diagnosis, but there wasn't enough time. 

the thing is, im going to see him again on thursday, and i would like to talk to him and ask him about it, but im fearful that if i talk to him, then its going to be a repeated issue of what happened with the iron tablets issue, and then ill end up feeling even worse. 

because the only thing is im fearful that if i ask him, then he'll say its something else, or i ask him and at the very least get diagnosed, but then thats it? and we'll continue therapy which honestly doesnt exactly help me, and hasnt been helping me for the past 2 years now. 


does anyone have any idea on what i can do? or if i should even ask him about it?",20Oct2019,1
276,"Throwaway account. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for bad formatting.

Anyways one of my close friends owns a small border collie. He’s had it for only 4 months and he’s been treating it VERY poorly. He brought it out of pure impulse. I told him to wait and do research first, but he did it anyways. 

For one, whenever I would come over, he would leave the dog in it’s cage for HOURS and HOURS on end. When I would take the liberty to get up and let it out, he would tell me to put it back in, because the dog “annoys him.” Second, he NEVER takes it for walks. (He lives in an apartment, so he can’t just let it outside like someone with a backyard could.) When I tell him, “Hey, maybe you should take Daisy (the dogs name) for a walk,” he says “No, I’ll do it tmrw.” And I KNOW for a FACT he doesn’t. He also doesn’t have the correct bed, or supplies/equipment for it. The dog just sleeps on a towel or the hard floor. :/ The dog isn’t very well trained yet as well, so sometimes it pees on his kitchen floor. When it does, he yells at it, and one time, I even saw him kick the dog. (Not SUPER hard, but still.) When I’m at his apt I find myself tending to the dog MYSELF. I take it on walks, feed her, cuddle/pet her, etc. I mean, I love dogs, so I don’t mind; but HE should be doing these things.

This friend works from very early in he morning till usually 8/9 at night. He lives alone. So basically the poor dog is home alone ALL DAY. When he comes home he’s too tired to tend for it. I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel so bad for this dog. Every time I try to tell him to step up his game he tells me it’s “none of my business.” Imo, this is literal animal abuse, but I don’t know how I could handle this without causing a lot of trouble.

Next thing I know I wake up after having blacked out and I'm about a few hundred feet down the road with a Ford  in my backseat.

285,"Hi, so I'm using this new account because I don't want it linked to my main account.


My (17M) sister (13F) told me yesterday that she's been throwing up her food for the past month and that she's trying not to eat. She told me that there are some days that she doesn't eat, and as her brother I'm really scared for her. She told me not tell our parents because she is scared of how they're going to react (they're not from r/insaneparents but my mom sometimes exaggerates some situations, so she's scared it will happen) and I had to promise her that.
She's very conscious about her body (she thinks she is fat but honestly she really isn't) and very depressed as we live in a foreign country that she really made her home for the last 3 years but we are returning next July and she has no friends in our home country.


I don't want to break my promise to her so that I don't ruin her trust in me, but on the other hand I know that she must talk to someone about that, because obviously at my age there's nothing I can do to make her healthy again. I had to force her to eat some rice and chicken now because she hasn't eaten all day (it's late afternoon here) and she did after 15 minutes of trying to convince her. I'm also trying to convince her to speak to my mom but she says she doesn't want to.

289,"So I (19F) have had a huge fear of getting blood taken since I was about 13, this was the first time I needed bloods done. The doctors struggled with me for a year trying to get me to do it but it just wasn’t happening. After being yelled at by a doctor they finally just gave me laughing gas and it was all good. 

The thing is I’m not afraid of needles, I can get vaccinated no problem or needles in my mouth. It’s touching my veins that’s a problem. I don’t even touch the underside of my elbows or wrist or neck, I can’t I cringe. 

So anyway, I need to get a blood test done again to check if I have a certain illness, but I can’t do it unless they knock me out or drug me up. There isn’t anywhere that can do that though. I was living in a different country the first time I got my bloods done. 

My parents said that they want me to go to cognitive therapy, to solve my phobia of veins (and also glass shattering, another phobia of mine). They said they’d rather me solve the issue than have to have problems all my life with getting bloods done. I don’t think therapy is going to help me. I’m a very self reliant person as in I never ask for emotional help from anyone. I can’t explain it but basically I’m a wall and no external input reaches me or has any affect on me.

290,"I just need to vent because I honestly don't know what to do. I have very severe social anxiety, to the point where I get physically sick. For two years, my boyfriend (36m) and I have lived in my apartment together and have never had someone over because I'm so anxious about people in my personal space. Our apartment is also an open studio loft with no door to the bedroom, so theres nowhere to hide for time to myself.

My boyfriend's very close friend (42f) is someone he briefly dated. She's very sweet and we've met a few times, and I really enjoy her. She mass texted a group of people around midnight that there was an intruder in her apartment, made sexually threatening statements, and police were on their way. I sent my boyfriend to go check on her.  She  understandably isn't comfortable sleeping at her apartment alone, and I said it was okay for her to come back here if she had nowhere else to go. So, here she is. But she lives an hour away, and he drove her here instead if having her drive her own car. He's working all day tomorrow, so it's just me and her as of 7am tomorrow.

So now, for all intents and purposes, my boyfriend's ex is crashing on my couch and has no way home unless I drive her or wait until 8pm tomorrow night when my boyfriend is off work. I really didn't think this through.

I'm glad she's here because she's safe, but that has not been relayed to my inner anxiety about social situations. So now its 4am and I'm so stressed I'm physically sick and just locked in my bathroom. I have problems with my stomach and ate horribly at a party earlier so it's compounding the two and I'm throwing up nonstop. There's no way she can't hear in this small apartment, so you can add that to my anxiety, too.

I have errands to run tomorrow and she can come with or hang back, but what I need are tips to get over the level of anxiety I'm going to feel while she's here. Again, I agreed to her coming and I'm glad she isn't in her apartment alone. I'm actually shocked at how severely this is affecting me. Are there stealthy anxiety reducers I can do? Like gifs that help you breathe or something? I think at this point even someone just validating my anxiety would help.
 My boyfriend feels awful because neither of us expected this to be my reaction, but he thinks I'm upset that he brought her here which isn't the case, and it's not like we can talk about it because she IS right here.  Oof.

TLDR: boyfriends ex is staying with us tonight because there was an intruder in her apartment and she had nowhere else to go. I agreed and I like her, but I'm having crazy social anxiety about it to the point that I'm physically sick.",20Oct2019,2

296,"Hello, me and my partner moved into our first flat (renting) about 3 months ago now. I am a disabled woman, my disabilities get worse during winter time or when I'm cold.

The property is single glazed with no central heating. We also have a damp and a mould problem that was here before we moved in but is now spreading from not being able to open the windows due to how cold it gets. When we viewed the flat I did look for mould but couldn't see any, and we were told that there was none, but once we moved in and moved some of the furniture we were provided from previous tenants we noticed the mould actually in the carpets.
Also the sink is starting to come off the wall, it looks like it came off at some point before we moved in and a previous tenant has tried to stick it back on. There are cracks in the ceiling too which aren't letting in rain or anything but look like they might eventually. 
The shower also doesn't work properly. The hot water goes from boiling hot to freezing cold so I've had to go back to my parents just to shower.
We were also told when we viewed the property we would be supplied with 2 electric heaters, but when we moved in we were given one that had the wires cut and the other didnt heat up at all.  We are both first time tenants so  a lot of these were things we didnt know to ask about and didnt think to look for. 

Our flat is really cold all the time to the point where I'm basically bed-ridden, and even my partner is starting to get cold now (he's normally not affected by the cold), and the mould has already started to give us breathing problems (constant coughing and wheezing).

On her birthday which was quite close to the start of the school year he got her a really cool tube with drawings on that led up to the day of her birthday and also got her some art suppies (she loves art) and took her to get ive cream. They used to go home on the dlr together every day after school and sometimes they went out to the park or shopping somewhere. 
But gradually over the months he started to slip away. He didnt talk to her as much. He started going home with his other friends and she couldnt get a word in. Then in the summer holidays everyday there was sonething he was doing something stopping him going out with her. 
And more recently he forgot what day her birthday was, didnt get her anything, and isnt coming to her party.

Recently we've been discussing cheating and what either of us would do if it happened. He said if he ever did he'd instantly tell me because he'd feel horrible. He also mentioned how he doesn't fully trust himself, in case there was a situation where a woman was pushy and forced her presence onto him. He says he doesn't worry about me doing it, just himself.

Ever since knowing this and me acknowledging that I had felt thing, this has made me very uneasy in the pit of my stomach. I know for one, it's a highly possible situation because of his past (as in, him freezing and just going with it) and another thing that bothers me, is that by telling me 'this information and possibility' is he preparing me for the future? 

I'd really appreciate all the help thrown my way.

Recap: boyfriend had bad sexual experience, freezes, scared it will happen again, not sure if he's preparing me for it to happen.",20Oct2019,2
310,"In my junior year two years ago I was a gossipmonger who didn't know her rights and wrongs. I befriended this guy who would talk with me and one day he told me that this girl we knew lost her virginity to him. This was a big deal as it really hurts a reputation of a girl especially in my country, and could really affect her relations with other people. One day the girl and I were in a room alone and she started talking about how it really was all a sham and nothing of it was true. I really didn't take her word for it and acted as if I didn't even know about the situation. I later talked with a few close friends of mine (two, to be exact,) and of course word would spread. Every now and then I still feel horrible for all of these falsehoods I had started and even thiugh things quieted down I knew the girl obviously hates me. Rather than anything I just feel ashamed for my actions and wish I could do something about them. I'm too ashamed to confront this girl and I still feel like I'm too reckless for any action. I'm scared of how she will react to me bringing up these things again, and more on how this may effect my family's reputation as well.",20Oct2019,1
311,"I was at a friends apartment having a nice quiet night just me and him. We’re both dudes who drank together and I’m still a little bit buzzed so I’m sorry if I have trouble making out what I want to say. (Also I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting and what not)

Anyway, we had a few drinks and he tells me before I even get inside his house that this package in front of it is sent to the wrong address. This intrigues me. This, paired with the idea that the package has been there a while tells me that nobody is coming for it. When I decide to go home, I pick up the small package and get excited about what small item is inside. (I know that by this alone you all probably think I’m a horrible person but these are very abnormal circumstances. I don’t usually just take people’s packages because I think that’s wrong and I especially would never take something so valuable.) So I get back to my place and I open the package to see a new iPhone 10. It’s got a little card for setting it up and everything. Its even nicer than the one I’m writing this on. But it’s not right that I have it so I want to return it. 

What I want to know is, How do I return it without getting in trouble? If the answer is that’s impossible then I don’t want to return it. I may have the correct address but it was shipped to my friends house. I have the phone number but I don’t want them to be able to track me through my phone number and get me into serious trouble. I really want to do the right thing but not more than I care about my future. The last thing I have is the name which is not much help. Please help me do the right thing so I can wipe my hands clean of this whole mess. I’m not a bad guy and like I said, I would never do this under normal circumstances. I don’t know what came over me but I do feel incredible shame",20Oct2019,1
312,"This sounds so dumb but I promise this is a real argument my boyfriend and I just had.

So... I like spoilers. I literally look up the plot of movies and tv shows before I watch them. That’s just what I like to do and it makes me super excited to see what’s going to happen. I know it’s not normal and nobody gets it but that’s just what I like to do and how I love to watch things. I think it just comes down to how much I loathe surprises so ever since I was really young, I’d look up what happens in stuff before I saw the movie or show or read the book. Kind of how some people would rather read the book before seeing the movie or some people would rather see the movie and disregard the book. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for a while and for as long as I’ve been with him, anything we watch together, I don’t look up. He doesn’t like spoilers so I steer clear of telling him anything I might already know anytime we watch something together that I’ve already seen.


So tonight, we were watching Breaking Bad (it’s one of his favorite shows and he’s watching it with me before watching El Camino) and I asked him something and he started saying he wasn’t telling me anything so I said I’d google it and he got upset at me. I’m sitting here explaining to him how I just like finding out what happens beforehand and it makes me more excited to watch things and he’s like telling me I’m wrong and that he is incapable of understanding why I am the way that I am and it really hurt my feelings.

He’s like “you ask me something every time we watch an episode” and I’m like “YEAH, BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW.”

Finally, he told me to just look things up without telling him I know plot points and saying he’s not going to “facilitate this” for me and I told him he was being ridiculous and acting like I’m trying to score drugs or something. I told him I didn’t want to watch anymore because I was tired but now I’m in bed and I’m so upset, I can’t sleep.

Am I being ridiculous? What should I do?",20Oct2019,1

This is how radio stations and nightclubs know what songs to play; ""pop"" music is short for popular, and it refers to the top 40 songs on that list, so what can be called pop music actually changes every week. I downloaded all of these songs to use for my DJ gig at my former elementary school's Halloween dance, and out of everything the kids only knew like 3 or 4 songs. So I had to resort to mostly line dance/EDM, hip-rop, R&amp;B, reggae, and reggaeton that was really well-known or even several years old.

But as soon as i do something wrong, even a tiny thing she gets mad at me and overreact things. For example one time after lectures i was playing TFT with friends and she kept trying to make me unfocused. When i told her i want to focus on game to not lose(i didnt say go away) she got mad at me, left room and for next 3 hours was angry at me. 

I know its normal in relationship to fight sometimes but this shit happens everyday.

Today is her birthday. We sleep toghether and when we woke up we started cuddling and i said to het happy bday i wish this and this. She had cold hands and i said please warm your hands before touching me. She started to touching my back instsntly and i jumped out of bed. Went to toilet and started cleaning myself after night. When i came back 10 minutes later she was again mad at me. Didnt wanted to talk and was as always scrolling instagram without answering my questions.

My timing wasnt maybe best but i told her its enough for me iam not gonna apologize to you this time( you need to know i always apologized later even tho 80 percent of time it wasnt my fault).

316,"Probably not worded properly because I’m really stressed out. My brother, he has good intentions, but has a personality disorder that I think basically prevents him from experiencing any form of empathy. It’s been really stressful because his actions from his mental health get him kicked out of basically any secure situation, jobs, work etc. as far as I know right now, he’s homeless. My mental health is not good right now either, so I tend to avoid any stressful situations until I’m sorted out, including having my brother in my home. He has no sense of personal boundaries so he does some extremely stress inducing things. (Taking your prescription pain relief without asking you, playing your computer all night). Anyway, to the point, I was at my mums house two hours away, and he called her and asked for me (which is how I know he knew I wasn’t home—it was our little brothers birthday). He basically said he’s in my driveway, has to catch a train and needs to charge his phone  because it’s about to die. I’m extremely stressed and upset because I set boundaries like this because I need them, but he constantly breaks them and I just don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or not by being upset.",20Oct2019,1

322,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for nearly a year now and for the most part things have been good. He is very sweet and loving and loyal and it is evident that he cares about me a lot but the biggest issue I have right now is that I think he has ‘yellow fever’ or whatever you want to call it. He’s a huge weeb and really into Japanese culture. He always wants to eat at the same Japanese place, follows Japanese and other Asian cosplayers on instagram, is learning Japanese, uses 4chan, is visiting Japan soon, watches hentai and Asian porn, past relationship was with an Asian girl and would want to move to Japan and I’ve tried to not let it bother me but I can’t help it. I have this fear that he’s only with me because I’m Asian (even though I’m not Japanese though) as he seemed to fall for me really quickly even though I used to blow him off often. I’m even kind of embarrassed to introduce him to my Asian friends as I’m worried of what they’ll think. Is it horrible that this part of him disgusts me?  As he always defends japan and its culture and people and thinks so highly of them and it’s just so frustrating. I also don’t want to be seen as some self loathing Asian that worships white men or something as I find that so disgusting.

323,"Before I get into what I need advice on let me introduce who I am. I am a 16 year old (almost 17) Australian teenager. I still think despite my age that my problems are relevant.

So for the backstory; About 18 months ago I fell in love with a girl, lets call her BK, BK was this gorgeous girl with the most beautiful blonde hair and hazel eyes. We had been talking for 2 months already and I knew I wanted her to be my girlfriend. So I confessed my feelings to her. To my surprise she said that she also had likes me but needed time as she had recently got out of a very toxic relationship. I understood that and decided I would wait for her to be ready. Big mistake. Fast forward 3 months and we are still talking except the way she talks to me is flirtatious. She makes me think she wants me and that we have a relationship just waiting to happen. But yet again she tells me we can't date as she has feelings for someone else aswell. I'm a little sceptical but I keep it to myself and say whatever. Fast forward another month or 2 and suddenly she is dating the guy she had just met. Now let me put this into perspective in the months we were talking I had gone countless nights without sleep to help her with her problems and emotions and suicidal thoughts. Never once did she try to help me and now she had just started dating someone she just met after telling me she didn't want to date me when she liked someone else. I thought it was all bullshit and cut her out of my life. Recently more shit has been brought to life as one of my closer friends showed me screenshots of chats between BK and my friend basically contradicting everything BK ever said about me and showing that she never liked me and only kept around because I gave her attention. After she found out that I was shown this she decided to defend herself, pin everything on me and verbally abused me. At this points I had enough and cut her out for good. Thats the BK stuff explained now let me introduce you to LK. LK is not related to BK at all. LK is a girl I met at a party who I instantly hit it off with. To keep this story short I basically have been talking to her alot and could tell that not only she liked me but I liked her only thing is I keep doubting every feeling I have and pushing them away afraid to get attached to LK and afraid it will end up like BK situation. And not only that buf LK has now been texting me less frequently and only texting with one or 2 word replies. I'm afraid she's losing interest and it's been effecting alot. Ontop of all this I no longer enjoy previous I hobbies I used to (Gaming, Making short films, Reading and making conspiracy theories) it all feels like a waste of time and I find myself just laying on my bed doing nothing.

If you've read this all I thank you. I just need some advice because everything is stacking up and I can't hold onto all this any longer. If this is all stupid and I'm overreacting please tell me.

Thank you again

My family flown down to see me, which is a huge deal because that is their first time ever doing so.

My sister felt it was appropriate to hash out old issues which I explained to her about my depression and selfish task about helping her while I was taking care of my terminal husband. Note that they refused to come down for the wedding giving them a year notice. 

I was ready to berry the hatchet and start small again. But she wanted to talk about that after I cremated my husband that day. I am greatly disappointed that she didn't let it be and just be here. I wanted them to just support me and not bring things up. I even got his family to tell stories about my husband to honor him, as a way for them to get to know what kind of man he was. 

I feel lost, exhausted, sad , upset, and angry. I made her cry when I told her this is not the time and slightly inappropriate. I said it calmly.

I have a fiancé for the past year.
He is my buddy my moral support and he got me out of that hell hole and saved my soul. Pushed me to see a psychologist and even when i am a bitch he says he loves me no mather what..

I have been with my fiance, today, for 5 years. He has autism spectrum including ADD. Its not an excuses its a cause of certain behaviours. He doesnt clean much, doesnt cook much and he keeps postponing fixing up certain parts of our house we have been having for 2,5 years now. 

It drives me crazy, i get so angry from the inside and like a child i need to ask him everyday to clean out his plates, his wrappers, used games all sorts of stuff, something his mom had to do up until the point he left the house. We went to a counselor together because i told him i would break off our engagement if he didn't change or use medication to keep his head under controle as that is a problem. He doesn't want medication, we got a set off rules, i try to be more patient, react more kind and i keep reminding him that we both have to go by these rules...it went fine...for awail.

He hates valentines day, he never says i look good or my clothes are nice and said that he did not feel like celebrating our time together only on certain point like 5, 10 etc...because of previous realtionships and i have kept my part of that. 

Today is our 5 year anniversary, i was up at 8:30 already but left him in bed intill 10:00. I went up asked what he wanted to eat. He didn't know...asked if he wanted to go out tonight for diner, he didnt know...it's 12 in the afternoon he didn't congratulate us being together, he is still in bednon his phone and i am feeling so sad from the inside. I love him, so much and i know this is my side of the story not his...but things like this make me want to throw a bucket of water over his head. literally. I don't know what to do with this and am i overreacting?...

335,"Hi Reddit, and hello r/Advice.

I apologise in advance for any spelling or grammatical mistakes, I'm very uneducated.

First some background on myself, I'm 23 and male to female transgender, I'm 4 months into HRT and it's been a slow process filled with unfortunate events. 

I started dating my SO April 19th 2018, we used to be highschool sweethearts and she broke up with me back then because I told her I had always wanted to be a girl. 
She said some awful things and I said some awful things as well. 
We were 16 and I don't blame her for calling me a fag. I'm sure it was a surprise for her. But this was the person I thought I could tell anything to, so it did hurt she told everyone in my highschool class that I was a faggot crossdresser. I dropped out promptly and spent alot of time at home. I've since forgiven her for what she did. 

But she says what I did was unforgivable. For perspective what I did was start talking to other girls and denying I was trans while calling her a psychopath to my friends.

Years went by and my friends slowly faded, a girl asked if I was the dude who dressed up as a girl at a mutual friends party. So everyone clearly thought I was trans even though I denied it. 

At 18 I started to embrace myself more and started to experiment with other men. 
me and a close friend exchanged oral drunkenly after a party and we never spoke again afterwards but it left me wanting to find someone more like myself and naturally in a small town I resorted to checking the Craigslist hookup ads. I talked to a couple people and they all seemed incredibly creepy and more just wanted to fantasize me in woman's clothing. 

But I met a person who pretended to genuinely care and it ended in a sexual assault which left me completely unattracted to men and permanently scarred. I didn't talk to anyone and I didn't try to be a girl anymore. I buckled down on my masculinity and worked on my car and helped my mother and her husband get their property cleaned up and fixed. But I still couldn't help being scared anywhere I went. 
I couldn't work a job out of fear and I was completely unable to socialize.

In the beginning of 2018 my brother had moved back into town after being 3 states over with his wife for the prior 6 years. He was openly pansexual to our family and I had to listen to everyone make fun of him and his wife behind his back. But it always made me feel closer to them somehow. Like if anyone would accept me it would've been them. 
He started inviting me out for drinks and to play pool at the local dive bars. And me just wanting to get out of the house without being completely alone and terrified started going out with him and his wife

St Patrick's day rolled around and I was at the bar with him. Even though I don't drink ( I went to play pool and hangout) we were outside smoking and my ex from highschool walked in and we met eyes. I told my brother I was leaving and that it was because my ex just walked into the bar, he understood and told me to drive safe. 

A few hours later I received a friend request on Facebook from my ex. And then that led to messages the very same night. Which led to her apologizing for her actions and my apology as well.
Weeks went by of us talking everyday and she turned out to be really supportive of me being transgender and helped me stop denying it. However I never told her about my sexual assault. I don't feel like its something you just blurt out to people in regular conversation. 

We started meeting, she taught me how to do makeup and we were full blown dating after a few months. We've spent almost every waking moment together since April 19 2018. It felt amazing knowing someone cared for me and actually accepted me for who I was. 

But little did I know she had picked up the drinking problems her parents have had. She would drink an 18 pack every other day leaving the day in-between to recover and clean up whatever mess she made. I should've seen what a massive red flag this was at the start of our relationship. But I was blinded by the acceptance and just being with someone again. 

I bought a brand new mattress for myself with what little money I had from doing odd jobs for my parents, ive never owned a new bed until then. And the very first night she spent the night she drank so much she pissed herself in her sleep leaving a giant stain in the center of the bed. I later learned that she had a rubber sheet to prevent the ruining of her own mattress at her house. I was upset but she was embarrassed and I simply asked her if she could clean it up and if I could stay at her house that night.  I didn't know that this would be a habit through our entire relationship. 

Months went by and towards the beginning of our relationship she asked me if I had ever been intimate with a man, all I could think of was my assault. I lied and told her no, I had spoken to some men over text but never actually done anything with anyone because they were so creepy. Little did I know her co worker was friends with the friend I had exchanged oral with. And was very public with that information. Her co worker had always wanted to sleep with her she said, and I guess he took it upon himself to tell her that I had been with said friend sexually. She told me to come to her house and had me take everything I had at her house and put it in my car while calling me a faggot and breaking up with me. I left balling and a week later she apologized and wanted me back. But she considers the event me cheating on her. And I was told to delete my discord account and not to talk to men anymore. Or any of my online friends. I stupidly agreed. And now my online friends I've known for over 5 years have all lost contact with me.  Or well I've lost contact with them. 

Her drinking became worse afterwards. And we started going to the bars alot. One day we had planned to go out with her parents to a local bar to watch a local band play. Her and her mother had already had some drinks while getting ready and she ended up having too many to go out. She literally couldn't walk. So I went into the natural routine of getting her to use the restroom and putting her to bed. So on the way to the bathroom I told her mom that she had too many and that we decided to just stay home but that I'd still drive them and pick them up afterwards so they would have a DD
I get my SO into the bathroom and she does her business and after standing up from the toilet she looks at me dead in the eyes and slurs out ""you shouldn't have fuckin done that"" and pulled her arm back and jacked me right in the jaw. I pushed past her and left the bathroom absolutely fuming. 

It hurt but not enough to complain about it just really upset me that she would hit me. I told her mother that we could leave and that her daughter could find her own way to the bed. And I explained what happened in the bathroom. Her mom basically sprinted across the house and screamed at her for punching me for 20 minutes while her step father told me that I should have her arrested. 
Her mother ended up putting her in her bed and I took them to the bar. And picked them up later on in the night. And yes she still pissed the bed even after using the restroom right before sleeping. It's never been a garenteed solution.

I grew resentful after this. I became short with her and easily irritable and she refused to lessen her drinking which only put me in more crummy situations like that. But I've still stayed this entire time. 

It was nearing the same date of my sexual assault and I was basically refusing to be intimate with her. It was just on my mind and I didn't want to be touched. She assumed I was no longer attracted to her because she gained a small amount of weight and accused me of thinking she was fat. I had to explain that it wasn't the case and that I just didn't feel up to it. 
She started crying and refused to believe me and I told her everything about my assault. Which led to me breaking down completely. I had never spoken to anyone about it. I simply got tested and did my best to bury it emotionally. She was understanding and let up afterwards.
But her drinking never got any better. 
Yet she asked me to move in and I did.

Months have gone by and she's starting being incredibly mean. Everything is always my fault.
Because I have no education and no work experience it's been hard getting a job and I still have plenty of issues and I'm honestly scared to get a job or to be judged and made fun of by coworkers for being transgender. 

She calls me names like stupid or idiot. Or that I'm a ""fucking child"" and then never apologizing for saying such mean things. And I've started to grow distant. She tells me that I need to ""grow up and be a man"" but she doesn't understand what that sentence means to me in regards to wanting to be a female. 
She's been drinking more and threatening to kick me out on the street even though I pay my portion of the bills unless I get a job. Which has forced me into putting my fears aside and seeking employment for manual labor jobs. 
Just recently she got incredibly drunk and told me she wanted me to die and then threw all the ice cubes from the freezer at me and screamed at me to pick them all up before they melted. 
She's told me that I'm fucking awful at communicating and that I just stare at her when she tries to talk to me about something. And when I don't remember something she said she says that my memory is fucking awful and makes fun of me for being unintelligent she says I'm an awful boyfriend and a shitty girlfriend too.. She says ive been gas lighting her, Everytime I try to explain to her how I feel she says I could solve all these problems if I would just ""step up"" and stop causing the problems and I end up feeling like she's gas lighting me. I don't understand what to do. And I literally don't have anywhere else to go. My brother doesn't have the space for me and my entire family thinks I'm an abomination. So I'm just stuck here feeling like everything is my fault all the time.

I probably forgot something that has happened or something, I can't help it. I'm actually retarded and my memory sucks. But i just needed to get this all out and get the opinions from someone else.

His brother lives with his mother and they are becoming really bad alcoholics

really no hope for this guy cause I am really holding everything together. I've
had multiple talks with his mother and her involvement and she agrees she's
an enabler but nothing changes. And I've had talks with him to the point where
he tells me he's not going to change... So I really see no reason to carry on. It's

becoming too much to bare. Now to the point of our child... I really wouldn't
want him here without me around should I go threw the extra steps to get
supervised visitation? There's definitely grounds for it. A simple drug test would
end the discussion. I am completely clean of drugs but my boyfriend would fail
for weed cocaine and excessive alcoholic consumption to the point where just
the alcohol test would be enough to make my case. It's just really sad because
I have tried everything and I feel like it's going no where and it's beginning to
effect me and my son. Please any advice. Thanks.",20Oct2019,1

344,"I am 25 years old male. I finished master engineering degree and I went to my first job as a programmer. The point is that my new work place is hundreds of kilometers away from my home town. I changed my living place several times. It started in the elementary school. My family send me to another city. Since then, I always went to different schools than my colleagues. Many times that was equal with changing my living place. From school doorms to student houses. I didn't have a problem with that. I know that this helped me a lot to finish my master degree and get me a fantastic job.

Jumping from place to place in my life made strange issue. I always was an outsider that come and dissapeard. Quicker or later. Even my home town is odd place for me now. I barery recognise people. I have few very good friends that I met across my journey. If I would be in trouble, they probably would arive to me within hours. But, eveyday we live apart, and meet few times a year.

I was working hard my whole life. I was training judo everyday in my highschool. On studies I was top grade student spending nights at projects to pass. I had pulmonary ebolism that destroyed huge part of my lungs and I didn't give up. Despite the fact that I was always in a rush I meet many fantastic people.

But now I stuck. Before I went to the new city I break up with my girlfriend (she cheatted on me, not like I was    
burning bridges behind me). I don't meet peoples in my age. Most of them have families and work on their head. In work I mostly have people at age 40+ that have children in similar age than me. I tried to go to local fantasy events etc. I was there like a relict (I am 2 meters high). Imagine! 16 years old girls that are barely half my size, and me across. My body barely withstand one beer (becouse of lungs etc.), aiming at party clubs is not the best way to go. Anyways, I gave a lot of my ""young"" time to be where I am, but now I feel that I ended alone on the desert.

So here I am. Begging for a tool&amp;advice that will help me to break thru this maze. What are your thoughts? Maybe somebody was in simmilar situation? Maybe I am still suffer from breakup and overdramatic things. I don't know what will happen in few years. I might go back near my home town and build a house or I might stay here. I can't predict the future as I didn't predict that I will land so far from my home area. I try to focus on the present. So, here I am to make present better.",20Oct2019,1
345,"Hello, this is a follow-up post from this [post for](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/deom4f/unsure_of_being_exploited_by_a_girl/) those of you who want more information.

Basically I asked my Crush out on a Date that went pretty nice, to be honest after that Date we met again at her best friend's house to play some games. Her Best Friend got pretty drunk and she started talking to me about my Crush. Turns out my Crush is interested in me and she is afraid that she does not fall in love because she really wants to fall in love with apparently. She also said that my Crush has a perfect image of me in her head and talks about me very nice.

Well, you need to know that I always thought of her being way out of my league because she dumped so many better guys, she was something unreachable for me. Her Best Friend told me she thinks the same way I do. She likes mature, talented and funny guys. Her Best Friend told me she likes it when I text her and take responsibility or do the first step.

So I texted her and asked if she wanted to do something again with me, she said yes but probably not in the following week because she's going out with friends that just got home from vacation and she has to do school-related things. I told her that's fine and I would text/ask her again when I have something planned. 

Should I still text her? It would be shitty if we wouldn't talk for a week but then go out to eat I guess but then again she never texts me or when we text she seems so uninterested and dry. She sometimes needs hours to answer. But in Person, she is completely different.",20Oct2019,1

I currently have a old core 2 duo PC which can't run any latest games. I saved up some money from eidi (religious event) and it's about 500$. The problem is that my dad won't let me buy a gaming PC in that price range because if I get it it will distract my older brother (17M) from studies and he is constantly studying for his retake of board exams. He is in college BTW. But the thing is my older brother doesn't shows any interest in studies and is basically forced by my dad to study with threats to cut off WiFi. He plays mobile battle royale games all the time.

We all also live in a single room due to financial issues but we are not struggling financially anymore and can afford a new flat for rent but my dad refuses to move. 
I am from an typical Asian family where everyone single person of the family stays in 1 house. Hence why my entire close family lives in 1 room.
My dad is (50M) BTW and he has the typical conservative mentality.

I have brought up this issue with my dad and he  would always brush me off saying get better grades. The fact that he promised me to get a PC one day hurts when I remind him of it and he says not now. My brother is on board BTW.",20Oct2019,1

Was using my phone, relaxing on a sunday evening when my mom said ""Don't bring your phone around you all the time, you're **getting addicted**."" I'm certainly not addicted. I study a lot and I only play/surf for a while every other day aside from reddit, where sometimes where I live isn't very applicable. I'm disgruntled at the accusation, as today has been my only day where I really used it for a majority of my time here. Anyways, I don't use it and I'm staring at the ceiling to soothe my growing anger(Short tempered. Runs in the family). And shortly after I get my phone and walk downstairs. I could hear stomping and she opened her door while I was half way. She said ""You left this in your pocket. It was in the washer."" She showed me my earphones, which were probably ruined unfortunately, but I don't carry them around often so that's my mistake. So I retort(a bit of a late addition, she was getting very snappy, sassy and I don't really have any words otherthan the angry mom voice) that ""Did I place it in there on purpose for you to wash?"" She said ""yeah. Who else would put it in there?""
""Yeah, because the first thing I do after I get home and sit down is to think about my earphones."" We get into a pretty heated argument and she stomps up stairs, saying she wished God(religious family) punished me. Pretty low blow considering I'm also religious. I went back to my room but without my charger. My mom took it. 

A few minutes later she slammed on my door. I never locked it so I yelled it's open. She said something nasty and threw my hoodie at me, so I was a bit fed up, so I followed her to her room and said ""Give me my charger."" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""Because I said so."" So after a few circular arguments she said ""You know how disrespectful you sound?"" I retort back with a ""As if you aren't disrespectful? I am your *son*."" She then slaps me and my glasses go flying. I then push her heavily and keep her from hitting me. This is the first time I've ever done anything physical to my mother. Afterwards I slam her door shut and look for my glasses. This leads me to.. now. What do I do? And I'm sure as hell not apologizing to her. She never accepts it and just takes it as a way to kick me when I surrender. We have a flight in three days and she's threatened to leave me here.

362,"Other than not being in the best mental state this year and having personal issues arise; now I’m beginning to have problems falling behind in university. I just started my first year and they’re speeding through newer topics (expected; I know others are a bit behind which made me feel a bit less stressed). 

Basically I fell behind because for the first 2 weeks I had problems with where I’m living (leaks, broken laundry machine...so much) and had to make time to get everything fixed. It mainly took so long because my landlord is straight up useless. Having to figure out who to call and how to fix everything took way too much of my time. Last week, I got sick (still have a cough going) and it made me do even less work. 

Despite being behind, I still went to an event I booked tickets for months ago (they were expensive and I didn’t want to disappoint my friend and cancel). I still feel like I shouldn’t have. 

The stress from being behind also made me realize how much I’m actually stressed about. I stayed on call with my best friend crying for 6 hours and venting. About what/who hurt me in the past, my worries and stress in the present... I guess that call made me feel less stressed...but it also made me think how I dealt with and experienced so much negativity. 

I feel as if I’m to blame; as if I attract this negativity. So I’m not sure if instead that call makes me worry more. These things are always underlying and I can ignore them...however I will eventually explode and just cry it all out. Then again, I don’t know why I can’t ignore uni stress in the same way.

Went a bit off topic there but:

Fourth week begins tomorrow, I’m still stressed about being behind. Should I be stressed? Is it normal to be behind this early on in uni? 

Should I lock myself up in my room and just study until I’m fully caught up? Or should I focus on the newer material since I understand the basics of the first 3 weeks (I just haven’t done some reading, written proper notes; just attended lectures). Should I ditch my social life completely for a bit? I just don’t know.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",20Oct2019,0
365,I have been to 6 dates with this girl and on the 5th date she invited me to the movies with her friends. One of them bought the tickets for everyone including me. After the movies we went to have dinner and I proposed to pay him back on the spot but he refused and we exchanged numbers so he could ask for the money later. In the past week the girl seemed to be gradually ignoring me even though we had a date and last time I asked if she wanted to go out again (a couple of days ago) she just said she is busy without saying no or suggesting any alternative date - she basically said I will let you know but then never texted me. Today her friend asked for the money (about $20) and honestly I don't see why I should bother to pay him if she is ignoring me. The thing is that I am not sure where I stand with the girl because if I knew she still wants to go out then I would pay him straight away otherwise I would not as a sort of petty revenge. During our dates I almost always offered her a drink so I am not even gaining anything by doing this. What should I do?,20Oct2019,0
367,"I’m 27M but I’ve been told that I look like I’m 40 which is probably an insult. I used to be a very popular kid until I lost a majority of my hair and my stuttering got even worse as I aged. I’ve been single for a long time I tell myself it’s just do to the fact I was homeless for almost 3 years but I’ve seen dudes with nothing still have game. I’ve been with 2 women my entire life, idk if it was a fluke because they were incredibly sexy women. Both relationships lasted quite a while I would say about 4 years each on and off. I moved which ended those and when I moved back they either already had a family, or interested in someone else. I moved back to go to a school for a specific trade skill that was advantageous to have that trade skill licensed from this state. Just recently got up off my feet and into my own place with a roommate. While I was homeless my social skills were shot. I was taking odd jobs to barely survive and didn’t talk to anyone while I was homeless. So my social skills are off if not reset to zero. I know work at a company with a lot of attractive women, I’m moving up in the company, and I still don’t even have a friend in the place. I’m too quiet too shy I see guys there picking up these girls with ease. I guess that’s what got me in my feelings and the fact that every time I look in the mirror I get to see the ruins of my once prime version of myself. Idk if I hate myself but I’m not content with myself. I think dating a woman again will get my confidence back. I tried hooking up with a lady from one of my odd jobs, just to have sex cuz man it’s been a few years, i don’t even know if my dick still works. I’m finally having all the pieces of home, work, and school, come together but I still feel so miserable. Any advice would be appreciated. Or just some input, maybe something to give a new perspective on things.",20Oct2019,1
369,My dad's been abusing my mom since even before I was born. It's not an everyday occurrence but the physical abuse happens once a year. My mom's stuck in the cycle of domestic violence where she thinks it okay since he's nice other times and don't know where else to go. Now coming to me who has seen this happening since childhood just wants to run away from this toxic environment. I'm not close to my mom since she herself is hot tempered and use to physically abuse me. Even now she verbally abuses me for small mistakes. I still think that running away is not the best option as I feel that I still owe them for raising and educating me properly. I have mixed feelings for both of them and don't know what to do? I am a college freshmen right now. Please I need advice since I have trust issues saying these things to my friends.,20Oct2019,2

375,"My closest friends have been ghosting me over messages, they've been ignoring me when I'm with them, they make me sit at the far end of the table and I'm away from the conversation. Friends in classes (friends only because we share notes etc) started to not say hi to me, or just ignore me unless I get into their faces and start convo (even then it's awkward and doesn't go anywhere).

I'm a shy and very passive person, so maybe the not-so-close-friends have just stopped going out of their way to greet me or sth, I can understand that. But with my close friends, I've always been the ""baby"" of the friend groups, everyone used to pay attention to me when I talked and they kinda took care of me since I'm indecisive and all. But now they try to avoid me, they don't make plans in the groupchats I'm in. And when I paid condolences to a friend's family member in a group (I was the only one in the group to say something after my friend sent the message about it), everyone left me on seen, even the friend whose family member passed away. Now I had a fight with a friend because she kept ignoring my questions and sending messages to me about unrelated topics (I sent something, she didn't say anything and sent a different thing, I kept trying to communicate by asking questions and stuff but she wouldn't answer and now she says it's because she was busy. While I believe she was busy, I don't get how she had time to send messages about unrelated topics in PM but didn't have time to answer my messages.) 

I just feel like something happened that is invisible only to me. I didn't change the way I treat them, I try to spend time with them even though we're all busy with uni. I've been sadder these days over an unrelated topic, so I've been quieter than usual, but it just happens to me sometimes and it's never been a problem to need space before. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to fix things without knowing what the problem is. I don't know how to approach the topic because I feel like nothing's changed either in their relationships with each other or me, it's just the connection between me and them that changed, so they may think I'm exaggerating things. 

The fact that people outside of my friend groups also started to distance themselves from me also makes me feel like there's something wrong about me that I just can't see. If it's my personality, I've always been shy and kinda awkward, so why is it pushing people away only now?",20Oct2019,1
376,"So, I'm meeting with a friend who I went to school with (we both left last year) because it's her birthday soon and I wanted to pass her a birthday card, say happy birthday and such (because I wont see her on the day).  I also wanted to give her something that I wrote for her, a poem, I cant promise it's the best poem ever but I tried at least. She knows I'm meeting her to give her these things and we know roughly were and when we are meeting but like, I dont know what to say?

It seems silly but past the whole ""hi, heres the birthday card and the thing I wrote for you"" bit, I'm pretty clueless. Like do we just say hi, do the usual small talk thing and go after I've given her the stuff or would it be ok to try and start a conversation, see how shes doing, where she went to college, you know, catching up stuff.

377,"Hello! I am new to Reddit and the whole forum thing however, I am seeking advice from complete non biased individuals and like minded people. I’ll cut right to the chase. 

Yesterday 10/19/2019 was Sweetest Day (holiday for lovers we celebrate in the Midwest) I took my girlfriend on a dinner cruise, we romanced one another and had a beautiful time while watching our city. Later that night we went to a party, her friends party. Her friend is the sister of her ex. 

Her ex has literally stalked us, gave us a hard time and constantly reached out on and off throughout our FIVE YEAR RELATIONSHIP and even a fake suicide attempt. Last night was the first time I had ever seen him, he paced back and forth and a few times and finally made his way into the room as we and another couple are sitting down playing uno. He goes around the table to say “Hi” in a shifty way and when he gets to my girlfriend before he could speak I say “Hey, don’t talk to my lady. Not tonight, let’s have fun”  his composure immediately disappeared and he says “This is your last time talking shit, come outside” I respond engaging eye contact with a stern voice “Walk away” he goes onto to say “Since you got a big dick, come outside” again I say “walk away” the more he talks and talks and tells me to “come outside” I calmly never losing eye contact say “Walk away” this went on for a solid 45 seconds to 1 minute and someone grabbed him and kicked him out of the room. I am a female and my girlfriends ex is a guy.

379,"I'm a 19 yr old recovering porn addict. As of now, i am +90 days free of pornography and masturbation, after a series of heavy relapses.

I also have a binge eating disorder, which i believe developed because of how my mother used to berate me on my eating habits. She used to tell me that i would roll around because of how fat i was going to get and that i had zero skills in life.

Throughout a bit of my elementary years and all highschool i had severe social anxiety, because i was so self-conscious of my weight and my man-boobs. This led to using gaming/food/pornography as ways to cope with my depression and anxiety.

I always thought i never deserved anyone as a girlfriend. I deemed myself as a horrible looking human being and spent most of my best years in front of a pc, gaming, eating and masturbating.

You may be asking, why does my title ask such question?

Going straight to the point: i masturbated thinking about prepubescent girls and sometimes even used facebook/instagram pics of them. This didn't bother me at all, since i wasnt really attracted to their bodies, only their faces. I believe i was about 15/16 yrs old at the time.

That phase didnt last relativelly long (some months?) because i realized how fucked up it was, and i just stopped and never thought about it again for YEARS. It didnt even cross my mind and i never even thought about a little girl like that ever again.

But my pornography addiction didnt stop when i cut those toxic habits. I just started fapping to other weird shit.

Back at 2019: i gratuated from highschool and a year long course. I dont work so all this time alone really hurt me, and i started therapy to treat my social anxiety and food addiction. I didnt really know i was a porn addict until i started talking with my psychologist. 

Recovering from my addictions, i suddenly acknowledged the fucked up things i used to masturbate with. I dont know how, but i honestly forgot about it until i started therapy. 

My therapist recently diagnosed me with ocd, although he said he knew since our first session i had it. I asked him why would he tell me that after about 5 months of therapy, and he said there wasnt really a point because it wouldnt help.

I believe im not a pedophile (not certain though but would never act on it), and this ""kink"" (ugh) developed from being desentisized with porn, combined with my ocd.

BUT, theres something thats KILLING me inside. I masturbated with my 40 year old neighbours clothes about 4/5 times before starting therapy. I even said to myself it was worth it and, at least at the moment, i didnt regret it at all.

This wouldnt be so bad (even though its already extremely wrong) if it werent for the fact i used to watch rapey-porn. I never watched cp or illegal porn but i used to watch legal pornography that portrays an abuse-like scene. I even remember when, many years ago, i searched for porn in a legal site using the word ""rape"" and i got zero results.

I tell myself im a disgusting pedophile and a rapist. I spent almost all my days using my cellphone, eating and smoking pot. I seriously considered suicide before, and although i dont think of it as heavily/often i still think about doing it.

I dont know if living is worth it. I feel like i have this immense secret life and i have no one to talk to except my therapist. I dont want to be in a relationship because i feel like i dont deserve true love.

All the time my friends tell me that im such a great person. A saint. Every time they tell me that, i just dont believe its true.

Im not a good person. Even though i havent abused anyone, i humilliated a great person and didnt even care about it, and i even did it multiple times.

To be honest, i dont know what to do with my life. I try to stop thinking and getting high or drunk but lately ive been really down. I got a job for november and i want tl use that money to start community college and many more projects, but deep down i just want to die.

This was more of a rant than anything else but im so screwed that i dont know what to do. Any input, including insulting comments, are welcome.",20Oct2019,17
380,"My sister recently came forward to me to talk about an assault she experienced in college a few years ago. She’s just now deciding to report it and has been using me for her sole support system. This is really hard because I’m struggling with my own feelings about her being assaulted but I’m not telling her this because it’s not about me. 

Recently she asked me if I’d be willing to be my dad’s support too. She wants to talk to him about this because she needs more support, but she wants me to be available to talk to him if he needs it. I just finished a call where I said I’d only be willing to support him, but as minimally as possible. (As to where my mom is in the conversation, my sister vehemently doesn’t want to talk to her about it, ever, because she doesn’t get along with my mom). My sister took it poorly and hung up on me. 

Was I wrong? I can’t help support her and my immigrant dad. As it is I feel like I’m not able to handle this and I’m getting resentful that I just keep doing things wrong, and then guilty.

382,"I've been messing around with this guy. We saw each other 2 nights in a row when we first met up and he asked for another night and I said no because it would feel like we're in a relationship, he said just friends and I said I didn't want it.

He kinda disappeared for a month, out of state. I messaged him once and he replied so I knew he didn't hate me. A couple weeks ago, he hit me up asking if I would ever want to see him again. I asked, ""why not?"" And he replied talking about how I didn't want to catch feelings and asked what the problem was if he liked me, too. I told him my mental health has been terrible lately and he understood.

We've been seeing each other a lot in the past couple weeks, like 5/7 days of the week. He likes when I spend the night cuddling/sleeping after we have sex, when he could easily just take me home. Last time, he didn't even want sex, he just wanted to hang out. Obviously I started to catch feelings. I tried to hint it at him by telling him I like him and that I'm feeling conflicted, but he either didn't get it, or didn't care. He told me ""we don't have to hang out anymore if you want"" but that's not what I want.

I really don't want to lose what I have with him. I am a person that isolates themself, I have no friends whatsoever. I enjoy his semi-clinginess, makes me feel wanted for once. The thing is, I've been in this situation before, where I caught feelings for someone that didn't want me. I don't want to be the ugly girl that's easy to fuck but not good enough for a relationship, again. I hate laying awake at night thinking ""he's probably talking to a bunch of other girls and having sex with me because I'm easy."" I hate that he tells me he likes me and wants to spend all this time with me, because I feel like it isn't true.

He's different in the sense that he would drop and come get me whenever I ask, that he said he likes me (even if I feel it isn't true), and that he likes to spend time with me after sex/wants me to stay with him (every guy I've been in this situation with would rather take me home after sex than spend a night with me).

383,"I’m writing this literally a few minutes after it happened, and I’m still quite shaken for some reason. It’s not really the most dramatic coming out story; not much screaming or anything. 
So this is what happened:

I was here in my room alone with my sister, she’s on the desk drawing portraits(she’s an artist). I’m just there sitting and chilling (I was in a pretty bad mood moments earlier, and I wasn’t thinking properly and was quite impulsive).
And for some reason I suddenly thought it was a great time to tell my sister my deepest darkest secret! 
I started with asking her “hey, tell me a secret, like, something you don’t want me to know.” She responds with some I don’t knows etc. Then she asks me something along the lines of “what about you then? Why did you ask in the first place?” Etc. 
I tell her it’s something I’m ashamed of, and to imagine the worst. She says she doesn’t really want to know anymore. And yadah yadah a few more awkward lines and she asks “what do you like women?” I believe she was probably half joking when she said this, I answer “yes,” 
“I’m bisexual”
Now this is the part I’m not entirely sure of.... 
I tell her that I was serious a few times, but she kind of says she thinks I’m joking, because I always say ‘I’m serious’ when I’m not (I joke around a lot and say strange things). 

And a pause. An awkward air fills the room around us, my heart is still beating, adrenaline is flowing all over. I don’t like how this ended, I don’t know whether she thinks I’m serious or not.
I joke around with her and tell her with a serious face “hey, I have a secret to tell you.. I just murdered someone... help me hide the body.” She just shakes her head knowing it’s a joke.

But what I think is; is that she kinda believes what I said, and didn’t really know how to react to that situation so she responded in the smoothest way she can... which is pretending she thinks it’s a joke. But I know a part of her believes me, and I’m afraid things will be very awkward between us. And I don’t know what to do. 
And I hope you (whoever is reading this) acknowledges I’m a Christian and very religious, although I’ve accepted that part of myself (that loves boobs), I knew in the end I would have to choose between my God and what I want. And I chose my God. And I’m not ashamed of that. Originally I was planning to take this secret to the grave, but unfortunately I impulsively broke that plan. I hope whoever is reading this remains open minded, and respectful to my beliefs. (I’ve had too many people in the internet spat at my face that ‘I should just give up my faith, and stop being a homophobic trash’, and I just want some genuine advice.

387,"So the upstairs neighbour never goes out - apart from last night we bumped into him in the stairwell coming home from a night out at about 1am. We saw the two dogs he has - and we hear him screaming at. One of the dogs was so thin when we petted it, you could feel the dogs ribs. 

We rarely hear anything from the neighbour except shouting and swearing at the dogs. He vacuums his flat floor all the time and at random hours. 

We hear an extremely loud vibrating music alarm which blasts so loud it wakes us up and we have to bang the ceiling - yet he sleeps through this alarm. It always goes off around 5:30am which is odd as he is unemployed. He just switches the alarm off and we don’t hear anything. 

He looks very thin and like a drug user. My partner petted the dog last night and asked if it was a puppy as it looked small and thin. He said it was 5 years old. 

This is probably the second time we’ve spoken to him, the first time was to collect a parcel from him. He answered the door topless and his house was filled with smelly bin bags everywhere.

Me being my autistic self on totally wasted said a bunch wack shit (stuff I don't actually believe, I dont know why I even said it, maybe a form of subconscious self destruction) all the girls get offended and call me a bunch of buzzwords and tell me to fuck off. Then told my freind not to hang around me anymore. I haven't spoken to another person in months, I just want normal human interaction again. How should I reach out apologizes to the girls, with a card, show up to their places and do it in person or tell them about my disabilities or just fucking kill myself and hope that I wont fuck up so bad in the next life??",20Oct2019,1
392,"I feel held back by social media. It's toxic, but I don't know how to let go of it. I have a wonderful life and so much to be grateful for, but when I get on social media, I end up comparing myself to others to the point that my own life becomes out of focus and it becomes depressing.

For me, the root of the problem is this: Social media fuels comparison, and comparison is the root of unhappiness. It's almost inevitable to not compare your ""behind the scenes"" to someone else's ""highlight reel,"" when that's just what social media IS.

On the other hand, social media is a great way to connect with others, meet new people, stay in touch, and stay informed. Without it, I would feel naked and disconnected. It would cause a major case of FOMO. How do I balance the need for personal interaction, friendship, and connectedness, with the reality that social media may be holding me back from living my own life fully? Do I try to stop comparing myself, or just give up social media altogether?",20Oct2019,1
393,"My friend has been through some pretty traumatic things that I won't go into detail about. I've been with her through it all, but she's taking it very bad. 

We've casually been doing weed for a good year or so, just every now and then smoking a bit, not excessively. Recently, my friend has been doing it more than we used to, which I didn't mind because I understand that she's stressed.

Today I found out that she's also using MDMA. She's told me she's only done it two times, not too much at all, but I'm starting to get worried. She wasn't like this in the past. Ecstacy as far as I understand it is a pretty bad hard drug with bad lasting side effects. She's become pretty insomniac after everything, which I thought was just because of the trauma, but I've read that that's a common side effect from using ecstacy too so I feel like it's just making things worse. 

If I bring it up, she gets mad. She says she doesn't want to talk about it and doesn't want to be reminded of it. I think she's underestimating how bad MDMA is(or maybe I'm overestimating?), but I have no idea how to talk to her about it without her getting mad. If I go to her parents with it, she might see it as an act of betrayal, and I don't want to lose my friend, and I definitely don't want her to lose hers(she doesn't have many).

I’ve always been a probably weirdly sexual person but I’m also known for being well behaved, but recently every time I get drunk I become very overly sexual and I do things that I really regret when I’m sober, like sending nudes to strangers or once almost giving a guy a handjob in a club. Just for context, I also used to send nudes and sext with strangers when I was quite young (14ish?). I’m really embarrassed and uncomfortable about it all,

I'm 21 M

Ever since my teenage years (16+) Ive been feeling a lot of shame and having huge problems just 'being'

it's like I'm ashamed of being myself and expressing it any form. I feel shameful when I try to get new clothes, when I try to public speak, when I have to be vulnerable etc etc. All I want to do is hide or blend in and never be the centre of attention

When I was 11 I was bullied and heavily blackmailed into sexual abuse and theft. some older kids made me do things I never wish on anyone else. I never had the courage to talk to anyone because Ive always felt responsible for what happened since I complied to what they asked.

Ever since Ive been filled with paranoia and fear. There's this feeling ""If you dont act tough you will be crushed""

It has fucked up my life and gave me severe aggro phobia and shame. I failed 12th grade and quit school, become a recluse

I unsuccessfuly tried to kill myself once. I was under medication for a year but it had bad side effects - increase in myopia, weight gain, memory impairment

I'm not sure whether I should just continue having a friendship with him or whether I should go for it and tell him how I feel.

406,"So, basically, I've been single all through my college life. All my friends ended up in relationships and I can't help but third wheel, (well, also 5th wheeling and 7th wheeling if they are something). I end up going alone to movies and restaurants cause I have no one to date. It gets really awkward mainly because of their PDA and them getting intimate with each other. And, to make it even worse, I usually ask my friends if their significant others would be tagging along so that I can drop the plan. They lie and I somehow end up amongst the couples. Trust me. I've tried to steer clear of this, but this being a small college, I end up being the third wheel. I've tried making new friends. Didn't work out. I am a senior and I can't really go and join the friend circles that are already quite strong among the Freshers, Sophomores and Juniors. I end up roaming around with my PROFESSORS! And that is kinda awkward too because the Student-Professor factor comes into account.

Upon finishing boot camp, he hit me up again wanting to hang out, and of course I would say “of course.” We’ve had a great friendship even while in the military. One habit that I know he’s picked up is drinking. He drinks like there’s no tomorrow. I myself don’t drink at all, but I also don’t judge if he does. Anyway, Yesterday my family was having a party, where there was going to be beer galore. And obviously my friend took advantage of that. I warned him saying he was overdoing it, but by then I’m pretty sure he had no recollection of where he even was. As soon as we get to my house he crashes on my bed butI don’t mind, being the bro that I am. I finally go to lie down and 2 hours later, I feel as my back is really cold.

409,"Hi, I had this problem for most of my life. I don't really know where I went wrong, I just know that I had a trauma with severe bullying when I was in kindergarten with my brother where both teachers and children, supported by teachers, verbally and physically abused us. I've got some behavioural issues that I am still struggling to solve to this day, but this just made the situation worse. I've also had to deal with domestic abuse, but since I've called the police a few years ago the situation at home became acceptable. The problem is that with my problems I've always drawn people's attention towards me. Up to this day every class I've been into just resulted in a situation similar to the one I had in preschool. This situation got me to stressful eating and finding ways to escape from reality either playing videogames, drawing or overall being on my laptop all day. This made the situation worse because with those problems people had the possibility to call me names and justify their actions. I noticed that when I leave the school people start adoring me and usually feel very guilty about their actions even if they are unable to justify them. I am now 17 and have been with my current class for almost 4 years, they are the second worst class I've been into. This comes both from the class and the teachers. The situation came to the point where even the school principal stereotypies me as an obese girl that spends all of her day on the computer (even if I lost most of my excess weight and am completely average) even after I proved many times that I lowered my time on the phone and computer as much as possible. There have been many cases where both teachers and bullies did something bad to me and no school authority decided to do something to help, but as soon as I do something, even by accident and no matter that I usually can prove that I am innocent the school does a giant mess to the point that one day they left the whole class insult me and bully me for one whole hour with the teacher just standing there and saying maybe 2-3 times that they shouldn't use my surname as an insult. All of this while I was cutting myself in front of them just trying to distract myself from that pain in my chest that kept growing. The situation is drastic, I can't change school because those years are just too important and my parents wouldn't allow me anyway. I've tried everything possible, even ignoring. But just ignoring for years is impossible and I've exploded more than once. I am desperate, this situation led me close to suicide more than once. How can I handle this situation? Those people are also described as the noisiest and messiest class in school, yet as soon as I loose control everything goes just against me. I am just an average student trying to improve but this situation is having a negative impact on my performance too.",20Oct2019,1

I hope everyone's doing good. I needed some advice about a problem I'm currently facing. It would me very much appreciated. 

First off I'm 27 years old and I have a job as a Safety Officer in Saudi Arabia. I really don't get paid well about $1500 U.S Dollars. I send my mom $500  Dollars every month. She's in need and I really feel bad not providing for her. She currently lives in the U.S and she has a job but she's not getting paid enough. In which she provides for my brother and sisters. 

So basically I live with my 2 uncles ( My mom's brother's). And one of my uncles personality is always wanting to criticize you no matter what your doing. Sometimes I say hello or try to have a conversation and he just gives me a dirty look. It really makes me feel bad. I live here because I can't afford to pay rent for an apartment of my own. I've lived here for about 1 year. Also my uncle he is always suspicious about everyone and everything. I'm really not the emotional type of guy. And I've always lived a though life. But I was always thankful. But in my current situation living here with my uncle I just feel unwanted and him bothered of me being here. But does not want to say it.

Anyway, my first essay was due last Thursday at 9:00. I submitted it on Wednesday and didn't check my e-mail for a couple of days. Bad idea. When I checked it on Friday afternoon I had an e-mail from my tutor asking me why I hadn't submitted my essay. I panicked and checked the website to see what had happened. Turns out that I completely forgot to click on confirm after uploading the document because I got distracted rereading the essay to make sure that I'd selected the right one, so I closed the tab. I messaged my tutor explaining this to him and telling him that it won't happen again and I will completely understand it if he decides to penalise me. He still hasn't replied and I'm terrified to check the website in case it has already been marked (I submitted it properly as soon as I read his e-mail)

I'm hoping that he will be understanding since it was our first time submitting a document through the website and it's quite confusing, but if that was the case I'm sure he would have replied to my e-mail by now.

My curfew is 10pm and at 9:17 pm I texted my stepmom and asked if it was ok if I was home by 10:30pm and she said ok. Then at 10pm I realized that I wasn’t gonna make the 10:30 curfew so I texted her and apologized for being late and where I was. She told me that we would talk about the consequences in the morning. This morning she told me that I would have to pick my own punishment and I’m completely at a loss. She told me that this is the second time I’ve broken a rule which is true but for context the first rule I broke was that my boyfriend was in the house without any adults being home because I expected my stepmom and my boyfriend to make it home at the same time (literally minutes within each other) but he got there first and I let him in bc I didn’t want him to wait in the car and I didn’t think it would be a big deal. 

Also for more context. When I turned 17 in June I asked for a later curfew (11 rather than 10) and was shot down and since having a curfew of 10, this is the first time I’ve broken it. 2nd she claims that my boyfriend and I could have been doing “stuff” but I told her I was sexually active and she even agreed to let me get a hotel room to spend the night in on prom?

But over the past few months management has been terrible to me. I'll call my two managers T and A and my ""lead"" M. 

In an attempt for briefness, a bit ago a situation happened where I talked with a coworker about some of our issues, a simple conversation.  Lead that to M twisting the story and telling my managers I attacked and yelled at this person. Leads me to getting a meeting with HR + A and T where they automatically believed M because they favorite her and didnt give me a chance to defend myself and basically forced me to apologize for something I never did. Ever since then both managers have a distaste for me and will sometimes lecture/yell at me for things I dont do or arent my fault, I assume they do this because I am now their scapegoat. 

Not to mention I can only trust 2-3 of my coworkers, the rest are snitches and look for any mistake anyone does to run and tell the managers. Dont get me started on the work groupchat where the managers and lead like to call people out for making mistakes. Basically, I'm miserable here and dont want to work here anymore. 

But the Christmas bonus. I've been working all year and its most likely gona be around $300-$500 dollars, I was planning on quitting after December. Now my dilemma is I've already secured another job so even if I only work one day a week at my current it's an all day shift and I'll be working a ton on top of school (I'm in college). Not to mention the training for my new job is brutal in that for two weeks Mon-Fri I have to come in from 5pm-10pm. 
On one hand, the check I'll be getting from those training weeks will add up to around 500 so technically theres my bonus right there. But if I stay I could get ANOTHER 500 on top of that. 

I dont know what to do. On one hand  I know people will say it's just one day a week for 2 months stick it out that's the obvious choice.

It all started in 2009 freshman year, I had just moved to a new school and I remember him being the only person that stuck out to me. We'll just say his name is Cole, he has red hair, green eyes and an adorable smile that stole my heart. I don't exactly remember how we started dating but we dated on and off until we graduated.. Now it was only on and off because he was SUPER controlling since I was a young rebellious thing I wanted to drink and smoke weed, etc. and he wasn't having it which I know he just cared about my health but I've never liked being told what to do. After graduation we broke it off for good because he was tired of the on again off again which I get it, we were young and dumb. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had moved out of my parents house right after school was over at 18- wanting freedom and all that stupidness that I shouldn't have done.. I ended up sleeping with my manager at the time and I ended up getting pregnant by him. Flash to six years later I'm still said managers girlfriend and we have been raising our beautiful baby boy together. I did love his father but I wasn't fully happy we never did anything together, he never did anything sweet for me like I did for him and not to get too personal but even sex was a minute long and I just craved love and attention and wanted someone that was crazy about me and then it happened....

Cole somehow got my Snapchat we started talking and catching up, he said he would have reached out to me sooner but that he saw I was married with a kid. I was almost too quick to tell him that I wasn't married and that I was not happy whatsoever just that I couldn't afford to live on my own- then the rest happened so fast over the span of two weeks we started talking non stop then he asked me to get a place with him and that he'd help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds awful leaving my boyfriend of six years for an ex that I had just started talking to for two weeks but a day didn't pass by where I didn't think about Cole and I just wanted to feel loved again and he did just that. We decided to get an apartment at the apartment complex worked at to save money and they were nice but the employee discount still wasn't enough. I asked my manager if I could move into the apartment a couple of weeks early for free since it's vacant anyways to save money and he said he didn't care.

Flash to a month later I go into work at the president of the company is there to fire me for theft, coward manager says he didn't approve it and I get kicked out. Cole told me we could just go live at his mom's house, that it'd be O.K. So we cram our 1,200 sqft apartment into two small bedrooms, my son is sleeping next to packed up boxes in an old not so clean house and I'm unemployed. Cole tells me to take my time looking for a job that he could cover both of our bills but I knew he couldn't afford it I spent a full month looking for a job and no one wanted me after I had fired on my application. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then as a last resort with a pile of bills I decided to start camming- I was so thankful for that it felt wrong at first but it's not as bad as it's made out to be. I had money for my bills in two days time thanks to the generous people on there. But then shortly after that is when the fighting started with Cole, over stupid little things. We'd fight at least every two days. There had been two instances where he had screamed and yelled in front of Connor telling me to ""shut the fuck up"" all the fighting and yelling was causing me extreme anxiety but I felt like I had no where to go. The days my son was at his dad's I'd just drink constantly or I couldn't move. I felt broken and dead inside but I felt as though the fighting was just because he were crammed into his mom's house possibly?

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to yesterday while he was at work we decided I should leave it felt wrong leaving, my mom said I could stay with her while I get back on my feet but that I couldn't bring any of my possessions that couldn't be thoroughly cleaned inside (he had cats she's allergic). So none of my sons toys, I'm having to go buy clothes etc. the sad thing is I tried applying for an apartment and didn't get approved because my ex boyfriend my sons father still hasn't gotten my name taken off the house but I told my mom I'd be out of here in two weeks... But Cole, I miss Cole I've loved him for ten years and I don't want to be without him but it was like we couldn't help but fight. I can't stop crying, my brain feels like it's on fire and I just need someone to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do, for me or my son- my son put first I know he wasn't happy at Cole's moms house so I know that's not an option but other than that I don't know what to do. I know a lot of people have it a lot worse than I, I just feel lost. Any advice regarding my living situation, bettering myself as a person or Cole is appreciated. Thank you",20Oct2019,2

435,"I’m in college at the moment, doing 4 a levels and in my second year. I’ve been dating her for about 8 months now and we’ve always talked a lot as we both enjoyed it (I still do). But since the start of the new school year she’s needed me a lot more frequently so we would talk in the morning, maybe on the bus over (1 hour) then sometimes during my frees and then on the bus home and when I’m home we talk. She’s had a really tough year. I want to be there for her but I just can’t even talk with my guy friends after college and have barely anytime to do homework/revise for tests and I’m barely hanging on to my grades. I think it’s also important to mention that I find it very difficult to revise or do homework when I we’re on a call.

Anyways I told her how I felt, I made sure to let her know that I still care a hell of a lot about her but I just need some more free time during the day. Her initial response was pretty good I think as she seemed to take it really well. After that (maybe an hour) she started to go really quite and she’s not the type of person to do that unless there’s something wrong. I asked what she was thinking about and she said “my brain is being stupid”. She has pretty bad anxiety and stuff kinda gets out of controls when there’s no one there to ground her. That was yesterday and when we called today she said she’s sorry for calling me and I said I still enjoyed talking to her and nothings changed. But her response seemed like she didn’t really believe me.

I pretty much blocked them both on everything, I will admit that I did say one really rude joke to both of them out of the many they said to me after they ticked me off but he went off to go in a call with the other friend and essentially told him everything although I told him in full confidence because I trust him much more because the other usually starts everything. The first thing I said was a play on ""watcha gonna do when they come for you"" song but adding ""gay boys gay boys watcha gonna do when they come for you"" then apparently something playful we do to eachother everyday almost with no backlash had give them the right to be spiteful and rude to me according to the friend I told in full confidence.",20Oct2019,1

457," Hi y'all, I must start by saying that I'm not sure if my post fits here,  I'm sorry if it doesn't but I am at my wit's end and in a desperate  need of the input and help of others as I have no one to confide in  nor ask for advice, so please bear with me. A little background about  me: I was never interested in boys as a teenage girl, I always was an  introvert, and spent my time either studying, reading, playing vidya, or  painting. Did not really have any close friends, but I was generally  content with my life. My relationship with my father was not so great,  he was often cold and emotionally distant, would get angry at the  smallest of things and start yelling at everyone. His attitude towards  every other person was often coarse and condescending, my father also  believed that the most important attribute a girl can bear is her purity  (i.e her virginity), in our household, i was shown that being feminine  was a sign of vanity and correlated with being empty-headed. I think,  the stereotype that women are attracted to men who are similar to their  fathers is quite true. 

I was perfectly fine going with my father was the  right thing to do, until when I was around 19/20 years old biology  kicked in and I started to show interest in the opposite sex all of a  sudden, at that point I still had not . I did try to suppress these  urges as I thought they were wrong and will hinder me, but the  loneliness soon overcame me and I could fight them anymore. There was  this one person with whom I had a couple of shared interests and went to  school with. I started to develop feelings for this person and  fantasized about being with them, I still had some internal struggles  about these feelings of mine but eventually told the person about how I  feel. At this point, mind you, I still had not grew out of my tomboyish  phase, did not have any sex appeal (still don't in my mid-twenties)  while I watched all of my female peers turn into fine ladies, and I had  fallen into deep depression. This person said he did not feel the same  way towards me, I stayed friends with this person but then cut him off  after a lot of mental struggle, he was my only friend at that time but  seemed to want to take advantage of me because of how i felt towards  him.

 I used to go on 4chan a lot before that, but I started going to r9k  (a board that is somewhat similar to the incels subreddit). I was able  to relate to these lonely men and felt a great deal of sympathy towards  them. The melancholy was quite addicting, and the women- hate they all  displayed never bothered me, as I did bear hatred towards other women at  that time mainly because all of the other women had something that I  was missing: sex appeal and femininity. I ended up meeting a man from  there online, now this guy was the sweetest person I had ever met, he  treated me so kindly and showed a lot of interest in me, I'd never been  treated like this before and being starved of affection I fell deeply in  love with this person. We had a lot in common, similar struggles and  similar interests. I became obsessed with this person, always thinking  of him, looking at his photograph for hours and wanting to embrace and  save him, I became extremely attached to him, in an unhealthy manner.  Soon after this person started to change his attitude with me, took a  complete 180 degrees turn and started being aggressive, hateful, and  verbally abusive, even though he treated other females normally, and was especially nicer to the ones who were good looking and who he thought would have sex with him. I found out this person had bipolar disorder and his  mood swings happened very frequently that they can switch within hours.  He also did not have the best childhood and was rejected by women a lot.  I tried to cut him off but I wasn't able to because I felt a great  amount of love towards him and did not want to abandon him. A few years  pass, we still had not met in real life, but I would always try to help  him, cheer him up, and do anything in my power to make him feel better.  But he never appreciated me bending over backwards for him or any of  things i did for him and continued to act so aggressive with me. My  reasoning behind not cutting him off, is my great attachment to him and  me seeing myself in him in someway.

 Naturally, this took a huge toll on  my mental well being and caused me a set of issues that i had never had  before, I suffered a lot but I still was not able leave him. The hatred  was contagious and now I feel jaded towards everyone, and especially  these men that I used to sympathize with, I feel like my soul has been  sucked out of me and I am nothing but a husk. The attachment won't go  away, because i am weak and alone. I learned my lesson, the cost was  very big, and I no longer want to be with a man, I am somewhat okay with  being on my own, but I still can't let go of this person. Wherever I  go, topics of sex and relationships are being shoved in my face and It  gets me into intense anger and sadness, seeing other women with their  partners makes me feel inadequate and envious.

459,"This is hard to write, I feel like it's a tough subject and I haven't been able to say it properly, but it's been at least two months already since I've been feeling like this, so here it goes.

I haven't been happy since the start of the year. Sure, I have had a couple of happy moments, but as soon as that ends, I tend to feel miserable again and back to hating myself, I just generally feel without energy and almost never wanna do stuff, but well, I have to. I suffer from depression and anxiety (got to be honest, I think I do, I've never been diagnosed but I'm almost positive I exhibit the symptoms).

I guess it all has to do with the fact that I started going to university this year. I graduated high school last year and I really really liked it there, I felt happy the last couple of years, it felt like a home, with my friends, the teachers, it felt like a wonderful place. But now I'm in uni, one of the best ones in my country, but I just have never felt happy there. It's not about academic stress, I've gotten good grades so far and I like the career I'm in (art history), but I just don't feel like I belong there, I feel a lot of anxiety, I spend most of my time alone, and I really have trouble getting close to people, since I have social anxiety and I just feel different. As I said before, I like my career, but I don't see a future, I don't think it's going anywhere and I don't feel happy. I used to have long term goals and I used to know where I was headed to, but now I'm just doing things by pure inertia and I just can't find myself.

I miss the happiness, I miss feeling in a place where I belong, and I've simply don't see myself feeling any different in the future. This has led me to think about ending my own life because I feel I've lost myself, I can't find real happiness and I really don't anything right now. I've talked to some of my closest high school friends (I'm not close to my family, so I don't really trust them and I've never talked about my emotions with them) but it goes always the same, it turns into an awkward situation, they don't what to say (I don't judge them, it's a difficult topic to handle), we say goodbye and then it's never brought up again and it's like it never happened. This has led me to remain more closed and I really don't tell anyone anymore. Also, I know all my friends are happy, they have found their place, they have found new people, a career they like even with all the stress, so I simply do not wanna be a burden and take them back, because they have already moved on mostly. I've been thinking of seeing a therapist or something, but I can't work up the nerve to do so, and I really don't think I would open up so easy to someone I don't trust.

I don't really know what to do, I've also been thinking about dropping out from uni or taking a semester off, but I don't know, I would feel like a deception, my parents have spent a lot of money already, everyone is set in their new life, and I feel like I would be like that kid that doesn't know what to do, because let's be honest, everyone talks about the dropout who couldn't find its place, it's a thing our society does. But even if I take a semester off or something, I don't know what I would do, I would probably end up laying around being sad, and even if I find something new that I like, I'm scared it will be art history all over again, something I was sure about and now I'm here. Sometimes I watch a movie or something and I forget about all of this, but then I think about all of the things I have to do and my life feels like a downside again.

Killing myself feels like the easier route because I don't want to feel like this, feel this pain anymore, I don't want this horrible uncertainty, I've thought for at least to months about just ending it all. I haven't done it yet because I'm a coward, and because I feel there are some people that would be really hurt (my grandmas, a couple of my friends).

460,"This is about guy in my school, he is so talented, smart and funny,we are friend but I love him so much. It started way before but I wasn't really sure but I realized it about 2 weeks ago and now I'm sure. But it is more complicated than that. There is another girl that likes him and he knows that she likes her but he doesn't know that I like him too(at least I hope not). When I asked him about it he told me that he liked her too but he wasn't ready to be in a relationship yet. A week ago I saw them hugging and stuff, so I asked him if they were in a relationship but he said no. And yesterday I saw him going to a mall with her and some other people. I didn't ask him anything because I was too shy and didn't want him to see me as a weird person (which I think I failed but it's fine). Now I just can't stop thinking about him and I want to tell him that I like him but I feel like it would make him confused and I do not want to make our friendship end.

The thing is I am abroad so it is kind of a small group of people to hang out with while in a foreign country.

We went to another country (the 3 of us) and it was as if I wasn't even there....like on social media she only mentioned the other girl (who were friends before coming here) but still...Then she posted more photos of so many different people and nothing of me... even though in all the photos I'm there too! I have no idea why this girl is so fake towards me and so rude. I am super nice, never said anything offensive and let her borrow my stuff etc. I just don't get it and I got upset so I told the other girl I didn't want to go on our upcoming trip next month because I didn't want to deal with ""ingenuine"" people.

463,"A little background, me (21F) and my boyfriend (25M) lives in a small town, so we work for small companies, unfortunately in these companies there's not really space for growth. Me working in a home based spa, it's only me and the manager working and then the owner. Obviously owning it. My boyfriend is an IT technician working in a small company with 3 employees and again the owner. We've decided to move to a bigger city next year for better opportunities, we're already looking for jobs and I have my first interview tomorrow.

Now, the problem is, I absolutely love the place I work at, but my manager recently had a baby (3 weeks ago). So she's still off from work and will be back in a few weeks. But she'll be bringing the baby along as it's fine with our boss and I'm there and our cleaning lady is there as well.

My manager has run the place alone before for about a year. But now she's got a baby, and she and the owner keeps saying what a blessing I was showing up at the time I did (a year ago) before me they couldn't find anybody to fit the position.

In all honesty I love working there and feel extremely carefree to do so, my manager and boss is extremely nice people but unfortunately my manager has been working there 8 years, and she makes less than I made at my previous job. My salary is shit too, I only left my previous job to move closer to my boyfriend because his job was here and at the time it was easier. But again there will never be growth, now I'm not saying that I wanna get paid a shitload, I don't. Unfortunately what I'm getting doesn't pay the bills, and my boyfriend and I can get a wayyy better salary in tbe bigger city, plus his mom lives there and some of my family so it's just practical for us.

And when I get a new job I need to give a month's notice, which is fine most places understand. But the question is, how do I go about resigning, I feel like I'll feel so super bad about doing it, do I just send an email to the boss, or do I rather talk to my manager face to face, my boss stays about 4 hours awayband is actually retired, my manager runs the whole place. 

So I'm just not sure how to this, I already feel so bad, I don't just want to leave them, but it is for my future. 


TL;DR: Moving to the city for better opportunities, have an extremely nice boss and manager, only me and the manager working she just had a baby so it's just me. Need advice on how to resign in a nice way.",20Oct2019,1

465,"So a bit of context. 

Last year in late June, I adopted a kitten called Leo as a way of bringing myself out of my mental health rut. He was something for me to love, something for me to look forward to seeing, something for me to focus on. This year rolled around, Leo was supposed to turn one in April, and a week before his birthday would’ve been he got hit by a car and passed away. 

A month later, in May, my family decide to adopt two kittens that we named Ralph and Roo, despite me still mourning over Leo and not wanting another so soon. A few months pass, and it’s the beginning of September and Ralphy goes missing for a few days. This is super unlike him, usually he will go outside for two hours max. Every day I was going out every couple of hours, calling him, trying to find him but nothing. Then finally after three days I hear a meowing and whilst looking in my neighbours garden, her neighbour asks if anyone has lost a black cat. 

Eventually we managed to get him out, he’d been stuck between two brick walls for however long and couldn’t move himself. Vets thought he’d been ran over because his back legs were broken, his tail was broken, and he couldn’t control his bladder. Only after shaving him did they realise he’d been attacked by a fox or dog, and was covered in puncture wounds. At about 7pm they sent him home with us saying he’d been heavily medicated and would be out of it til morning, so we should bring him back for 9am. 

I went to work for a few hours (he was left with my mum) and arrived home around 11pm. I sat with Ralph for a few hours, until about 2am when he started making so so much noise from pain. He was suffering so much, and whilst I was stroking him he died just like that in front of me. 

I’ve never seen anyone or any pet die before, and it’s been so incredibly difficult to deal with. It’s only mind all of the time and even after nearly two months I’m still crying over it daily and I feel like I’m starting to fall back into a depression rut over it. 

TLDR; adopted one cat, he died, adopted another cat, he died within 5 months of the other

I went into severe depression late last year which lasted well into this year. Since then I've drifted apart from all my friends. I struggle with opening up but most of them know I struggle with some degree of depression and anxiety. Although I am now making some attempts to reconnect and meet up again, they always give some excuses of ""oh yeah we will hang out soon"" but we never find a date even when I open my entire schedule. I know they are not too busy because they still hang out with each other but have never invited me. I feel really lonely and I feel like I am losing the motivation to do anything because of the lack of a social component.

For the past month or so, I have been staying at home most of the time and doing nothing much. The only thing that I do that I still mildly enjoy is exercising but I am also beginning to lose interest in that because I have to do them alone.

I have a guy I am dating that supports me greatly but I feel like a great burden on him for depending on him for my sole social component from day to day. I am causing a toll on him because of my emotional instability and I feel pretty helpless about things.

469,"I live in a house with three other women while we finish school, one of which is my good friend from high school. We have gotten really close since then and I love having her in the house. Her boyfriend entered the picture last year before she moved in and now he comes over to our house a good amount of time. Whatever, the more the merrier. There have been a small series of instances when he comes over that another roommate and I have problems with, cumulating in the fact that my roommate thinks her boyfriend “basically lives here.” 

I came home after a stressful day at work last night to see the boyfriend in the kitchen. I said hi as I entered, then opened the door a bit more and saw three other people, two roommates and another boyfriend. Even though my social skills have improved greatly over the years, I was shocked at all the people in one place (doesn’t happen often with us) and think “shit, lotta people!” And go around and address the remaining people by, “hey /name here/“ and went up to my room, still a bit surprised. Not even two minutes later, I get an aggressive text from my roommate saying how pissed she was at me and how she doesn’t want to talk about it but I was incredibly rude and mean. 

Now, her and I don’t keep things bottled up for long periods of time, so I think, “oh! She didn’t hear me say hi to her boyfriend when I walked in so she’s mad about it”. Understandable, of course, but incredibly rude to jump and assume I would purposefully exclude greeting him, especially in her company. I explained what I said in the past paragraph but she wasn’t having it and, I can only guess, tried to catch me saying I knowingly excluded him. She also texted the other roommate who was there asking if she heard me say hi. After that, she texted me again and ended with saying she didn’t want me to walk on eggshells around her and can tell her anything but I almost don’t want to tell her things anymore if she was so angry about a misunderstanding.

I understand why she was upset not hearing me say hello originally, but I don’t feel it was right to be super defensive and outwardly aggressive immediately.

472,"Some back story before we get to the animal abuse part so you can understand what I'm dealing with here...

So about a year ago my sister's ex broke things off with her. She was dating an emotionally abusive man with a religious cult-like family who is extremely secretive. Looks pretty on the outside but on the inside the family are all brainwashed and abused. The mother of her bf is entitled and takes all their paychecks for herself then rules the family with an iron fist. There are 12-13 of them all living in one house. We tried really hard to stay in contact with her but as we didn't know where they lived/she would ignore our texts/phone calls and I had to go to her work to even speak with her. He prevented her from most contact with us and would read her phone and Snoop to anything we said to her. I personally cussed him out multiple times and he hated me especially because I wasn't falling for his bullshit. Finally recently she has seen the light and admits he is probably a sociopath. 

Fast forward to current times.
The family moved to a new house and has been using the neighbors facilities as apparently there are rats in their well. Gross. Also said ex boyfriend has a new girlfriend with a child and she has a dog. Now I'm guessing he is implementing the same emotional abuse in his new relationship as he was with my sister. My boss is friends with the neighbor and she came into my work the other day and notified my boss that she saw two of the boys in their family holding the dog on a leash and beating it. There are four brothers and they look similar from a distance so she couldn't say exactly who beat the dog but she stated she was thinking about not letting them use her bathroom any longer because of what she saw. I mentioned it to my sister and she tearfully admitted that while she was living there she had a hedgehog and didn't notice it had stopped eating its food. She found it dead in it's cage one day and thought it had just passed on. Later on he ex told her he had broken it's leg on purpose because he hated it and that it couldn't reach it's food bowl because of it. It had starved to death. She also admitted that he confessed when he was younger he abused his brothers dog and hung it repeatedly in their barn over a beam with a moose until it almost passed out multiple times. She was terrified of this man and so didn't say anything to us or anyone else. I can't stand the thought of him doing this to that girl's dog. I don't know what her full name is but I don't think saying anything to her specifically will help as a husband of one of the exs sisters has already tried to talk to her and tell her he's scared for the dog and she brushes it off! Someday I believe his abuse will escalate towards her and possibly even her daughter. There is no evidence except word of mouth right now unless I go steal the dog idk what I can do as far as legal wise trying to get it safe. Everyone in town thinks their family is so amazing because they do alot of volunteer work and they fake nice very well. Are there any options anyone knows of other than calling the police with no evidence except an eye witness? I can't bear the thought of this dog dying and being tortured but I don't know what to do at this point their family is crafty and all about appearances so they don't make mistakes like this often.

I don‘t know why I felt like that but I do so often. I feel awkward when I‘m around people which leads to me not having a lot of friends. I have 1 „main friend“ and he doesn‘t treat me too well.

We've helped her with money (nothing huge), basic necessities for her kids, etc. My husband changes her flat tires, jumps her car when it breaks down, takes her kids fishing, basically the things her array of meth using boyfriends should do, but don't. I've gotten her boyfriends jobs (one of them smoked pot his car while I was paying him for a handyman job in the parking lot of my workplace) which has always blown up in my face. One of these boyfriends beat her kids with a belt and left bruises all over their legs, she had to call the police, but she still lets this man in her home when she's lonely.

She got community service for the ticket, since she claimed she was indignant and is a student living off government subsidies and loans. Fast forward to six months later and she (of course) didn't do the community service. So she tells me she wants to say she did community service at my workplace, and can I please tell the court she did her community service hours at my school? I told her no, it has to be non-profit and I could get in trouble with the court if I lie and get caught. So she does it anyway and doesn't tell me. The court called her to get the nonprofit number, and of course she doesn't have it because my workplace is a private school and we're definitely not nonprofit. So she then decided to tell me she lied and put my information down, even though I asked her not to.

481,"Hello everyone, throwaway account because my friends and girlfriend know my real one. I'm not a native english speaker, so forgive me for any mistake (I'm in a hurry rn too), and if you need more details, please ask. I hope many people will read this and give me some advice.

Let me explain a really difficult situation I'm finding myself involved in.

I'm engaged with a girl I knew on Facebook. She lives in my same town, she's one year younger than me (I'm almost 23), and she's amazing. I love hanging with her, she's funny, smart, loves art and pop culture. I find her beautiful, she has nothing wrong at all.

After a couple of months, last week I decided to introduce her to my parents. 
That's where the nightmare began. 
When she went away that evening, they started the drama: I can't stay with her, she's not the right one for me because she's too ugly. Short, big breast, they say she's deformed. 
I desperately tried to convince them that they got the wrong idea, that she's a beautiful person both inside and outside, but to no avail. 
They spent the whole night crying, throwing a fit and pretending/wishing to die (especially my mother).
They thought this girl has led me into a trap, because the pics are different from reality. They also accuse me of being so easily accepting towards people. The way they see it, they believe I'm convinced I cannot find another girl, so I stuck with her. For me, they would like another girl, one they like.

They say I should be ashamed to introduce her to the society as my partner. But I don't agree with them, not one bit. No matter how many times I told them it's me that needs to choose, they don't understand. 
She's not at all ugly, she's perfect for me, and I want to be left in peace when I with her.

I had to choose between them and her: I am ruining the family, they say, because I don't listen to their advice, and one day I'll regret staying with her, because of her appearance.

Arguments carried on for a couple of days. I even pretended to leave her, while we actually stayed together. This led to a temporary truce, but I couldn't keep it hidden, so it exploded again.

Somehow, one evening I managed to hang out with her after an afternoon of arguments, so me and my girl decided to ask for help. We are not religious at all (while my family is) but in that moment, I saw God as my only chance. 

We went to speak to a local priest, one I've known since I was a kid. He knows my family too. We explained the situation.
It was unsustainable for me. I was even afraid to stay at home because of arguments, because my mother would threaten to kill herself because of this. 

The priest said he was with us, he agrees with me that she's beautiful, and that they are wrong to oppose to this harmless love story. But he couldn't do nothing to help us. He said time will fix things. 
Somehow, we felt better. That evening, I even received the support of all my friends, I felt like I would win this.

The following day, we had the last argument with my parents. They basically allowed me to do whatever I wanted, but they wouldn't be happy st all.

This kind of peace (I was slowly starting to get used to it, thinking I had won) lasted until today.
My mother of course wasn't the same during these days: cold, distant, caring for me just for necessities. But today things went south again. My parents have not accepted this situation yet. My mother asks me to take care of my little brother, because she says she doesn't want to live anymore. 

I'm actually torn. I don't know what to do. I want to love this girl, but I also want my family. I don't want to decide between the two, it's nonsense. I'm not committing any crime, I don't want to bring shame to no one. I want my family, I want to love who I want.

482,"So I decided to quit smoking weed, because I feel it made me a bit lazier, less focused and less ambitious. I wasn't physically addicted to it, so quitting really isn't the problem for me.

I enjoy bodybuilding and looking up things about science or the world economy on the internet, because I find them interesting, but going to the gym only takes about 2 hours a day and I can't just sit at home behind my computer for the rest of the day so I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for new things to invest my time in or if anyone who has been in a similar situation can tell me about their experience.

484,"I apologize in advance if this story is confusing. There's a lot to explain.

So, for context, I (my exact age isn't really relevant here, but I'm a teenager) live with my mother, and it's just the two of us. During the week, she is gone most of the day because she works. I, however, do my schoolwork online, so I'm at home.

Last week, my mother expressed her interest in getting a dog. Specifically, a Yorkie puppy. She had seen a post online, and that led her to search for one. I told her that I didn't really want a dog (for reasons I'll explain later), but she persisted. She found someone relatively close by that had a Yorkie puppy (four months old) for sale, and asked me to at least go and meet it. I agreed. To be completely honest, I knew going in that I didn't want a dog, especially not this dog, but I thought if I at least met it and told her afterward I still didn't want it, it would be okay.

We went and met the dog (I'll refer to it as such because I have friends and family members on Reddit, and I'd rather them not know about this), and the owner (who was a breeder), explained a lot about it and their training methods, and the whole experience confirmed for me that I didn't want to do this. My mom, however, really liked the puppy. We started to talk afterward, and I explained multiple reasons why I didn't think it was a good idea:

1. It came from a dog breeder, and I didn't want to support that. The parents and the puppy were well cared for and kept out of cages, but even still, I didn't want to support using animals for profit, and whole dog breeding business in general. The owner revealed that the mother was artificially inseminated, and for some reason for me that made it worse. The whole thing just felt wrong. I told her that, in the small chance I would get a dog, I would get it from a rescue shelter. There's a lot of people who would want a Yorkie puppy, that's why it was bred, but a dog in the shelter might not have the same fate.
2. It was a lot of money, that I don't think my mother really could afford. The puppy alone was $800 and there's supplies on top of that. My mother has recently separated from my stepfather, and she already made it sound like money wasn't in abundance, yet here she is, wanting to do this. My grandmother expressed concern about this as well.
3. This is perhaps the biggest reason, or at least the second biggest, behind the first reason I gave. My mother works and is gone the majority of the day, and she often has something to do after work, so she's gone even longer. This means that I'm the one that's going to be taking care of this dog. She'll be home maybe four or so hours in the evening until she goes to bed, leaving me to care for it until then. I don't think it's very fair to leave me to care for a dog I frankly don't have any emotional connection to. It's not fair to the dog, either. I've considered going back to school in person next year, but if I did that, it'd leave the dog in its crate the whole day, and that's obviously not an option.

Despite my arguments, my mother decided to go and buy the dog anyway. More specifically, she bought it for a two week trial period. That was yesterday evening. I'm sitting here typing this while I'm at home alone, watching the dog.

It's already hard. To me, it's another source of stress that I just don't need. It's another living being that I have to worry about and constantly watch. I can't control what it does. Is it going to try and eat something and choke? Is it going to try and jump of the bed and end up hurting itself? Its wellbeing has been placed into my hands, and to be honest, as lazy and selfish as I might sound, I can't take it. It's a lot of mental energy that I don't have. I think it's a bit unfair that I've been placed in this situation. My mom, however, loves it already. She said that she's always wanted a Yorkie, and she seems happy with it.

486," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",20Oct2019,0
489,"My friend(lets call her Sara) was murdered by her boyfriend(Josh) and hes only getting a Manslaughter charge, when he was trafficking her, other women also, abusing her, and he shot her in cold blood and left her on a porch to die alone, so any sane person would think Josh is the scum of the earth right?. Well, My old roommate (Rose) introduced me a year ago to Sara, the first time i met her was because my roommate Rose called me and said “my friend sara is outside the house and her boyfriend is keeping her hostage in the car, please go help her, im not there, hes the type of person who would kill their gf”, so me being me, i went outside in the cold November rain and told Josh that I’m bringing sara inside, i didnt even know the girl but she looked so scared... Josh of course started cussing at me and threatening me, at that point i go back inside and call the police, they dont come, hes still outside screaming at her, i call the police again, they dont come, josh leaves, i go outside and find her crying in the car, she tells me her story about being trafficked, kidnapped, raped, abused, and her struggles with addiction, i cry with her, i hold her and tell her shes important and worth more than that. 4 hours later the police show up, she tells them she’s scared hes going to kill her, she cant go anywhere because he will find her, Sara give them his name and address, the police dont write down a single thing, no report, all they do is give her a card with a woman shelter... so Sara is now really important to me, mainly because my sister works for a company that rehabilitates victims of H.T, so it hits hard for me she is a victim of it. I let Sara stay at me and Rose’s place, i feed her, I encourage her, i hold her when she cries, i stay up with her when she cant sleep because of all the trauma and fear stained in her. Sara is manipulated by Josh, she tells Josh where she is(shes hiding from him at our house). Josh is angry, he breaks into my home, attacks my friends i have over Threatens to shoot up my house, i call the police, i hated him, so i got my pepperspray and sprayed as long and as close as i could to his eyes(now i wish i killed him), Sara leaves with Josh, the police show up, no reports made even after giving then Sara and Josh info. Rose is angry at Sara for telling him where she is, yet I understand where she came from, abuse is a scary cycle. So Josh now really hates me, he would genuinely kill me, i am not scared of him though, he isnt anything without weapons (hes 4’11🙄), i have to sneak around to help Sara, i care about her eating and being safe. Rose my roommate doesnt seem to care about her really, she drives her to her “dates” with men, i cry and tell her that she shouldnt do that, she continues to though, Rose hangs out with the scumbag Josh, Rose tells me Josh wants to fuck her and make her one of his girls...she asks me if she should do it, she actually considers it. she says Sara is a “crackhead” “whore””crazy”, the words Josh told her most likely, she tells me “hes not as bad as you think”, Rose is being manipulated by Josh now, Josh is getting Rose to help traffic Sara. I go hang out with rose and sara in a hotel room, josh is showing up, sara tells me i have to hide because he will kill you, i hide in the hotels stairwell, sara and rose freak out because they think they lost me or Josh saw me and hurt me, i am fine, Rose cusses out Sara and fights with her because she is blaming her for putting me at risk, when the only reason theres a risk is because of Josh... this is the last time i see Sara... i dont hear from her ever again, never hear her laugh or poetry again because Rose says shes a “bad person” and i know it isnt safe to be around her because Josh can show up at anytime. Rose calls me and says “josh killed sara” i cry, rose says “we all knew this would happen”, i am full of regret, i didnt get to see Sara for over a year because of Josh, and now i wont ever see her again because of Josh. I am heartbroken, but mostly angry, angry at the cops for not locking him up earlier, angry at myself for not trying harder to get her away from him, angry because he is saying Josh was in a fight with another person and Sara tried breaking it up and got shot by Josh... so hes only getting Manslaughter which isnt enough justice for Sara... i call the detective and tell him my story, he says they know he trafficked woman but they cant find them, he asks for my help because he doesnt want him on the streets ever again, i tell him my roommate knows some of the women. I text my roommate the situation, her first reply is “wym” I explained again, all she said was “damn”... if she would come forward and tell the cops anonymously he tried pimping her out and she drove Michelle to her dates with men like the detective said we should, Josh would be behind bars for 40+ years. I am angry, i want justice for her, she deserves it... i dont know what to do, should i come forward with my story? Im not sure if it would help him get trafficking charges... he deserves to be in prison, he deserves to be someones bitch in prison, he deserves to be fucked and fucked and fucked against his will, so he feels what he did to those women and Sara. I know I’ve said this multiple times, i am angry, sad, and overwhelmed, i need your help, even if its just kind words to help me get through this, anything. Thank you in advance, also sorry for any grammar errors, its not the most important thing to me right now.",20Oct2019,2

493,"So, i met this girl one year ago in my class. But we really started talking months ago, she seemed cool but I’m not interested in a relationship yet, she kept inviting me to an instagram group with her friends, don’t even know most of them and the group was just pure spamming, i left since i hate spams. Next day went by then she started sending me messages like help - I got anxious and asked her what happened, she said she was feeling depressed then i talked to her and asked her if she could talk to someone that could really help her then she called me a crazy person and was saying that i was calling her crazy for asking her. It was always stuff like, i’m feeling down and i always acknowledged that but it was all the time (which is fine), a week ago she told me about a gang that wanted to kill her because her friend made a joke about them, i told her that i needed to tell somebody she insisted in saying no and told me to help her... now i’m not even past 20 and don’t even know how to properly punch somebody how the hell am i supposed to help like that? She doesn’t want an authority to help she wants me to help. One day she comes and says that some kid that bullies her choked her, i wanted to tell the principal but she wouldn’t let me and i even told her if she wanted me to talk to the kid, Another day, she comes and tells me her friend made another joke to some other person then came to me and asked for help again, another day she told me that her friend was her only real friend out of the blue... I just shrugged it off. Now, i have no experience and i have no idea how to talk normally or help people, but for what I experienced this is different and she is always asking me for help, i told her that we can talk but I can’t fight somebody because it’s not my problem i can’t simply just fight somebody because you bullied that person or something. I want to help her but everytime i give an advice or something she’s always like life is life, it doesn’t matter i’m always saying it does matter and you matter, i’m always trying to help her but she doesn’t listen, she doesn’t want my help and also she insists in saying that her real only friend is the same girl who made fun of the guy, listen I don’t care who your real friend is, i’m here to help you and not listen to why she’s your real friend. Sorry for the long text, but i need advices i’m not trying to be an asshole but I seriously don’t know how to help and i can’t fight somebody, i only know her for 1 year and we didn’t even talk, she needs help i know that but she doesn’t want it, i asked her if i could talk with the principal she always says no.",20Oct2019,1
494,"Please help. 

My teenage years SUCKED. I was going through a lot of emotional turmoil. I smoked a shit ton of weed to cope with this. School was going terribly. I had awful friends who bullied me. I was the punching bag of the group, but I think (as far as I can remember) that I was just happy to have friends or a group to be included in. There were some good times, but I've kind of mentally blocked out ages 11-17.

Anyways, I just finished my job, and I'm revving up to apply to a new one. I Google searched myself last night because I was curious about what I'd find. I know that some HR departments search potential candidates online. A video from YouTube came up called ""beat the (my name) game"". I recognized the name of the person who posted it, so I clicked on it.

In the video, Im standing there high as fuck surrounded by my ""friends"" and opposite of the girl who used to bully me the most. She's screaming at me and everyone is cheering her on. The camera is panning to various people and they're like ""war crying"" and making bets. Finally, the camera pans back to me and this girl, and she tackles me and starts fucking beating me up. Like banging my head into the ground, punching me (lightly), screaming at me, and making fun of me. I'm like fighting back, but I was super skinny back then (5'2, 85 pounds). I couldn't get her off. I'm also just really stoned. Everyone is cheering and acting like it's a fucking boxing match or whatever. 

Finally, she gets off. A kind girl is helping me up. I have a red mark on my face, and I look in the mirror. I don't look too well. Then, the video shuts off.

I wasn't prepared for that. That was a really bad time in my life. Plus, it was just really fucked up and disturbing to watch.

As I said, I knew the girl who posted it, and I'm friends with her on Instagram. I reached out and asked her to take it down. It wasn't a hostile message. Just a message letting her know that I Google searched myself, found it, and would appreciate it if she delete it from her YouTube. Is that weird that I reached out and asked her to do that?? I feel fucking weird about it because it was 2am and hadn't talked to her in 10 years. She hasn't responded (it's almost noon where I am). 

I just feel so fucking upset about discovering this video. I feel so weird that I asked the poster to take it down because it's a video from so long ago and we havent talked in a really long time. I actually threw up last night after watching it. I discussed this with one of my few close friends who I've had since I was a kid. She's like family. She told me to report it. Other than that, I don't feel comfortable telling anyone else.. Like my bf or my other close friend. I don't want them to know how I used to be or how I let other people treat me. Maybe I should? But I just feel uncomfortable. 

I wish I could permanently erase that part of my life, but it's unfortunate that past events spill into your current life.

Thanks for listening, and please let me know if you have any advice. I'd really appreciate it in this moment of shittiness.",20Oct2019,6

498,"I've been talking to this guy, Jake, for about a month. We met through mutual friends, my good friend Belle is dating his friend Andrew and our friend groups are pretty intertwined by this point. He seemed great at first, his friends spoke highly of him, he's finishing up an engineering degree, close to his family, all of that. We've spent time together with our other friends, but only had two official dates since we live about 45 mins apart and I've been traveling for work so our schedules didn't line up.

Last night he and his two friends drove up to where Belle and I live, we were planning on seeing a movie and going out after. After the movie we came back and ordered some food before we went out.  It's important to note that Jake has been to my place twice before this and we haven't slept together yet. He wanted to shower before going out, which was a little weird, but no big deal. I got him a towel and told him what stuff he could use. He came out and made a point of telling me that he had seen the conditioner that I told him about but chose to use my expensive shampoo/conditioner that I specifically said not to use. I didn't know what the hell to say because I was so taken aback? I dye my hair so there was no point for him to use my color-treated conditioner. This was in front of everyone else and I sort of just let it go. 

Because everyone had been drinking, they decided to sleep at my apartment. My roommate has a futon, we've got a comfortable couch, it's doable. I let everyone use my bathroom to get ready to sleep and while I was helping one of the guys make up the futon I realized Jake had been in my bathroom for a long time. I knocked on the door and asked if he needed anything, he told me to come in and I walked in to him on his knees going through the cabinet under my sink. I'm pretty sure he realized I was upset when I said ""what the fuck are you doing?!"" He goes ""oh I'm just looking for a hairbrush, it's no big deal."" We argued about it for a minute, but it was really late, everyone was there, and we were all a little buzzed still. He did admit to going through ALL of my bathroom cabinets and the closet, which I am still \*furious\* about. I don't know why he didn't just ask me for a hairbrush, and the dude has long hair, he could have brought his own! 

I'm really uncomfortable with him going through everything in my bathroom. Do I care about him seeing my makeup, tampons, towels, whatever? No... but I'm fuming over how he didn't see an issue with it, and told me to calm down and not get upset. I'm an only child, he has siblings, so maybe I'm going overboard with the privacy thing? But I'm still so mad. My gut instinct was to throw him out, honestly. The smug way he said he used my conditioner and the way he had no problem looking through everything. Disgusting. 

I didn't say much then, just that it was not okay and that we'd talk about it later. I don't know how to bring it up now? Was wanting to throw him out an overreaction?

502,"I work as an agency laborer. I get paid on time and for the hours I work. But, £40 gets taken out of my paycheck every week because of agency fees. I worked out the wage and I'm basically paid just under £1 over minimum wage. Also, the work is usually very basic, I'm a hard worker but I you can't put your all in when you don't want to be there. Not to mention it's getting cold in my area. If that wasn't enough my coworkers have a poor grasp of English, so I can only make small talk once or twice an hour and spend lunch looking at my phone. 

My goal is to take some exams and get an IT helpdesk job. However, the time between studying, applying and getting the exams and job offer is realistically 2-3 months. I just don't want to work as a laborer for 3 months. 

I could get a card and get a traffic marshal job but it would take 100 hours before I start making a profit off it. Although considering the work is easier(direct vehicles, general public, signing people in and out, playing on phone ), I could probably waive off 50 hours.

Right now I plan on working enough for November and December rent(live with parents), and find any other job. So something like 3 more weeks. I could work for 1.5 months and have enough to pay for rent and most of my exams but by that time I'm in the worst part of the year to be a job applicant.

**The job I will do cannot be worse than what I already do, but if it is, then I can easily go back to laboring.**

Here is my schedule :

* Wake up after 5-8 hours of sleep. Take a caffeine pill + vitamins and feel euphoria for 3 hours. (probably from caffeine?)
* Go to class and learn 
* Eat and socialize
* Go to the gym (used to be 7 times a week now 3)
* Spend time with (f19) girlfriend and study or go out. 

I drink tea and feel ULTRA peaceful and content. I can just sit and love life for hours. Think and be grateful for everything. Throughout the whole day, I feel like I won the best life possible and the gratefulness just doesn't go away? How do I ALWAYS get amazed by little things and find everyone beautiful and special?

I don't understand if I am supposed to be happy all the time. I come from an extremely poor background and was quite miserable until I left home and started college. Now it's completely the opposite.

**Where I think my happiness comes from:**


* I somehow achieve everything I dream about eventually. 

*Wanted a car? Got it. Wanted a certain phone? Got it. Wanted to live in a dream house? Got it. Wanted to be in my dream grad program? Got in.*

*  The way I look. 
*I won a genetic lottery for this culture and I feel I am slightly more narcissistic than average, physically looking the way  I want helps.*

* Dating most girls I find attractive and now having intelligent gorgeous girlfriend who connects with me on every level. 

*Is this normal? Why do I feel confident and happy when 5 years ago I felt little and miserable?*

My brain processes everything in a positive way. I got three midterms this week and I am semi-ready yet my brain is happy. I know I will study more and be prepared, yet I am not as anxious as I should be?

I shrugged it off as just her complaining but now I feel like I missed something in that interaction. I don’t know what do you guys think?",20Oct2019,1
515,"I would really appreciate your input regarding my university prospects. I received my SAT results yesterday and I got a 1490, a bit lower than my expectations, but it was my first contact with the college board so I don’t think that I can complain about the score. I also took the ACT and had a score of 35. Here comes the tricky part. I’d like to apply to Ivy league-esque universities, meaning that I’d love to study at Princeton, Brown etc. but I also consider the lower tier universities in Europe, like King’s college or LSE. I finished high school at 17 and got a perfect score in the CAE exam. But my high school diploma roughly translates to 3.0, because of some bullshit translation rules. I am taking the CIE A-Level exams and already have received an A in the AS Level history exam, however, the rest of my exams are all next year. Would universities of that caliber offer me places or would they be concerned with the uncertainty regarding my grades? Cambridge already told my that the CIE A-Levels would be considered retakes and therefore less valuable, but I’m not sure if other universities see this the same way.",20Oct2019,1

518,"Hello redditors! Obvious throw away account here. I am 21 F (going on 22 in Nov). My college graduation date is approx December 2020. I’m a very hardworking student, I was inducted into the a national honor society my freshman year, and I am a member of many clubs. Due to financial issues with my family I was forced to leave that school in spring 2017, take a semester off to figure things out, and I returned to a different school in spring 2018! I transferred back to my current school as a commuter in fall 2018 &amp; now here we are. That’s just context. In the midst of ALL that is being a first gen college student I’m also fighting personal struggles everyday. I have a bad case of anxiety, I’ve suffered from depressive episodes numerous times, and I’m also struggling with a pretty strong dependence on marijuana. My home life is very very triggering. I always feel like I have one Foot in the ghetto and one foot out (I still live in the projects with my grandmother, her long time boyfriend, and my sister). I’m constantly seeing two different worlds. There’s also drug abuse in my home by someone other than me with something much harder. That abuse leads to very loud and scary frightening even tho I’m 22. These things have been going on since I was a child though pretty sure I have a mild case of PTSD bc of it. My mom &amp; dad arent very active. My mom lives 5 mins away &amp; I’m pretty sure my dad is living with his brother. My mom is more concerned with her own life and she’s always been that way which is why I was raised by my grandmother. The anger I feel toward my parents esp my mom has clouded a lot of my judgement I think. I feel like I’m always looking for an opportunity to be mean &amp; aggressive (it usually comes out when I’m driving). I also find it hard to be happy for other people. My first thought is always a negative one. What I’m asking you for are tips and direction on how to navigate this life? I have no idea what I’m doing or why I’m doing it past I just want to get my family out of the projects and protect my sister so she doesn’t end up as damaged as I am. But honestly it’s prob too late bc of how mean I am to her. I don’t want to be or mean to be but I’m so FRUSTRATED with everything. I’ve also had to assume a parent like role in her life because of our deadbeat mother. I was literally raising her at one point. I hate being mean to her because she deserves so much better than all of us but I’m very unhappy with myself. I know I won’t be able to do much in life if my mind is polluted but I have no money And no resources to see a professional face to face. podcasts, your instagram accounts, YT videos, God, and even reddit are all that has kept me alive for awhile (and I do mean alive). I’ve seen a little light recently and decided that life is worth sticking around for &amp; that maybe if I’m authentic and truthful about what I feel and who i am then it may get better for me. However, the environment I’m in right now is screaming the opposite. I know this was long (sorry!!!) but I really need help. I’m not able to keep friends or boyfriends bc I push them away. That may be a combination of the relationship I have with my parents &amp; the sexual abuse I suffered at 10 yrs old. I’ve really been through a lot and just can’t seem to get out of it. I’m not really able to keep anything it seems but school, my weed habit, and myself? What are your thoughts?",20Oct2019,2

530,"Hey, so today Is my cousins birthday and for some background I rarely see them ,just found out the party was today late last night, and I’m usually pretty upbeat and telling jokes for the whole event (birthday party, Christmas party, etc)

So I woke up today not feeling so well in a mental way. Last Friday I had to stay home because I was so scared about going to school for reasons I don’t feel are important and just wanted to lay low until I see my therapist on Monday.

Then I remembered It was my cousins birthday party today and it was happening at our house and I started feeling anxious about being around that many people on short notice. Don’t get me wrong I love my family and would die for them it’s just today I feel like if I go I’d be a drag to the party since I probably wouldn’t talk as much as I usually would and just be in the corner so to speak.

I asked my mom if she could tell them I’m sick so I can hang out in my room till it’s over and she thought I should go to the party since 1. It’s happening at our house and 2. I don’t see my cousins as often anymore.

This got me thinking and getting worried that if I don’t go my cousin will be mad at me or something. And the more that I think about it it would kinda be a douche thing to not to go to a party that is at your house but it also kinda douche to not be excited over a party that is for a family member.

535,"I have had some trouble in the past because of drinking. I don’t drink frequently in number or days, but when I do (say back in college, on a Friday night out) I sometimes overdo it. 

The problem has been that I tend to be a light weight but on top of that, I BLACK OUT. I forget what happens at the end of the night after barely any drinks at all. It’s kind of a dangerous thing for a woman, and admittedly it gets me in trouble. 

So my dilemma is, I have tried and tried to get the whole “2 drinks if your limit for the night” thing down, and it doesn’t always work. But if it only works half the time, that doesn’t exactly count because it only takes one bad night to do something stupid and hurt yourself. I’ve heard a really bad story about a guy who ended up in a wheelchair permanently because of a bad night on a trip to Europe.

I decided that abstinence is the best option for me, but every once in a while I’ll still engage in a little. I’ve been doing really well. Engaging in a little for a DnD session or something is fine. But last night I went out with friends who make me feel safe, and I overdid it and now I feel really upset. Nothing I did was bad and to regret, but what scares me is that I let myself indulge again. It’s so dangerous. And honestly when it happened, I was literally not even thinking about my drink limit. I was so in the zone about having fun.

Tl;dr: I’m beating myself up fam. How do I proceed? Has anyone had a struggle like this with alcohol? Where you don’t drink frequently, but when you do, you overdo it EVERYTIME? It’s dangerous and scary. And I know myself enough to know that For me: it’s a slippery slope and I cannot always adhere to the 2 drink limit.",20Oct2019,2

547,"Girl in question is a sibling of one of my best friends. A couple months ago, when I met her she hooked up with an acquaintance of mine, then a couple weeks later did the same with someone else I know. 

I always got along with this girl really well, but I was never really into her because she hooked up with those guys I know. Now it’s a good while later and based on what her sister told me she would want to date me or something. And yea it’s obvious to me she really likes me and appreciates me. She’s said as much herself. 

One issue is she goes to another college 60 miles away from mine. The other issue is completely in my head, and it’s that she slept with those two guys. 

Last weekend she was visiting and we drunkenly cuddled for a while and talked about all sorts of things. I was so scared it was going to escalate to kissing or something. I have a lot of weird feelings about sex and intimacy that I need to overcome, but in general I was somewhere between super anxious and super happy this entire time. 

And this has been the trend now for a bit when I see her. I’m fine around her and acting myself, she kinda comes at me and I stiffen up. I’m probably really frustrating her.  

This kinda reads more like an r/offmychest than a advice post, but I need some guidance idk. I feel like I’m leading her on but I’m not trying to.

550,"Hi, 

So yesterday I went to a party, I got pretty drunk, I could still walk, and I remember the whole night, so I wasn't that drunk. I met a girl at the party, who I went home with. we had consensual sex, which lasted for at least 30 minutes because I couldn't finish, and this was my first time too, hence why I need advice. the reason I'm writing here is because although she did consent to sex, when we decided to eventually stop she seemed down. During the intercourse, I made sure everything was okay, I asked her every 5 minutes or so if she is okay and before everything I did I asked her if she would be fine with that. When we stopped, I put the condom aside next to the bed. When she left (she decided to leave without staying the night, she had to be somewhere this morning) and I was getting ready to go to bed, I realized the condom was gone. I tried to look for it everywhere, even the wrapper was gone. The girl is religious and has a 4 line tattoo that says something about God, I couldn't really read because of the heat of the moment and the alcohol in my system. She is also close with her parents.

So I'm asking for advice on what I should do, I'm scared she would accuse me of sexual assault and possibly use that condom as evidence. Again, this was my first time going through anything like that so I don't really know what to expect and I'm just really confused why she would take that condom. Is there any way to calm down the anxiety or anything else I could do to improve the situation? Is there anything I've done wrong? Is there anything I could do better next time? Is there a way I could avoid something similar from happening in the future? And if something like this happens again, how do I deal with that? 

Can I please get some advice? Thanks in advance.",20Oct2019,2

558,"I think this will be a bit lengthy so I will do a TLDR.

Last night my close friend and I went to a party. It wasn't too bad at first until 2AM hit when this really drunk girl started flirting with everybody. My close friend wanted to do a one night stand with her, and I was all cool with it. However, the night started going to shit when she started to hit on me. I'm already taken, and it made me really uncomfortable. On the bright side, my friend managed to keep her attention for a long time. It got very late and she wanted us to go to her house to get weed. I was ok with this, as at time I did not realize how under the influence she was. She turned a 5 minute drive into a thirty minute one, insulting me and my friend the entire way for being ""annoying."" She forced my friend to make us smoke in the car, something I was not comfortable at all doing, so I stepped out of the car. My friend consoled me and told me that we will just go back home and it will be fine. ""What a great friend I have, I am so happy I met him!"" I said. I tell him that he really should not do anything with her ever again and break contact with her and she agrees. I go to his room and crash for the night. At least, I thought I did. I end up waking up to them having sex in the bed next to me.  I lay there in perpetual disbelief at what is happening until I get up and leave. My friend gives me a very tired ""sorry"" before I go to sleep downstairs. After I sober up in the morning, I go home without saying goodbye.

How do I handle this situation? I have been friends with this guy for years and this is the first time he has done something like this to me. I would like to keep him, but also express how hurt I am so he won't do it again.

TLDR: A drunk girl at a party harasses  and annoys me and my friend the whole night. My friend agrees that it was bad that he hit on her and kissed her and stuff, and vows not to do anything with her again. I wake up to them having sex next to me hours later.

My parents are in their mid 40s and will pay off their morgane when they are 70! After seeing all of the house flipping shows, they are convinced that they can buy this beach house and renovate it to make a profit. I have tried to explain to them that they aren't professionals, neither one works in real estate or any similar job, and there is high risk. Everything I tell them, they brush off. I am worried because if it flops, my family is screwed. They don't make a ton of money and they want to take the risk. I know that its ultimately their decision, but I'm worried that my family will be in major debt because of this. I feel like I'm the only one who is thinking rationally. Please help.",20Oct2019,3

565,"TLDR: I haven’t seen my family in almost two months because seeing them throws me into mental instability, but I feel really guilty.

I moved away from my family home about 4 months ago, and I think it was the best decision of my life. I was so unhappy living with my family and while I know my parents would’ve loved me to stay, I needed to leave. I was having such anxiety and depression because of feeling suffocated by my parents. Even as a grown adult with a full time job, I felt like I needed to walk on eggshells and couldn’t do anything for myself while I was living with them.

Fast forward to two months ago. I tried sleeping over for a while because other family was visiting and it sent me into a spiral. The yelling and craziness of the house reminded me of my childhood and I just couldn’t take it. I left and haven’t been back since.

Even though I know they are unhealthy for me and haven’t been the best, I feel so guilty for not seeing them. Every time I’ve seen them since I’ve moved out, it’s resulted in me being unhappy and unstable. My boyfriend is trying to remind me to fight the guilt but it’s so damn hard. 

Should I bite the bullet and see them to rid myself of the guilt? (I think this would cause more tension because then there’d be a chance that they’d want me to visit even more often afterwards) Or should I just continue to live my life without seeing them until I’m ready?",20Oct2019,1
566,"Hi. I’m a senior in HS. I’m the quiet kid I guess, I’m shy and only really talk to people in my history class cause we’re all nerds, but outside of that nobody ever speaks to me unless required like a group activity or something, and when that happens it’s usually pretty great, i make people laugh and it’s a good time, but as soon as that’s over it’s back to no friend town USA. Like I get I’m fat and ugly and my name is hard to remember since I’m trans so it doesn’t match what’s on the class role but sometimes I really try, i dress as nice as I can really try to appear pretty and feminine and nothing is different. So I go back to my shitty black t shirts and jacket and headphones and I know that probably makes me harder to approach but at this point I’m sure it doesn’t change much. I just don’t know what to do. I used to have a friend group. I used to have a girlfriend. Now I have nothing. My only friend is my ex who’s super nice sure but one minute she’s talking about how she’d date me again if we lived closer and another she’s telling me about her boyfriend who just bought her a promise ring and this is her best relationship yet, which is a lot on my mind in it’s own right.

In reality my life was just in shambles and the habit stuck and it’s become pathological. I’m in college now, and away from my toxic family for the most part, and I want to save myself before it’s too late, and ruin the few relationships I have left even more.

571,"This is a little long but please stick with me, this is my first time on this subreddit. For context, yesterday I(m16) invited two of my closest friends over (both f16) who i consider as family. We went to the park near my house and had a picnic then came back to my house and watched a movie and baked sugar cookies. It was a fun time and no drugs or alcohol was involved. When we left to go to the park my parents were also leaving to go to an event at my sisters school while my younger sister was also out with her friends. My friends leave around 10 which my parents were ok with then i try to go to sleep. 

At round 11:30 my parents come home with my dad clearly wasted. When he comes in the house he shouts my name which i don’t hear. He then goes upstairs and shouted again which scares the hell out of me then u go to him and he just says he was wondering where i was then laughs. i go back to my bed a little frustrated. my sister comes home(even later than my parents) and my dad tells her to “check my room for girls”. she walks in then i tells her to stop then she tells my dad it’s just me and he just laughs it off. He goes downstairs and sees the heater was on (which i decided to turn on because i was cold). He yells at me asking why the hell i turned the heater on. i tell him i’m sorry i didn’t think you would think it was a big deal. He gets even more mad saying that he isn’t mad that i turned on the heater but is mad because of WHY i turned it on. I tell him i am completely lost and don’t understand. He asks if i’m high and i tell him no and he could even check if he wanted to. He continues to ask why i turned on the heater when i keep telling him i was cold because i can’t see any other answer.  He calls me fucking stupid and i tell him that i don’t understand. He gets mad at me even more calling me a smartass. 

I continue to tell him (this whole time not raising my voice and staying calm) that i don’t know what is going on and tell him to please tell me what i did wrong because i don’t know. He continues with that for a while then says that i’m “fucking screwed” and that he will “ruin my fucking life”. Then he tells me he doesn’t care that i just got my license because i can’t drive anywhere anymore. He says he will drive me to school every day and he doesn’t care, but one of the reasons i got my license was because he hated taking me to school and would always complain about how he wants me to drive already. I am utterly confused and i just say ok then he leaves while cussing me out. 

My mother asks what’s wrong and my dad tells her to ask me what i did. She comes in my room and i completely break down saying that i don’t know what i did wrong and i don’t understand anything that’s happening. She says she will talk to him and i overhear her saying she doesn’t understand the problem. I hear him start going off but i couldn’t hear anything he was saying.  He proceeds to yell at me as he goes downstairs and i start to feel as if i’ve done something wrong but i don’t know what it is. He makes me feel like dying sometimes

I haven’t talked to him today but i want to keep asking him what i did wrong. i thought he was just like that because he was drunk but he still seems mad today and i completely don’t know why and i just want it to end. Thank you for staying with me and i hope you can offer some advice.",20Oct2019,4

You need to get a ball in the hoop 10 times in order to get a 100% (you only get 10 tries). Each ball in the hoop is worth 10 points.

This means that if you miss 4 times, you get a 60%. A SIXTY. That’s it. You failed. 

If you make it in the hoop four times, you get a 40%.

Do you see the big issue at hand?!!??!!!

I get straight As in my academic classes but unfortunately sports were not one of my given gifts. I’ve always been terrible at sports but now I seriously concerned. If I get anything below an 80% on this “test” my average is gonna drop like the stock market in 2008.

Backstory 
About 6 months ago my mom met some new friends but became close to one women In particular due to similar music taste and job. This women is gay and divorcing her husband (I have no issues with this as I am also gay)They hang about ever so often and sometimes I’d hang with them w/ my partner, it was great seeing my mom have a close friend. I don’t live at home anymore but recently my mom has been very secretive with her phone and her whereabouts, she seems more and more glued to her phone and also has pass codes on phone and what’s app which she changed a few months back. 

Now my proof I opened her phone to change a song on the playlist (my finger print is saved from a year or two back) and her messages opened right away from this women, all previous messages were deleted but the first one said “Morning my beautiful wonderful girlfriend” followed by some more generic messages, my heart dropped I double checked I read it right and clicked off the messages, she never seen me on her phone and has no idea I know. My parents don’t have never had the “perfect” relationship but cheating has never been an issue. My dad isn’t the best husband but definitely doesn’t deserve to be cheated on I don’t understand why she didn’t leave him. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel like I don’t have enough proof to confront her should I dig more?  Should I tell her to end it with her gf or my dad? Tell my dad right away? I know it’s going to cause a huge fight with all my family (my dads side will probably cut her off) and my dad will never speak to her again.

585,"I don't do very much with my life outside of school, but I am deeply invested in the few things I do.

Football has always held a special place in my life. For almost 3 years now, I have undergone rigorous training as a lineman, eventually gaining enough prestige to be considered the varsity team. With confidence, I can say that I am a capable athlete who can easily kick ass in a game. 

...There's just one problem: Training is the only thing I ever get to do.

Every time I go to practice, I always put in my best effort. When we practice O-Line, nobody can get a foot past me. When we practice D-Line, I always sack the QB.

Yet whenever game day comes around, its as though the coaches think i'm nonexistent. All I get to do is eagerly watch every game from the sidelines hoping the coaches will put me in. But they never do. Not for a minute, not even for a second.

All of the other players considered to be a part of the varsity team play a significant portion of each game. When the game finishes, many ask me, ""Did coach put you in?""

I plaster a smile on my face and always say, ""No, but its alright, my time will come soon.""

Sometimes I get a response like, ""Damn, but you really should play. You're way better than the other kids coach has been putting up""

And that's the thing, whenever we are up by a large amount in a game, my coach plays new kids who have only just joined over me. I know that I am stronger than them. When we measure our strength in the weight room, I easily rank near the top. Whenever we practice, I outperform them.

Every day I get benched, it really hurts me. I think I have an overall good relationship with my coach, as I occasionally talk to him about work and such. I have never done anything to anger him. I've never asked my coach to play me, out of fear that it could make him even less likely to play me, but at this point, should I?",20Oct2019,1
586,"I will start by saying, this may take a while to get to the point, I feel a backstory as to why I've joined and why posting such a personal, but fairly odd situation I am now in, is needed to understand the situation... 

Okay, you've read this far, so I'll start:

Firstly. 
The year is 2007. England. I'm a college student. A girl called ""Megan"" is a college student too.

Throughout the 2 years we met up only at college. Her personality and style is total opposite to myself (imagine, dare I say this, a 'chav' girl and an 'emo' guy). She helped me keep 'sane' when I had issues with bullying &amp; torment - and always listened and helped when she could. 
After the college course - we further kept contact via Facebook but very, very rarely spoke or interacted with each other at all throughout the years. (different life, friends, social settings etc) 

Fast forward 10(ish) years. Year now 2017.

While out having a meal at my local pizza restaurant, turns out she works there (hardly changed appearance since I last saw her).
This was around 40 miles away from where we grew up before back in 2008. So both now live locally it would seem.

I arrive home and immediately message over Facebook (last message was like 2016 saying happy birthday, and around the same time each year before) and ask if it was her.
Turns out. It was.

She didn't want to come over and say hi at the resturant due to not wanting to interfere in an odd setting so that was that.

Spoke a few times after, nothing exciting, basic hi, how are you, how's your kid (turns out he left her etc etc) and that has been it.

Now the year is 2018.
She's been posting on Facebook almost daily at this point, that I'm noticing becuase of the style of posts (heart-break, emotional, not wanting to live anymore etc) and me being me, asked what's up.

She PMd over messanger saying everything that happened since we last met in college, fell for a guy, he done drugs, got her into it, lost her first kid because of it (social services), then left him, she been clean 7 years now, met new guy, he was no better etc - but she was able to keep this child as she's better than before with no drug use and so on.

She's got a decent job (bringing a 5 day a week min wage job even with a child. So good on her to be honest).

She had issue with a manager being inappropriate (and due to her being previously raped etc) she panicked and quit. Got a new job shortly after, but it's only 3 days a week. At best.

Now, she's been asking for £5-10 here and there for electricity, milk bread teabags etc.
I was thinking it seems odd, but admittedly she was paying back when said (end of month 28th).

So, no problem.

After this, asked again, and again, now we are up to about £80 and i asked how she is this bad in debt etc and if there's any underlying issue as to why (bills too high, travel costs, childcare etc) but turns out, child's father is not paying for child support.

She rang me today (first ever time hearing her voice since) crying that she's minus -£10 in electric, has been eating and longing out the same food and meals (so sausage &amp; mash for lunch and dinner) and is not eating alot herself, and making sure her child is full before she is, and that she has no money untill end of month when she gets paid, but it's only about 8 too 10 days worth of actual wages (due to lack of work she's been scheduled) and has rent, bills, food etc and won't be able to meet these needs, which pulled my heart strings, alot. 

Me being me, Mr Make Everyone Happy, I've just gone and brought £168 worth of 'basic' (non branded) shopping, like pasta, vegetables, cereal, fruit and so on. Also, paid to clear her debt - over the phone (with her prepaid electricity meter details) her minus -£10, and put a further £40 on so she has electricity for a month? or so.

I know in my heart I won't see the 168 shopping, the 80 amount this month and the 50 electricity, but here's the best part, I was terminated 20 days ago and have not a full time job myself (average 3/4 days a week..one of the joys of agency work).

Now for the point of this post. The advice part.

I won't be able to do this forever or even next month, but knowing what stuff she's been through, what's happening now and how she's come so far from where she was with her ex, I feel I need to help, seeing as she helped me so long ago back in college.

I guess what I'm asking is. 
How do I say.. I can't help forever.. but without the heartache with myself knowing she could/will be in trouble with food rent and possibly being homeless with a child etc if I didn't help at all (also she has little to no family as out of care an doesn't know parents etc)

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any questions please do ask, or to clarify anything I have missed, or not made sense on.

588,"I am 14 years old, (boy) brazilian (I speak portuguese so sorry for any grammar/spelling english mistakes) but other people (teachers, adults, even other students) say I look older and act older. Everybody considers me a smart person - even though I just study and pay attention in class -, an intellectual/cultured person - even though I don't read very complex books or articles. I don't like science/biology and I am more into writing stories, critics, and I admit that I am very good at writing. 
I play Bass and Piano, and usually listen to 70's/80's Funk, Jazz, Fusion, Pop and synthwave.
I have a 5 year old brother and I take care of him.
My parents live in different houses but I talk to both of them very often, spending more time in my mother's house.
My parents are not strict, they let me do whatever I want as long as I don't break the law or anything and do my responsabilities (I get the highest grades in school anyway because I understand the purpose of their way of parenting).
But there are some things that are ruining me in the inside:
-I have only two real friends that actually understand me, others are just other students I pretend to be friends with.
-My mother complains that I never want to go to friends parties, hang out with other people (even though I think my personality/acting makes most people avoid inviting me to parties and stuff) and I don't want to because I always want to leave since nobody listens to what I like to hear, reads what I like to read, talks about what I like to talk and I end up just feeling lonely there.
-What I like to watch, differently from what my friends like, is usually about 80's crime/cops/other movies and tv shows that none of my 'friends' know about.
-I feel like I don't belong where I am, everything is starting to feel useless, I can't find the motivation to do anything. Everything I do is just a temporary distraction to a feeling of sadness. But its not exactly sadness, its like I will never find someone to love, something to live for and I end up getting obsessed with characters from tv shows and other depressing stuff. 
And i dont know if all of this is just hormones and teenage/puberty acting up or do I have something serious like a disease or condition or something. 
I hesitated a lot writing this because I always felt like I didnt need therapy, or self help but I never feel better after admitting all of this. Its not like I will burst into tears, because I cant cry. I try but I am simply unable to cry, it just gets stocked and it onky gets out in some acts of anger i cant control. Like in school, some student keeps annoying me or touches me (even in a playful childish but innocent way) I get very angry for no reason and hit them very hard, and become agressive but i never make a scandal. People who saw me or were the reason for these anger attacks never say a word to anybody because they fear me, and I regret acting like that later.
Well, to sum everything up, I need help because I dont want to wait 10 years for people around me to get to the same mental level as me (seriously I feel like a 30 year old in a 5th grade class everyday in school) or even to find somebody so I can fall in love, I never had this love feeling and I really want to know what is it like...

589,"This might be a bit long so I apologise in advance. 

I’m not too sure how to explain this without rambling so I am just going to put it into dot points if that’s okay

• My (F19) friend (F18) started talking to a guy (M30) on reddit around November last year (when she was 17)

• She hasn’t made a lot of friends at uni this year (first year) and the one friend she has seemed to make doesn’t seem to be a good influence and they basically just smoke weed together 

• About half way through this year she lied and told her parents she was going to Japan (potentially with another friend who also went to Japan) when in actually she went to India and Thailand on an expenses paid one month holiday with this guy (he paid) 

• They slept together and whilst in India he took her out for dinner and she met his friends and brother 

• She is back home and he is on another holiday and said he “can’t promise he won’t cheat”. She believes he is joking and won’t cheat 

• She was kicked out of her mums house and now lives with her dad 

• She is still in contact with him and laughs it off when she was warned by our other friend 

I am super super worried about my friend but don’t know what I can do to help. She doesn’t know I know (I heard earlier this year when she went overseas but now I’m overseas and can’t talk to her in person) and I’ve been given new info by another friend and we’re the only two who know. 

Since she has reddit, if you see this please don’t get mad I just want to make sure you’re safe and so does our other friend! You’re a great person and deserve someone to treat you well, not take advantage like I’m worried this guy is doing",20Oct2019,1

592,"So this is weird to talk about but I don't know what else to do. My younger sister has an issue with itchy armpits. We'll all sit down as a family and she'll raise her arm, out her hand under her shirt and just sit there scratching her armpits for minutes on end, repeating the cycle every 20 minutes or so. She's explained that this is because when she sweats a lot, her arpits get itchy, and perhaps due to allergies of some metals in deodorant. I know the feeling, as I myself have to use aluminum free deodorants. 

She's tried aluminum free deodorants and the sensitive kinds, but says they don't work well and stain her clothes so she continues to use regular kinds and 'deals with' the itchy pits. 

The thing is, it just is really uncomfortable when we have friends over or even if it's just us and she just lifts her arm to scratch her armpit for a couple of minutes again and again. I don't think she realizes that the habit is socially uncomfortable and friends look at it a little grossed out. I personally am a little grossed out because she's explained that it's worse when she's sweatier, but then scratches and proceeds to touch the remote and her phone, utinsels etc. 

I wouldn't say I'm necessarily a germaphobe but armpits hold a lot of bacteria and body odor sweat that I think should warrant a quick hand wash after. I understand that itchy armpits is something we all have on occasion but to me, it seem like more of a 'private time' sort of care, than something to be done for period of time around people. 

The problem is this, when I try to kindly bring it up, she gets immediately angry at me and says it's just something she has. I don't want to hurt her feelings or embarass her so when I bring it up, I try to mention it like 'Oh hey, I heard cortisone cream can help with itching', or 'I've tried this awesome new deodorant that's made for sensitive skin' or 'Maybe a cool washcloth would be soothing'. I want to help her and find a way to solve the problem, not just the scratching habit. 

When I bring this up, she gets upset with me or blows it off. I did some research about it, including potential medical causes and think she should see a doctor to look into some things, but I also saw that every recommendation said to stop scratching as it is inflaming the skin more, causing more irritants to get into the skin and making it even itchier. 

When I tried explaining this to her, she again got angry and just said she 'couldn't help it', and I understand habits are hard to break but it seems a little ridiculous that she can't break the habit of scratching her armpits for minutes at a time. 

I bought her some steroid cream to help, but I know as long as she's scratching, the worse it's getting. She seems ok to just be living with the itch as long as she can just go on the scratching binges but it's uncomfortable for me sitting on the couch next to her and other people in the room. I think it would just require a bit of self control or, more effort to determine the cause and use the proper treatment.

I feel as an older sibling, I can help with some social things, and I don't know how to tell her that her lifting her arms above her head to scratch her armpits for minutes on end is not appropriate to do when we're all watching a movie. I don't want to hurt her feelings but I also want to spare her from doing a habit that maybe she doesn't realize is as weird as it is.

Also, frankly I'm grossed out. Scratching sweaty armpits leaves a lot of bacteria under the nails and on the hand that she then uses to touch my remote or blankets or dog. Again, I know it's a sensitive subject, and I don't want to tell her it's a gross habit but I'm at my wit's end. 

There is no change in behavior, effort to heal, and dismissal like 'I can't help it', when I think it's more in control than she may think. She won't acknowledge that the scratching makes it worse which is frustrating because it creates an endless cycle. 

My question is this, how else can I bring this up in a gentle and kind way, strong enough to communicate it's honestly kind of gross but without hurting her feelings? 

How to I communicate that this isn't just me being nitpicky but an actually weird and unhygenic habit that I think she needs to take more seriously and put more effort into stopping?

Or, am I just totally out of line?",20Oct2019,1

598,"M18, I think this part of my life is essential to understand my issue, so there we go: As a 16yo I had traumatic friendship with my classmate. It was my only friend, and occasionally, I fell in love in her. We were a copule for some time, but I screwed up and she abandoned me. I felt empty for almost a year. It made me really insecure and now I'm carefully thinking about every single action I take. I promised myself not to ever make a move on anyone unless someone makes a move first. Not so long after getting a grip of myself, I met another person, she lives several dozens kilometres away. While playing games online, she joked about a weeding of us. Remembering my past, I let it slide, but she repeated. Occasionally, I agreed, and we decided to 'get married' (not officially ofc) on our soonest meeting. It happened, and I became somehow attached to her. It's like loving her without being in love in her. With some time, our relationship weakened (we're still 'married', but we don't act like it). It was okay with me since I didn't have crush on her, and we were still having fun together. After some time, she graduated school and she got a crush on someone from her class. I know because she told me about it.

As you may guessed already, my issue here is jealousy. I'm jealous of her life, or maybe of her. Unlike me, she lives in a clean and comfortable house, she has friends irl, she has a crush on someone, she's an important part of few 'friendly gangs', she's pretty, she has dreams, there are people who have crush on her... And I'm a loser and a loner. Spending most of my time home because my environment is into alcohol and parties while I'm a calm introvert. Jealousy is ripping my insides out. I am constantly thinking about a situation where I can sacrifice myself for someone else just so I can die without making others regret they couldn't help me in such state (its ok, not going to kms). I don't have depression, I have hopes for my future, but it's just hard. I don't know what should I do with my life. I don't know what I want to do. I just want to be happy.

By the way, I'm pretty good at sincere talking. I didn't tell her about it yet just because I don't even know what's my point here.

605,"This is a throw away account, however it is also my first post on reddit ever, please forgive me for any errors. 

I am a 21 year old female, soon to be 22. I work minimum wage and have no idea what direction I am expected to take in life and am filled with fear, dread, and anxiety about all of it. I am facing immense pressure from my father who is expecting me to know what I want by the end of this year. 

About 8 months ago I was living on my own with my boyfriend, paying rent, working, living happily. My father offered us to move in with him rent free in order to save for a home, as we were paying enough rent that it was equivalent to a mortgage and then some. My boyfriend and I took the offer and have since been with him. Except we shortly after fell into a financial hole after a medical emergency and were grateful to be rent free and could keep up with these unexpected issues. It wiped out my savings, his savings, and most of our checks for weeks to come but my boyfriend and I made it out healthy and alright, we had zero assistance from my father in all of this. 

Now in the last two months my father has been pressuring me to attend University or College and start a career. He has also pressured me into purchasing a vehicle saying I should not be bussing around. However I work minimum wage full time and the addition of a vehicle would be absolutely stupid as I could barely afford a monthly payment on a car loan, I would be unable to insure it and would be living way beyond my means. My fathers solution to this was try to force me into a career. I have attended a trade school once prior and found it was not something I could do long term (cosmetology) as it made the same as my current job does. I then attended one year of university for teaching, again due to familial pressure, and once I was enrolled the same people who pushed me into it, all told me what a huge mistake I was making. Scared, I did not re-enroll, as I wasn't even sure myself if I wanted to do this as a career. 

However now my father is again pressuring me to re-enroll and stick to it. But I'm terrified. He does not support me in anything I do, and my passions (art) do not align with any sort of career that would make any sort of decent living wage. I also feel the need to clarify that my father wanting me to stick to school is not supporting me. He does not encourage me otherwise, his only concern is that I not become a failure, and constantly holds over my head that my older brother (29) was able to start a career in HVAC by 22 and I have done nothing even remotely notable yet. 

My boyfriend does not have these issues as he's in a career he loves and managed to fall into without schooling, and so he has been able to avoid student loans (although he still has numerous bills to pay for himself) but I envy the fact he had this opportunity when I did not. He however is my biggest supporter and tells me to do what I want and will love, I just don't know what that is.

I am very scared for my future, I know I am still very young with lots of time, but my father is threatening to cut me loose and giving warnings very often and I really have no other family to turn to, it is forcing me to choose quickly and grow up much faster than I am comfortable with. I was much more content working 50 hours a week, saving slowly each month (maybe $100 a month in savings), than I am now living ""free"". It may seem as simple as just moving back out, but I am scared that in doing so I will also be. stuck in a minimum wage job the rest of my life, which I also do not want.

I suppose I rambled a little and I am sorry. I guess the advice I could use is how do you figure out what you want to do for your whole life when you have so little experience to begin with? And how do I deal with this constant pressure? It has put me in a very, very dark place in my life and I am genuinely scared.

606,"I rejected a teacher's advances at university during a private chat. This person is respected and regarded as being a lovely person - I was inclined to agree up until recently. I talked to a colleague of this person but I was dismissed as they are friends. I decided to skip some lessons in favour of independent work and I've been called out on this.

Suddenly I've been referred to counselling and even other students are treating me with kid gloves. It's quite creepy. I'm also expected to come in despite the fact that previously the teachers were quite lax about attendence. This concerns me because I'm quite a private individual.

The issue is slightly complicated because I previously had difficulty with a student respecting boundaries and this is also being used against me. I think my sexuality is going to be being used against me. I like being single but I'm not interested in dating or sex at the moment and in general I'm pretty much asexual and I'm fine with that.

I can pretty much complete my day's worth of work within one hour if I wanted to. I spread it out, so I'm not pretending to work for the next 7 hours of my day.

These past few weeks I have been feeling unfulfilled, depressed, and questioning what I truly am passionate about and what my purpose is in life. I have been talking to my college/ hs coaches, cousins, and friends for advice and one of my coaches told me to work there for another year and save up enough 'f u' money and quit and go backpacking for a few months. I think it is a great idea. I do not see myself here any longer than another year, so why the f not? Do something like this is completely outside of my comfort zone. I always make sure that there is a plan and after I come back from this trip it will be the first time I won't really have a solid plan.

I have presented this to my family and they were kind of mind boggled that I am planning to quit such a good job that pays well to do practically nothing lol. They can't really see where the issue is

It has been years since their last time doing these things, and as long they are in the past, I can live with it, but it has come to my attention, that Frank has been renting an apartment on the side on his nights out. 
Frank and Eva have just moved to the same city as my boyfriend and I, and we live close to each other, but why does Frank ""waste"" his money renting an apartment besides his own?

On a night out with some of my friends, I ended up speaking to some guy, Ian, who attends the same classes as Frank, and this guy was drunk out of his mind. Ian ended up telling me, that the apartment Frank was renting for some weekends was his. Frank was paying for his friend to stay somewhere else, so he could have his apartment to himself.
I just played the ""blonde card"", and asked why on earth someone would want to do that. Ian just looked me dead in the eye and said: ""You know..."" then he made a sort of humping-move, which suggested, that Frank was renting Ians apartment to hook up with someone else.

I go to the gym with Eva, and we are close friends - at least close enough to talk about our sexlives. She told me, that lately Frank hasn't been in the mood to have sex with her. She also texts me when she is home alone on weekends, which I find to be quite often.

My dilemma is, that I know in my heart what is right, but I have no idea if Frank is actually doing something bad, even though his actions seem really fishy. Eva has always been mildly taunting me with my boyfriend's previous drugaddiction, but she has no idea what Frank has been doing, and what he is up to now.
I asked my boyfriend about the situation, and he told me that he knew about the apartment.

I feel like a brat who can't do her own homework, but I also feel like a ghost in my own house. As I said I've been grateful to my dad for years just for the food and the roof over my head, but I'm so sick of feeling like he doesn't want me... which actually he once told me he only agreed to have me as a compromise when my mom wanted kids.

I know I'm stupid for not being able to get everything at school, but I've suffered from anxiety, depression, and possibly something else for at least six years, I don't want professional help, as I've tried it, and the best ""help"" you can get where I live are therapists who judge your problems, and tell you that if you eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise, you have no reason to be upset.

625," So  I am currently taking 4 major classes in my last semester but one of  the classes is really hard to the point that I am not understanding  anything. I asked my classmates how they were doing and most of them are  confused about the material as well. I have been trying to read from  the book but the things that the professor teaches in class is really  different and more complex than the book. I also tried studying from  online sources but what they show are simplified version of the  equations that I am learning in class. My friend is taking the same  course with another professor and he did not even understand what we were learning.

How should I tell  my parents that I want to drop this class? I feel really bad doing this since I am an international  student and I am not legally allowed to work in the country so my parents  are paying my studies as well as my living expenses.",20Oct2019,2

627,"I left my ex at the end of August (2019). We were together for 3.5 months. During our relationship I found out him and his best friend had previously engaged in foreplay (before we were together) and she had cheated on her boyfriend with him. I’m a very jealous person and I explained this before we even got together, I wasn’t happy for the friendship to continue. He then decided to not talk to the 3 other girls in that group as well. Throughout our relationship he would lie to me about smoking cigarettes and messaging these girls. His room mate also hated me and would post tweets about me while we were together. When I left him he threatened to kill himself, once I made sure he was okay I blocked him on everything. Then he started messaging my friends. He then texted me saying that he was going to tell people things about me that would ‘make my life miserable’ if I didn’t talk to him. I explained I would keep him unlocked on text if he needed me but I wouldn’t keep him on social media because I knew he was posting things about me there. He agreed. I went to a party and he found out me and an ex were messaging which cause him to lose his head, he threatened me, told me I was awful person and that everyone at university hates me and knows that i’m a toxic, manipulative, jealous person. I went home and that was that. That was around 2 weeks ago. 
He messaged me on Instagram yesterday (which I though I had blocked him but I must’ve just removed him from being able to see my posts) acting as if nothing had happened. He apologised and said he didn’t mean what he said (this had happened about 3 times now) I told him I don’t want to contact me at all anymore. He hasn’t since. 
This morning I woke up to 3 friends sending me the same screenshot. At my uni there’s parody facebook page where you can submit anonymous things. Someone had posted that I made sure he didn’t talk to his girl friends, while I was allowed to speak to 7 boys (this is untrue I had 4 boy friends and every time I spoke to them via discord, he was there), and that I was again manipulative and toxic. People were tagging me in it, calling me a whore, saying he deserved better etc etc. I messaged the page and it’s been taken down, but i’m terrified. What am I suppose to do. I can’t even go to uni or the library now without someone escorting me incase someone spits or insults me.

Now, I'm in poverty. Like, ""more than 300% underneath the poverty level"" poverty.

636,"I feel like I need to go to therapy. I have been dealing with a bunch of this stuff since last November. I have talked to my parents AND my doctor about it. My doctor says I should see a therapist but my mom and dad say “oh you don’t need it. You are fine.” Let me explain what I am afraid of. I’m dealing with what you would call intrusive thoughts. I’m F13 and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t understand myself or my feelings, and I’m petrified of being a bad person or getting older. Everything just seems so scary, and I feel like I might grow up to be a horrible person. I understand that all these thoughts could be originating from both puberty and some events that happened last year. (A shooting in my home town, fires almost burning my home, friend passing away, eating disorder). I’m just so scared that I don’t have control over myself, and that I might do something to hurt someone or myself. Like hurting my dog. I hit her a few times before when she was being mean to my other dog, but not hard. Another time I was playing with her and I got too rough. I just feel terrible about everything, and I don’t understand anything. I don’t understand if I WANT to hurt the dogs or not. Obviously I’m against it, but I just don’t know anymore. I’m just questioning everything, and my parents are getting tired of hearing it. I also question my sexuality a lot, because I am attracted to dudes. But when I say ‘I’m straight’ it doesn’t feel right. My parents don’t like when I say that. They aren’t very supportive, and just want me to be straight. They say they would be fine if I was but I feel like they are lying. Back to the Intrustive thoughts, when I get into these moods where I freak out and have a panic attack, I can’t think straight and things just become more jumbled up. When I finally calm down, I sort of understand it a little bit better and I feel like I get it, only to be thrown right back where I started. I can’t help but feel like I am a bad person, and I just don’t know what is going on. Got any advice?

643,"I’m 17 years old, just about a 1/3 of the way through my senior year. I go to a trade school, busting my butt to get my Fire Fighting and EMT certifications, already have a dispatching certification from Criminal Justice my junior year. I’m a 3 time honor roll student, my teachers love me, and not one of my classes are below an A. I have a job, getting paid 9.50 an hour, and plan on going into the work force right after I graduate.

Good record, right? Apparently not. I am constantly reminded by my 48 yr. old dad and 18 yr. old sister that despite everything I’m working towards, it’s not good enough. My dad constantly compares me to my sister. I get a good check? Oh, she made more. I’m on honor roll? Well, she graduated with honors, so it’s not that special.

Just today, I told him I had a really good check, and at first he was like,” Oh, cool, good for you.” Then my sister comes home, said she made 200+ in tips alone yesterday, then they both go on for 15 minutes about how she can make more in one day than I do in two weeks! 

It’s not even just money, they say they work harder than me too, which is shitty just in general. We all work really hard, and just because they had a worse day than I did, or are stressed out with their job, doesn’t mean I’m not working equally as hard. I go to school for 7 hours, 3 1/2 of which is bundled up in fire gear working on live burns, car fires, or just general fitness; then, I come home, power through my homework, then go to work until 9 p. I’ll come home, entirely sore and miserable, and when I tell my dad I had a stressful day he goes on this exact spiel:

“ You know, I wake up at 5 o’clock every day and bust my ass until 4 p. All week. You don’t have it that bad!”

I can’t even be stressed out without them thinking they’re better than me!

I just don’t know what to do, and I can’t take constantly being reminded that I’m not good enough. It’s so hard to actually succeed and have motivation to do things when they always tell me it isn’t good enough.

I would like to somehow offer my support for her, but I don’t know how since we haven’t talked in years and I don’t want to come off as pushy.

There are some people that I know that don't Do anything wrong, and are in actuality very nice.

Some i do hang out with because we have common interests, but I am very uncomfortable when they make the relationship to be more than it is

To me we hang out to do X because we both enjoy X and not a lot of others do. I don't like receiving big hugs, i dpnt mind listening to your probpems but I have no inclination to share mine, and I dont really want us to go on any big trips. I enjoy having a stable distance where we are not integral to one another.

One of them got into working out and asks me lots of advice since I've veen exercising for a long time, which i am happy to give, but they eant ro share progression pics of each other to ""keep them motivated"" and I just find it very, odd.

This one isn't a stranger, we've known each other for roughly 6 years, but they consider our relationship far more interpersonal than I would like. 

I have been told this makes me rude because I'm not willing to be more open, but it feels like people are taking their own needs to be open over my needs to be more withdrawn.

I recently got close to my friend (we can call her J) , and it's been awesome for the most part. But a couple months ago, she invited me, her boyfriend, and a mutual friend over for a get together before springing a 'surprise intervention' on us. It didn't go well, and all parties felt attacked and unsafe. She sprung all these issues on us including communication issues that she feels are happening. She didn't see that what she did was hurtful, and acted like it was us that were having a problem with a normal thing. 

We got over this, but I still feel weird about it. Well, recently, I was at work when she asked me to go check on her place because her boyfriend was out of town (she was mad that he didn't tell her but she also has a habit of asking very last minute for things so how was he supposed to know?). Either way, I said yes, and was answering with shorter answers because I was at work and it was getting busy (I work fast food). She then accused me of being mad at her and leading her on when I didn't want to be around her. I told her this wasn't true and that I was at work so I couldn't type out long winded responses. She said that I should have said something then and that by not saying anything, I was being bad at communication and I wasn't supporting her when she needed people. 

I also explained that since I am a college freshman, I have been focusing on school. My roommate also just lost someone close to her, so I wanted to make sure she was okay. I again was accused of not messaging her to tell her I was busy (I very honestly was, but I also responded anytime she messages me so idk where she is coming from) and tell her I couldn't respond often, despite the fact that I could. I'm an 18 year old, and I usually just respond in short quick ways.

But he was so kind and adorable and he said I was pretty and picked a flower for me. It was so cute. Moving forward, it was bedtime for james but he said that he always slept in the same bed as his mum or older sister because he has a lot of nightmares so I told him that he could sleep in his mums bed with me. We got tucked in and once he fell asleep I got ready and I drifted off as well. I didnt know how much time passed but I slowly was waking up and was struggling to get back to sleep. I was really uncomfortable and I thought the bed was really scratchy and bumpy and it was like needles scratching my back. I kept rolling back and forth but the scratching wasn't stopping but it did keep getting slowly weaker and lighter so I decided to relax again and finally let my full weight onto the bed and after that I heard a muffled cry of pain which made me wake up again (Side note I was super tired and barley conscious). I was wondering what the noise was but I ignored it and decided to go back to sleep because I was super tired and could barley feel the scratching anymore. I woke up in the morning stretched and sat up.

666,"Hey Reddit, 

not sure if I should post this here or if it is the wrong place, but I just need some advice from people on the internet.

I am pretty sure for most of you this sounds pretty trivial, but here is my story.

So, my parents divorced when I was around 7 years old and it was hard, but I saw both of them every day, because my mom moved to a flat that was near where my father and I lived. 

I went to my mom's place after school and in the evenings I was at my father's.

After a few years my father met his new girlfriend and everything went downhill from there.

After a few months they wanted to move in together and then I made the dumbest decision of my life.  

I was asked at court whether I wanted to live with my mom or my father and why. 

I answered that I wanted to live with my father, because we would go on vacation and do family trips a lot. I mean, I was around 8 years old, but still there are days where I hate myself so much for that especially when I think about how hurt my mom was when she was told why I wanted to move to my father. Also, I told her that I loved her equally as the new GF of my father, which was one of the dumbest things I ever said. I don't need to say that my mom was extremely hurt, but of course she never stopped loving me. She always supported me even though I hurt her so much. 

After a few more years I moved in with my mom, because my father's GF was a toxic and manipulative bitch and he was afraid he wouldn't get another woman and took her side every time. 

This was the best decision I made so far and I really appreciate the time I've spent with my mom since that day and try to let her know that I love her very much.

And now my problem: Everytime I think about those things I get extremely sad, feel remorseful and I feel so guilty for hurting my mom like that.

I don't know how to handle it and I also don't know how to tell her just how sorry I am. 

Please excuse me complaining about a trivial matter like this, especially when there are people out there who have worse problems than I've ever had, but I just had the feeling that I have to do something about this whole situation.

Thank you for any advice in advance.",20Oct2019,2
667,"I have been dating my current boyfriend for 4 months. Before this, we'd been friends for 2 years. He knows about my history of disordered eating, anxiety, depression and has been extremely supportive.

I was first assaulted 3 years ago by a guy I was seeing. And then again year and a half ago, my ex boyfriend assaulted me on multiple occasions while I was unconcious. I woke up completely naked with no recollection of the night before. He knew I was unconcious. I didn't break up with him immediately- I didn't think it was a big deal until I told a close friend about it. 

This ex-boyfriend is still friends with people in our group so I saw him last night. I am having severe anxiety today thinking about what he did to me a while ago. 

Current boyfriend knows that seeing him makes me upset but doesn't know why. I want to tell him, but I haven't mentioned it before so I'm scared he will think I'm making it up.

668,"Hello,

So I lied to my parents about passing in the next year of college , because I was afraid of their reaction, and I cannot bring myself to tell them now since they'll react badly.

The thing is now my mom need a school certificate for her work, and she'll notice when I'll give it to her that I lied.

I can only see two outcomes out of this : I tell them, they explode and my relationship with them become awful ( that would be difficult to support since I already have severe anxiety, and suicidal thoughts although I won't kill myself ) or I insist on leaving the house (which would be difficult since they don't want me to).

The problem with leaving the house is that I'm a jobless student (though that might change soon) and only have 5k€ in savings, so I'd need a ""guarantor"" (someone who is willing to pay rent in case I can't) and my parents are the only persons that can.

I'm in France.

682,"I recently moved from a rural area into a city suburb. Everything is all hunky-dorey, except I am not sure what to do about my drug addict neighbors. Pretty sure that their house is a drug den of some sort due to the unusual amount of people that and cars going through there at night. 

I would talk to them about these issues, and their house would cease all strange activity for about a week, and then it would start back up again. But lately they started ignoring me or answering their door entirely.

One of the druggos drives a big white pickup truck.  This truck has never been liscensed, the windows are broken, and it was crudely spray painted. I have seen the truck move, but it has been parked outside of our house for a month or two and hasn't moved since. I know he's into hard drugs because he told me.

The dude who owns the truck starting trash bags of dead branches by his truck. It looked like he was going throw them in the back of his truck and take them to the dump, but instead he left them sitting on the sidewalk directly in front of our house. After a week, I got sick of them and threw them through them in their yard as they would not answer the door when I tried to talk to them about it. They sat there for about two more weeks before disappearing.

This truck has become a beacon for sketch people. One morning, around 3:30, we head someone pounding on the door. I looked out the window, and there were two guys, one dude at my door, and the other dude across the street specking out my house. I waited for the dude at the front door to start walking away before I went out there to yell at them and find out what the hell they wanted. Turns out the sketchos had the wrong house were looking my neighbors. They left down the street. Half an hour later, they were back peaking through the non-windows of the white truck. Spoke to the drug neighbors about it, and they expressed concern that someone was looking in the truck. I asked them to move the truck. That night they moved it 3ft or so, the truck is still directly out front of my house.

As time progressed the owner started putting more trash in the truck. Things like a broken wheel chair, an old mattress, 2 halves of a box spring(?), an old whiteboard, and more random shit. The truck was overflowing with trash until this morning. It was extremely windy, and all the garbage blew out of it. The old mattress had landed on our front lawn the box springs were blocking traffic in the middle of street. I wrung their doorbell and pounded on the door to try to talk to them, but there was no answer. I know that they are home. I ended up kicking their gross mattress under their truck to get it off my lawn, and throwing the broken box spring pieces onto their yard. 

What should I do here? I don't know if I should report the truck, because they would know it was me. I am afraid to piss them off to much because they are super sketchy, and I don't know how they would react. I also have a wife who is home all the time while I'm at work, and I don't want to put her into a bad situation.  I am also tired of being civil.

Also, I don't know who to report the truck to. If I do report it, it will be ticketed or towed because there is a fire hydrant right outside my house where the truck is parked. If the truck get's towed, a whole bunch of that garbage will fall out.

TL;DR: Druggo neighbor parks truck full of garbage outside my house. Not sure what to do cause he is sketch, and he would know it was me if I reported his vehicle.",20Oct2019,1

I managed to get really friendly with one of them and ever since then continued to text and talk to them on a near regular basis. Despite the distance, and not having seen them in person for years, I always felt a really special friendship and a close bond with them. We both felt that we could talk to each other about anything.

During the end of this Summer, (I'm now 18 btw), I was awaiting my final exam results and university acceptances. As a result I was extremely stressed and would easily find myself getting angry over the smallest of things. This extended to our friendship and about a week before my exam results came out I just lost it with her, over something tiny and said that I didn't wish to speak to her anymore. 

I've regretted everything since then and I miss everything. I really want to start to talk to her again but I just don't know how, or even if I can, since I'll have to do it over text or call since I can't exactly just show up in Germany with no prior notice.

694,"tl;dr my friend and bf are in a never ending feud. What do I do?   
Last February, I went on a group trip with five people including a close female friend and my boyfriend of 6 years. This friend is a very sarcastic person and at times can come off as mean rather than playful. At many points during the trip, the friend poked fun at my boyfriend or just rude to him and this resulted in my boyfriend and having several emotional outbursts (he got angry but was never violent). When he tried to apologize to the friend for his outburst and discuss what she did that aggravated him, she refused to talk about it stating that she was already ""taking care of his emotions."" He later sent her an email outlining why he was still upset and asking to talk. The friend (who btw is a therapist) said she wanted him to just respond by email and then she would decide if it was ""worth the emotional labor to respond.""

After the trip, I was stuck in the middle of this feud.  I told my bf that his angry outbursts were unwelcome and alarming and he needs to figure out what is at the root of his reaction so it doesn't happen again. He recognized that and admired his roll in the arguments in an email to the friend. Shortly after he started therapy and is working to identify and deal with his triggers.

The friend on the other hand (the therapist) has admitted no wrongdoing. I tried to tell her that her sarcasm comes off as mean and her reaction to that was to say ""I'm done changing my behavior for men"" and ""I'm tired of people not believing me when I tell them my intentions."" Only in the last month is she starting to realize that maybe she comes off a little rough but she still believes/acts like my boyfriend is emotionally immature.

This is difficult for me on many levels: 

1. My bf rarely sees any of my friends because she is often present and he wants to avoid her. This makes parties really awkward because someone is always uninvited.
2. I have to listen to my bf rehash this over and over again. And while I understand that healing takes time, it can be hard to hear.
3. My friend the therapist thinks she is right in this scenario and pretty much all interpersonal conflicts because she's a therapists. She does not take feedback well at all and as a result I feel like I can't be honest with her. 
4. My other friends are hearing my friends side of the story and not my bfs or mine, and as a result I worry they think less of him. 

What the hell do I do here? Any advice appreciated.",20Oct2019,2

So I am a female, i have always been really outstanding at school my entire life and i got a scholarship to come to the US to study at an honors college (i do realize how lucky I am) but now I am about to finish my college education (I studied economics) and everyone around me is telling me to go to PHD in economics or do this or that in academia or I won't make it in life but I have NEVER wanted this. when i got into college i did not know what i liked, so i went with economics because it felt the closest to a major I can tolerate and allow me to have a wide window of opportunities when i graduate so i am not restricted. i mentioned i am a female because i can't go back to my home country and simply live peacefully because i come from an extremely dangerous place and one that is extremely conservative where i would also suffocate entirely..

 I do not want to become a professor of economics or even work in academia i think it will kill my soul..people there take themselves way too seriously, everything is way too serious and incredibly suffocating for me in these fields. i've always just wanted to live a simple life near an ocean or the sea and do something that isn't overly complicated and tied to politics or academia or things that are that serious.. i know it is silly but its literally killing me how I feel like i am trapped in life in this path that i feel is going to kill my soul..and it is even killing me that i don't even have a certain passion for something other than music or production or business..things like that. i don't even know where to start with that first and second everyone in my life would be so disappointed in me if i don't become someone extremely 'prestigious or ""respectable"" all these kids constantly around me competing to get into top schools are boring and do not really know that much about anything.. they don't know how to have fun or truly live life and i feel suffocated being in this environment... my crisis is that i don't know what to do and i feel like if i don't get into these fields people tell me about i won't be able to make it on my own and be able to live a peaceful life in a safe place or i will have to go back home...i dont know what to do",20Oct2019,1

707,"Like the title says and sorry this is long.
I am 17, female and don't go out too often as I get anxious but also cause I generally have no business to do so. My area is sketchy af and I don't have real life friends either so I spend most of my time indoors. I don't need a  extra person to go out but would prefer it for both comfort and simply cause it's more fun. I'd love to meet my online friend hence have take the opportunity to do so.
My online friend we shall call ""Milk"", he's 19, male and has autism where he is considered legally disabled. He struggles in social situations and need a family member or friend or even both when going out in public because he can get overwhelmed. However, he'd like to meet me in real life just to hang out as friend.
In January 2020, there is going to Hatsune Miku concert in the Uk. Milk originally planned to go with his dad and friend but I suggested to join him which he was happy with. I asked my sister about it and she bought only me a ticket. So it would be me, Milk, his dad and friend.
Sounds sketchy? Understandable!
My sister suggested for me and Milk to meet up beforehand as a seperate event which I was cool with, just not sure where yet. The problem is my sister keeps suggesting london which is bery far for Milk and he believe his family won't let him go that far especially to meet an online friend. I keep telling my sister to meet half way as it would be fair on the both of us but she isn't having it.
Why?
Milk doesn't have an online appearance as in he doesn't tell or show anyone who he is rl. This is because he generally doesn't see why he needs to and also because he has identity issue due to family. However, I've been in voicecall and seen a pic of Milk's face very recently and everything seemed normal to me. He looks like your standard 19 year old man.
My sister still is suspicious. She has calles him a ""pussy bitch"" for needing his dad to be with him and that he looks ""autistic"" after I showed his photo. I'm, of course, pissed at her for insulting him but never said anything. 
She keeps nagging on about being safe but fails to realise he's very much haress. This is the same woman who has said ""All men are pigs"" in all seriousness (I don't agree with it at all). 
She is now somewhat threatening to tell my mum about me meeting an online friend if we don't meet in reall life.
I don't know what to do, I've been crying about this because it's been stressing me out.

I had a doctor tell me a few months back that I have depression and anxiety which was a shock to me. She told me to call a number on my insurance card about it but they were no help to me.

711,"So I was baby sitting my best friends little brother James (7) for her. I'm a chubby girl around 240- 250 lbs and I'm 27. I have experience with looking after kids since I work in a preschool. Now james was a little introverted and was a mummy's boy so he didn't act like an average 7 year old since he was sheltered a lot and often acted younger than he was. But he was so kind and adorable and he said I was pretty and picked a flower for me. It was so cute. Moving forward, it was bedtime for james but he said that he always slept in the same bed as his mum or older sister because he has a lot of nightmares so I told him that he could sleep in his mums bed with me. We got tucked in and once he fell asleep I got ready and Put my earphones in with music on as it tends to help me sleep and then drifted off as well. I didnt know how much time passed but I slowly was waking up and was struggling to get back to sleep. I was really uncomfortable and I thought the bed was really scratchy and bumpy and it was like needles scratching my back. I kept rolling back and forth but the scratching wasn't stopping but it did keep getting slowly weaker and lighter so I decided to relax again and finally let my full weight onto the bed and after that I thought I heard a muffled cry of pain which made me wake up again (Side note I was super tired and barley conscious). I was wondering what the noise was but I ignored it and decided to go back to sleep because I was super tired and could barley feel the scratching anymore. I woke up in the morning stretched and laid there for a while just listing to my music for about an hour. I could barley sleep last night so was very tired and since the bed didn't feel that scratchy anymore I decided to go back to sleep again and slept for about 3 more hours. I woke up and rolled over to say good morning to James but he wasn't there I got up and looked at the bed and found him with dry blood on his nose, his fingers looked really damaged and he was unconscious but still breathing. I called and ambulance and as we were heading to the hospital I remembered hazy bits of last night and then it suddenly struck me, I had rolled on top of him and he was trying to get me off and i couldn't hear him due to the music. I felt so guilty and the next day and could have really hurt him of kids weren't so resilient. his parents and sister were very angry at me and James looked at me in horror and I was lucky to just get away with that. It's been a week since then and I haven't heard from them since. What do I do? How can I apologise to them? How can I get my friend and the kid to like me again?",20Oct2019,0

713,"
I (25/F) have a friend (\~27/F). I'll call her K. Important thing to know she is gay.

K is going through her most recent heartbreak. It got me thinking about how unhealthy her relationships are. 

A few examples of recent past relationships:

*  She had a crush on a waitress. We went to that restaurant 4 times a week for over a month. She never made a move, just romanticized the  whole thing. The only thing that changed that was when our mutual friend basically set them up. 
* One of her friend's had a friend and wanted to set her up. The friend showed K the person's social media and gave her the person's phone number. K never contacted the person but obsessed over their social media.  The weird part is that she'll create a whole relationship with this person. She talked about meeting their family, pets, friends, etc. without ever contacting her. It ended up with me convincing her to send a message. This was 2 months into her obsessing over this person. Turns out person had just started dating someone else. 
* The most recent: K met someone at a Pride Parade. They live a few hours away from each other. During Pride, one of her friend's convinced K to talk to her. They talked for 4-5 months, only met one other time about 2 months ago. After they met it became obvious that the person wasn't interested. But because she never said she wasn't interested it was drawn out. 
* She's still obsessed over her first love. they dated for about 6 months, almost 2.5 years ago now. They haven't been in contact for the past 2 years. K will still check her instagram through other means since the person has blocked K's account.
* She will be actually offended if someone doesn't message her back on a dating app. No matter the length they've been talking.

The biggest thing that actually gives me concern is the fact that my friend seems to have a chip on her shoulder. She has the ""but I'm a nice guy"" attitude and often says ""no one understands what she's going through"". 

I guess I'm asking for advice of how to handle this sort of situation. Does she have worrying stalker tendencies? How do I navigate through my friends constant heartbreak? I feel like this isn't healthy relationship behavior, how do I address this with her without her being offended/going off the rails?",20Oct2019,1

715,"So, long story short...my mom died in December of last year after a year long episode of stage IV breast cancer.   My parents were married 30 years and my dad lost his wife and best friend. 


Fast forward to yesterday. Dad comes over for dinner and tells me he’s so upset because he lost his wedding band. He had taken it off his ring finger because it was getting to be too small and put it on his pinky to wear home.  Somewhere between dinner with a friend and the next morning he realized it was gone.  


He asked for a nice ring for Christmas, not to wear as a wedding band but to wear as a pinky ring.  I have a half brother who is his step son but otherwise I have no other siblings.  


I want to do something nice, in memory of my mom and their life together. I went to the jewelry store in the mall today just to get some ideas and they suggested an engraved ring.  Obviously I can’t afford to buy him a $1000 ring,  and he wants yellow gold because that’s all he’s ever worn, so my options are slightly limited.  My brother has agreed to go in on it with me for Christmas but I’m not sure what to do.  


I’ve thought about just a simple gold band with their wedding date engraved on the inside...but what a better place to come up with something a little better than the hive mind of reddit?! Anyone have any good suggestions or ideas?",20Oct2019,1
716,"I’m a junior in college studying aerospace engineering. For a little back story, I have always been good at maths and have a great amount of admiration for science. I was never a “good” student and was always told I could do better. Come senior year and I decided I wanted to go for Astrophysics, so I applied as a physics major in college. Despite my “bad” (3.3gpa) grades I got accepted into a really good physics program in a good college which actually had one the noble prize in physics the year before I applied. After first year I realized I could never see myself as a college professor or a researcher in some institute, I needed something that fit my personality best. Something more hands-on and exciting. So I switched to aerospace engineering. I could still enjoy the science and math behind it and would have a fun job. 

As I get older though, I am noticing how extremely fast time is going by. Suddenly I am a junior in college and in two years I will be doing a job that I’ll eventually be doing until I retire. Now, since I was really into physics from about 12 years old, it really granted me a lot of perspective on life, especially humility and the concept of mortality. How everything in the universe comes to an end, especially human life - and very quickly I might add. 

My brother is a Harvard graduate, (yes, really), and my sister is in a very good business school. They both are pursuing the good old fashion professional career, planning to eventually settle down and retire at 60. I however, do not want to waste the only life I have, which is passing by extremely fast, being another sheep in the herd and doing what society’s guidelines say I must do. College, 9-5, retire, die. After moths of thinking, I realized that my passion lies in the film industry. I have always dreamt of directing a movie and telling stories that have never been told before. This may sound crazy, but I have decided I want to quit aerospace engineering and go to film school. I realized that I could never see myself as an engineer working for a company, whether it be NASA or SpaceX. I will have to start from 0, but timelines don’t matter when you’re doing it for yourself.

I have already started the process of applying and am getting help from a friend who graduated with an MBA and MFA in film and tv production, but I cannot find a way to tell my parents about this decision. They expect me to follow their choices and their dreams and lead a professional career and “follow the plan”. 

So yeah, how do I tell them I am planning to quit my aerospace engineering degree and pursue my dreams of film directing? How do I even start the conversation? What words do I even use? Do I tell them separately or together?",20Oct2019,1
717,"So I'm driving myself crazy, which is why I'm asking for advice here. My daughter is almost 5 and is special needs. My husband got laid off months ago in Spring and is in a different job now, but making half a week of what he did before. My daughter is in prek during the day. Since her going back to school and us having a problem with a non payment tenant, we've been cashed strapped and I've been trying to figure out what to do. I don't have a college degree yet but I have a high school degree. I've worked in retail and as an admin assistant. I can't seem to find anything other than retail jobs and I don't really want to sacrifice odd hours when I have a child who depends on me outside of school hours to be around. I have a lot of anxiety and ocd as it is, which has also been on the back burner because of losing insurance. My mental illness, chronic pain and severe need to make money are building up.

720,"Hi. Before you ask, yes, I'm on the younger side. But please, just hear my out.

I live in a really religious family. Like extremely fucking religious. My mother is a devout Christian who believes in all that spiritual shit and my dad I believe is like that as well. I, on the other hand, am not. I'm a firm believer in the supernatural but, nothing like god and satan and shit. I don't see any reason to believe in it. To me, it's nothing more than a bullshit excuse to manipulate and brainwash children. Because that's what happened to me.

Now, I'm a gay trans man. I am under 17 and I am monitored severely. Hell, I made this on a throwaway email from 10 Minute Mail just so I could get my story out there. To get help from someone who could actually give a fuck about my position and offer me genuine advice.

I mean, that's why I'm here, right?

So, I guess it's story time. I need to make this quick before my parents check this. I don't even know if I'll finish it before I post so, if it's half finished, you know what happened.

I live in an extremely religious household like I said before. I go to a very religious school with very religious beliefs. I am active on Discord as that's basically where my only friends are. My mother is a religious fanatic. She says that there's an ""evil spirit"" around me and telling me ""not to give into it"". I think this is completely bullshit, but hey. Give her the benefit of the doubt, right?

She only started saying this after my guidance counselor outed me to my parents. Or, really after my best friend told her mom about myself being trans and her mom told the guidance counselor who then told my parents. She's basically not letting me go. She's been monitoring everything I do. I can't do anything without asking her first. Making me show her my Bible homework (yay,,,), and the like. All of my conversations via text messaging is monitored too. The only thing that isn't monitored is my laptop where I'm posting this.

I'd say she's in the right to do this. Hell, I get no privacy when under my parents' roof, right? I'll move out when I'm 18 and everything will just go away.

But I can't. Because they said something yesterday that made me confirm my suspicions. 

Here's the quote:

""Nobody will love you but us, like us. The people online you talk to, don't care about we. We are the only ones who care.""

I've been suspecting emotional and mental abuse for about three months now. And I don't know what to do with this information. It hurts to suspect them of this, but it just feels so damn right. I'm really thinking of running away but I don't have anywhere to go. I can't take it anymore. It hurts being around them. They're constantly watching me. It's really scaring me. Almost making me love them.

They say love is a choice. And that they choose to love me. And that really feels wrong to me. It really does.

I don't really know what else to say. I just need advice. Please, anything you can. 

Thanks and have a good day.",20Oct2019,3

725,"I am finishing college with a biology degree (I was originally pre-med). I decided I did not want to go through 7+ more years of hardship last year with medicine. I started taking computer science classes. I have the option to do 1 year post bac programs that are very expensive (&gt;30k). I already have 35k from undergrad. It would be ok with just 35... but adding another 30 is making it questionable. There is one post bac (WGU) all online and accredited. My only concern as someone with no experience in the field, is how the degree would look to employers.

Commuting and living at home while my family is enduring financial hardship would make me miserable, as I was for a lot of undergrad. Doing the CS at my original school is not viable for my sanity.

I have equal desire for both medicine and CS. I just want to be able to be on my own financially and not have to endure anymore financial hardship... and be able to enjoy life. I did not as I worked my college years away. I am unsure where to go next. I just want good employment in either field without crippling debt or several years of the same thing.

726,"A friend of mine I’ve had since I was 2 is in a very bad way mentally, she is very depressed and doesn’t leave the house anymore. She also turns her phone off for days on end so barely replies. She had a difficult upbringing and has had a bad time with bullying and I feel like she’s never been able to handle adult life. She won’t take any medication and also won’t see a therapist (even if it’s online) so it feels a bit frustrating sometimes as I don’t know how she will her better if she doesn’t accept medical help. 

I have always tried to be there for her as much as I can. I text her all the time and call her when I can see that her phone is on, I’ve also sent her letters and birthday presents. Sometimes she asks me to meet up with her and it’s very difficult, I lost my mum to suicide after she refused all help and find it extremely difficult being around my friend who acts the same way (my friend knows my mum died this way). I also have a heart condition which makes traveling quite stressful and draining (she lives over an hour away from me). 

She keeps asking me to meet up with her but as she won’t leave the house she wants me to go there, however for the reasons I explained above I find this very difficult. If I decline because of this she gets very upset and will ignore me for weeks, but if I say yes I know there’s a 50/50 chance I’ll have to cancel because of my health problems (she knows this) and if I do cancel she also then gets very upset and ignores me. The times when we do meet are very sad, she often only says 1 word answers and then we spend a lot of the time in silence. I don’t mind this because I know she is probably enjoying the company but it makes me feel quite emotional for a few days after. I am completely at a loss on what I can do to support her at this stage and it is really starting to bring me down and make me very depressed also. I’ve also been thinking about my mum a lot more than usual because it feels like I’m in the same situation all over again.

727,"My friend (19F) is wanting me (18F) to move in with her. She lives at a student-based apartment complex with cheap rent and online it has mostly great reviews. She has invited me to move in with her before and as much as I would love to because I love the area she lives in and there is so much opportunity there, I’m hesitant because a couple of reasons.

1) I’m confident I would be able to find a job, but I’m worried about my father. I usually pay for the bills at the apartment with my dad (about $350 a month) and while he does promise me that it would be just fine if I decide to move, I just don’t trust that completely. I also feel bad leaving him because I feel like he would be lonely without me.

2) My grandmother has cancer and to put it bluntly, is slowly dying. I usually visit her about once a week because she has always been so close to me, but if I move the city I’d be moving to is about an hour and a half away from where I live now so I likely could not see her as often. I know she would just tell me to live my life and not worry, but I feel like the guilt would eat me up inside.

3) I do not have a car. I am in the process of getting my license now, but even once I do I doubt I would be able to afford a car (I have a bit in savings but it’s not enough for a car nor do I feel like it’s wise to drop all my savings money on one).

During this i have had a lot to think about and you know i think friendship should be a two way thing , however i feel like i'm trying to be friends with a brick wall, i don't think I've ever revived a message from them without me starting the conversation, also the thing is that i have never been invited to anything by them , its literally just me trying to make plans which we go and do sometimes. i was at party yesterday and they didn't say word to me he spent all of it with his new girlfriend which i actually understand but when i say they have never started a conversation with me i'm not exaggerating as i literally cannot remember one time.  I have had a conversation about this with them , about me believing that they no longer like me, he did say to me that he appreciated the fact i made him ask his girlfriend out on a date and that he does like me, i also brought up the fact he doesn't want to message me and he said that he dose like talking to me, i'm not sure if i should trust this as he could be saying this so that its now awkward between us when we are out with everyone else as he said he hopes every is alright between us and that we can be alright when going out.

I’ve been feeling very insecure lately about everything. How I look and what people think about me is on my mind 24/7. I care so much about how I’m perceived by people and everything I do is revolved around that, negatively or positively it doesn’t matter. I’m obsessed with other's opinions on me. It’s exhausting and sad. I always feel like i’m being talked about or everything I do is so important to everyone else.

She says things like, “oh you have a lot of hair “. I also have acne. I hate how I look and wear thick clothing and pants all the time, no matter if it’s 90 degrees out. I’m also wondering if I’m trans. I know this sounds really stupid, but it really weighs down on me. I’ve always pretended to be a boy online, and I like it when people call me a he.

735,"A while ago, one of my young black cats (under a year) started having weird several weird and kind of gross issues. She was leaving discharge and small amounts of blood everywhere and I had no idea why. When I first took her to our vet (small, locally owned business in the neighborhood) they checked her bladder and she had a UTI, which explained the discharge. They gave me medicine and we went on our way. However, while the medicine helped her bladder, she was still having issues with bleeding and was constantly licking around down there.

 I took her back in a week later and explained she was still having issues, but they did not seem very concerned. They gave me another medicine to apparently help with bleeding (it didn't do anything, which isn't necessarily the fault of the vet, but irritating that I paid $140 for medicine and she was still bleeding everywhere) and said she likely just has an abnormal uterus and everything will be fine once she's gotten fixed. They made it sound like she was too young to have any serious issues.

So imagine my surprise when I go to a local shelter (not the same vet) to get her fixed, and they told me she's actually had pyometra this whole time (a life threatening uterine infection, often found in older and unspayed cats) and that she was at higher risk for complications from the spaying surgery. They said her uterus was filled with pus that could have ruptered and become much more dangerous. Luckily the procedure went fine, but I was shocked that my original vet wasn't able to tell me she actually had a dangerous infection, not just an abnormal uterus. 

\*\*\*\* So to the point: Afterwards I went home and left a review on yelp for my other vet. It was a short, 3/5 star review that simply explained how this vet failed to point out to me that my cat actually had pyometra and that the medicine they sold me didn't do anything to help her condition. It was genuinely not a nasty review whatsoever, it simply stated the facts and described the situation as I did here and I still gave them 3 stars. 

However, this vet also prescribes cat food for my two cats (they have sensitive stomachs and this food is the only one they can eat without causing diarrhea) and when I order it through the website Chewy, it requires approval of my vet. When I tried to do it this time around, I got an email from Chewy basically saying that it was denied and that I would have to go back to my vet to get it approved. When I tried calling in confusion, they told me I had left a ""terrible review"" and basically wouldn't be prescribing the food. If I remove the review and apologize I feel like they might do it then, but the review is literally my honest experience and none of my friends think it should be removed after reading it either.

I don't want to remove my review but I really need to get this food for my cats. It is the Royal Canin Gastrointestinal dry cat food. Does anyone know how I could go about getting it? If I try to order on Amazon without a prescription it is over $100 for a bag.",20Oct2019,1
736,"I’m going to keep this pretty short just to for the main details. One of the friends in my friend group had a brunch, and there was “bottomless” drinks ( I don’t remember what the name of the drink was) and everyone got pretty wasted. Since I don’t drink, I was the only sober one so I had to deal with all of them. One of my friends ended up throwing up on the car and I got charged for damages (just to give you a sense of how bad it was).

Anyways I get back to my dorm first and I begin to sleep and about 15 minutes later my roommate comes into the room with one of our other friends (who happens to be his ex). I contemplate leaving as they get into the bed (clothed) together, but they insist it’s fine I stay. I fall asleep for about an hour until suddenly  I hear a bump . I turn around towards my roommates bed and I see our friend on the floor. I hear her retching so I offer her a plastic bag which she doesn’t take. When she stands up I notice a stain on the floor, which in the time I thought was vomit. She then begins to take off her pants (underwear and all) in front of me so I get my hoodie ASAP and leave the room. My roommate seemed to be asleep during all of this. 

I’m not sure what happened after I left but everyone has recovered since then. I came back to the room and there was a vomit stain on my bathroom rug but that was it. But now a few hours later I smell a strong urine smell in my room. I think now my friend may have peed on her self and was taking her clothes off in response to that.  

My question I guess is how do I go about fixing this. The rug is huge and cannot be put in a washing machine. I don’t know if I should confront my friend who I suspect did it to confirm or just tell my roommate; which would inevitably lead to me having to tell him I saw his ex naked.

750,"I'll just jump right in. I have a problem when people talk about certain things or feel a certain way. I don't stop them or try to go against them, but internally it stirs something up in me. A while back, I had a bad addiction with pornography. Since stopping, I've opened my eyes and see just how bad things were and how destructive it can me. My partner had started watching porn a year ago and I talked to him about it and he stopped. But ever since then, I've come to hate many things around it like anime/hentai, or just porn in general and people talking to me about it or obsessing over it. I used to love anime but seeing how oversexualized it is has made me hate it. My partner loves it. And honestly I won't stop him, but whenever he or anyone else brings up those topics, it upsets me greatly. I usually hold it back, but earlier today a certain topics was brought up relating to it and I went on a rant and ended duo lashing out at him. I appologized and told him I needed to calm down. I know part of it is that I don't want to forgive him for watching stuff. Was I not enough? He's very religious and the fact that he preached about how bad that stuff is and then did it himself...it irritates me. I haven't been able to forgive him for it because he hid it from me and knew I was sensitive to it. It's been at least 6 months and whenever I hear about those two things, it makes me angry at him. I've just kept it in for so long, but I'm worried it'll only worsen. I'm not sure what to do anymore. 


Disclaimer: I am not trying to offend anyone. If you wash anime or porn, that's fine, it's your life. And I'm not really against anima per se, I just don't like how obsessive people can get over it. Even then I don't do anything about it, I just hide my discomfort. Please don't try to convince me on why pornography is okay, I respect if that's what you watch, but I don't want people to try to change my mind.",20Oct2019,1

755,"My brother and I (he was 13 and I was 16/17) always got along together. He was very sweet but he had a speech disorder and ADHD, and the school put him in special education. He was always a loner and he usually kept to himself. I was severely depressed my whole life because my parents were narcissistic and never paid attention to either of us emotionally. I also had severe ADHD, and that wasnt ever treated. They also neglected a condition that basically ruined my childhood and social life. I always felt like shit every day and it really made a bad impact on my mood. My dad was horribly verbally abusive to me as well, and he tried his best to put me down often.

Usually, we have to walk to our relative's house to eat lunch, which is about 10-15 minutes walking distance. My brother usually takes really long because he's distracted on his iPad watching youtube. I got really frustrated one day because I went to see the nurse for my condition. She constantly tried to sell new equipment that costed hundreds of dollars out of pocket, even though it was unnecessary and I felt like I was being taken advantage of. When I got home I felt really disgruntled and when we had to go to my relative's house, I yelled at my brother for taking so long. I was so mad and under mental stress, and I threw a metal frame garbage basket to the side of him. I was really furious for no good reason... My brother became terrified and started to cry, and then I felt really guilty immediately after that. My mom came home to bring us food instead (sometimes she does), and my brother told her what happened. My mom just shrugged her shoulders and said it was normal conflict between children. But I feel horrible for doing this and I have trouble living with myself for doing that. I apologized to him right after and he said it was okay. But ever since then, I tried to look after my brother's health. I check up on him every week and I ask him if he's okay.

I found out maybe 2 months before I gave birth that my mom has cancer. She had to get started on chemo immediately to better her chances vs probably dying in 6 months. BF and I weren’t in a position where we could go see her, as I was due soon but also financially we just couldn’t afford it. Well BFs mom said she’d front the tickets for us to go see her after the baby is born (fun fact: you can fly with a newborn 2 weeks after birth with pediatrician approval) so long as everything is good with me and babeh- I would pay her back when I could. I don’t know when I’ll be working again so I didn’t accept the offer. She looked into BFs money status or something and told him he has the money to fly us all out there and she would cover our rent for the month (he would be on paternal leave so could make the trip) so we wouldn’t fall behind. 

In theory it was all a great idea but the whole time I was thinking there’s just so many unknown variables. 

1. We don’t know when baby will be born, they come when they want lol
2. Because we don’t know, we can’t purchase tickets. Everyone knows the longer you wait, the more expensive they’ll be- especially with holiday season coming up.
3. We don’t know if there will be any complications. So far I’ve had a smooth pregnancy but you never know with birth.
4. We don’t have someone to watch our cat.
5. Biggest one for me, I just don’t know if I can do it. I just gave birth. Birth! 

Fast forward, had the baby 5 days ago (lil squish is great) and suddenly we’re back on the train to going to visit. My mom is doing AMAZING now and is super optimistic, all her doctors are super impressed with the progress etc. I know that could all change in a minute but I don’t think I can do it. I’m supposed to be healing and figuring out this child and my house- This is my first baby and it’s different than babysitting. I don’t exactly know what I’m doing, these few months off work I’m supposed to be adjusting. I don’t want my BFs paternal leave to be spent visiting my mom, I want his help and to bond with me and the baby. (Also: BF just got a promotion + raise so if we postponed the trip, we wouldn’t have to worry AT ALL from a financial aspect. I want him to use his paternal leave to be a parent, he can request off a week at another time right?)
I feel so guilty but I’m literally in stitches, bleeding- I haven’t pooped yet! Yesterday was my first entire day back at home and it was hard. How can I get on a plane and go visit when I’m still exhausted and in pain. I can’t even think about the amount of germs and shit in the airport with a newborn when I haven’t thought about when I’ll next have to leave the house! I’ve cried about this, I feel so selfish because it’s not I don’t want to see my mom but that’s the only way this comes across as. My BF keeps saying when we go see the pediatrician, we’re going to ask if he’ll be ok to fly when the 2 weeks is up so that he can buy the tickets. He knows I’m not fully on board and reminds me “I don’t want to regret NOT visiting her”. He’s not doing it to be mean, that’s what EVERYONE has been telling me!
I don’t want to regret it but I just don’t think I can do it. Any advice at all? How can I best explain to everyone- BF and mom included- I don’t think I can and it’s not a matter of trying to talk me into it/ suggesting everything will be fine?",20Oct2019,1

Am I crazy or just stupid?

I literally have no way to title this sorry about that.  This is not going to be short, strap in for a bumpy ride, all arms and legs in the carriage at all times and enjoy I guess. 

A little bit of back story for how this started;
I live at home with my partner and child kind of house sharing with my mother - we’re young parents, at the time my best friend lived here too due to being made homeless a couple years before when he was 17/18. My brother hasn’t lived here for a few years, because no one could stand all the arguments, issues and pain he brought to the family, but moved back into the area as our mother always supported him and still to this day pays for his apartment and general living needs (he’s 25). 

So my partner and I found out we were going to have a baby (okay life happens not the main point). Not long after we went on a break, all her hormones were raging and I was scared of becoming a dad. 
Soon I found out my brother was trying to get close to her, I didn’t like this because I knew he’d already raped around 2 women (he’s raped around 5 that I know of and he’s admitted to family that he’s done but none of them went forward because he’s crazy and it’s too late now). Soon I found out something had happened with them, turned out he’d raped my partner too. I disowned him. I hated and still hate him.  

Soon my brother had moved on with some woman (this is relevant I promise). But we found out my best friend was going to be a dad too! 

My brother and his partner had broken up but my best friend still tried to keep in contact with her and one day she was round my moms place dropping some baby stuff for my best friend and having a coffee. My brother found out about this and came over to start an argument. He then pulled out a 7” bayonet and tried to stab my best friend and then tried to stab me when I got in the way. The police were called and we eventually got a restraining order and he got a suspended sentence. 

Now after all of this our mother has done nothing short of everything she can for him, she pays his rent, brought his food and cigarettes and gave him hundreds of pounds every month. 

At this point my son and partner are living with me at my mothers place as we support the house with food and tidying and everything. My best friend moved in with his partner at her mothers to get away from everything. 

I can’t work as I’m recovering from a fracture in my spine and my partner looks after me and our son. But my mother is annoyed that I have asked her once to help me pay for a new computer so I can work from home maybe (I’m a qualified infrastructure technician and I only needed £60) and she gave me the excuse of “when will you pay it back? I can’t afford it, you know I don’t have enough money” even though she tries to keep her paying for my brother a secret. Within a week I find out she’s taking him to London to go see phantom of the opera (£200 just for travel so actually around £600 trip). 

I’m now concerned because she’s starting to threaten kicking me and my family out even though we do everything she asks of us. I really don’t see how any of this is fair, can anyone give me any advice or as parents what they would do in a similar situation?

I’m really not sure if I’m going crazy or I’m just stupid.",20Oct2019,2

773,"I've had Reddit for a hot minute but haven't really used my account till recently. Some backstory for what happened. August 2018 I got added to a group chat on instagram. I was following a popular Pokemon account (~15k followers) but they had changed content to Splatoon related posts. On their story they said ""send a meme to be added to a gc"" wo did and that night I woke up to hundreds of notifications on my phone from all these kids sending memes in the gc. I was 20 at the time, I'm 21 now. I thought some of them were pretty funny and even though I'm an adult now I haven't stopped loving anime or videogames. We all eventually became friends and it was weird for me because I didn't think I could care about people I've never met before. Oh, and the other people in the gc were 16-17 years old. I was named the gc mom because of me being older than them and I felt like I had a responsibility to help them and give them advice as I had just gone through highschool not too long ago. The creater of the chat was always kind of weird. She was very explicit in talking about her period and would say when she was horny (wtf) and people would ask her politely to stop. Something happened and she started talking to some kid she met while playing Splatoon. They would talk and she'd tell us all about how she liked him and what not. Then she messaged one day freaking out about how he was lying about his age, he wasn't 16 he was 12. She eventually calmed down and they started ""dating"". She got more and more sexual and would talk about wanting to peg him and eat his ass. I was informed by her cousin who was in the chat that she was having ""e-sex"" with him and they'd exchange pictures. In one incedent where her boy was freaking out about belle Delphine he stated he was grossed out that older men were just paying her because she's basically a loli, to which I responded ""she's an adult, you can't say that when you're literally doing illegal things"". I was messaged by the gc creator that he was very upset by what I said and that it wasn't okay. I responded that he was being a hypocrite in what he was saying and that she shouldn't know so much about this 12 year old boy! When he wasn't active in the chat she would tell people about his dick size, how he wasn't circumsized, how she liked how little he was and that he didn't have body hair, and she even went as far to tell us that she asked him to taste himself and he did and that he liked it. Being the adult I informed her that if an adult were to see any photos that were exchanged between them and they took it to the authorities they both could be charged with distribution/possession of child pornography. I left the chat some time later and made a new one with the people I felt I made genuine connections with. We talk about memes and anime and games and just general life stuffs. Maybe two weeks ago the old gc creator messaged a friend saying she thinks IM a pedophile and that I'm grooming these kids. Because I have a thot account that had an image of me sitting on my bed with my cat in my lap. I was wearing a underwear and my cat was covering my chest. One of the kids from the gc started following my thot account because I tagged him weeks later in a image of Jake from State farm. So somehow that = me being a pedophile. I told her cousin I want to make contact with her mother to discuss things because I don't like this hypocrite accusing me of a crime when I just have friends that are 5 years younger than me. And besides that she KNOWS I'm in a relationship. I'm not poly, I've been with this man for 2 years and talk about having a future with him. Is there a way for me to report her? I'm concerned for this boy that she has sending her pictures. No 12 year old should be having this sort of relationship. She would talk about how she looked up romeo and Juliet laws and was sad that her state didn't have them, she wants to go drive to see him when she turns 18 (he'd be 15). She has stated in the chat ""well, I want to fuck a 13 year old sooo"" what do I do?!",20Oct2019,1
775,Hello I’m a 17 year old female. I have a lot of anxiety symptoms but I’ve never got diagnosed. While brushing my teeth I suddenly started feeling a tingle in my left arm. Google says it might be a sign of a heart attack. I currently am feeling disoriented and am shaking. My parents say they won’t call the ambulance bc they think I’m being dramatic. I might be but I’m still rlly scared. :(( idk what to do. My arm still feels weird but no other symptoms. I’m rly scared and don’t know whether I should try and go to sleep. :(((( I’m healthy overall but my heart always has worried me.

776,"So a little context: I got my degree in photography. It took my 5 years and $100k and a lot of hard work. The thing about all of that is that I studied fine art photography. I made art for 5 years and worked in hotels and restaurants while doing it and now I am living in the LA area looking for a job and my parents keep sending me jobs links for jobs I either A: don’t want to do or B: am not qualified for. 

Marketing and creative jobs I don’t feel qualified for but are the choice I would want to make. If I am going to be making money doing photography I’d prefer it being that. However these places want portfolios of work that I don’t have(my work was large format film) or working experience I don’t have. 

The other options I keep getting sent are lifetouch and senior photo gigs. To me that is like going to med school to be a brain surgeon  and working as a school nurse for the rest of your life. I also look at that and think what a joke I would be if I applied to something like a magazine and they saw a resume with “lifetouch” on it. It seems like a huge joke. 

Am I being unreasonable? I feel like they don’t get it. I just want to work so I can afford to do what I love and then take that work I create on the side and make something big of it.",20Oct2019,2

Now, we haven’t communicated for over a month because he hasn’t texted me since then, but he would always show up at places I’m always at, like the street I take to pass to school. He has greeted me twice during the times we passed each other, but whenever I’m with my friends, he doesn’t say anything to me.

Two weeks ago, he was talking to his friend outside of our school, then he saw me and my friend, then he said bye to his friend and parted ways and literally passed the same way my friend and I were walking. It’s weird since that exact thing happened twice last week. On Thursday, he was sitting on a chair outside my classroom and was looking at me when class was almost over. Yesterday, he sat outside my class again and looked at me then turned his head quickly to the other direction.

785,"I grew up pretty extroverted (lots of friends, always feeling the need to do something with others, etc), but I got into a very serious relationship from 17-22 and also went through a period of cancer during that time (Hodgkin's Lymphoma, I am fine now). 

During this period of 4.5 years, I honestly LOATHED being around anyone but my ex and my family. I was INTENSELY introverted. I also had really bad social anxiety during this period because I think the transition from high school to college/adult life was very difficult for me. I was also very content to just sit at home by myself, reading/playing videos games or even doing nothing at all. 

But after those four and a half years, me and my ex had a very sad break up due to circumstances neither of us were in control of. She was my best friend and my entire life revolved around her, we were inseparable and I never even fathomed the possibility we wouldn't be together in the future. It's been three years since we officially broke it off - we didn't know what was wrong aside from lack of physical intimacy which I couldn't cope with because we were very intimate for years. A few months after we broke up she came out to me as gay. We are still good friends and I even helped her move to her new apartment with her new partner.

 I am sincerely very happy for her, and can say that after three years I still love her, but just in a different way, and have come to terms with what happened. We are the perfect friends, but obviously incompatible as partners due to her sexual orientation and our independent growth from one another since that time.  


After we broke up, I was devastated and would go days without speaking to anyone. My whole city sickened me because it reminded me of what I had and I craved adventure and a new start, so I went to Alaska for a year for college. There I forced myself to be social and I made a HUGE circle of friends. I also started turning into a bit of a party person and started drinking a lot. Long story short, I had to return home after that year and leave all my friends in Alaska behind, thinking I was coming back the fall semester. Money got really bad and I ultimately decided that as great of a chapter that part of my life was, I was not making good decisions and needed to be removed from that environment.

I have had a few relationships in the three years since I split with my longterm ex, but they are always superficial. It sounds cruel, but I really don't feel much on a personal level for these people I dated. But I am SO lonely and feel so unfulfilled. My need to be social usually makes me make decisions to go out drinking on weekends with my friends, and aside from a few of them, I would say my friendship is very superficial also, and centered around just drinking/partying.

I have two useless associates degrees, and work two low-paying jobs. I work SEO monkey-work from home, and I work in a deli for a total of 54 hours a week, but I get weekends off. I like my job at the deli but I had aspirations to teach English overseas, and I can't do that with my associates degrees, I need a bachelors but don't have the money to return to college at the moment. I am also a volunteer fireman again after a four year hiatus. 

I don't even know what I am asking.... I guess any advice would do. I am lonely on a romantic and even platonic level. I feel like there is a void in me. I feel sad the day after a night of drinking/bar-hopping, though obviously I feel pretty good at the time when I am drunk. I am not moving my life forward in any meaningful way - I am 24 with no car and still live with my parents, which is hardly an ideal set up for a longterm relationship. I have grown to despise the way I look and even myself as a person. Although I like working, I feel fulfillment and disappointment knowing what I am doing isn't what I had believed I would be doing at this age. I am still able to be kind to others and ACT empathetic, but the connection I once felt for people on a more intimate and TRULY empathetic level has largely dissipated into me just acting kind because I know it is the right thing to do. I am sad as fuck the day after a night out, and I even feel discontent after a long day at work when I come home due to loneliness and not knowing what to do with myself. I am starting to truly hate myself, and I have tendencies to be a bit self-destructive, so I am afraid of spiraling out of control.",20Oct2019,1

789,"I’m not sure if I’m posting this to the right subreddit so I apologize in advance i haven’t. I apologize in advance as well for the goddamn novel I’m about to write but I really need some guidance. 

My father is a raging alcoholic. He always has been, but didn’t disclose this crucial piece of information to my mother before they started dating. So my mom had no idea until they were 10 years down the line (he was very good at lying about his whereabouts and that sort of stuff). My mother knew he had some....issues, but she didn’t know to what extent. When my mother had my sister 25 years ago, he became less “sneaky” and from there it has been downhill. 

Over the past 18 years of my life, in summary, he has attempted to commit suicide 3 times (two of which I was home alone with him and also like 10 years old), brought prostitutes into our own home, drank himself to the point of domestic violence and a whole series of other unfortunate events. I wasn’t fully aware of what he had been doing all these years because I was rather young and my mother wanted to hide the truth in fear of upsetting me. 

My father went to many rehabs and went through the twelve-step program. So one of my main points of this whole story is that I went through my mother’s “box of memories” last night because I needed a baby photo for a school thing. First question: is it wrong that I read all the notes in there? She has gone through my stuff many times and I didn’t read her stuff out of spite but merely out of curiosity. So I read my fathers notes of “making amends” and his “life story”. Now in his life story, I read some of the most horrifying things I have ever read in my entire life. (Before I elaborate, I would like to argue that I was incredibly tired of being left in the dark about my family and I wanted answers as to why my parents split up so suddenly.) I read that he slept with a lot of prostitutes and he didn’t have any money so he brought knives with him so he could kill them (he never ended up killing them, but the mere thought is horrifying). I read that he had killing fantasies of my mom,sister and I. I read that he forced himself onto his cousin. 

I read a whole bunch of other stuff but that was the summed up version of the ones that stood out the most. I don’t have a simple question around this whole thing but how do I continue to love my father if I know all this? Is it ok to feel incredibly angry towards him? How to I deal with this?

795,"I’m 23 and I’ve had major depression and anxiety for most of my life but now it’s at an all time high. Even with a college degree I hate my life more than ever and feel like a complete failure. Everyday I see people who are my age and they’re doing way better than me financially which means they are better than me as a person and I can’t take it. I see them going to exclusive events, having acting careers, seeing them on media outlets. Keep in mind, these aren’t celebrities but people I know irl. 

Then I imagine people who have made it when they were my age like Mark Zuckerberg and basically every athlete ever. I’m over hear doing absolutely nothing with my life making 40k a year at best, $29k at worst. I feel like a failure as a human being and like I deserve to be treated as such so I don’t mind being treated like crap because I feel like I deserve to be treated this way for being a failure. 

It’s hard for me to do anything anymore without constantly comparing them to myself. It’s hard for me to enjoy anything when all I see is a bunch of people doing what I couldn’t even dream of doing living their dream while I am stuck on the sidelines.

I’ve never really told anyone this because it’s kind of depressing. However every week at some point i’ll just get in my car and drive. It all started in august when my then girlfriend broke up with me. I loved her with all my heart and she left me out of no where. 

I started driving. I got on i-85 and just didn’t stop. It was relaxing at first.

About a month later all my friends decided to leave me. One of them turned out to be such an asshole, he even ruined my credit score. That’s a story in itself. 

I drive because I don’t want to sit at home. I guess it takes my mind off the fact that I’m literally depressed and have absolutely nobody to talk to. My life went from great to wherever I am now. I constantly miss my ex, I was able to tell her anything. 

The only thing I have to look forward to is joining the Army in a couple of months. But until then I guess i’m just going to keep driving. It sucks. Every time I start I just think “Here I go again. I have nothing better to do but sit behind the wheel of this car and drive. I’m so alone.”

801,"This question ties into a lot of aspects of my life. Im finishing up my last few weeks of school and these last 2 years have basically been a bomb shell for me. My confusion is at breaking point and i'm tired of trying to sought this out internally. Please i need some advice.

Recently i've joined up with a martial arts gym, i absolutely love going, the people are nice, i enjoy the exercise and the skills i learn are valuable. However i find it entirely difficult to leave my house and walk into the building. Ive struggled with this problem before when i was a child, i used to do karate at a local dojo but after a month or 2 decided to leave. My desire to not go outweighed my desire to go and have fun. Why is that?

And over the last few years i've been finding more and more excuses to avoid school. Im not going to repeat, thankfully but i'm probably getting close. Some days are good and some days are bad, but thats to be expected. For some reason, the thought of having to go to school fills me with a lot of anxiety. But once i get to school i feel fine.

I also struggle with maintaining an exercise program, i love exercising and think that everyone should incorporate some sort of activity into their lives. But i might work out and be active for a few weeks and then stop... Why am i like this?

Why cant i do what i want to do, why do i hold myself back? I think the worst part of this is my awful relationship with sleep. Sleep is amazing, sleep is crucial. For years, i've been saying ""Yeah, ill go to sleep at 9:30 and get some rest"". Only to look at my clock at 1:30 and curse myself for being an idiot.

I don't know if its mental illness related, and i hope it isn't, because i have phases when i'm perfectly fine and i feel like i can do anything. Ive had good routines before, but they don't last long, and my lack of sleep has made me forget what i did to achieve that lifestyle. And if it is then that would be very frustrating, because i've seen 2 seperate psychologists/therapists before and i found that they were no help, they only told me stuff i already knew and i felt like they hated me. I also felt very foggy whenever i saw them, i thought i knew what i wanted to talk about with them, about my problems but as soon as i sat down i just didnt know what to say.

804,"Basically, I've discovered my biggest flaw which is I don't really care about myself? 

A few examples would be that:
- If there's something that I need to do to benefit me, I procrastinate and will probably end up never getting round to it. If it's something for someone else I care about, I'm balls deep 100% effort solving it. I often help solve a lot of problems for friends/family
- Another one I often think about is that, when I was with an ex I always cared about their well-being to the point I neglected my own. When she went away to visit family I literally lived off of canned food for two weeks, not because I can't cook, I cook quite well and always made sure we both ate healthy and right every day, cooking 99% of the time, but more because I had no motivation because it was just me.

A reoccurring theme is that when there is no-one else, when it's just me, I don't care? I've never cared about money, looks, social image, nothing. I care about people, loved ones more than strangers, but even people I don't know. Quite ironically I'm very monotone and blunt though very empathetic which comes as a shock to people. I have literally done the cliché jump in front of a car for someone thing. 

I'm not stupid, I know this isn't normal. I know it's unattractive to not care about yourself, exes have pointed that out and told me if I took some self care in myself, my image, I'd be much more attractive. (I literally wear the same clothes most days) 

I grew up dirt poor, wouldn't have it any other way I loved my childhood and it's taught me many morals. I believe this is the reason I don't care about money or possessions and dress like a hobo.

I get the feeling my grandfather sees me as a walking kidney recently, he knows my father doesn’t approve because he told him in his face.

I’m a 17-year-old girl, almost 18, and I was never a rebellious teenager, but lately I’ve been giving more attitude, feeling more sarcastic and frustrated lately. My parents aren’t that patient or understanding sometimes and can respond like dicks, sometimes sending me on the verge of tears. I don’t know why I’ve been feeling or acting this way. I’ve been applying to colleges and my parents often add stress on to that process, so maybe I’ve been feeling less comfortable around them lately? I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sick of dreading being around them.",20Oct2019,1
810,"Okay, so where to start? I have several things running through my mind right now and I don't know what to focus on or how to divide my time.

First off, I'm in college. I don't like my course. I'm studying accounting. It's not bad as a plan B, since I've always wanted to own a business, but I don't see myself actually working as an accountant. I'm on my last year, not doing great, not doing awful, but I have never really studied apart from pulling all nighters starting 1 week before an exam. Alternatively, I could pursue something in the legal field (either giving legal advice to companies, which would be my first choice, or going the opposite route and working for the state by analyzing companies). This would add 2 extra years to my studying.

Second, social life and related activities. I honestly pretty much hate everyone in my class. I do get along pretty well with a select few, but apart from that they all seem kids to me? I'm not trying to be the owner of truth and all-mighty me, but I need to state how I feel. From clowning around in classes to binge drinking to general way of being. Nobody reads, nobody has any ambitions, nobody has any sort of interests, everything people seem to talk about is drama and I swear this feels to me like I'm a senior in high school again. That said they are all 2-3 years younger than me since I missed a few years on another course before dropping out, but I don't think it should make that much of a difference? 

Anyway, I've been trying to get out more often, meet new people, and increase my confidence and social skills. I haven't been in a relationship since I left high school, and I'm still a virgin, so I've been trying to put myself out there more. This includes learning things that I think would make me seem more interesting in the eyes of others (pop culture, news, etc. Most recently I started forcing myself to watch movies I really don't care much about and that I actively find boring because I think they will eventually come up in conversation and make me look interesting, idk). Most people seem to react positively to me when I first me (MOST). I actually love talking to people and can easily make them smile/laugh/enjoy themselves for a while. And I've had a few girls (and sometimes friends in general) attracted to me, but then one of two things happens: a) I'm not attracted back, so I withdraw, or b) after I meet them, when I calm my energy and look for a connection and deeper conversations, there's nothing there. I lost count of the amount of times I've heard ""Hey so what happened to the funny guy I met?"" or ""Hey, what's going on, you are usually so much more energetic"". Honestly, this infuriates me, and it tends to lead me into withdrawing from that person. It makes me feel like a comedian, and a failed one at that. And some people I can tell don't really care for me at all. They are okay if I'm there because I'm not a creep or offensive or a bother in general, but they would be totally okay if I wasn't too.

Finally, my hobbies/passions. The things I think I would be good at and could get paid for if I dedicated myself to them, and the things I actually have fun doing. Four main things here right now would be: a) anything to do with digital art, VFX, 3D product visualization/character creation/etc., love the way this teases my creativity, b) programming, c) (human) languages, and then long term starting some sort of business or designing a product. I've been wasting so much time on other things (namely that second part above) that I haven't dedicated much time to this at all, and I think this is taking its toll on my mental well-being. Ideally I would be able to earn enough money with one of these to allow me to move out and start taking full responsibility for my life. At the same time, moving out with such a shitty social life would mean I could potentially lose the only consistent social contact I have (my parents). However, it would allow me to travel more, meet new people even outside the city, have more stories to tell, etc.

Help. Not knowing what to focus on is stressing me out thin. Which of these parts of my life do you think I should focus the most to get in order? How do I split my time between them? Thanks!",20Oct2019,1

812,"Hey Reddit, I wasn't sure where to post this, so after some consideration, I came here.

This is now my second attempt at a University degree. My first approach was a Psychology degree, and after feeling left out, and not enjoying the course, I decided to defer for a year and continue working in my part-time cashier position in a wholesale. Here, I felt like I was doing amazing. When I stepped in, I felt like a natural, quickly picking things up and advancing with small promotions (no pay rise, I'm a part-time student and the management was cheap). I enjoyed it overall, and got to meet a lot of business owners, who took a shine to me. 

Being a smart guy, and someone who has always been a hard worker and known for it, on top of receiving praise and offers to socialise with my business owner customers, I felt like I was destined to be something, especially knowing that I was going to start an Economics degree in a much bigger city, with a better University, and finally being with my girlfriend in this city (she moved away, and we started dating after she moved). I always dreamt of being in an executive role, or starting up and running my own business.

Since starting, I am getting on pretty well with my course, but I have noticed myself becoming somewhat...different? I have started a new job in which I sell fireplaces, and I've picked it up a lot faster than they have seen anyone pick it up, it seems. I'm not sure whether it opens up as many opportunities, but it pays. Ideally, I wanted to work in a bank, or as a cashier of some sort. 

I have also noticed myself developing a slight gambling habit when I am in a bad mood. I have traded cryptocurrency passively for a few years now, but I have now found myself trading more frequently, and losing a portion of my cryptocurrency, even putting the majority of my savings into them, as well as poking my head into the lottery. 

I feel like I have lost a lot of ambition. I don't feel like I will be as successful as I once thought I would be. My social circle has decreased to about 2 people, one of which is my girlfriend, and I am starting to slack with my University work, reassuring myself that it is first year, and that it doesn't matter as much. I know that I will work hard and might even find some sort of success wherever I step my foot in the door, but I have this sort of deep feeling that I will be a failure, especially with the fact that my idea of success can be measured financially. I don't know if there's much I can do to help this; I have very specific dreams of having a family, a nice house, and a generally upper-middle class lifestyle, and I come from a background of (first-world) poverty.

Tl;dr - once had serious ambition and belief I would be successful, lately have noticed myself slipping heavily off track, and I now have a feeling that I will be a failure when I am older, and it's breaking my heart.",20Oct2019,2

815,"I have a suicidal online friend.. he's 18. He's extremely mentally unstable and depressed 24/7. I've known him for about 4 years now. The only reason I didn't leave him 4 years ago is because he's super clingy and suicidal, and I was afraid that if I left he'd commit suicide and I'd feel the guilt for it. He once attempted suicide because he thought I was becoming close friends with another person, and didn't want to be replaced. 

Not to mention I haven't been entirely truthful to him about what I look like. I wake up every morning and feel nothing but extreme guilt for lying to him for so long. It's no excuse for lying about my identity, but I was 14 at the time when this all started. I'm now 19 and in college. I want to move on with my life, but there's absolutely no way I'm able to end our friendship calmly. He's madly in love with me and thinks we're getting married. One time, I told him I didn't love him romantically and he had a mental breakdown, cried on the floor for 2 hours, etc, etc. He comes to me daily about how depressed he is. I think I've came to his rescue for 200+ mental breakdowns. There's only so much I can do. I know if I just abandon him, he'll likely commit suicide. He's told me he's one of the only reasons he's still alive. It affects my own personal life so much. I feel trapped and miserable, because everyday I wake up to a ton of texts about how much he hates his life. I try to give advice and come to the rescue and make him happy, but it's exhausting after 4 years straight of this. I'm not really sure how to go about this. I've tried every excuse in the book to distance myself, although I always reassure him I'm gonna be there for him if he needs someone to talk to.

His mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts make me anxious 24/7, keep me up at night, and I'm losing my ability to function normally. I'm so lost. What do I do? Is there anything I even can do?

822,"Hey guys.

I've just had a ton of stuff on my mind lately and I was wondering if I could get some advice. 

This past summer, I devoted a lot of time to going to the gym since I had a pretty routine life style of going to work 9-5 and then going to the gym at 6. I was pretty excited all summer that I finally had the motivation to hit the gym every day and get that dream body by the time school was going to start in September for me. 

Over the summer, I was noticing some great results. I was getting some nice muscles and I was sweating hard every day. I felt AMAZING. The issue though is that, my diet wasn't the greatest. Long story short I was pretty stupid and just ate a ton of food over the summer due to my appetite being insane after going to the gym nearly every day. 

So, even though I was indeed gaining muscle, I was also gaining quite a bit of fat, and I gained around 15-20 pounds. 

Fast forward to September, I have gained 15-20 pounds but in my mind, I felt amazing. I thought I was so BUFF and muscular. Really, I did indeed gain quite a bit of muscle. But, in September when I went out with friends, and we took pictures together, I noticed something...extremely disappointing. When looking at myself in the pics, I just saw myself as this fat dude. It didn't really look like I gained much muscle really; in pictures it looks like I'm just fat. 

When I looked at myself in the mirror this whole summer, I legitimately thought I looked great. But, in pictures...omg...I can't even look at myself without cringing. So now I'm just thinking to myself.... this FAT monster is how everyone else sees me, this ugly fat sweaty dude. 

It makes me so sad because before the summer, I was pretty lean and I felt pretty confident in pictures. I only wanted to go to the gym because I wanted to be healthy and feel that great feeling after a good sweat/workout. But, it backfired hard, because I decided to eat so much in the summer and didn't realize how fat I was getting. 

So now I just highly regret all of this BS I did in the summer. But now it's so hard to lose weight and get lean because I've conditioned myself this whole summer to eat like a pig every day. 

Now I'm just sitting here, writing this fucking post instead of doing my homework, because I am so sad and ashamed at how I went from being pretty good looking in pics to being like totally unrecognizable from how I was before the summer. I'm just a fucking round boulder now. WTF!!",20Oct2019,2

837,"I am currently a college sophomore at a well known university with a rather large Hillel (Jewish organization on Campus). There are many different clubs associated with Hillel, including a theatre group of which I am VP (club theatre is a huge thing at my school, and my theatre group is also associated with an overarching organization of multiple performing arts groups on campus, but that's besides the point). I also happen to be directing a production for the group this semester.

Anyway, before the start of the semester, our club President goes through Hillel to book a space for the show, and we are told that Hillel has booked this Black Box for us on campus for our show. We held auditions, put together a cast, assembled a production/tech team, and I have been running rehearsals and holding meetings with the assumption that we had the space and that was what we were working with. Within the past week, however, I found out that Hillel never followed through on the booking and I think failed to send something to the President or something like that, meaning that we never actually got the space and someone else took it. So basically we got in contact with Hillel, since we were told to book the performance space through them, and the club President and I emailed the people responsible asking if we could instead take the large space on the basement level in our building where events are often held and which would make a sufficient performance space. I checked the site and it wasn't booked, and we were told to go through our Hillel rep to book the performance space and stuff because it was part of this email chain, so I emailed them, and didn't hear back.

Today, I checked the space-booking website, and saw that someone else had booked the space in the time between my emailing and today, so I went over to the Hillel building to confront the people in charge directly, and I was told that our specific representative/correspondent was out and we wouldn't hear back until Wednesday. Most likely they will try to give us one of the larger rooms in the building besides the space we wanted, which is not going to be nearly enough space.

The play is now just over a month away. The only people who know are the club president (who is also my producer) and our stage manager (who is basically the only other person I have keeping me somewhat sane right now). None of my actors or other members of the production/design/tech team are aware of the issue because I don't want people to freak out, and I don't want it to harm the group's reputation (since our group is currently still pretty small having pretty much been relaunched this year).

She is incredibly condescending, has wild expectations, steals my ideas and presents them in meetings as her own, throws me under the bus for things I did not do, and even raises her voice with me when I talk to other co-workers because she doesn't want people talking to each other without her approval. Sometimes she stands at my desk in silence and after a minute or two of saying nothing tries to start an argument with me (I have only given in to it one time). She also asks me questions that could only have a lose-lose answer like, ""do you always forget to do this correctly?"" For context, I work hard and other higher-ups always have good things to say about me and my work and it's clear they only tolerate my boss at best.

Either way, I can't take it anymore, so I got a new job. I would have tried to get out from under her reign, but the company is too small to move around. Unfortunately, the new job doesn't begin until March (it's complicated but will be a great fit) so I have to put up with this maniac until the new job starts. Any tips on surviving work with this psycho for the next four months? Any advice no matter how big or small is welcome!

You are all the best!",20Oct2019,2
848,"first of all im sorry for my English if my Grammer is wrong.
Me (23m) and my crush were very close friends, when I had the courage to ask her for a date she told me she just started dating a new guy and she didn't knew how to tell me.
I told her Its ok and that I just want to take a step back from the very close relationship we had.
a month passed we kept seeing each other in social events and sending a message to say hi once a week or so.
yesterday I drove her home and she brokedown crying saying that she want what we had before and if I have told her a while ago maybe she didn't have started dating that other guy.
even though I really miss her if I'll go back to have a really close relationship with her while she have a boyfriend (with the same named has mine) it will break me from the inside.
but ever since she spoke with me I feel kind of bad. I want to do the right thing for her but it will hurt me to be so close to a person that i have feeling for and I can't have.
of course she is still very important to me and I told her that,  it will not change even if I'm not as close to her as we used to be and I want the best for her but in the same time the best for me is to stop thinking about her and to move on, the only way to do so is to stop our close relationship and to try to see her as a casual friend.

850,"So, I am currently debating whether or not to get a rhinoplasty first or a boob job. I am 20 and in college. I  plan on paying for the procedure via direct loan. (No lectures please).. i had a septoplasty done to my nose because I had broken it and my airway was blocked. It led me to have a droopy and crooked (witch like) nose.
As for my boobs, I lost about 60 pounds over the last year and a half. Leading my breasts to become very saggy and skin filled. I want one procedure done but I don’t know which one would be the best to start with and which one would be the best to wait for... advice???",20Oct2019,1
852,"So, I have  been hanging out with this girl, and I now noticed that I compliment too much. For example, she got this big coat that’s like a blanket that you wear and I said it looked good. (It doesn’t really, but I was being a suck up)
and she saw through it and said she knows it doesn’t look good. 

So, I noticed afterwards that I compliment too much and am quick to agree. So I began to change that, aka be more honest and make light criticisms when asked for opinions. (Honest criticisms though)so I am aware of The problem and am working to fix it, but any advice on how to be more honest and less agreeable would be nice. I need to be more genuine, but not come off as a prick.

854,"so to get this started off, this is my first post in this subreddit and i dont really know how to go about this. to give some background, last year i was in the worst relationship i ever had. my partner was severely mentally and emotionally abusive, and has left me with severe trust issues and easily triggered flashbacks, panic attacks, and many issues in general. we were only together for a little over half a year, but in that time they caused a lot more damage than i thought was possible. ive had some time to heal, but i still have not gotten over most of the pain from being in that relationship. i had to experience being taken advantage of mentally, emotionally, and sexually by someone who did everything they could to convince me that they needed to be dependent on me for those things in our relationship, and that if i didnt upkeep with all of their needs and wants then i was a bad partner that didnt want a relationship with them. i was manipulated, harassed, and guilted into a heavily sexual relationship with them that i was then gaslit into believing i had asked for and actively sought after. i then was informed that they had been cheating on me for most of our relationship while we were slightly long distance, and when i broke up with them, they decided they needed to be in constant contact with me so that we could ""stay close"". this ended in me cutting contact with them after having to be ""on call"" for them for 2-3 weeks after we broke up, as they were guilting and threatening me with suicide when i expressed wanting them to leave me alone. for a period of 9 months after my ex and i went no contact, i really believed that i wasnt going to find love ever again. i began to see a therapist, but felt useless and unloveable for a while after my ex was out of my life. i stopped seeing my therapist in the beginning of the summer when i finally was feeling satisfied enough with myself. 2 months later, i began dating a close friend of mine when we realized that we were rather compatible. we fell in love pretty quickly and we're still dating. we are a very new couple, and have only been together for a couple of months, but we have known each other for about 2.5 years. however, i still feel echoes of my last relationship when we do couple-y things. at a sleepover for our friend group, we shared a bed together, (completely nonsexual without even the slightest bit of intention) and i thought it would feel good to be able to sleep next to my kind, sweet partner i loved so much. however, when i was in the bed with them, i began to feel sick as i remembered a time i attempted to share a bed with my abusive partner, only for them to turn it into a sexual thing with our friends sleeping in the same room. i began to have a panic attack so bad that i couldnt move much except limited motion in my neck, head, legs, and eyes. my partner, who i assumed was sleeping next to me, had their arms around me while i was unable to breathe &amp; suffering from this anxiety attack. the attack left me weak and confused and i couldnt remember or even identify who i was in bed with, so i wanted them to get off of me. my brain began to repeat to me that my partner didnt love me, and that everything was going to turn out the same way as my last relationship. i began to feel so sick i couldnt even hold my partner anymore. luckily, they were still awake and noticed that i had my eyes open wide and was staring straight ahead at nothing. they tried to ask me if anything was wrong and to tell them what i was thinking about, but i couldnt even move my mouth or get any sound out. they stayed awake comforting me until i felt i could tell who they were, where i was, and speak again, and then i had to sit up to breathe and cry and tell them that i was terrified to be in a relationship again because i was already in a lot of pain about possibly losing them or them only pretending to care about me. they reassured me everything was alright and calmed me down to the point where i could lay down and we fell asleep together. 
my partner is really wonderful, but i hate feeling like the responsibility of others'. i still kind of feel like i am too messed up in the head to be dating them, and that i dont want them to see me as a manic person that cannot fend for themself. im certain they dont see me this way, but i still feel sick about being in a relationship with them. i dont feel like ill ever really be able to believe them when they tell me that they love me or trust them fully in general. they havent done anything to justify me feeling like that, but i cant shake the feeling that something horrible is going to happen and that im going to lose my best friend and love of my life. thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: im insecure about my current relationship because of my last one, and recently suffered a violent panic attack about it that left me feeling sicker and less familiar with them for reasons beyond their control.",20Oct2019,1

I have tried asking them why they do that in private; it causes them to angry and then they take it out on me in others ways.

I have tried mentioning a couple times in discussion that I thought of it:   
""Oh yeah, the idea I thought of last week might work.""   
""The idea I told you about last week? Sure. I'll explain it again.""   
But I feel lame, like I'm leaning into narcissism, which I deal with daily and never want to espouse. I don't want to morph into a narcissist, and it gets so....tiring....  


Then there are times I just let them take the credit....  I don't want the arguments and don't want to waste my efforts when I know it will be futile... 

Or, I just don't talk to them... and watch my words....Again all this vigilance because of the circumstance is tiring.... I feel like I have to put up barriers and walls and live in a fort.  Defend. Defend. Defend...Why do people feel the need to take credit for other people's work and ideas? What is there to gain but make enemies and look like a fool? lol I just will never understand this mindset.  


If I'm real honest, I feel like I'm mishandling it all...  
And am no saint, who smiles at every wrong or has mature thoughts about letting it go and being above the fray...though I try....  
I hate that people take my ideas and work and label at theirs but worse that they start telling others that I'm a waste of space....because I didn't do the said work or think of any ideas to help....

859,"I'm very lost at this point and am trying to navigate consent and intentions.

Rape by deception is a situation in which the perpetrator obtains the victim's consent to engage in sexual intercourse or other sex acts, but gains it by deception or false statements or actions. 

Logically speaking, could ulterior motives also be assault by deception?

First example, between the ages of 17-19, I gave some women hugs, with consent. However, I really just wanted to feel their breasts against my chest. Which is gross and creepy. But assault?

Secondly, I wanted to touch my girlfriend's breasts. I asked her if I could feel her heartbeat by touching her breasts. She said yes. I really wanted to feel them for sexual gratification.

Are both of these examples of assault changed by intentions? Or is it the act of me being gross and creepy?

860,"I am considering the pros and cons of moving out of my parent’s house before graduating university (3rd year student, 24 years old). The main factors are my mental health and my financial well-being.

I am fortunate enough that my parents are willing to let me live at home rent-free until I am done with school but honestly it’s been getting to the point where living with them is extremely draining my mental health. As many parents are, they have certain expectations for me and my siblings and have a lot of conservative viewpoints which don’t align with mine (I can accept their input but it’s incredibly frustrating to have a conversation with them without just biting my tongue and not saying anything). 

I don’t feel like they care about what I have to say or that I’m struggling mentally. I’ve dealt with some abuse in the past (not from them) and they’re not very supportive about my anxiety and depression to begin with. 

Generally, I’m a happier person in 2019 than I have been in the past but I’m still working on some issues. 

I just ended a several year relationship because we were drifting apart and communication between us hasn’t been as frequent as it once was. It felt like a one-sided relationship. Surprisingly I feel like I’m doing okay emotionally but the stress of home life and school is more of a burden for me than everything else. I have a small number of close friends but as I’m getting older I notice these people are becoming more distant and I am noticing that I am lacking human connection since the breakup. Instead, I realize that I’m feeling alone and socially isolated in my household of four other people.

I commute over an hour to get to school and go back but if I were to move out I would be able to live a lot closer. I could save time this way, but I would also have to work a lot since rent in my area is more expensive than I’d like. I have worked in the past when I was going to college but the distance from my university leaves me drained every day (2.5+ hours of commuting every day) and then I must deal with my stressful parents and siblings on top of that. I get some alone time every day but I feel like most of it is just me recovering from my fatigue. I don’t think I can work too much while living at home although I am in the slow interview process of a part-time job that will be less stressful than other jobs I've had in the past.

Tuition is reasonably affordable and I can pay off a semester’s worth of tuition in a reasonable amount of time. My plan would be to work several shifts a week (maybe 3-4) and try to save as much as possible. I only started taking out student loans this year and I am trying really hard to minimize my debt. I am also okay with taking out more student loans in the future if necessary.

**From a financial point of view, the best idea is to stay at home until I’m almost done school to minimize my total debt. I would be taking a lighter course load per semester if I moved out to ensure that my financial situation doesn’t blow up on me. Although maybe I should go see a therapist which won't be cheap.**

**But on the other hand I’m just drained and stressed constantly and I feel like this part of my life is just a huge grind that I’m just trying to get through so I can get to the next stage of my life. I feel like a good chunk of my life is either being exhausted, mentally drained, or feeling disconnected from others.** 

My head knows that staying at home is probably the best option but I also feel like I’m wasting my youth being like this.",20Oct2019,2

I should note that I’m severely ill with M.E, Pots, and a brain tumor. Basically my immune system isn’t very good. 

I’m a paranoid person so I have to spit out my saliva because it feels like the mouthwash is in every corner of my mouth, and I’ve washed it with water afterwards because I regret using the listerine. 

It’s night time here, and I called my mom and she told me that they wouldn’t sell it if it was poisonous, and that I shouldn’t wake up my dad to ask about this. (I’m bedridden, so I can’t just wake him up) 



So I’m hoping my mouth washing-Reddit users can help me instead, my questions are: 
 
 • Should I swallow my saliva, even if I can taste the mouthwash still? (I know I sound like a crazy person, but I’m already so sick so I get scared about stuff that could potentially harm me, or send me to the hospital)

 • Also, doesn’t everyone accidentally swallow a bit of mouthwash every time they use it? They say ‘contact a doctor if you swallow it’, but what amount are they referring to exactly? (Since I still got many symptoms by just swallowing a small amount of it)

 • My tongue and my whole mouth swells up every time I use mouthwash (some toothpastes as well), and it feels like my whole mouth is burning.. is that just me?

That was less questions than I thought, but I guess that’s all..

I grew up a spoiled kid, I've done my best to be a better person.  A big problem I face is when I run into something that doesn't go into my favor I get super depressed.  A big example is my recent desire to buy a car.  I test drove one and pretty much fell in love with it.  My credit history is ok but it's very fresh so I have to have someone cosign.  Dad declined to do so mostly because He believes I'd be better off just putting money in savings for now.  I definitely understand his reasoning and I'm obviously not gonna hold it against him.  The thing is now I absolutely feel bum fuck miserable about it.  Not just ""this sucks"" but borderline ""I don't want to live anymore"".

I know it's awful and selfish of me to feel this way and I want to do better.  I just don't know how to cope with stuff not going my way I suppose.",20Oct2019,4
878,"I'm just starting out college. I've been practically forced into enrolling, lest I be kicked out onto the streets with pretty much nothing. I'm only a month in and I'm very behind on pretty much everything. No matter what I do or what people tell me I just can't find any motivation good enough to actually kickstart me into doing everything. I try to drag myself through my work but that ends up causing more harm than good. I'm in serious need of some help.",20Oct2019,1

880,"I'm probably being scammed.

I tweeted out something about being in debt and was almost immediately hit up by three different men whose twitter profiles indicate they are looking for sugar babies or are philanthropists. So they obviously have some sort of keyword search alert set up. Their tweets are a mix of normal usage and hitting up other girls also offering financial assistance. Their accounts range from being created from one to nine years ago. 

I responded to their DMs and one said he would give me his banking and routing number to pay off my credit cards online. He doesn't want my password or my banking numbers. I have to assume this is a scam, but I also know a friend who legitimately is into fin-dom and men will give her money sometimes for nothing. No pics, no vids. They just get off on having some young woman spend their cash.

I don't think this is the case here, but there's 1% of me that is hopeful these dudes are just freaky fucks who want to jack off at the thought of a woman using their cash. I know, I know. I wouldn't even assume this was a thing if it wasn't for my friend who actually does get this treatment. 

I was wondering if anyone could specifically tell me what kind of scam could come from this situation where I have his supposed financial institution numbers and he doesn't have mine.",20Oct2019,2
