0,I am filling out a job application and there is a section that asks me to write a message to the hiring manager. Any suggestions of what to write??,24Oct2019,1
1,"Still a semi new poster- and i apologize for length. 

I’ve worked in a daycare center for almost 6 years now. Most of those years have been the best of my life. Not only have I formed unbreakable bonds with many families over the years; I am also a senior staff member, a lead teacher and up until the past few weeks, have been one of my directors “right hand men” if you will.  My director has struggled since she bought the business 5 years ago from the original owner who hired me. Myself and another girl, T have been by her side the whole time. She struggles with just about everything. But bottom line it’s been too long and everyone has grown tired of her laziness and excuses. Over the summer I attempted to resign, however my director insisted on meeting with me. So I met with her along with T, who has been the office manager now for the last few years, and we attempted to basically spell out everything for her that needed to be changed. T is the only
Reason the place is still running. The parents and staff all love and adore her and know that she does the job of many in her role as office manager. My director acted like she understood and agreed with the issues we had. She talked me into staying and giving it another chance. So I did. T went out on maternity leave in July. My director was In over her head and she came and offered me a raise to do not only my job, but also T’s until she came back. I juggled both jobs for a few months and did it well. My director was as usual falling short and not doing her own job. The staff is stressed. Parents are unhappy. T comes back a couple of weeks ago. A situation arises with T and the director which causes T to resign on the spot after 7 years of working there. It was a significant blow to the Staff and families. My director however brushed it off. She never spoke to me about it. 5 minutes after T quit she had another girl in her office for two hours with the door shut. (Another teacher, who’s been there a year) I then find out from other co workers she’s been offered a raise along with T’s job. I feel extremely sad and disappointed. Not only that T is gone but that my director seems to have overlooked the past 5 years and is starting to now treat me as if I am “new”. T resigned last Thursday and my director has not spoken to me since. I assume because she is well aware that T and I are best friends and she feels some guilt. I’ve interviewed at another center. Pay is fine. Benefits,which aren’t offered at my current center. But I struggle severely with change. I know the obvious answer is go to the new job. I’m afraid though. Leaving my friends, my kids at work. This center has been my life for so long. My director is not easy to talk to, and with T by my side it was so much easier. Do I jump ship? Or do I stay and try to stick it out? If you’ve read this far thank you. I appreciate it.",24Oct2019,1
3,"Alright so I've found myself in the predicament where I like two guys. I don't want to give too many details for personal and privacy reasons so I apologize. We're going to call them Sy and Ay respectively. I've come to be good friends with both of these guys. At first, I only liked Sy, and it seemed like he liked me too. In fact, he even said he could see us as being more than friends. Awesome, right? Well during that time, I had been getting to know Ay a lot better. He's a lot of fun to be around and in all fairness I've gotten more chances to hang out with him outside of school. The thought of liking Ay never actually crossed my mind until maybe a week and a half ago when Sy suddenly disappeared. He didn't answer my texts, hasn't showed up to class, nothing. I've missed him really badly, especially since it was so obvious to everyone and their mother just how well we get along. Currently I'm struggling because Ay is such a cool guy and I really enjoy hanging out with him but I still really like Sy and I just want to know if he's okay but I haven't heard from him at all. What the Hell should I do???",24Oct2019,1
4,I’m currently in my first semester of freshman year of college and i hate it. I have friends here and we drink every weekend and go to the football games but it’s not making me feel happy. I’m currently in a major than I’m sucking at and i miss my home. I miss my family and hometown friends. Should i keep going to college since i know it’ll benefit my future?

5,"When I was a young girl, I did not pay much attention to lectures and I was always confused because I didn’t understand specific materials,why I needed to learn or the benefits of learning. Until I entered middle school, my parents  advised  me to focus on my grades for a brighter future. I dedicated my time to math rather than English class because I thought math was such a fun and interesting class (still is.) English class as a subject felt like a chore, boring and time wasting. I was told that Highschool years weigh HEAVILY. Then in my freshman year in Highschool, I like to say that I worked my butt off in every class. I also still focused mainly on math but I also started  look on the bright side of English class. I self picked books that sounded interesting from different genres and read them. I also had to write a 4 short paragraph essay about immigration and crossing the Pros and Cons about crossing the Mexican boarder into the United States. I instead wrote a 5 page essay. I learned about Shakespeare, read Romeo and Juliet, touched on World war ll and the holocaust, and read a book called Night by holocaust survivor (one of the best books I read, you should definitely check it out :) ). I soon started to realize that English class wasn’t actually that bad. In my freshman year, I joined a spring sport and I actually had friends that I can socialize with because they were my friends since middle school and where in most of my classes. I was also a Honor student at my highschool. 
Now, I am in my sophomore year in highschool and I’ve been struggling with getting my work done. I don’t know exactly what the problem is but I just lost interest in everything. I am struggling to keep focused on school and leaving class work to the last minute. I have a pile of assignments that are sitting there waiting to be finished. Everyday feels like I am carrying a 300 pound bag on my back and all I want to do is go home and sleep all day. My friends from last year, I don’t communicate with, I also sit alone at lunch since my friend moved to a different school (I don’t really mind sitting alone but I like company). I don’t really have anyone and I have noticed that I have been really awkward towards people. I begin to go to fall practices  for softball almost everyday after school for 2 hours so I get better at the sport.A  day after I feel extremely exhausted and soar. 
Are there anyways I could do to motivate myself to get things done so I don’t repeat this habit and possibly end up doing it the rest of my highschool years?",24Oct2019,1
6,"So I know that this may not be as serious as other things on this subreddit, but it's kinda got me down.

&amp;#x200B;

So I and a few friends decided we were going to declare our highschool independent from Canada (I know, kinda stupid but it was more for fun than anything) after our first election my rival party won. He's a nice guy so It's not all that bad. However his vice president has just contacted me saying that he wants to hold an election in 2 weeks (right after the 1st election happened) I said no, then showed him the part of the constitution that said a new leader would be selected every 2 months. He then exclaims that his party has forced the current leader to resign through 'violent' means. I told him that just by saying that he had voided any opportunity for his party to run. He then announces that another election would take place in 2 weeks (Never even contacted the ALC; who are basically like a congress or parliament), He said that the current leader had resigned even though that was ***not*** the case.

I contact the leader, we join forces in a joined government and tell this guy that we accept his challenge, he then says that he wants to start his own nation and write his own constitution, because the original had ""too many rules"" (he then goes on about how popular he is, which for the record is true, and that our country would become less popular)

(Please do note, however, that I am very popular with nerd and people who actually care and put time into this project) 

He then goes ""EVERYTHING YOU GUYS WORKED ON IS NOT REAL AND GONE""

And here I am thinking, yeah... it's not real, and for a guy that says I take this to seriously hes taking it pretty freaking seriously.

Anyways... I intend on letting him do his thing and write his own constitution so that we can continue to work and have fun with people who are actually serious about the 'mock' politics part of the deal, what are your thoughts?

7,"Tomorrow I have senior pictures... and I’m super nervous. I’m not happy with the way I look but I don’t want to change it to where I’m unrecognizable. I’m bald and fairly gender non-conforming (afab) and my Mom wants me to do a full face of make up and wear a wig... she told me “she doesn’t care what I do” but then guilted me hard core. She told me “I know you’re in this... ret*rded gender fluid phase” (which, for clarity, I’m not, I’m just gender non-conforming) but that I need to really think about how I’m going to look.  I don’t know if I want to wear a wig and full makeup or not. I’m not unhappy with the fact I’m bald, I’m just unhappy about my overall appearance. If I wear a wig and full makeup I will be unrecognizable, like how at homecoming people didn’t know that I was, well, ME. I don’t know what to do. I don’t hate being in a wig and full makeup, but I want these photos to be... of me? My Mom keeps telling me that “this is the photo that will follow you forever” and honestly thinking about that makes me want to cry and sick to my stomach. I can’t push this back any further because the pictures are due by the 30th. I’m so stressed out, my Mom and I are fighting now, and I don’t know what to do for my pictures and which are in a little over 12 hours.",24Oct2019,1

At the time, I went along with those dreams, but now I can't seem to feel the same spark between us that we used to have. I know it's not fair for her, because she has done nothing wrong, she's been really supportive and caring; I don't want to break her heart, but I don't want her living an illusion either. 

She has abandonment issues due to her father leaving her before she was born, so me breaking up with her could add on to that feeling of not being worthy of being loved and possibly make her go back to the depressive state she used to be in. But I know that keeping this relationship going is not fair for me either, I can't keep a one-sided relationship.

17,"Okay, so Yesterday at around 11 p.m I got a friend request from a guy. I accepted it and like 20 minutes later he inboxed me. He sends me the wave icon, so I sent it back. He didn't respond until like 6:30 in the morning. He sent me a reply saying ""Hii"". I then responded like 4 hours later. The thing is we have been talking all day. At some times we would text consecutively but sometimes he would respond like 30 minutes after because he was at work. As I looked at his facebook profile, I kind of found him familiar. We had actually gone to middle school together, and right now I am in my last year of college. He kept messaging me all day which I guess made him interested in me I would think. I kind of cut off the conversation like 30 minutes ago because I had to do homework lol. I don't know if he will message again but if he does should I go through with it. The thing is for his work he goes to different places so he travels. Sometimes he comes back to our hometown. I know I might be taking it to an extreme but if something, were to happen between us, should I go for it. The thing is I have trust issues and I never open myself to meeting guys.

20,"Hello. This is a weird question to pose to the internet, but I'm not sure what to do here. 

I am assigned female at birth, I get read as assigned female at birth in public. Have I always presented this way? No. I identified as FTM transgender in high school and college, and eventually socially detransitioned (never did hormones) as I went to therapy and discovered that some trauma that caused me to react in this way. **This is NOT to say that ALL transgender people have this experience, but I am speaking solely from my own perspective here please do NOT use me as a scapegoat for transphobia**.  

For the most part, I am happy. I wear what I want, whether that be men's clothes or women's clothes, and overall I feel comfortable with my presentation. The issue comes really when specific instances of what I describe as ""unavoidable gendering"" come into play. Examples include, being called a girlfriend, referring to myself as a professional woman, and most notably, being called Ms. 

I've taught students in the past in settings that were more casual, where I could simply request that I be called by my first name--and I used to joke that being called Ms made me feel old. This played out okay, and I avoided the term for many years. 

However, I start a job soon that's more intensive, where I have to fit into how the other staff members are called, and the titles are always **Mr/Ms** *first name*. I don't know what to do here. It makes me **so** uncomfortable to be called Ms, but I can't switch to the other side of it either and be called Mr because I'm not transgender. I don't feel like I can just throw the whole context apart and ask for my name to be different because of my comfortablity, because I understand why the format for the staff names exists, but I don't know what to do.

Are there ways of getting rid of that crawly feeling when someone points out your assigned gender? I know this is the weirdest question for those who don't think about this, but I do think about it and I really would like to not, specifically in this setting. I want to enjoy my new job and I don't want to be that person who tries to destablize an entire setup for my personal comfort, so I want to learn how to make myself more comfortable. 

Thanks in advance.",24Oct2019,1

23,"Imma try to keep this short and get to the point. We are opposite genders (this will be important later) My best friend, I knew him for about a year and a half before this happened- I know this may seem a little early to call him my best friend, but we'd spend literally every waking moment together- we would video call literally 24/7, and I don't know about him to me, but I know and that period of time he was my ride or die. We were in the middle of a video call in early March of 2019 when I told him I was gonna go to go play games with another friend and...that was it. I honestly don't know if I am an asshole or something and I just don't know it. The next time I saw him irl I tried to talk to him but he was rather cold and standoffish, and when I tried to start conversation he'd use the phrases ""So?"" or ""I don't  care."" Everytime I'd be talking to a mutual friend ours (also a boy) he would swoop in, interrupt our conversation, start talking about something he knew I didn't have any interest in and get really touchy with that person, as if to say ""Haha, look how close I am with this person... we're practically brothers. You can't do this."" We are in middle school so you can imagine what would happen if I tried to do anything of the sort. Then he'd walk off with them whilst maintaining eye contact with me. I had a pretty severe depression, around this time, (I still do,but now I'm on Prozac and therapy, I got help) most of my thoughts were of suicide, so you can imagine how this only sent me over the edge, most of the time I couldn't find a reason to get out of bed. Its 2019 October now and we have had a few positive interactions- he's not so cold to me anymore. But he is keeping me at an arms length- so now I'm wondering how to revive our friendship.

I thought I had gotten over her but I see her all the time since she works at my school. I saw the dude she left me for and the dude was jacked and handsome and I admitted felt pretty betrayed and jealous. I see her and occasionally stop and chat with her and she seems genuinely sorry but when I'm alone I can only think about how she just left me with nothing but hurt. I know people just say time heals all but it's been too long with this emptiness and depression about how it ended. Please help.",24Oct2019,1

40,"It's a very real possibility that my parents will kick me out in the near future. I currently don't have a job, and my funds are very limited. Normally I wouldn't be all that worried about any of this. There are resources out there to help people in such a situation, and I'm sure it wouldn't take long for me to find work. I'm not afraid of fending for myself. The problem is that I wouldn't be fending for myself; I'd have a dog to support.

I've had this dog since he was a puppy. He's my best friend. The thought of giving him up hurts me. He's the main reason I haven't killed myself already. But how am I supposed to care for him when I have nothing? I don't think homeless shelters allow dogs. Are there a lot of rooming opportunities out there for someone who is poor and has a dog? There's nobody out there who will take me in. He's all I've got.

Am I being selfish? Would it be best for me to give him to someone with the means to give him everything he needs?",24Oct2019,1

42,"So I was in class with this girl who I’m friendly with. Not best friends but we always seemed to have the same classes and because of our names sat right next to each other. One day she was talking to me and somehow she brought up that she was having a party. Almost, jokingly, she asked if I wanted to go. I think everyone sees me as a “pretty boy” or a “good boy”, being that I really don’t drink that much, or even at all. That’s what I took it at least. So then I countered sarcastically saying , “ah funny, because I don’t go to parties.” I definitely kept it light-hearted. She then totally dropped any humor and said “no, you can come, of course.” Still keeping it light-hearted. I said “really” and she said “yeah”. So I was pretty psyched, but I did my best to keep my composure. So because of that, Idk if she was being serious or not. That’s the first problem. Second is that I’m pretty friendly with about half her friend group. The other half I don’t know that much, but they’re all part of a big group of kids that constantly parties and has fun and all. Not necessarily a bad group of kids, they don’t even have a record of being bad, but it’s just my view of them, being, again, that I’m a “good” boy. I don’t think there would be a problem with me going, especially with one of my better friends going, and I had fun and the last party I went to. Should I go? Why or why not?",24Oct2019,2
43,"Hi,
So I had invisalign a few years ago... my mom died soon after my invisalign was finished and I never ended up getting a retainer. I decided to bite the bullet and go back to the same well-regarded orthodontist to get the retainer I should have gotten previously.

The office manager, I'll call her Lucy, was extremely nice and friendly. When I finished my fitting and was about to give her my check for the retainer she made a motion with her hands and said ""don't worry about it."" I was extremely surprised and checking with her, I was like ""really?"" And she said ""yes"" 

I was extremely happy about this lucky gift. Cut to two weeks later, a bill for the retainer arrives. I call her, asking what happened. She confirmed that I understood her the first time, that she meant to give it to me for free and said I should email her a picture of the bill and she would take care of it, which I did. I didn't hear back.

A couple weeks later, another bill arrives. I call her back AGAIN and she says ""look, I was trying to do something nice because I like you. Because the cost was already entered into the system, I can't remove it. Do you think you can pay some of it?"" She was very pleasant when she said this and I said, ok, I can pay some of it &amp; paid $100 out of the $425.

Cut to a couple weeks later and I GOT ANOTHER BILL. WTF.

What do I do at this point? What is wrong with this woman, is she incapable of fully owning up to a mistake? Does she get off on doing nice things for people that end up being totally empty???",24Oct2019,1
44,"I’m Male 182cm tall lanky slim framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin. And most  girls treat me like shit despite the fact they need makeup to look attractive yet they have that ‘ewwww how dare you even look at me’ attitude on them if I do. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",24Oct2019,0
45,"Hello, i'll try to make this as short and simple as possible so that i won't bore anyone here.

During this whole time she met my best friend and they ocassionaly make out and they have this big sexual tension between them.

The thing is i really don't want anything serious with this girl anymore, but i still feel really really down whenever i see her making out with my friend, i just feel all my efforts where in vain and then someone just popped out of nowhere and scored...makes me feel like a really big failure and i tend to start treating her like shit and she notices and also feels bad.

47,"Ok, so I have a whole story, so just sit tight.

So the first week back to school in my last class of the day (creative writing) we did an assignment where you had to start a story, then you would pass your paper around and the next person had 30 seconds to write the next part. After a couple turns, the stories were really weird, and I got mine back, which started out about a girl wandering through the forest, and it had a part about making hot pockets for the boys when they got back from seeing endgame (that’s how long ago this was lol).  As I read it aloud, I looked around the room and a guy (17m) was saying sorry and it was really funny. At the end of class he was saying sorry he wrote that, but I said it was fine, it made the story more interesting.

Later on, our school had the first football game on a Friday, and since I’m in yearbook, I had to interview people. Since I was afraid to ask a total stranger, I asked him. That Monday, I was sitting alone in creative writing since my friend was sick, and he cane and sat by me. He got my snap. That night he texts me telling me I’m pretty and we start talking. The rest of that week was pretty weird, we didn’t talk and avoided eye contact pretty intensely. The next week after that, we start texting ALOT. I’m really awkward so, we had more text convos than in person ones lol.

He would text me while in other classes and on the weekends and stuff, and sometimes he would sit by me in creative writing. We started becoming friends and it was really nice. He would tell me about a lot of things. We weren’t super close, but it was definitely the start of a good friendship.  One day we decide we’re going to twin out and dress the same, and we did and it was amazing. He wore my bow thing for spirit day, and we had a lot of fun, but after that it started going away.

He hasn’t really talked to me or texted me in a WHILE, and I want that to come back. I don’t know what happened or if I did something, but he just kinda stopped talking to me. We still say something, usually a short sentence about something, yesterday he said we should twin out again, today I asked him about something. But still, I liked our new friendship, it was fun. 



I just want advice on how to get close with him again, and how to have and start a good conversation. I really want help. On Wednesdays I can sit with him at lunch, but sometimes he’s doing other stuff. I don’t know what to say, and i don’t know if I should ask him about if we’re friends or not.

I feel like the last straw was when they COMPLETELY ignored me. After school, we meet up after class and walk to the bus together. Some days, they walks past and says “I have to go somewhere else” and I’ll go off on my own. But they just walked past me, bae in arms. They looked at me, didn’t even smile or wave, and just kept walking.

Basically, I go to an all boys secondary school (or highschool, whatever you call it) which isn't the best starting point for meeting girls. Couple this with my social anxiety and toxic friend group I used to have, and I basically had no interaction with real people for my teen life, let alone girls.

I turned to online dating at the time and while this let me learn one or two things about like treating people right I don't count it all as anything that meaningful in real life.

In the last few years I got a lot better friends and I've been going outside way way more. But I just noticed how unnatural I am around people because of it. Like most people have SOME form of experience with a girl and I'm afraid that my lack of that will let me down later in life. Will I lose out on dating opportunities in college? Will I even get as far as a date? What if I end up being so bad even if I do get a date she just moves on to somebody else? 

Idk just spitballing here but I really think I need some advice on if I'm way too far gone or if this shit happens often. Like I'm the kind of person that values companionship a lot and I've been looking for something serious for ages. Please, give any advice you can. Thank you for reading.

57,"My boyfriend (27m) and I (29f) have been having some issues lately, stemming from a severe lack of trust on both sides.  I went through his phone, he went through mine.  I saw no evidence of cheating.  He saw that I had told multiple people a secret of his that he did specifically tell me not to tell anyone.  It was a huge secret and I am well aware that it was NOT my secret or my place to tell.   This breach in trust happened about 2.5 years ago, and he just found out about it about 3 weeks ago.   We've been dating for a bit less than 3 years.  He also recently had asked me if I ever told anyone this secret, to which I lied, saying ""no"".   I'm very unhappy with myself.  I am disappointed in what this says about my character, and this event has caused me to severely look inside myself and reassess the kind of person I am.   That being said, my boyfriend refuses to talk to me about it.    He is all but ignoring me, says he wants to work it out but shows no effort to do so.  Says he doesn't want to leave but shows no signs whatsoever of wanting to stay.   I have apologized profusely but he says that this breach of trust basically negates our entire relationship and he can't believe that I'm even sorry. 

My question is this: 
How long do I give him before saying enough is enough and getting on with my life?   I am the one in the wrong here, but I am also trying hard to become a better person, including therapy and medication changes.

I also just shaved everything down there a few days ago which i heard can cause pimples and ingrown hairs and thats a lot what it looks like. Also it doesnt itch burn or hurt or anything. It started off as a bump that looked like a razor bump or ingrown hair and then i had sex after and the bump kinda turned into a pimple.

Is it just a really really bad coincidence? I’m freaking out really bad and cant go to a doctor or anything. Other than that theres no symptoms it just looks like a pimple and nothing else and just one single ingrown hair/pimple. Also it showed up a few days after shaving everything down there.

My intuition tells me they're supposed to be destroyed. If I can do this and learn how to get to where I can ask someone out without coming off like a creep, I'll have nothing but suave.",24Oct2019,1
75,"I’ve grown extremely close to this girl I met some time ago. We never go a day without texting, and we’ve shared many personal things with each other. We regularly say “I love you”, and call each other hot and stuff like that (not a relationship, kinda complicated). We rarely call each other, but we’ll text all day. I don’t call her much because I can be awkward. We usually ask before calling the other person, I’ll add. The thing is, I only say “I love you” and stuff like that over text. My question is, would it be rude to make an unsolicited call to her, to tell her that I love her? She doesn’t hate phone calls, we talk a lot, but I feel like it would be more heartfelt if I told her with my own voice, instead of an iMessage. Would it come off as weird if I did this?

I wouldn’t call her like that at night, of course. I’d do it at a reasonable time.",24Oct2019,1

77,"People of the internet, I could really use some help/support/advice. Please. I don't know how I got to this point in life. I am no longer happy. I spend most of my time just reminiscing on my childhood, wishing I could go back for even a single day. There is no color in my world, just dark, lonely greyness. I want more than anything to be happy!

I have no college degree, just lost my job, my apartment, have never been in a serious relationship (still a virgin), and have a small group of friends that continues to get smaller. It seems life is passing me by and I'm just...frozen in place.

I grew up in a very religious family and was homeschooled throughout my entire childhood (5-18). I am a shy person by nature, but due to my sheltered childhood, I have severe social anxiety. I feel like I just can't relate with other people. I've tried to make friends, but always seem to have nothing to say. My mind just grinds to a halt.

The only friends I've ever had were from church growing up. I am no longer religious, far from it actually -- now being an atheist. I'm glad I've discovered myself in that regard, but it feels like I've left a HUGE part of my life behind. My relationships with my family and friends have suffered since. 

My support group is dwindling. My family and I love each other, but we just can't relate anymore. I used to be close with my cousins as a kid, but they've all moved on with life, most of them being married and having kids now. It's like I'm the only one still at the station, waving goodbye to a train long past. I missed the ride to adulthood.

I want to go back to school and finish my degree, but struggle with depression and anxiety. Everytime I think about going back to school, I have a major panic attack. I feel so unprepared for the academic challenges, because I've forgotten mostly everything I studied before. I can't just dive right in, I'd have to review highschool level curriculum and work my way back up. 

I tried therapy for my anxiety and depression, but it wasn't working and I couldn't keep up with the cost. I would try it again, but I'm afraid finances will make it extremely difficult since I don't have insurance. I have enough savings to live for a couple months and that's it. I could try to get a new job, but my anxiety, stress, and depression was the reason I lost my previous job.

I've thought about taking medication, but I don't want to become reliant on something. I've also heard they cause numbness to everything. I don't want to be numb, I want to laugh, love, cry. I want the ups and the downs. I always think about death, but don't think I would ever commit suicide. I don't want a bad reaction to medication change that.

I've always worried about finances as well, which is also part of the reason I didn't go back to school. I hate the idea of getting into more debt. If I go to school, I WILL need to get loans. I currently live in Texas and hate it. I really want a change in scenery after being here for most of my life, but I don't think I can afford out-of-state tuition. Besides, I would be leaving whatever support group I have left. And that scares me.

I spend so much time thinking about options and formulating plans, but then I overthink everything and tear every option apart. Although I've always been adverse to change, I used to be motivated and determined. I would break out of my comfort zone. Now, I'm just a sad, pathetic coward, not wanting to move in any direction out of fear of making the wrong choice. I'm making zero progress right now.

I'm stuck playing catch up with everyone else my age. I try not to compare myself, but how can I not?

I just want to pick myself up and LIVE. Not be alone, but with people I care about and who care about me. How can I get out of this seemingly endless rut? Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice. I hate being so negative and I'm sorry this was so long, but I really needed to vent. I need help.



TLDR: Feeling lost and left behind in life. Have no job, no apartment, no friends, and have never had a real relationship (still virgin). Struggle with debilitating depression and anxiety. Tried therapy, didn't help. Want to finish college, but mental health is getting in the way. Afraid of making the wrong move, which is stopping any progress. Need advice on how to move forward. Please!",24Oct2019,2

80,"So a little background story, when I was maybe eight or nine, (five/four years ago. I'm 13 now), my sister, who was two years older than me, showed me a bunch of creepy and paranormal things like videos, stories, images, ect. and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I cried several nights after recalling the stories and images vividly. After that, I went through an extreme paranoia phase that lasted for about a year or so. 


I was paranoid of almost everything in the house but mostly the more open spaces and hallways. I was terrified of someone demonic standing downstairs in my dad's office which he always left the light off to and the door open. I would fear that that person/thing would come running after me and chase me through the house until I knew I was safe. So I ran. 


I recently moved my bedroom to the downstairs room which is also on the same hallway as my dad's office, the one I was paranoid of specifically. 
Everything was fine for the first few months when we were still in the process of moving things over. My parents had bigger focuses around the house due to a baby on the way so they did not work on my room for a long duration of time. 


We rearranged my room about a week ago and moved my bed over parallel to the wall it was against previously. Nothing much. I was certain that I would love the way I had been planning my room to look for the past few months. However, when I got it the way I wanted it, I disliked it and I still do for unknown causes. The night that I was going to sleep in the bed for the first time since it had been moved, I was walking through that hall and upstairs when I, out of the blue, had this feeling of extreme paranoia again. Very familiar feeling but it threw me off guard. Again, I was terrified of that girl standing in the doorway of my dad's dark office. I bolted up the stairs in fear and worry like I used to. I stopped in the kitchen and hastily looked behind me, confused. I had not felt that feeling in years. 


That night, I slept with a light in the hallway on as well as a small light in my room, which is something that I NEVER do. I can't sleep with lights on. 


The past few days I've felt wary of my room and the hallway and I'm seriously considering moving my bed back to where it was originally. 


I am just very confused as to why this would happen again and what would cause it. Any advice or ideas as to why this would happen is greatly appreciated. 


TL;DR- I had a paranoid phase as a child but came out of it a few years ago. I haven't been extremely paranoid for those few years until I recently rearranged my bedroom. I don't understand why that would trigger my paranoia again.",24Oct2019,1
81,"I’m actually embarrassed admitting this considering I’m a 26yo woman, but I’m genuinely hurt.

My best friend of 14 years and I have been inseparable since middle school. A little over a year ago, she started hanging out with a coworker she met and brings her whenever our friend group goes out on the weekends. I have no problems with this other girl at all, we get along great. But lately, they stopped inviting me places. We haven’t hung out in over a month and she almost never responds to my texts anymore. But she’s always posting pictures of them and my friends house with captions like “with my best friend” or something. I asked her if I did anything to upset her and she said “of course not”. I obviously didn’t want to make it a big deal, so I just said okay. 

But here’s the thing. My boyfriend asked me my ring size recently and had the future talk. So I know he’s going to propose in the near future. My best friend and I always promised that we would be each other’s MOH. She knows I would pick her. But I’m not sure she would do the same for me now. And if she did, she would probably have me share the spot with the other girl.

I know this all seems so petty, especially at my age. But you can’t help how you feel. But I don’t know what I should do. Should I just accept that we aren’t as close as I thought we were and just let it fade? Or just suck it up and deal with it like an adult?",24Oct2019,5

I'm starting to realize I need help and I need it soon, but I can't tell my parents there is just something stoping me from telling them.

I feel trapped, I told one of my friends all of my issues and how I almost killed myself and now they've gone and told other people, including the people who made me suicidal in the first place. I'm not sure how many people know, but someone who never talked to me and never really seemed to know I existed just walked up to me and made a joke about me being depressed and stuff like that all cause I told a friend who I thought I could trust how I was feeling.

92,"I was wondering today about how you actually tell apart between people who are projecting their own insecurities on you (tell you bad traits about you that are in fact theirs) versus the people who don't project a thing and are telling you things objectively for what they are.

In the first scenario a person probably should disregard them.

In the second a person should listen.

The problem is when you don't know how to differ these two: are there actually _external_ clues? I don't think internal ones are a good clue because even if we work on breaking our own biases there always will be an actual as5hat who will decide to tell us we are piece of sh-t and make us believe it.

---

For the **context**,

I grew up with a single mother (as a F) with narcisstic controlling traits who disregarded my values every time and wasn't exactly a nice emotional/empathic person. 

For this reason I believe I tend to questions myself whether I am the wrong one as I cannot tell safely if they're not projecting. The other half of the reason is that we as people might often not know how we come across, so I like to be ""humble"" in a way by not disregarding their opinion completely.

I'd like to also add I never have this problem with friends, only with strangers - if it's my friends, we know each other well therefore it's unlikely they're projecting (they don't conjure up their reasoning for me being an as5hat out of nowhere) so it's not a trouble for me to know that they're right - while with strangers, I first jump into assumption that they're projecting (maybe as in self-defense), but not entirely as I remain _indecisive_ whether it is really just that.

My thoughts about the situation aside, I think I also relate/compare their harsh behaviour with the traits I saw in my 'narc' mum. If the person who is telling me I have bad traits being calm, they usually persuade me to see my true negative behaviour and I agree with them because they often reason rationally and make a sense. If the person who is telling me about my bad traits in a conflict (read: they are angry and not empathic), I become confused because I become emotional due to them being angry and second, I won't take them as seriously but I am always doubtful.

Sorry as I am contradicting myself in some parts, my thinking side goes to lalaland if ppl go too strong on me lol.

---

So the question is:

* Are there any strong indicators to see whether someone's projecting?

* I am evaluating my behaviour all the time so more introspecting won't probably help me, possibly for the worse as it's only making me feel more worthless/insecure the more I consider ""what if they're right"".",24Oct2019,1
94,"I started working a new job about two months ago, and I have liked it so far, though it is a relatively low-wage service job. Due to some kind of error on behalf of the HR department, I didn't receive a check for my first week of work. Once the issue was corrected, I received a check for my second week of work, but it didn't contain compensation for my first week.

I first spoke with my boss about about three weeks in after not getting the check, and she told me to contact the payroll department about the issue. When I did contact payroll, they told me that my boss needed to fill about a wage adjustment form.

She collected some information from me, which included sending screenshots of the scheduling platform we use via email. Two weeks go by without her contacting me, until she needs to speak with me again about something. I use that opportunity to ask her about my missing pay, and she said that she thought it was taken care of. After not hearing from her for two more days, I emailed the payroll department, and they confirmed that they didn't receive a wage adjustment form from my boss. I sent my boss a text to tell her this, and I don't hear back from her for a week, until my former supervisor is able to contact her for me and tell her to text me.

When I hear from her the next day, she tells me that the wage adjustment form didn't need to be submitted if the wages were ""directly added."" She then asked me how many hours I was missing, saying she would review them that night and add them to the current week, if needed. After reviewing, she tells me that while there was initially a delay, that my pay had been paid out on her end. She tells me that I need to check the app we use for payments to provide her with information, because she is unable to see it on her end. Interestingly, she send me a copy of this text word-for-word via email as well.

After giving her info from the app, she tells me that I will need to speak with payroll again to resolve the issue, but that I would not need a wage adjustment because the issue was on HR/payroll's end, not hers. She also tells me that she will try to contact someone in the department quickly to move it along, and tells me she will contact me tomorrow evening to touch base.

Now, this next part is where I think it gets kind of absurd. I don't hear from her the following night, so I text her the next evening to touch base with her, and she sends an exact copy of the message that she had sent me two nights ago over both text and email.

I was really baffled by this, so I just brought up her mentioning that she wanted to touch base last night, but I didn't hear from her, so I asked her if she wanted to do so regarding contacting someone at payroll. She sends me a short message saying that I was paid out on the 18th of August, and that I would have received the check on the 30th, and highlighted the fact that the screenshot I gave her showed that I was paid on the 30th. But as I had mentioned before, this was only for my second week of work. I again told her that this payment was only for the second week, not the first and second together.

That was two days ago, and I still haven't heard back from her. I emailed payroll again, and they just again told me that my boss needs to submit a wage adjustment.

I honestly have no idea what to do here, it seems like both my boss and payroll are just playing pass the buck to see if I just give up.",24Oct2019,1

I have become aware that she is now dating a man seriously who has been staying over at our family home. It bothers me that picture's of my dad are all over the house. His shaving bag is still on the counter. His clothes are still in the dresser.

I know I need to have a conversation with her about how I am feeling. But I'm just curious if anyone had been through this situation or how you went about eventually meeting the new spouse. Because its literally the last thing I want to do. And I don't think it's fair to the new person if I do with my current mindset. 

I can say at this time I am feeling that I am most protective of my son and I feel that since my biological dad was not given the chance to be a grandparent. It's not fair that someone else can try to fill that role. Might be thinking too long term...

99,"I can't think of a title concise enough to convey the issue. I tried for a little while and it ended up sounding lurid enough to be click-baity.

My attempt at a tl;dr: a mentally challenged woman moved in to the adjacent unit and set up her address wrong when she set up her electric. My wife and I have autopay set up and never look at our electric bill. We did not notice that they stopped billing us (scouts honor, we really didn't). Our landlord explained that our neighbor essentially kicked us off the service (our account for our address is still active) and that our landlord has a 850 dollar bill. They are taking their name off the account on the 1st, and we will be given a bill or lose our power.

This seems like legal advice shit, I agree, and I'll likely go there too. But there's an ethical aspect to this that I'm battling. I'll lay out everything, it's going to be a lot of text. It's pretty odd, and I've had a few so it might get colorful. Hopefully that is enticing enough to suffer through my bizarre situation.

My wife and I are irresponsible and childless adults. We both make okay money, we're poor but we're not broke. As such, all of our bills are automatic payments. Almost all of our bills are due within the first 2 weeks of the month. After that paycheck, we have to make rent, and the rest is for whatever. Our electricity is one of those bills. My hours are in constant fluctuation so my paycheck is as well, not by extreme amounts, but enough that 100 bucks plus/minus isn't a huge red flag.

A year ago we got a new neighbor. She is mentally handicapped (I don't know if that's offensive, I don't mean it to be if it is). Her disability is more relevant later. She apparently set up the wrong service address on her electricity account - our address. So we stopped getting bills. Our account is still active, oddly, but we have no bill, no due balance.. Nothing. We seriously didn't notice. I don't mean that in a ""look at our fat fucking pockets"" kinda way, more of a ""we are terrible adults"" kinda way.

I got this info from my landlord yesterday, who told me she's got an 850 bill that we'll be getting and that she's taking her name off the electric bill on Nov 1st (conveniently, since Nov 15th and they can't turn off someone's power). Looking at our previous bills, a year of electric would run us much more than 850. Our place is twice the size of our neighbors, and we are not energy conscious. I'm betting it's our neighbors bill.

If our neighbor is paying our electric, it's not our electricity that's getting turned off, it's hers. The woman who's been paying way more for her electric than she should is going to have her electricity turned off.

Our landlord demanded via text today that we contact the electric company or have our shit shut off. I can't tell if she knows that it's not ours that's at risk and is just hoping we get it figured out before she has to deal with our neighbor's case worker or if she is just an idiot. Both are equally likely.

The thing is, we don't have 850 to drop on a bill we just learned about yesterday. We certainly don't have 1500 to drop on what we more likely owe. We feel like we've just gotten fucked despite doing nothing wrong (knowingly). We didn't change anything but were being told to deal with a massive bill or lose our electricity (and heat, and hot water).

We doubt it's ours that's getting turned off. Maybe it is. But again, we have no bill. We're also not shitty people. And I feel like our landlord is asking us to pay our neighbors lower bill and then have the power company switch the service addresses after the fact because that's easier. Which benefits us a lot.. But is very shitty behavior. Trying to call attention to this shitty behavior will likely fuck us over financially. But it's the right thing to do. But we can't afford it. But I want someone to make my landlord stop being shitty..

I dunno. Fuck.

100,"So long story short, as the title says, I have evidence of intentionally ignored sexual misconduct, tax evasion, harassment, moral ineptitude, and to top it off, neglect of the animals he/she should be taking care of (numbering in the hundreds), of a very prominent social media figure / Sanctuary owner.

I would like to bring her down and expose her for the fraud and terrible human being this person is and I need to know the ramifications of doing something of this magnitude and how I should go about it.

From here on out I will be referring to this single individual as ""them"" or ""their""

Q &amp; A

Q. How do you know anything?

A. Not only did I work for them, but I worked with this person directly over the course of multiple months, and I worked with people who were in their inner circle taking care of their tax information.

Q. What evidence do you have?

A. I won't dive into to much detail as I don't want to reveal anything yet.

Q. Why do you want to do this?

A. Their neglect is putting the lives of the animals that are supposed to be being cared for at risk, as well as the lives of people untrained and unfit to be taking care of these animals, while siphoning money from benefactors by begging on Instagram and Facebook for ""donations"". They are allowing a sexual predator to work on the farm with female volunteers leaving them alone in big fields for hours at a time.

Its only been half of a semester in my new major, exercise science, but I genuinely miss the math-based work I was doing as an engineer.

105,"I'm graduating college in May with a degree that makes it extremely easy for me to find a decent job anywhere. I'm from a fair sized city on the east coast, where my school is also located. I've been doing clinical rotations for my degree this semester at another university hospital in a much smaller city that's about an hour away. I'm currently working part-time weekend nights at the university hospital in my home city, living with my parents, and commuting an hour to the city where my rotations are. So here's my dilemma:
        - The hospital I'm doing my rotations at (an hour away from my home city) is offering a $10k sign on bonus if you agree to work there for 2 years. Lots of positions are available and I may not have to work night shifts, but it's at the discretion of whoever hires me (probably will work evening/night).
        - I can continue working at the hospital I'm working at in my home city when I graduate as a full-time employee, but would not get a $10k sign on bonus. I most likely would work evening/nights here.
        - Pay/benefits/vacation time/working every 3rd weekend are essentially the exact same at both hospitals. The cost of living in both cities is exactly the same. My home city is a much bigger city with much more to do and is more convenient to destinations (beach, DC, mountains, etc.) The other city is in the mountains, but is generally farther from anywhere else I'd want to go. I do have a cousin who lives there and 2 of my friends from my classes will likely take jobs there. However in my home city, I have my parents, some longterm friends, and a guy I've been seeing exclusively for a few months (known him for years though). 

I really like the hospital in the other city, but during college I've been living at home with my parents and have just been looking forward to being an adult, living on my own, and going out in the city I'm from. I feel like the $10k sign on bonus is such a good deal, but I don't really want to live there. It's only an hour drive from home, which isn't bad. However, after a semester of commuting, it's something I'm not willing to do for an extended period of time (2 years) so I would have to live there. $10k would be a huge help to me financially, as I don't have a ton of money saved up. My parents also offered to let me live at home another 6 months or so rent-free when I graduate until I'm ready be on my own financially and so I can pay down my student loans. I also feel that moving away for 2 years would potentially mean an end to the relationship I just began, however, I don't want to feel like that's influencing my decision. I transferred schools partially because I wanted to be closer to my ex-bf and somewhat regretted the decision. I also did live in a small mountain town in my state before for a year and was not a fan. It's extremely conflicting.

He plans to leave home and kill himself so that his family will think he ran away. He does not attend college or have a job, and he lives with his grandmother who is close to death herself. When i visited him, he was smoking and drinking recklessly and bought a knife which he bluntly told me was for cutting himself. He also said if i try to take his knife or anything similar away from him, he will beat me up. He is much stronger than me, so i believe he easily could. I’ve known him for a while and i’d like to think we are close, and he’s never acted so aggressive before. My first instinct was to call  a hotline or something similar, but he has already stated that he would rather die than go to a mental facility or anything similar. Knowing him, calling authorities or a hotline and leading them to him would only result in him dying even faster. I have no doubt that if it came down to it, he would bash his own head against a wall until it killed him if he had no other method. I told his best friend about it even though he told me not to, because he’s the only person that my friend will listen to, but i don’t know if he will be able to help either.

109,"Hi everyone. I guess I should start by saying I’m a 22F and live in Canada. So when I was in middle school, I was offered the HPV shot but at the time, I really didn’t know what it was and I just said “I’m not gonna be sexually active for a long time, so I don’t want it” (I was a preteen/early teenager cut me some slack). Sadly, my parents accepted my refusal. 

Now, my doctor advised I get my HPV shot to help be protected against the virus and certain cancers so of course I said “yep no problem”. Well, not really no problem. I showed up to my appointment today and the nurse explained to me that because I am over 18, I would need to pay $210 for the vaccine and it’s three doses. If I remember right, she told me it was that price PER DOSE and I just can’t afford it right now. :( 

Does anyone have any advice for me or am I kinda just screwed until I can afford it? I’m SO angry at my teenage self for saying no to the vaccine at the time. I also only have one sexual partner and he’s been my only for 6 years. I know I’m still at risk regardless but thought that was worth mentioning.

114,"Long and rambling, on mobile 

Female, mid 30s, married 12 years with 2 kids.  I love my husband but we are in the trenches of raising kids and being tired and stressed out, and we rarely go on dates.  

I have worked with one of the same supervisors, a male, for 5 years.  I thought he was attractive physically and personality-wise early on, but very minor.  Over time, I have had to lean on him during difficult times at work and with my children, being vulnerable emotionally.  I even moved to a new job 3 years ago, and we shared a sad goodbye when I left.  Then the next year, he was transferred to my current location.  I honestly think of him as a good friend and can share just about anything with him:, work, children, or just being silly.  We usually text quite a bit during the day, about half work related stuff, half teasing and being obnoxious/silly.  

Until last week.  We had a serious conversation about where he might go after this year, and I was bummed to hear he might leave and told him so.  Fast forward a bit and the texts continued to be a little flirty, on both sides.  I messaged him over the weekend, said I was having difficulty with something at work and wanted to talk about it Monday.  I think he knew it was related to our conversations the previous week, but nothing was actually said to affirm that fact.  I actually avoided talking to him Monday, but Tuesday felt like I had to speak with him.  I have been thinking of him constantly, when I’m with my husband and kids and before I go to sleep and when I wake up.  It was affecting my thoughts at work.  We had to bring up the elephant in the room, right?  

Yesterday we sit down to talk.  Across the desk.  When I began, “So what is this exactly?” He tried to play it off as friends.  When I pressed him for more (“You talk to all your friends in this way?”) he admitted that he was being a little flirty.  And I responded that I liked it.  I knew I shouldn’t encourage him but I am so attracted to him now.  I have thought about what we might do together in the future, how upsetting this would be to my husband, how I was not even extremely upset at the idea of getting divorced.  We both admitted strong feelings for each other, even though we’re both married with great families and don’t want to mess that up.  But when he inquired about taking a break from talking, I told him that I didn’t really want to even though it was probably best.  He told me he had liked me for a long time, saying I am beautiful, smart, funny, and easy to talk to.  He also said that if circumstances were different he would want to see what this could become.  

Then today comes.  He asks me what time I might leave today, as he will be out of town tomorrow.  I know he’s thinking about seeing me before he goes.  I am nervous all day.  When we finally do talk, I close the door against my better judgment because I don’t want to be overheard.  After more discussion about what each other wants from this or what we can actually give, he held my hand.  Then he moved to sit next to me and began touching my knee, holding my hands.  Finally, with the tension rising between us, he kissed me.  And I let it happen.  I did pull away a few times and said, “we can’t, we can’t”. But I feel terrible for liking it and wanting more.  

I get plenty of attention from my husband, so it’s not lack of sex.  And I feel so guilty for letting this happen, pursuing the flirtation, and for the fact that I wasn’t that upset afterward.  It’s also more than just the attention I’m getting- it’s him as a person I’m attracted to.  I’m sure I’ll be called a home wrecker, other woman, and worse.  I don’t know what to do.  I can’t throw away a marriage and family for a fling.  But is this more than a fling?  I really like him as a person and feel close to him.  Please give honest feedback and advice without bashing me.",24Oct2019,2
117,"Long story short, I had a series of TBI’s or concussions in my adolescent years. I played football and wrestled for the better part of 12 years (6-18 years old). I didn’t care about my health and neither did my parents. Head health wasn’t really a high visibility concern at the time. Obviously this was at a time when my brain was still growing and developing. I am now 31. I am also a disabled veteran. I now live day to day, hoping that I don’t have any outburst or episodes. Anger, confusion, lack of motor skills, slurred speech, memory loss, sensitivity to noise. Shit even as I write this, I am having trouble to some degree. 

CTE is a fairly recent talked about issue and I am afraid I may be a victim of said disease. Unfortunately, there is no cure and not even a way to diagnose it until after death.

124,"TL:DR at end.

Apologize for long story, appreciate any who read and offer advice. A couple of years ago my dad was diagnosed with kidney failure as a result of an enlarged prostate. The kidney failure impaired his memory for a few months. In addition to that, the medical leave (3 months) devastated his business (salad company that sells to grocery stores) and he was forced to close his business.

The details are somewhat convoluted, but what I know: I was sitting with him in the backyard of his house when a man came up and handed him an envelope. My dad went into the house for a few minutes then came back out and acted like nothing was wrong (hindsight tells me this was a subpoena); a few days later he and my step mom tell me they are moving because, “they are tired of this house.” They move into a small rental house (previous house was 4 bedrooms, lakeside, boat x 2, Corvette, Mercedes, and old F150) that they both profess to hate the new house (the furniture from previous house is stacked into the garage in hopes of relocating to a new house in the future.) The new car is a Kia Sorento. I knew something was up and asked how things were going. “We are just getting old and needed to downsize.” Side note: During this time I was getting calls from debt collectors to my number for my dad and stepmom. I would tell them about the calls and they’d tell me not to worry. I stupidly believed them. 

A few weeks later I get the phone call that my dad is in the hospital for kidney failure. Prostate surgery, many follow ups with doctors and dad is told he is good. Kidneys are better, memory is a little impaired but will improve with time. 

They are living in new tiny house, which I don’t mind a bit. I like that my dad and I now both drive Kias. His memory is a little off here and there but overall ok. 

Here’s the problem: I know my dad isn’t working. I know his business and financial situation collapsed. A google search confirms that a salad distribution company took over his business with a major grocery chain. They filed for bankruptcy around the same time as the subpoena. He doesn’t tell me this. He says, “I let these guys help while I’ve been sick. I just can’t run the plant anymore. When I’m better, I’ll go back to work. “ Fine. 

I went to visit him every other weekend or so for the next few months. One visit on a Saturday, my dad takes my daughter to walk the dogs (all 5) and my step mom and I stay behind to visit. She comes to me, slurring words, bumping into walls (at 1 in the afternoon, sadly, not an uncommon occurrence) to tell me she wants to commit suicide. She’s upset because my dad hasn’t brought home a paycheck in months and she can’t make ends meet. {Now, my dad is 12 years older than her. He’d started to draw social security, plus his retirement from an IRA, plus he is on Medicare. } Hindsight again tells me they should be able to afford rent, utilities, food, etc. but they were definitely not “rich.” She had previously done “accounting” for my dads business. Since losing the business she started working at a local dollar store. I told her she could be an administrative assistant with her skill set. I am a nurse and gave her advice on how to navigate hospital HR. (That’s really all I know.) Fast forward: she ended up being a high level AA for a pediatric surgeon and rocked it. 

After that day I felt so bad for her. My dad can be a bully. I offered to help her by giving money to help make ends meet. She said she appreciated it, but that due to memory impairment my dad was spending money they didn’t have. I said I understood, (dad has always been a spender, she’s always encouraged that, but they were obviously hurting) but please let me know when next appointment with neurologist would be so I could attend. I kept transferring money to her. I’d ask about neuro but it was always, “that was last week.” 
Fast forward to present situation: 

Dad still isn’t working. I believe he, in a clouded mental state gave all of his business to a competitor. I believe my stepmom tried to stop him, but he bullied her into silence. 

After $12,000+  has been given to them, I’d hope it would have helped. A few days before my birthday in March I received a text from stepmom saying, “I need $1,600 before 5 pm today. If you need to take a cash advance on a credit card, that’s ok. I love you sweetheart.” 

I sent her 2,000 with the understanding that all money transfer would stop until I had a meeting with my husband, dad and her. (We have a kid in college and another in private school. My car had over 100k miles and constantly smelled like it was on fire, plus our retaining wall collapsed and it would be $18k for repair. We couldn’t keep this up. I’d warned stepmom weeks before.)They were supposed to visit the next day, but I told her not to show up for my birthday pretending everything was ok. I did not want a gift or offer of dinner. (During our assistance, they bought a new car and got a 6th dog and would alway have “gifts” for my kids. This had to stop.) Stepmom sent a message saying they wouldn’t come and I needed professional help. 

The next day I get a raging phone call from dad wanting to know who the fuck I thought I was wanting to put him in a nursing home. I said I’d been giving his wife money, she chose not to tell him. He calmed down. Over next few hours said he had no idea why she would ask for money. I asked him to talk to her and get back to me (in a nice way: Dad, why did she ask for this/ accept this and not tell you?) He never responded. He’s protecting her. Yes, I should have told him too, but was trying to tread the line between them. My mistake. Any conversations with him since have been superficial. He has never attempted to explain this situation. He’s tried to pretend all is well. He says the neurologist has told him he’s back to normal. It breaks my heart. I want to be close again, but I’m not sure how to cross this divide. I talk to him several times a week. I can hear he wants to see me and his granddaughter. I am paralyzed by our situation. Obviously it’s so complicated, I need help to find my way out. I hate being estranged. I want to reconnect with them. I feel like the villain.

130,"It shouldn't take more than 1, but after 2 complaints to building management I've seen (or heard) no difference in behavior from my upstairs neighbor.


Now... I can understand this kind of thing happening every now and then, I'm sure even I can be noisey to my downstairs neighbor from time to time, but this... This is just ridiculous.


There are a number of characteristics that make this particularly malicious, in my eyes. 


First of all, the noise primarily starts *after* 10pm.  I can hear when this person gets home, at around 6pm, but it isn't until 10pm that they go crazy with the noise.  Building rules stipulate that after 10pm is when it's quiet time, fyi.  


Secondly is the odd nature of the noise.  Well, the person is a stomper - and I have no idea how someone lives that way and they don't know about the way they walk *unless* they're just a particularly vile person and they don't care.  But it's like this person is wearing heels, or atleast a hard soled shoe - and the floor is hardwood.  


Next is... About 3-5 minutes, although sometimes it's between 5-10 minutes... It sounds like this person is intentionally dragging a piece of furniture across their living room.  Like a chair, maybe.  It's just RRRRRRRRUMP, and then RRRRRRRRUMP again... Over and over and over and over.


And this will go on until 2 or 3 am.  It's been going on for a week and I'm completely exhausted from the lack of sleep ... I need silence, I can't live like this.  I'm the type of person where if I'm close to falling alseep and I hear stomping above me, then ... That's gonna wake me up, fully, every time.  I have to get up at 6am, this is *completely* unacceptable.  Words cannot express the rage I felt last night as I lay there still bearing witness to their insane symphony of racket.


And I have no idea what, if anything, I could have ever done to this person to deserve this.  We've never even met.  It could be that I complained to management about it, but I only did that after the nuisance started.  And I don't deal with people face to face - I've had too many bad experiences dealing with noisy neighbors to know by now that the appropriate way to handle it is through building management if possible.


And honestly if nothing is gonna happen to this person even after I complained to management about it, then I don't know what to do.


You know if love to be able to say ""this is why I can't wait to eventually move out to 'burbs, where it's quiet!"" but doing that requires some success in my life, a good job, moving up you know, and *that* requires that I not be running fumes every day of my life due to this kind of shit.

135,"My dad has cheated on my mom multiple times since they first got together, but my mom is one of those persons who thinks any relationship can be fixed so she never left him.

A couple of months back my dad got an important job with a high pay that would finally take us out of our sucky financial state. He involved my mom so she would make money too and everything seem fine.

Today they went out for drinks to celebrate the first paycheck they got and my mother found messages between him and one lady he used to sleep with a couple of years ago. She asked him to send her all the money so my mom couldn't take any of it and so they could finally run away together and leave us behind with literally zero money since he is our only source of income.

He told her he was afraid of doing this for me and my illness (I have depression and suicide tendencies), but that he loved her too much.

They came home arguing and my mom asked me to transfer all of my dad's money to our accounts (I have access to his bank account because he needs me to manage some stuff sometimes) but when I tried I found out he changed his passwords since the last time he asked me to transfer money. I told my mom and she told me she was going to spend the night on an hotel but she's been drinking so I offered to drive, she agreed but I convinced her to stay home, thankfully.

I really don't want to get involved but this is to big to simply ignore it and call it ""their business"". I'm really thinking about killing myself right now and my meds aren't helping.",24Oct2019,1

137,"Just a little backstory to my life. Im 15, turning 16 next month. I have asian parents and you know how it goes with their high standards and all. My passion is making games. 
Now I have to convert everything to the american school system so forgive me if i get something wrong. I have been a top scorer since elementary school. I take the cambridge syllabus and recently finished my IGCSEs (9A*s 1A) and I will be taking AS levels and my SATs next year.
So naturally my parents would have high hopes for me. I know its not going to be easy but I'm not one who studies 24/7 everyday. I like to watch anime, play games, laugh at memes, and as i said before make games. My mom is totally fine with me, she thinks it makes me more normal. My dad on the other hand is a pain in the ass.
My dad is not a modern one. He's the type to follow his traditional ways and isn't too good with modern technology. I don't know what his problem is but he has like zero tolerance for any game unless its like Fifa on the playstation. I have to tab put whenever I play a game on my PC like FPS games just because I know he is going to watch me over and ask what are you playing and all that (Video games cause violence belief). Especially online gaming. I can't even talk to my friends over discord without him asking who it is (with a attitude)
You are probably asking why I don't have my own room. To make it short my house does have other rooms. But the only other room is creepy af in the top floor and has been unoccupied for years. Its not your typical small cozy hotel room. I get freaked out easily too if I sleep alone especially up there so I'd rather not.
Let me just say that he has a really bad temper. He gets pissed off easily and instead of sucking it up he will get angry at others. Let me give you some examples
I was 11 back then, I accidentaly kicked my brother's toy while I was going on the bed. My brother had to go ""HEYYY WHAT ARE YOU DOING!"" My dad overreacted and took a sandal and fucking beat me with it repeatedly. A rubber sandal. Left a bruise in my leg. 
Then there was once during that time too. We were playing mobile games when my brother got a wierd ad(those wierd sexual chinese ads). My dad saw it and accused me that I was the one who told him to play it. ITS AN AD I HAVE NO CONTROL IT. I simply ignored him and muttered to myself. He heard me mutter and started shouting at me saying oh you talking back now or some shit.
Another time he smashed my phone because i turned off the wifi because it was being slow. HE ACCUSED ME OF USING ALL OF IT. He hit me in the face and my mom had to stop him. 
Ever since then he hasnt been doing anything. There was only some times where he would get angry at me for doing small things like tap on the table or stay up late. 

You can see how my dad dotes on my brother. Its so obvious. 

So now I am 15, grade 11. I stay up to 12 to find time for gaming and studying. It was 2 days ago when I stayed up till 12 (usually its not a problem because my dad is asleep in the other corner of the room)
At that time I was playtesting my game. Fixing bugs etc. My dad woke up, shouted at me for playing games this late. I was pissed but i held back from saying anything and went to bed. My mom wasnt asleep so she heard. 
The next day my mom told me I should sleep earlier and all that. Then she made this wierd ass relation. ""How you gonna go to stanford when you sleep so late?"" As a joke. She knew I was still mad about yesterday so I snapped back (in a serious tone but i was sarcastic) 
""Fine who needs to go to stanford, why should i study? I can just go to sleep right now""
She replied ""why are you so sensitive?""
I ignored her after that. They know exactly why im sensitive. They nag me everyday. I cant play games in peace, like omfg just stop. My dad was in the toilet beside the room at this time.
When he came in the room he suddenly got mad out of nowhere.
""Next time i see you stay up late I will throw that laptop, its been a long time since I punished/beat you (was speaking in my native language so the translation is off but basically it means that)

Never in my life I thought he would say that. Im 15 (16 in a month) now. I can easily take him on. I was going to snap back at him too but I didnt and stayed quiet
""You throw my laptop im throwing my future away"" was what i was thinking.

If he really loves me and wants me to have a better future. He would think twice of doing that. Because they dont have the power to firce me to study.

So now I want to ask you all. What should I do? Should I snap back at him next time and call the authorities if he starts hitting me?

I really have no respect for him at all. 

Sorry for the bad structure, im new to reddit.
I will update this post.",24Oct2019,1
138,"There is so much background as to how deep this issue goes but I will try to keep it succinct. 

**The Issue:** One of my best friends whom I hang out with just got a girlfriend and he no longer wants to hang out as often, making me more lonely than before. I don't have a girlfriend so it adds to the problem. 

**The Crucial Background:** I am what I call a social introvert. I have all the traits of an introvert except the part where I am a quiet and reserved person. If I am in an ok mood, I can be a chatter box. My weakest situation is when I am talking to someone 1v1 because I am not particularly good at continuing the conversation. When I am with a group, at least they can continue the conversation better. I am particularly at ease when the group involves all men or ladies who are already in a relationship because there is no risk of rejection so I feel good about socializing. If there is a lady (or more) that are attractive within the group that I may have a chance with, I start to panic and I become a typical introvert then. That's why it leads to this important part below: 

**My Girlfriend**: Is non-existent. It was always a dream. I have never had a relationship before. Just short-termed flings that went absolutely nowhere. Getting a girlfriend was/is one of the most incredible challenges of my entire life. You know how if you don't have something in your life, you yearn for it? For me, it was exactly like that, and it goes back to the point i made earlier. And for that particular reason, I am still a virgin. It ashames me. I lie to my friends that I am not so I can control the criticism. And I am a very insecure person because of it. It has affected me so much, that I literally start hating being around people near me that have girlfriends because I feel envious that they can while I cannot. If I am in public, enjoying my day, and even I see 2 couples holding hands, that's it; it triggers that loneliness and I start freaking out in my head. People talk about it so casually as if it's 1 + 1 = 2 and I am in here wondering how it's possible. I have dated before but it has not gone anywhere meaningful. And of those flings, I have done everything but penetrative sexual intercourse, so I still consider myself a virgin for that. I have tried dating from my social circle (the classical way) and they were either too old or were not interested if it did not lead to marriage. I also come from a conservative (but not religious) and the customs are not too keen on gf-bf dynamics. If you check my post history, you will see that I have tried methods used in /r/seduction (not going to lie; some of them were very challenging to do so I did not give it my 100%) and my second fling came from doing ""game"" but it didn't go anywhere. I have even tried tinder but I am so bad at taking pictures of myself having fun that no matter how many times I have created-deleted-created accounts, it has had a 0% success rate (I tried everything, you name it). You have to understand that when i say this, I mean it; it has lowered my self-esteem, it has made me mentally weak, it has made me more sensitive, and it has affected my drive to get better in my domain. I don't know how to emphasize it better. It's a vicious cycle. It's killing me from inside out. I call it ""Involuntary Loneliness"". Don't get me wrong, I value my solitude, but I don't like not being around someone I can talk to and be intimate with. It's within my human nature. And everyone who is not seeing what I am going through in College (maybe even you reading this) might ask why I don't consider joining clubs, going to parties or sitting beside girls in other classes ? That backstory is below: 

**My college program:** Has just about the worst social life you could possibly think of. It's alright for those who were privileged with a social life before coming here because if that part of your life is lacking, it's just 4 years of engineering. That's it. Let me enlighten you. So my college is a polytechnical college. I am in Canada. That matters because this is the *only* polytechnical college in Canada that offers engineering that is ABET/CEAB accredited. That means this is a rarity. It also means exclusivity. A lot of courses taught in polytechnic colleges here are at a level that is considered below a Bachelor's degree, meaning that you cannot just take a course of your choosing unless it's at the same level of a bachelor's. We have 5 Engineering degrees and nearly 30 engineering diploma programs. To make matters worse, there is a limited amount of courses you could take that the coordinators allow you to. To make matters abysmal, you cannot choose what courses you can take whenever you like unlike Universities; your schedule is made up by the program coordinators and all you do is pay the bills. As a side note, if you fail a course (just one), you fall behind by a year! The reason is that the program is limited to 30 people in a year. Imagine your entire year of engineering students are the size of a highschool classroom! This is because the program is specialized specifically to electronics from year 1. Academically, it's a great model of teaching. But socially, it's brutal. Those 30 people are in your group of classmates from year 1 to year 4 ( you move up as a group). You never experience different people within your program unlike in university because there are 200 or so university students in your program that get shuffled around with science students and other engineering students from different programs. My college also offers other degree programs, so what about those? Remember when I said my coordinators don't allow you to take any course you like? That and also that my college is split into 5 campuses that are nowhere close to each other. The main campus (which has just about everything except engineering) is where all the fun events, girls and parties and other degree programs are. That's not our campus. The problem is that we don't have any courses there. In fact, we never go there except if I am going to the gym or we have guest speakers coming in. The campus that I am in, is 

- situated in the middle of nowhere with the closest place being the main campus about 30 minutes away
- Has no events
- Has no clubs (everything is in the main campus) 
- Has the smallest amount of women on campus
- Is the main campus for engineering and tech students 
- Has no working microwaves (just to emphasize how shitty it is)

And to top it all off; remember when I said only 30 students ? IT IS ALL IN ONE CLASSROOM FOR ALL OF OUR CORE CLASSES; which is at the motherfucking corner of the entire campus. One of my classmates was joking at one time; ""this class is the personification of robinson cruso finding land"" which I think was a jab at this particular point. And the final point here is that, my program is electronics so the amount of women in 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year and 4th year (not joking) is 1 and she has been in a relationship since highschool. Where does that lead me? 

**Premise**: People in my program either have a social life from highschool or friends from back home, or gf's from tinder/bumble. The rest are shit outta luck. Because of the lack of people we are exposed to, we rarely get invited to parties (even if we do, it's a person we know from outside of school). And to top it off; WE ARE ENGINEERING STUDENTS, what do you expect ? We are mostly introverts and we have a lot of work to do just to pass the classes, let alone get good grades in them. Time management is extremely important and sometimes, time will become scarce. Hell, I don't even have time to go to the gym 4 times in a week. That's why it has angered me to a point where i have to seek help from reddit....

**My friend** is currently enrolled in a chemistry class along with the rest of my year. I am not because I did that course a long time ago. He is I would say, one of the 2 friends whom I hang out with very often. This chemistry class has 2 other engineering degree programs. In one of those programs, there is a Russian girl, who's fresh off the boat international student. My friend had joked about approaching her for a while and I had encouraged him thinking that the curse of our program will get him and he will remain single (I agree, it's bad to put people down to get ahead). But lo and behold, last friday, he had his 2nd date and he told me that they had sex! My heart sank! I thought that he was joking, because it's genuinely so rare that something like this happens to anyone in this program, but it was true. Over the last few days, we have not hung out once, which is telling. And it has made me dreadful. I am dreading over the fact that This friendship is going to be very limited because he will be with his lovebird, and also the point I made above about how weak and depressed I get when I witness couples together. I don't know what to do. Often I get so depressed , because I feel I am going nowhere in life. And I often get very desperate which makes me a couch potato and fills me with depression. 

**Proposed solutions:** Nearly half of the people that I share this with tell me meditation and stoicism is the way to go, which would help me ease the pain of loneliness. But the other half tell me that I am basically fucked in terms of finding a girlfriend. Among them are people that tell me that getting a girlfriend will not fix my problems. Let me tell you, that while it might be true for some, for me, it's absolutely false. It has been my number 1 personal challenge and when I have that covered, It will give me so much self-esteem that I will feel that I can accomplish anything. I feel that I need to reach out and ask how I may get out of this misery ?",24Oct2019,2

140,"My very close friend and I met a few years ago through art. I've drawn nearly every day since elementary school, went to college for art, made all my friends through art, and planned on getting a job in it for my entire life.

Within the past two years I've completely lost my way with art. I feel like I go through a depression about it nearly every day. I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough.

When I met this friend through art we both really loved each other's stuff, but as time goes on it feels like they've stopped caring about mine. I don't blame them, they don't have to force themselves to like my art, but it's still very depressing to me. I genuinely do still love their art, but a lot of the joy I got from art making was tied to them and their support. 

Now I still love their art and share how excited I am for it, I've gotten them into cons every year since I've known them and try to specifically point what it is they do in their drawings that I love, but it seems that they don't really care about how well I do. They rt my stuff on Twitter but it's never true genuine excitement for my stuff. When I talk to them about how I'm feeling they usually don't respond or don't flat out disagree that my stuff is bad. 

I'm still trying really hard to feel confident about drawing. I think I have my confidence in art tied too much to what they think of it, but it's so hard not to let their opinion matter to me. It does matter a lot still, and I really want to make art they love as much as I love theirs. 

I delete after posting my stuff on Twitter a lot because spending 5+ hours on a drawing that gets no attention crushes me. (I do let it stay up for 12-24 hours, so within twitters algorithm). I was showing them some of my stuff because they asked and I was trying not to feel low today, but they joked that if it was still up on my Twitter it was time to delete it (since that's what I always do). I don't think they meant it in a mean way, but it hurt a lot. I know it's not their fault for the way I'm feeling, but when you really support someone and it feels like they don't really care about your stuff, it just hurts a lot. 

Tldr; I love my friend a lot, but is there anyway I can stop feeling ashamed of everything I draw and like a total failure compared to them? They started drawing way earlier that me and are way more popular and better than I am. I never want to make them feel guilty about their success, but how to I stop feeling so bad about the fact that my art is way worse than theirs and I'm not sure how to improve?",24Oct2019,1
141,"There's this guy that has been scaring me lately.. I'm wondering if I'm just being biased or does he really seem kinda strange..

First time I ever saw him he literally popped out of a bush and asked how I was or something (was awhile ago) while I was spinning a pokestop on the way to pick up my son from school.  I saw him again a couple days after in my neighborhood,  he said something mundane about the weather, I said something like yeah, ""I can't wait to get home. Just need to get my steps in first."" 

Didn't see him much after that.. then bam he's suddenly always around. I see him randomly when walking to pick up my son in my neighborhood, he walks opposite of me right past me.

I see him almost every day coming back home from dropping my son off,  always in the same spot. Even if I take a detour to go grocery shopping for an hour or two... it's like he waits there for me. Appears out of nowhere the second I get to the crossing and walks past behind me.. he always looks dirty and he's really big, like tall and large framed. Kinda scares me. I feel like he's stalking me. If I just saw him occasionally I wouldn't think much of it,  but it's like he knows my normal route and waits for me.",24Oct2019,1

So, my mom’s boyfriend (BF) moved in a few years ago with his dog, an older German Shepherd, Kaya. At the time, we already had two dogs in the house, Max, who I’ve had since he was a puppy and I was ten (I’m now 21, he’s 11), and Nori, who we got at about a year old and is now six. I love all dogs, but I did not like the BF when he moved in and his dog was not mine. I didn’t really like the dog, either, because it was his (and kind of annoying).

It’s about time for me to move out. I’m not quite ready, and my mom seems cool with that for now, but we haven't talked about it. I really don’t want to leave the dog I’ve had for half my life (and he’s very much a mama’s boy and my mom wouldn’t want to give him up, either), so I thought I might just stick around until he passes away, but I have no idea how long that might be. I’ve been trying to spend more time with him since he may not have much time left and I haven’t been a very good best friend since I’ve gotten older and busier. I don’t really want to leave Nori, either, but she’s definitely my mom’s dog (I didn’t even know if I wanted another dog when we got her, although I’ve since become absolutely smitten with that lovebug).

The reason I don’t want to move out without Max is partially because of a story my mom told me. When she moved out, she left behind her family dog that she’d pretty much trained and raised herself. When she got another dog after moving out, her family dog became distant when she went to visit it. Could just be coincidence, but I definitely won’t get another dog for a while after I move out in fear of something similar happening.

Now, they’re looking for another dog. They went to see one the other day and the person who currently has him is supposed to bring him to meet our dogs tomorrow night. I really don’t want to get too emotionally attached to another dog before moving out, but it wouldn’t feel right to ignore it, either (and I wouldn’t be able to). 

What do I do about moving out and my dogs? What should I do with a new dog possibly being added to the house soon?",24Oct2019,1
148,"My apologies for how long this is, but I really need advice. And yes, I already posted this in r/relationshipadvice but have gotten 0 responses, hence why I'm here.

My bf (32) &amp; I (29) have been together 4 years &amp; we're expecting our first child. We both had gotten out of long-term, toxic relationships before getting together. This is the healthiest relationship we've ever been in before &amp; he's not the cheating type, which is a relief because my ex would cheat with anything with a pulse. But he has this pseudo cousin that makes me very uncomfortable.

The first 3 years of our relationship I met most of his family &amp; heard of ones I hadn't met yet. But out of the blue, a female ""cousin"" (they aren't related at all, apparently they grew up as if they were cousins since their parents were close, but there is absolutely 0 relation) of his that he hasn't spoken to in years added him on Facebook &amp; began messaging him CONSTANTLY. Like every single day, multiple times per day they would be talking all the time. She frequently vented to him about her husband that she was in the process of splitting up with. It really bothered me that I'd literally never even heard of this ""relative"" until 3 years in but my bf explained he hadn't even thought of her until she reached out to him. 

His siblings seem to see her as a relative but it bothers me that she's so close with him &amp; none of his other family in the same way. She talks to him about things you'd usually talk to another woman about. The other day she was venting about some guy she was messing around with &amp; how she felt like she ""was just a piece of ass to him"", like stuff you normally wouldn't talk to a male relative about. None of the messages are inappropriate besides the odd semi-tmi stuff like that, but I just get the weirdest vibe from her. It feels like she doesn't actually see him as a cousin &amp; she's prying for his attention a bit too much for my liking.

My boyfriend assures me he sees her as a blood relative &amp; that he only wants me, but he's previously been completely blind to women that hit on him. This ""cousin"" reminds me of an ole friend of his who used to constantly message him all day every day &amp; send pictures of herself (not nudes but several selfies getting him to say stuff like, ""You have an amazing smile"", just really attention-seeking) to him fishing for compliments. I made it clear I was not okay with it &amp; that she needed to stop. He insisted she was just being platonic &amp; that she had no interest in him, but I'm a woman too, I know exactly what she was doing. This ""cousin"" gives me similar vibes &amp; I can't explain why.

I admit I do consider myself to have ""relationship PTSD"" where as I'm so used to being cheated on &amp; abused that I'm constantly worried it'll happen even though I'm now in a completely healthy, faithful relationship. He's never been inappropriate with another person but like I said before, he's completely oblivious to women who are into him.

I initially thought this girl was a blood relative &amp; I still felt very strange about how often she talks to him &amp; the very personal things she discussed, but one day in passing it was revealed that they aren't actually related at all which increased my paranoia. I have a couple friends that I see as cousins because we grew up with close parents so I get that aspect, but there's no way in fucking hell I'd mention my sex life to them &amp; I don't message them all the damn time. I can't figure out if I'm just severely damaged from my ex or if this girl really has shady intentions. She has made no effort to befriend me at all except to add me on Facebook &amp; messaged me once asking about a previous TV experience of mine. Other than that she doesn't speak to me yet messages my boyfriend every single day. She's not close with other members of his family like she is with him.

I absolutely don't want to be that psycho girlfriend who sees every female in her boyfriend's life as a threat, but something just doesn't seem right about this girl. My boyfriend doesn't understand my concerns at all &amp; I feel dumb when I bring it up because he sees her as family but I'm convinced she has feelings for him, &amp; I don't like it.

150,"I've been a childhood friend with my crush, then I changed to another school and we rarely spoken to her until recently.

I am going to see another movie with her on 11/10, and I'm wondering when and how I'm going to speak to her about my feelings for her. I thinks she's really cute and I really liked her. And I think she already knows that I liked her, although I never really told her that I do. Any suggestions???",24Oct2019,1
151,"I’m on FaceTime with my friend, talking about how I found a parents stash of weed, but to my surprise my parent was eavesdropping the whole time. They confronted me and I broke down and told them. They called me a narc and says they have zero trust and I am just insanely racked with guilt. I’ve been screwing up recently and this just adds to it and I’m seriously feeling like a major dick right now and I have no idea how to approach the situation, as I’ve lived with this parent for all of my life so far (I’m only 15 right now), and it’s always been me and this parent vs. the world and I just feel like I’ve betrayed them and that I am the worst person alive.

153,"I don't know if I've really been happy or even content ever since school started. Everything has seemed like a burden.

It's really not fair for me to say that. I know that there are people out there who are suffering much more than I am, especially considering I come from an upper-middle class family in the United States. I am so much more privileged than millions of other people in the world, which is why I feel like I should be doing *more* in life. I should be taking advantage of what I was lucky enough to be born with, and help other people.

The problem is, I don't know if I'll ever be able to achieve that goal. If I'll ever be able to really make a difference in the world, and that's what really scares me.

My older sister is four years older than me, and, though neither of them would ever say this out loud, I know my parents kind of think that she's a ""failure."" She didn't get into any of the top Ivy League colleges in the US, and is planning to major in something that's not really ""respected"" in society.

Now I go to the same high school that she did, and my parents seem to be afraid that I'll follow in her footsteps. And I guess, in a way, I'm also afraid.

This is my first year in high school, and there are so many kids in my school who are completely out-performing me. Obviously it's utterly conceited of me to assume that I'd be one of the best in this school of over four thousand kids. But how am I supposed to make a difference in the world if I can't even make a difference in my *school?* And what's the point of being alive if I'm not affecting the world, helping to make it a better place?

I don't know if any of you have read *Annie John* by Jamaica Kincaid, but that's what we're reading in my English class right now. Basically, in it, the main character details the growing distance between herself and her mother, and how she's beginning to resent her mother for abruptly forcing her to ""grow up"". And I can kind of relate to that.

My parents (well, mother, at least) don't give me any time to myself. They think that just because I'm in a specialized high school, I should spend each and every second studying. Which makes zero sense to me, a teenager--how am I supposed to have time to recharge?

Today we got our report cards, where the scaling system is as follows:

E (90 to 100)

S (75 to 89)

N (65 to 74)

U (64 and below)

My scores were all within the E to S range, and do you know what my parents said? ""Not impressed"" and ""you need to improve."" To the second comment: no shit! That's kind of what the first marking period is about!

Also, they both know that I've been striving to do better in my two worst classes. They know that I stay up until 12am or later each night, getting less than the recommended six hours of sleep. And that I've been arranging tutoring sessions for myself. They know that my school is stressful, and that I'm just a KID. And yet whenever I try to have some downtime they immediately blow up on me, saying that I shouldn't be wasting my time.

Does that mean I won't be able to pursue my passions for the next four years? What's the fucking point then?

I feel like I'm in a parallel universe where nothing seems to go right. I don't know what to do. I don't want to grow up this way and I'm scared.

They broke up shortly before we met, so we made sure to wait a bit until making it official. Well today he went out with his brother and left his phone. Usually, he’s very protective over it, so I felt the need to check it. I’m also very insecure, and I needed the reassurance that it was clean. Well I went through his camera roll and found a hidden album filled with explicit nudes from his recent ex. These photos were dated to shortly after we met, but before we started dating. I’m hurt, of course, but at a loss for what to do. I can’t confront him on snooping, but I can’t ignore these photos. He usually has a lot of porn on his phone anyway, but his exes nudes is a completely different issue. I hate that he has so much porn saved when we’re together all the time anyway, but I can work on overlooking that. Nudes from a female that he dated are much much worse. What should I do? Do I confront him? Should I delete the pictures? I really need advice here. Thanks in advance.",24Oct2019,1

160,"Hey guys,

So my friend met this guy last year &amp; he seemed like a nice guy. He pulled her aside one day to compliment her, and she was nice about it and accepted the compliment, however clarifying that she was in a relationship.

He managed to find her on all social media and follow/add her, in which she didn't pay much mind to, as he seemed like a regular normal guy. He then proceeded to message her constantly, professing his ""love"" to her, in which she firmly told him that she wasn't interested and that she was in a relationship. Assuming he got the message, she moved on. He kept sending her messages professing his love unfortunately, to the point where she had to block him on all social media.

After blocking him on everything, he's attempted to make fake accounts to contact her and attempted to message her friends. He is delusional to the point where he has convinced himself and told people that her and him are ""in love"" and that they've been ""together"" for the past year. 

I probably missed a few details and specific stories pertaining to the story so feel free to ask questions, but the point of this is that he has sociopathic traits and he is slowly turning into someone who may be a threat to her, and I'm worried. Apart from being an absolute creep and sociopath however, I have no clear cut evidence that he means ""harm"", but that doesn't take away from the fact that he is starting to become a detriment to my friends life, and she has tried her best to stop it. 

Any advice or course of action would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",24Oct2019,1

He’s done this before and even spoken to some professors about me (that’s another story, but equally bothersome). To my discernment, it wasn’t the kindest dialogue. My boss, an older woman, seemed frazzled with me for a while &amp; I felt it had something to do with their chat.

164,"Over a year ago I was hit off of my motorcycle and broke my back in three places, twice at the base of my neck and once at the base of my spine. I also suffered nerve damage effecting all movement in my left arm all the way to my hand. (For reference I worked in the care sector averaging around £800 p/w.) I struggled majorly and ended up losing my flat deflating my savings to nothing thus leaving myself with no option but to move in with my mum. My employer paid the base sick pay for 28 weeks (the minimum) but accepted my sick lines up until I returned in June. I  was put on strict light duties as my doctor really didn't want me back working as in his professional opinion I wasn't strong enough. Despite the very limited amount of work it was a massive boost in my quality of life in terms of slight financial freedom (£130-£250 p/w.)I had been relying on my girlfriend up until this point. 

In July an electric wheelchair tipped and caught my belt loop it didn't fall but I twisted and locked up, MRI scan was done C4, 5 and 6 all have protrusions. My employer would't pay any sick pay as they argued I'd received the mandatory minimum and this was the same sickness, Universal credit refused to look at my case after the initial interview as I'd not payed enough in tax over the year (While off with an injury) I have been reluctant to post as I thought I would have figured something out by now as I have never had a gap from employment nor have I ever claimed benefits. 

I have been earning around £650 a month buying and selling online, spanner in the works my PC has just died and not willing to take the financial risk of buying another one. This is where it gets real for me and whats causing me to feel a lot of pressure, My girlfriend is pregnant and due in January. I have everything for the baby already purchased and ready to go. I have £4500 in a savings account purely for the baby as I don't have any secure income currently I can't afford to not have money for them. I have £3000 in my personal savings account and virtually debt free, I owe £1500 to my Dad but he's happy to wait.

* I'm high school educated I have higher Maths, English, Product design, Graphic comm and Art. All A except from Art, I have a B.
* Fully qualified Hairdresser.
* Work experience in the Salon, Manager at a warehouse distribution centre and managing staff in the care sector.
* Completed first year of uni for social work, Was doing this while working with me Ex-Employer.

I have tried every Job I can think of from dead end to things I'm qualified for / have experience in. Moderate success getting to the interview stage but can't really hide the fact that my left arm isn't fully functional and usually disclose about my injury as I know it would play a factor if I was to get employment without disclosing for it to later come up. 

What do I try and do from here?

My problem at the moment is that when I submitted my drug test (I’m 100% clean, so that’s not my issue), the results came back as “negative-diluted”. I drink a ton of water regularly, so my urine is rarely darker than a very pale yellow. The company allowed me to submit another sample, although this has now set me back about a week and really thrown things off as far as my pay schedule goes. When I submitted my second test I noticed that although I had barely had any water to drink that day, my urine was still very light in color, almost clear. 

I am SO worried that this test will come back as diluted again, and that I will be unable to start this job. The drug test is the last piece of this whole thing. I’ve already been through the interview process, background check, everything.

170,"My weight's always been a big insecurity of mine. I've dropped 21 pounds and have 15 more to go. I've never wanted to diet at a young age, but I'm at an impasse.

In gym, we all have groups, 5 people per group. We each have an assigned thing to do. I'm in a group of 6 and I'm the 6th one. 
I can't change groups, and if I did, it'd still result in a group of 6.

I had to be my own group (until one group member switched classes), which meant I couldn't spot or be spotted as there was one machine and it was always in use.

I've tried to use it was on the first day, and a girl who I'll call B was spotting when I was supposed to spot (She is always talking with friends and messing up the schedule, I get to that part later). 

I told her that I was supposed to be the one spotting, but she just told me she didn't care. 
I had to skip spotting and being spotted. 
(I used those spaces of time to repeat other exercises and take my break when I was supposed to spot. No one was ever left without a spotter as a result of this.)

When I was at my highest weight, B wouldn't care that I was doing other exercises. For some reason it started changing as I got thinner.

B's started accusing me of sitting on my ass all class long. She always says stuff along the lines of ""____, even though she doesn't do anything,"" or ""You can't just be sitting there playing with your watch all day""

(I was doing sit ups. My watch is a step tracker and doesn't even have a touch screen, let alone games.)

When we're all doing the schedule, she'd always yell at me to change what I'm doing because I was doing the wrong thing, and then get mad at me for changing what I was doing.

I've double and even triple checked, I haven't followed the schedule wrong. 

Last class, she yelled at me, saying ""Why are you always messing up the schedule?"" I'm sure it will happen again.

Along with that, there was a boy at that school, who was also my old town but had moved a year before I did, and I had a really bad, traumatic experience with him in the past, so that just added to my discomfort. I chose to do what I thought was best for me at the time to avoid worsening my mental health even more than it already had, so I switched to online school in January 2019.

Fast forward to now, I’m struggling keeping up with my schoolwork, mostly due to me getting into a bad depression again which affects my motivation and ability to focus. I don’t have any irl friends and no matter how much I don’t want to admit it to anyone, I’m starting to feel lonely just being with my family. I’m considering transferring back to a regular school, since I hope it would help me complete my schoolwork with being on a schedule everyday.

The woman runs another portion. At break time I run into her next to a staircase that bridges over the assembly line and she stops and talks to me. But something in her face looked wrong, so I asked if she was okay. She said she was fine. It was a lie and I called her out on it because, honestly, I have a crush on her so if theres something wrong, I would like to know.

Anyways, she comes clean then. She said she pretended to walk the other way because ""that"" guy always stops to stare at her ass. She then tells me he does it a lot, to a lot of the women we work with. I told her I was sorry she had to deal with that, and she said ""No. It's fine."" And then continued on her way because it was break time and our lunch break is only 18 minutes. 

This has been bugging me all night. ""Its fine."" It isnt fine. No one should feel so uncomfortable as to go out of their way to avoid being infront of a specific person. It's not right. And the thing that bugs me is that a few days prior, another woman that I am currently training to be my backup told me that shes always thought that same guy was kind of creepy, but she never gave me any reasons so I just thought it was because he was an old and clearly has a few issues. But it's no excuse to aggressively stare at womens butts. 

I feel like saying something to a higher authority might be the right thing to do, but I also feel like maybe its disrespectful to the woman that told me about this if I dont ask her if she would like to report it herself (I would back her up if she wanted support) or if she would like me to report it and keep her anonymous.

182,"Hey guys, this is going to be a lengthy post so please bare with me and offer me your advice as a third party looking in.

I am 23 years old and a university drop out. I belong to a family who follows traditions and believes women are in the kitchen while men are the head of the house. I was raised to be a dutiful wife and to be the perfect and agreeable daugther and future daughter-in-law. My family believes in no sex until marriage and believes that couples should not live together until married. They also believe in only marrying into the same race and religion.

The problem is... I am not like that at all. I, for one, am not a virgin and I’ve also dated plenty of guys outside of my race. I however have always cooked and clean for my parents and did whatever if not most, of what they’ve asked.

A few years ago, I graduated from community college and moved down south to attend university. Because of my family traditions, it was a long and hard battle before I could move. My parents wished for me to stay in town and stay close to the family, me however, I wanted to go far. I felt trapped in my family and I feel as though I can never reach my full potential as long as I am home. After much fighting and anger and convincing, I left to school away from home. My parents got me an apartment and dropped me off telling me to be good and study hard. I was lucky enough to have my parents help pay for my apartment or else I wouldnt have been able to stay there that long.

I immediately got a job to help my parents pay rent, but a year into university, I lost track of what I was doing. I hated my major, I was stressed, and I no longer had any idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I felt like a failure because in my mind I had such a clear view of what I was doing. I dropped out after missing two semesters and never went back. I don’t regret dropping out of school. It was too expensive, I didn’t know what I was doing, and i didnt qualify for any financial aid and paid everything out of pocket, which i then did myself to prevent my parents from burdening too much. I continued to work and help my parents pay bills and enrolled in a nearby community college to once again try to search for my passion. The downside was, I was too afraid to tell them I had dropped out of univeristy and was once again attending community college. So instead whenevee they asked about it, I would lie to them and tell them I was still at university.

Not too long after I met a guy at work that I never expected to fall in love with. He is the love of my life. No one has ever treated me better, loved me more or nearly as much, and no one has ever been such a kind human being before. I know he’s the one and I knew quite early on. He helps me through financial crisis, cheers me on when I’m down, and celebrates with me when I win. I love him so much and we can both see our futures together. I met his family and he met mine probably once or twice (only because my family lived so far). I completely adore his family and they love me too. His parents tell me they love me and have asked me to move in with them multiple times. Because of my cultural traditions and my parents, I haven’t moved in with them yet and I have refused to so far. Due to this, my boyfriend and I would spend a few days at my apartment and then a few days with his family; basically, we were somewhat inseparable and might as well say we basically lived together. My boyfriend too have asked me to move in with him multiple times and we both agreed things would be so much easier for the both of us if we just lived together, but once again because of my respect towards parents, I refused.

After leaving my first job, I found another job that I absolutely loved. I was happy to go in, I had a good incentive to do good at work and I felt so happy to be there. I was so happy there that I won best sales employee within the first month working there outselling all the other coworkers. I was so happy with my life and I have never felt so happy before. I was comfortable with who I was becoming, I was happy about my choices, I loved my job, and although I was far from home and away from my blood family, I found a new home and I found a new family.

My boyfriends family is different from mine. They were much smaller compared to us, but what I admired most was the fact that their family didnt believe in gender roles. No one had a specific job in their home because since they all lived there, it was everyone’s equal duty to keep the home clean. I loved it so much that on the days I was there, I would help clean and do the dishes and even occasionally did their laundry. I met his whole family (his aunts, uncles, grandparents) and everyone semed to like me; even the aunts and uncles and grandparents who they say are hard to please liked me.

A year later, I went to go visit my family and after I found out what had been happening, I felt terrible. My parents were in the middle of remodeling their bathroom and that had to stop in order to support me. My dad was pulling overtime every week at work to make enough money to pay for the family home mortage and my apartment rent. Their truck had gone bad but they were unable to fix it. I tried to blame it on other things like the fact that my parents invested so much money into raising farm animals that they didnt have enough money or the fact that they were hard partiers and a lot of their money went into partying hard every weekend, but I couldnt shake off that I was a huge part of the reason. After crying of guilt, my boyfriend advised that I told my parents what had been happening. 

I came clean to my parents and when I did, I knew exactly what was going to happen and I had been reluctant to tell them because I knew what was going to happen. I had something good and I didn’t want to throw it away but I couldn’t live with myself knowing the situation my parents had gone into. My mom lectured me and my dad was quiet. He told me they had sacrificed so much in order to give me the chance for an education and had hoped I would have made something of myself and that their efforts would have not been wasted. He openly told me he was disappointed, but because I am his daughter I do not owe him anything. He told me to go back to my apartment, pack up, and he’ll come pick me up at the end of the week. I was devastated to say the least, but I wasn’t mad at them. I know and understand why he had chosen to do that and I also know that it was wrong of me to do what I had done.

I went home and opened up about the situation to my boyfriend and his family which resulted in lots of crying and sadness. They helped me pack and his parents told me to go home, set things right, and come back home to them. They told me that they will always have open  arms waiting for me.

I’ve been home for almost two months now and it doesn’t feel like home at all. I don’t know how else to say it besides I hate it here. I love my family and I will never be mad at my parents for bringing me back home, but I dont belong here anymore. My heart is elsewhere and I know as a fact that I won’t ever feel like I’m home. I know I haven’t been acting like myself and I only look forward to the day I can go back to where I really belong. I’m not happy here at all. I feel like I’ve lost a piece of myself and I feel trapped. I feel like I can’t be myself here because I’m expected to be a certain way. I feel like as long as I’m here, I can never reach the true potential of what I could do.

I’ve recently opened up to my parents about how much I love and appreciate them, but also
how unhappy I am here and they’ve taken it as I’d rather live away from my family. They want me to go back to school and have told me that as long as I finish school, I can do whatever I want. I love that option, but the problem is, I don’t want to go to school. With the previous experience I’ve had, school is not for me and I’ve yet to realize where my passion lies.

What is your advice to me? Am I selfish for not wanting to live here? Am I just totally out of my head?",24Oct2019,1

192,"On mobile, english is not my first language and I’m just too tired to spell check, onto the story:

I have a friend, let’s call her Lana (we’re both 21f). We are together literally since the day we were born, she’s more than a best friend, she’s a sister to me, I love her with all my heart. 

Since high school, I started to notice that we both had very deep depressive tendencies - caused by things that I rather not talk about - Not surprisingly, last year I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and I have a eating disorder (although is unrelated to body dismorfia). I started treatment and I’m seeing a psychiatrist.

Lanas family is not very wealthy and she doesn’t have the means to seek treatment, though she has expressed to me that she would like to. 

The thing is, Lana and I, throughout the years, developed this...dark humor as a way of coping. We sent self deprecating, depressing and dark memes as a way to deal with being overwhelmed by this shitty mental state. We both always been very interested in psychology and, I’m not by any means claiming to be a professional or being able to diagnose this, we could see and identify symptoms, so it became this “since I know what I have, I can deal with it because I’m self aware” - do not try this at home kids. 0/10 would not try again. 

We are essentially “laughing at the void”. But it’s not helping, we even talked about it, we recognize how our conversations turned into a echo chamber for shitty self esteem. Just now she sent me a gif of a woman being flushed down the toilet with the caption “me going home”  and I, without even thinking about it, responded with “same”. 

It started innocent enough, we used to say “we laugh so we don’t have to cry” . But as the years went by , the text got so much darker than this.  Neither of us have ever tried anything serious, nor were we involved in self harm, but I know we are destroying ourselves. Nights without proper sleep, no eating, bottling up problems. We send jokes about having panic attacks, and passing out because of stress.

And I don’t know what to do.

We’re stuck in this cycle. We talk about how it would be impossible for us to cope without joking about it, we are afraid that, if we stop, it will get worse. I’m in treatment, but she isn’t, and I’m so terrified to cut this, because for her, I’m pretty much the only person she can “decompress”. I understand, I’ve been there, I AM there.

I know that if I told her to stop, the memes and the jokes would stop...but the way she feels is still very much real, and....is so fucked up to say, but I rather hear her talking about it than know she’s just keeping it to herself.

I want to break this toxic relationship but I’m not going to cut ties with her. Never. I want so fucking desperately to help her, but I don’t know how. I want for both of us to stop feeding into each other’s depression but I just don’t know how.

TL;DR: depressed girls are in a toxic cycle, feeding into each other’s depression, trying to cope with memes and I want to stop it without cutting her off my life.",24Oct2019,3

197,"So the knocking started at 2am, just regular knocking. I didn't answer it because I live on the top floor of an apartment building and if it were one of my neighbours they would've responded when I asked who was there. 

They knocked on and off every 15 minutes or so up until a while ago and it got more frantic every time, it's been over 30 minutes with no knocking. I've asked who they are, if they need help, if they're okay, nothing. I did knock back which prompted no response. I live alone, so I'm not risking letting them inside. 

I haven't heard a knock in a while now but I can hear the floorboards in the hall creaking. They're still there. I opened the door and saw someone move on the floor below but I didn't see their face. I still don't know who it is. Whenever they knocked they hid out of view of the peephole.

In our friend group there’s two girls who are cool and one of them I have a crush on and he knows that. Ever since he knew he’s been telling me they (mainly the girl I like) don’t like me, don’t wanna talk to me, think I’m annoying etc(and that they told him that). They have been friends with him a little longer tho and he’s a little more outgoing. He also tells me about how often they talk and how much happier they seen when I’m not around.     Now to the blackmailing, I occasionally have been vaping but I’m quitting soon as it’s not good. He also does it but ended up selling his stuff so I let him use mine sometimes. He’s been starting to beg an insane amount for it all the time, and when I don’t let him use it he threatens to tell my parents, all our friends, the principal etc. and he’s dead serious too. I let him use it Bc I don’t want him to do that but it’s gotten out of hand. I’m not gonna be letting him use it anymore but I he’s threatening to fuck w my life because he “needs” it. He’s become a fucking bitch about everything and acts like a kid about the girl I like, vaping etc. 

I’ve talked to someone I’m close with about it and they think he’s doing the thing w the girls just to make me feel like shit because he is uglier, shorter, fatter, and more annoying and he wants to put me out of competition.  

I’m scared the blackmailing thing will go to shit when I slowly cut him off. He’s a fucking fat bitch so he would prolly actually tell people. He also gets insanely mad when I don’t give him vape stuff for free. He has near to no self control with vaping although I do so it bothers me how out of control he is.

199,"I live in my father in laws house with my wife and two kids. I’m convinced they hate me. I never receive any mail. If it is a check, gift card, or anything else potentially involving money it gets taken and used. If I ask if anything has come for me they say they haven’t seen anything. 

So far it’s been a couple of amazon gift cards, a target gift card, a year or so worth of bank, 401 k, credit card statements.

As a child my mother opened a savings account for me that no one knew about except her. She passed away in 2006. The bank closed a couple of years ago and my father recently received a letter from the state that I had unclaimed property. I filled out some forms to receive such property. 

I checked the status of the check and it was mailed out in mid August. 
I received nothing. I filled out a claim with the state controller that I never received the mail. They replied that they will send me a letter to sign that I never received the check and they would see if it was cashed. If not that would send me a new one or a copy of the cash check. It should come last month but nothing.  I don’t want to also accuse them since I have no evidence. On the other gift cards and statements I do.

I can’t really ask my wife or father in law if they have received it or seen it. If they have they will just back each other’s story up that they haven’t seen it. 

It’s not so much about the money but it just makes me feel like less than a person. I’ve been in therapy for around 5 years with meds and I’m making great progress. There is only so far I can go with a stable support system at home.

My sister(32), myself(26)&amp; our two friends make up our best friend group - our Wolfpack -and the first of the pack is finally getting married!

Okay so the goal here is to find out if I’m:
1. Over-reacting and need to just shut up and be happy for the good of the pack 
Or 
2. Say something even though it’ll make it awkward no matter how it ends up but it’ll bum me tf out 

So our best friend(32) asked my sister to get ordained to marry her and her fiancé.  I love them both so much and want their day to be perfect ~ but ~ ever since I was a little girl, the only real dream I’ve ever had for my wedding (if I ever had one) was for my sister to get ordained for my wedding because that’s the most special thing I could ever think of. 
I’m a real sentimental person and to me the whole thing feels ruined for my future wedding because if our friends gonna have her do it then it’s dumb if I do because that’s not her job it’s just a special favor.

I fear if I say nothing I will be resentful of the whole thing and jealous and sad and if I do say something either it still happens and I pretend I’m not upset or she cancels the plan and then she’s pissed at my future hypothetical wedding. 

I really just need some perspective on how to not see it as a bad thing, or approach the topic because we’re homies. Or just tell me if I’m being selfish

210,"Fair warning, it might get kinda ranty here.  
So, i have been at the school for four years, and each one has gotten progressively worse in terms of this kids behavior. At first, it was minimal disturbances, such as unneeded retorts to the teacher, awkward intrusions into conversations, and just plain weird behavior. I go to a school where this is fairly normal, but as the year went on, it got even more apparent that it wasn't going to stop. The year after, we started high school, and my theory had been proven. He started to mimic the fuckboy advances that one of my classmates tried on all the girls but in a perverted way. He would stand a little too close to girls, ask them awfully private questions, and all of the other things I previously mentioned. I started to get really rude to everyone at this point, and this quickly scared him away from me. I was fine with this, but then I noticed how he acted around the other girls. Fast forward to sophomore year, when this escalated at an advanced rate. He was incredibly rude when teachers gave him simple instructions. He has no filter whatsoever. During this year, i had Ballroom dancing with him, and he never knew how to properly hold a frame. His arms would ""accidentally""slip low on our waists, and we started pulling sticks as to who was going to be his partner for the day. He would also whisper threats into my ear about telling the teacher that I ""threatened to snap his arms like twigs."" Now im in my Junior year, and this has been by far the worst experience. thankfully, i dont have any classes with him, but hes in my lunchroom, and thats somehow worse. He does all of the things i stated, but now started imitating the show ""Big Mouth."" He made note cards of all the girls in the school, with their description and 'ranking' which is honestly, disgusting. Every time I tell him to back off, he'll ignore me, call me a dick, asshole, dyke, or bitch, then huff away to the corner.

212,"This year, I'm a senior in high school and taking AP Japanese. Awhile back, my teacher (who we just call ""Sensei"", by her request) gave us free time to work on a project. I did not know the kanji  or what a word was called in Japanese. Kanji are pictorial characters, and there are thousands of them. They're not phonetic, and if you don't know what one is, you're kind of at a loss. I would have used the dictionary in the room, but it only provides the kanji with no phonetic explanation. I asked sensei, and she told me ""to look it up"". 

Like most schools, we have a no phone policy. I took her words to mean to go on my phone and look it up. As I was looking up the word in Japanese, she came over, grabbed my phone, and told me that I was going to get a detention for going on my phone.

I'm not saying that I shouldn't have been on my phone. What bugs me is that there is this girl in my class who never knows the answer. Sensei LOVES her, even though she never answers anything. She is ALWAYS blatantly on her phone, playing games, texting, or scrolling through Instagram. Lately, she has been on her phone, looking down at it, with earbuds in. Not even airpods, but earbuds with wires. Sensei can obviously see her, and she doesn't give a shit. 

Today, she was on her phone, and sensei asked her what she was doing on it. She mumbled something like ""I'm looking at google translate"", and sensei said ""OK"" and walked away. No detention or anything. To make matters worse, if you glanced at her screen for one measly second you could tell that she was playing Candy Crush. She continued to be on her phone the rest of the class.

If I'm going to get a detention for going on my phone to look up a word, it seems reasonable that she should receive one too. This has been going on for a good three months and today was the last straw for me. 

Would it be a bitch move to go to the office and report this? I am wondering. I feel guilty going to the office. If Sensei finds out I reported her, she will hate me even more.",24Oct2019,1

A- My crush, K- Her on and off boyfriend, C-My best friend

Context

I met A in our 6th period acting class our first year of high school and I immediately took a shine to her. She was nice and quiet (A rarity in freshman acting classes). We got along but because we were both introverted it just kind of stayed at pleasantries, no phone numbers or social media. At this point I didn't know I liked girls, I was a late bloomer and never dated before. It was sometime towards the end of the year she talked about some domestic issues that were uncomfortable but not entirely out of the ordinary in our not-so-nice town. There was a developing issue at her home that left her stranded at school and getting text message updates that would upset her. I stayed with her and she confided in me for quite a bit of time before school got out, she thanked me and I left. I feel weird saying this but think this was kind of the inciting indecent for my crush, it was just a really striking show of trust that I wasn't used to at the time.

Freshman year ended and we were placed in the same acting 2 period the next year. Again we kept it pretty surface level and my feeling for her were more just a strong affinity. Not much happened other than us separately maturing in high school as you do. She offhandedly mentioned that she was taking a break from her boyfriend, K, whom she had dated off and on since 6th grade (5 years at this point). I was really taken back because she never talked about him. This was also the year I came out as Bi and learned that she also enjoyed both genders, we exchanged a few jokes.

Junior year we were placed into the advanced theater program where the whole class would focus on putting on shows. At this point I was really coming out of my shell, making a lot of friends and gathering up some self confidence. A and K had gotten back together and we were all hanging out in larger friend groups and interacting. At the time K seemed to me like a shy and slightly sensitive guy, but decent. Around the end of the first semester my feelings for A came to a head and I had a good cry , cut my hair and decided I was over it because she was happy with K and I wanted to be their friend. Confessing was never an option because it would needlessly complicate things and I was happy with having 2 great friends that were dating each other.

Then came the 2nd semester's after school play. It was a very well known musical and I was put on the lighting crew with a very good friend of mine C while K was on sound and A had been cast in ensemble. Sound and light share a booth, this is important for later. A and K had hit a bumpy road and K would confide in C and I while in the booth. The gist of the conflict without getting too detailed is, A is sending very mixed signals and K is acting as an emotional crutch and A decided to take a break. I considered K a friend and opened up to him about the feelings I once had for A and he told me he understood as she was an amazing girl but that if she didn't want to grow up I could have her ( I thought this was weird and told him I wouldn't do that to him or myself because rebounds suck.) Over the course of the next 2 or 3 months, they reconnect and separate about 3 times. Finally, K breaks it off and ghosts A, refusing to talk or reply to her. His and A's friend group completely side with K and ditch A. A is wrecked over it and I spend the last month of school comforting her and trying to emphasize that the distance will help them be better when they get back together. At this point I still have feelings for A, but I was able to put those aside and give the best advice I could (I genuinely believed it and wanted them to get back together eventually). At first I was convinced that K needed some time apart because, in his defense, though not malicious, A had begun to neglect him emotionally due to her own baggage. But as the months dragged he still refused to talk to her and this continued into the summer. At the same time I had begun to test the waters with dating so that I could ""officially get over my feelings"" but most of it was just flirting with no real end game due to me being bad at that whole thing.

Annnddd now just this last summer. A was taking the break up very hard but she was managing. I had invited her out to a few summer night outings with my friend group to help her get out house. What really cemented her place among my friends was my forming a d&amp;d party. She absolutely loved it and really cherished her new surroundings, I saw her genuinely happy for the first time that year. During this my feelings came back with a vengeance, but I maintained a hands off policy because a rebounds suck. She and I got closer and closer as Senior year started, we were talking almost everyday in person if not over text. At the same time when school started I would talk to K over lunch, he wouldn't have his lunch payed off until later in the month so I brought him breakfast bars everyday and we would talk about video-games and other related things. He was really shocked by this and thanked me. Side note, at this time my friend group really disliked K over the break up and would pressure me to make my move on A. During one of our lunch chats, K told me he was trying to branch out and get over A. This was followed by him taking a girl out on a first date that 'went well' much to A's discomfort. K then asked a separate VERY popular theater girl out, being gently rejected and him calling her every name in the book and all but spitting on her before storming off. I kinda back off of talking to him at this point as he had his lunch and was beginning to act more aggressive in general.

And then the first big after school play of the year gets cast! A is the main lead while K and I are more minor parts. The group was in a dnd session when the cast list was posted, everything stopped so we could celebrate and I called A out for how far she had come from freshman year to being the lead girl. It was about a month from the show when K suddenly approached A after almost 6 months of silence and acted like they were dating again, arm on waist and even went in for a kiss. He tells her he misses her and wants to get back together. A understandable dips and runs to tell me. I was pretty upset, as I think that was way out of line. My feelings for her were very much a thing and was a full crush so I did my best not to let that get in the way of advice but it was difficult. I ended up telling her that if she was uncomfortable then she should at least address that before anything else.

Now my current issue,

Cut to radio silence until two weeks before the show. It's Homecoming and I wanted to go with A and my friends but got sick. C is spending homecoming with me (she already graduated so she didn't bother going) when A texts the group about going because K would be with his friends doing whatever they do. I got worked up over that, on top of being sick and pissy, so I ranted to C about the whole A situation. She said I had an obsessive mindset over A and my feelings for her were keeping me from having any meaningful romantic relationships of my own (citing my flirting in junior year that the whole theater department knew about apparently) and I should confess. Best case scenario, she reciprocates my feelings, worst case, she rejects me and I can get on with my life. Ok. I decided that after the show was over and A wasn't hit with a confession on top of being the lead. Tech week gets here. Everything sucks and everybody wants to be done with this stupid show. Finally it gets here and I get scheduled for a serious surgery that would put me out of the rest of the semester starting mid November. Same day I start noticing A and K practically sitting in each other's laps, acting very couple-like. I act normal and share a few spars words and then continue on. After the show closes K gives a very public deceleration of love and his intent to marry A out of high school.

That was about 2 weeks ago and I've barley spoken to A or K, though I've gotten away with using SAT's as an excuse. I've been using the new play ( I'm light crew for this one) to avoid them in acting class and d&amp;d hasn't met for a while due to school. I don't know what to do, normally I'm a very passive person but whenever I see them I guess I get jealous really badly. I just want to be over her so I can be happy as her friend. K is kind of trying to befriend me and I tried to today, but he cursed out a freshman for sitting in a chair one of his friends had left and I wanted to leave so badly. I want to be mature about this and just be a friend because I don't want A to disappear out of my life but at the same time I can't stand being around them right now. I'm really starting to think I am obsessive because I can't just get over it. I'm just so emotionally exhausted over this and I just want to be done with it.

She doesn’t want to fall in love cause she doesn’t think it’s worth it. She came out to me as bi which Idrc cause I don’t judge people based on things like that. Thing is I love her so much tho after all those things she said just left me wondering if I should just keep trying and hang on to these feelings or let it fade away. Like she is really nice and so am I. Like idk if this sounds creepy but, I love her so much. Like I would literally take a bullet for her. I want to hug her and stay like that. Though idk if she’ll let me. Like she says if smt bad happens to her it’s a “too bad” for her. Like if someone messes with her I’m obviously going to step up. I just can’t get these feelings out of my head. Should I confess to her or just let the feelings fade away? Should I hug her and tel her how much I love her or is that just creepy?

221,"Hi Folks,

I’m sure people can relate to this, so hopefully there’s some good advice out there. 

I’ve really been feeling the existential dread lately, a problem of mine that has been seeming to recur at least every year or two since I was 11. I’m definitely an anxious person by nature, which may be personality or trauma related or both. 

My first fear is monotony. I used to do well in grade school and then okay in college (I’ve now graduated with a bachelor’s degree) but only by pulling myself through it. It always felt like forcing myself into a life I didn’t love - and that paralyzes me with dread and anxiety. It feels like the motions of life (go to school to go to college to get a job to get a home, etc; 9-5 workweek; ya know) numb my true self - I’m less creative, less joyful, less caring, less calm.

My second fear is insignificance. Kind of speaks for itself. This is where the existential dread truly kicks in. 

These fears leave me uncommitted and uncomfortable. I’m currently working a 9-5 I hate because I need the salary in order to save up to quit and commit to my passions. I’m just worried that I won’t commit, as I always seem to do, or that I will commit and the same dread will sink in. Also afraid I can’t push through the anxiety of this 9-5 long enough to save what I need (at least April 2020). 

I hope this explanation is thorough enough. Let me know if not. Any advice/perspective is appreciated.

Thanks!",24Oct2019,5
222,"So I'm looking for legal advice, but this doesn't quite meet the requirements for r/legaladvice

My dad died three weeks ago. He was a couple of years into a dementia diagnosis, so not at full capacity, and had just recently found out he had terminal cancer. 

He and my mom divorced ten years ago. He quickly remarried. My surviving sibling and I had an oftentimes contentious relationship with this woman. At his time of death, she was no longer speaking to me after sending harassing text messages which I have saved. I heard about his death from my sister, who is still in somewhat contact with her.

My father was not the type to die without a will. Easter of 2018, while he was still in his right mind, he had stated in hearing of myself, my sister, my sister's husband, and his wife, that he was going to leave me a specific sum of money and my sister a specific sum of money. I honestly can't remember if he stated anything about leaving money for my brother, but not long after that my brother lost his life. So he likely would have changed his will between now and then.

My father was not the type to die without a will. But for the past few months I'm not sure he was considered competent to make any changes. I know nothing other than what he told us that day, which my sister has also confirmed.

How do you even go about beginning the process? I know the will has to be filed. I would assume his wife is the one in possession of it, and she hates us. The only contact I've had with her since his death was a harassing facebook comment she made on a post of mine, after which I blocked her. She's also blocked on my phone. If she never files it (I haven't been able to locate the filing on any county court records search), and denies its existence (which I'm not even 100% on, other than before his illness my dad was a very intelligent and prepared man), what are our options?

Death occurred in, dad and his wife lived in, and sister lives in Florida. I moved to California two months before his passing.

I've no doubt he had a will. I don't know his wife wouldn't have attempted to change it once he was no longer fully competent (which I don't know the legality of). I feel like it surely exists, whether it benefits my sister and I or not. I know in Florida you can be held in contempt if you are the holder of the will (which I would assume his wife is) and don't file it within a certain timeframe. But if you're the holder, and don't want to file it, and no one else has proof it exists, what on earth can you do?

I've never dealt with this before. I don't even know where to begin.",24Oct2019,1
223,"I don’t even know how to preface this because of just how absurd it is to me but unfortunately there is hefty back story so bare with me. I’m a server at a restaurant and I found out that another server I work with who I became friends with and I had slept with the same person before I had been employed, she was pregnant by him at the time and I had no clue of her even existing because I had no interest in this mans personal life. She had no idea, only I knew and I don’t think the father of her child even knew I worked with her because I had 0 contact after the night I met him. Fast forward a year and a half her and I are fairly good friends, we share a lot of our personal lives with one another, she’d been questioning if we’d ever slept with the same person and asked if I had a list and I just laughed it off trying to keep my secret, after thinking about I realized she was trying to get me to admit and I was raised on the premise honesty is the best policy and so I went outside with her and I was honest, told her I had slept with him it meant nothing (I’m getting married next year) and that I was truly sorry for keeping it from her and was hoping we could remain friends..she didn’t take it so well, absolutely flipped out, called the guy for whatever reason after I asked her not to involve him because it didn’t make sense to. She was visibly upset so I asked a mutual friend of ours to check on her because she obviously didn’t want to see my face, I’m in the kitchen of my work and she loses it on me saying she wants to beat my ass and I didn’t react at all, she eventually left and I just went on with my night hoping it would blow over.

Unfortunately, she is one year younger than me and I graduated high school and moved on to college without getting the chance to share contact info, and I did have a crush on her. Just recently, I found out that she goes to the same college I go to. One day we bumped into each other and exchanged numbers. The thing is, I confessed my feelings for her and she said she wanted to just be friends. I understood and we hung out. I had a great time but after we hung out, she distanced herself from me. I assumed she just didn't want to hang out anymore because she wasn't interested in me and thought I couldn't see her as a friend, so I shot her a text acknowledging that I completely understand where she's coming from. She told me that was the case. I was sad but I told her that I'd try my best get over her and it has to be done. But I did send one last extremely long text telling her my feelings throughout every interaction we've had since H.S..

I thought she wasn't going to respond to it (understandably so) but then she revealed to me that the real reason why we can't be friends is because she has bad friendships in the past which results in her having trust issues. I was on the verge of ending it off but after her text, now I just want to find out ways to support her whenever possible. That being said, I don't want to impose myself, especially since her trust is fragile. But if we cut ties, I feel really guilty that I'm abandoning her.

231,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’m a Caucasian female with a slew of mental illnesses and childhood traumas, some of which collaborate to make it incredibly difficult to take care of my hair. 

Throw away account because I’m incredibly embarrassed and ashamed of myself. 

Without getting into all the reasons why and leaving it summed up with the above, I can’t make myself shower/wash my hair more than one or two times a month. I’ve been privately and publicly shamed for it with no positive effect, and although I also don’t want to be this way, I am what I am. 

As a result, my hair is constantly gross and I’ve started trying to think about maybe styling it so that at least my hair isn’t a forefront issue. 

I know that the easiest thing would be to cut it all off and while I’ve done it before, right down to a 1” buzz cut all over, my husband and the rest of my family absolutely hated it to the point where my husband told me he couldn’t stand to look at me while my hair was that short.

Ive even tried medium-to-high end wigs but they’re worse/harder to brush than my natural hair even with the appropriate brush. 

My current thoughts are around putting it all in braids tight enough that I can sleep in them for extended periods of time without needing to redo them. My only problem with this is that I’m very wary of disrespecting the culture these types of braids come from. It’s not for fashion or to make a statement, but would this be considered cultural appropriation?

I’d appreciate it if people from the community could give me feedback on this.

233,"My ex and I had a short rocky relationship that ended very rough and not pretty at all. She was the only person I was able to open up to as much as I did about personal things and we had gotten extremely close in those aspects. Not having ever been this way with someone, I didn’t know what to do about it , I freaked out and couldn’t control myself. I picked out all sorts of flaws and things wrong that I could to drive myself away, being the narcissist that I am. I had made some poor decisions which immediately were regretted. After many months of being broken up and both of us away at different colleges I feel a need to reach out and talk to her again. She hates me, like hate hates me. I don’t know if I should reach out or not or if I should just let it go. Someone please give me a little bit of idea. Please and thanks",24Oct2019,1
234,"I’m in college right now and I have no idea what I’m going to do in life. I don’t have a single thing I’m passionate or interested in. Every day I do the same shit; classes, gym, video games, watch something on TV. I’m bored doing all of this stuff but I literally have nothing to do to pass the time. My peers all talk about their goals and drive but I have none of this. 

I don’t find any of my classes remotely interesting and the only reason I still go is I’d feel super guilty if I failed out of college on my parents dime while others have to pay their way through. I had an internship this summer where I worked a typical 9-5 job at a real estate company and it sucked. I’d rather blow my head off than do that for the next 30 years. 

My main question is how did you discover what you wanted for a career, or even how did you discover what you were passionate about. I just feel so indifferent to everything. Even things that once brought me joy barely peak my interest. It seems like once your an adult life sucks and then you die.",24Oct2019,1

This is for all the people, teens, kids, and up, who have had parents who divorced,

Recently I've been having some troubles coping with things that have happened in the past, and i've been trying to find out if what happened to me was actually a normal thing or not. When my parents divorced, it was messy and loud and incredibly scary for a long while. Police were called, my dad was taken into police custody, phones were broken, someone ended up breaking a hand. It was messy (i think?).

On the internet, most mention of divorce is how to deal with it or properly go through with it if it involves you as one of the divorcees. There is so little out there regarding the children it could affect.

So, what are your experiences with divorce? Was there lots of fighting? Was it smooth? I genuinely don't know what the average divorce is like!! &lt;3",24Oct2019,1

245,"Ok, so the title sounds horrible, but here's the thing.

Whenever my wife needs to take a stand and fight, she backs away. I offer her advice and she does the opposite.

About 6 years ago she was the victim of workplace bullying by the owners daughter, they gave her 3 written warnings that were all uncalled for and my wife went on stress leave before quitting.

When on leave she was sent emails that had screenshots of emails between the owner, his daughter and the GM on ways they can get rid of her including things they can make up.

One of the things in the ""what can she say she did"" emails they used against her. They were from private emails. Anyway her claim was knocked back and she appealed it, she flat out refused to show them the emails and lost her case.

It all worked out in the end as she's now is a great job, but I said all along to use the emails. I found them a few years later and forwarded them onto fairwork (in Australia) and was told straight out that she would have won the case on those emails alone.

Fast forward until this week, she was a victim of a serious road rage attack and she's 25 weeks pregnant. She went into the local police station who pretty much told her there was nothing that could be done.

I chased down CCTV, I chased her witnesses and I went back to the police, I was told there was nothing that could be done.  
She wanted it left alone, I've been pushing for it to be taken further.

I've said do media (I've had a number call me wanting to do the story), the police don't seem too fussed.

I've told her that nothing will happen until the media do a story, she doesn't want to do media.

Anyway, I got a call from one of the media people who contacted me, they spoke to the police and the police said they're looking into it, within 2 minutes, I get a call from the police, the leading officer there just found out about it and is fuming, they're now looking into it.

People involved are two girls and 1 boy, not including me. 

People involved and some backstory: 


* David - great dude, but had a relationship with Emma in which he was supposedly a dick.

* Emma - Dated David, good childhood friends with Natalie

* Natalie - good friend of David and Emma (closer to Emma)

* Narrator - me, friends with everyone involved

David and Emma broke up a while ago because they both did some pretty nasty shit to each other. Regardless, it was considered to be girl code that Natalie should not talk to David although this was not explicitly stated, Emma did tell Natalie how much he hurt her. Natalie befriended David regardless, but with no ill intentions towards Emma, she had no romantic interests with him as well, David is just generally a really good dude and a great friend (I can vouch for that).

Now Emma is mad that Natalie is talking to him. Keep in mind Natalie and David are good friends, nothing more. Emma texts Natalie basically going ""you know how much he hurt me how could you do this?"" and Natalie realizes that she has been unaware the whole time and promises not to talk to David anymore. A week later, Natalie feels terrible about it but still doesn't talk to him.

Natalie has now approached me feeling bad about not talking to David because he's a genuinely caring dude outside romantic relationships. David has also approached me saying that he's noticed that Natalie is now ignoring him and proceeds to blame the entire thing on himself, unaware of the discussion between Emma and Natalie.

254,"So, tonight was an awesome night. I have an awesome job and I get to be around awesome people. Lots of awesomeness happening all around. But I still have anxiety and I know it will keep me up tonight if I dont solve this. 

Backstory: 

I work with an individual who has a developmental disability,  he is very high functioning and takes D&amp;D classes which I also participate in. We watch a show about D&amp;D every week and the show is hosted out of the same place we take the classes. We are even involved in the story that the show revolves around. ( I'm also pretty close with the DM, he was my boss at one point and we have remained good friends)  

A few weeks back I got into a car accident, leaving me to use public transportation to and from work as well as take the individual I work for to and from classes. If his classes get out late, the individuals father picks us up and then drives me home since I live about 5 mins away from where the class and show take place. 

It just so happened that, tonight, the father was going to the studio around the same time they were live streaming the show. So he offered to bring me and the individual with him and then he could drive me home afterward.  

I took this as an opportunity to mention to the individual that they were streaming the show and maybe we could watch the show from the room we play D&amp;D in while they're streaming in the other studio and then we could talk to the cast after! (I knownsome of the cast too from working with them) The individual loved that idea, so off we went.

We get there and my DM friend sees us and INVITES US INTO THE STUDIO TO WATCH THE SHOW AS THEY'RE STREAMING. It was awesome!! Neither me or the individual expected that! 

After the show we were all talking and my DM friend asked why we were at the studio and I butchered the explanation. I was just so hype from having watched the show in person that my mind boggled. 
I half explained the public transportation thing, half explained the individuals dad's part in it, left out the fact that the main reason we were there was so that the individuals father could take me home at the end of the night and overall sounded cheap. 

My anxiety:

I'm afraid that the way that I explained it made it seem like we came in hope of being invited in. Almost like we expected to be invited in. I dont want my friend to think that that was my end goal by being there, but I also dont know how to make sure he knows that without sounding insincere.... Especially with how terribly I explained our reason for being there. 

My mind is in a whirlwind right now and I dont want my friend to think any less of me for a misunderstanding.",24Oct2019,1

256,"I didn’t want my mom to worry about me and agreed to go to the ER for her sake. When I got there I told them I didn’t want to be alive anymore but I had no plans set or even hurt myself. They took me in and left me in a dark room alone for 6 hours. They finally let my mom in and all I wanted was to go home and sleep. The “psychiatrist” finally showed up and insisted on a 72 hour hold. Of course I started to panic and realized I had just had a panic attack and was not suicidal. I was finally given something for my anxiety but I was fucked at this point. My mom was crying and felt so guilty but I told her it was not her fault at all.


A few hours later I was picked up and to the place only be left in the ambulance tied down for 2 hours before I was brought in. At this point it was 1am and I was made to sign some papers and given some pills to sleep. 

Short version of what happen while I was there. I was only seen by this “psychiatrist” for a total of 2 fucken minutes. Everyday I was given hope that I would be let out but I was there for 4 days. I spent most of those days crying in the dark until my mom was allowed to visit. All my support was ripped away from me. She was only allowed to visit me for two hours in the late afternoon.  I cried and she cried. When she would leave, I would be given some anxiety pill and sleeping pill. No one there cared. It was pretty much a prison for people who’s family didn’t care about them. Not once did I see anyone else get a visitor. It was so heartbreaking. 

Now it’s been a few days that I’ve been out and my anxiety is worse then ever. I’m so fucken terrified of my mom dying now because what the hell am I going to do? I have no one else and that place made me experience how scary that is going to be. 

I cannot sleep at night. I can’t tell if it’s from the anxiety or being terrified that this is all a dream and I’ll wake up in that place again.

Later in the day I asked her about drugs and she exploded (""HOW FUCKING DARE YOU"" ""I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN"" ""YOULL HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO SEE OUR CHILD"") 

I eventually talked her down after a while and things were ok. I was over at her parents place a couple days layer to spend some time with my kid and caught a glimpse of her brother mixing up shit with orange juice in his room.

She comes in the morning to meet Amanda once, she comes in the break, she comes sometimes in the middle of a free class. Basically almost whenever possible. 

My friend wonders why Rita keeps coming to visit her. She told me they weren't even that close for her to come meet her this often. Amanda is pretty puzzled and a little weirded out. 

Also note that Amanda doesn't particularly like Rita because she's the bossy type and a little annoying and keeps playing with Amanda's hair(she has a boy cut).

262,"I’m 16 years old. I have a very busy schedule. I’m busy every day out of the week. Usually, I don’t get home from my job until 10:30 and then I don’t go to bed till 11-11:30, and I try to wake up at 5, but it turns into 5:30, sometimes (most of the time) 6. Then I have to be at school at 7. I know I don’t get as much sleep as I should be getting, but I can’t really do anything about it. I can’t afford to take less hours. As a result of long days, I have trouble waking up to my alarms. I used to have an alarm go off every five minutes from 5 to 6, but I learned to tune them out and it would wake up my family. So now I have three alarms from 5 to 5:30, thinking that I’m more likely to wake up to those. While this is true, I also can’t motivate myself to get up. I wake up to my alarms and turn them off. I tried keeping a lamp on my nightstand but I don’t have the motivation to turn that on when I wake up. I’m the kind of person that likes to be early but I am never early anymore and it frustrates me. 

Another problem is my impulse buys. I’m always driving somewhere so it’s too easy for me to just stop at the gas station to buy a soda. Maybe a candy bar. And some chips. And a gas station sandwich. I tried asking myself “do you really want this?” before a near a gas station. My answer, of course, is always no. But the dumbass part of me always says yes and always wins. And then I hate myself because now I’m broke and I didn’t even finish the soda and the chips and I had to force down the candy and sandwich. Not to mention, extremely unhealthy. It’s gets bad enough to the point where I’ve had to take money out of my savings account to get gas. I used to have $700 in savings and within a 2 month period, it came down to $40. I did get a speeding ticket and have to take about $200 from my savings for traffic school. Understandable, but not necessary if I could just not spend my money on food I don’t even want. I’ve started saving again but i know a time is going to come where o need to take money from my savings again. It still hasn’t recovered. I really want to stop but I don’t know how.

266,"There is this guy I really like, and we exchanged snapchats and talk everyday it. He started being really sexual, and we ended up sending naughty videos and talking dirty. 

But for the past 2 days, he hasn't said or implied anything sexual!! He just talks about ordinary things, opened up about his family, etc. He calls me babe and baby and replies fast, but other than that I'm not sure if he is as attracted to me as before. He hasn't talked about my body or what he would like to do to me. Now i'm thinking he is probably just busy at work, it is the middle of the week.

I would like to bring back the passionate and sexual chats we had, because it makes me feel wanted. I'm worried he's being like that to another girl.",24Oct2019,0

271,"So I am a 26 year old female and I met this really cool guy on a forum and we started chatting a lot online and then on the phone. We have so many interests and things in common and he is just so easygoing and fun to talk to. Thing is, he started confessing to me about his personal life and I have been getting more and more concerned... I was wondering what you guys think? He jerks off for 4-5 hours every single day and has at least 10,000 hours of Japanese porn on his computer. I think he has a serious thing for the Japanese content if you know what I mean reddit. lol. Weekends he has told me that he can easily reach 10 hours(of jacking off) but he also loves ""marathons"" where he jerks off all weekend and cums on Sunday. He has told me that he doesn't do much but jerk off except for when he is at work of course. I think he only has me and a couple of other online friends. I don't understand this, he seems like such a cool guy. Let's call him Jake to make things easier. Jake has also told me that he has never had a girlfriend?!? One online girlfriend in high school I guess if you could count that. I think he said that they eventually met up and only kissed. Jake is 28 right now by the way.

Jake has no real life friends and seems to be alone. He has also confessed to me that he is a virgin and doesn't really plan on changing that because he likes being a virgin. Wtf?!?!? Jake told me he tried to lose his virginity to a..you know..prostitute but he was too limp to actually penetrate her. So he blew his only chance at not being a virgin because he jerks off so much apparently?

Ok, this ones really weird.. so Jake also uses his blanket to masturbate and I've asked him if he washes it often then and he replied flatly that no he doesn't and I asked him when he last cleaned it and he said 2 years nonchalantly. I'm really concerned about Jake because I have never come across someone like this and I'm wondering what the hell I should do to help him because he seems completely immobilized by his jerk off addiction?

272,"Hello. 

First-time poster here, so forgive any ramblings. 

I work in a retail, commissions-based job, as a middle manager type (you know the deal, extra work at little to no extra pay). Just like most jobs, there are side duties that can be done on occasions where we are slow and have no customers. 

A good example is Sunday - that is a day full of a checklist that the manager on duty (me) must fill out and I take very seriously. I also do a few extra duties on top of what’s expected just because that’s the type of person that I am.  

The problem is, my coworkers (or really, in this case, subordinates) just basically sit around playing on their phones while I am running around the store doing shit. Technically, it is allowed for us to have phones out and we are all guilty of it during actual downtime, but it should be obvious that I am doing something and they could offer to help. Even sometimes I ask for assistance and I either get no response or a half-assed job. 

The real issue here isn’t so much my coworkers, but the fact that I see the same tendencies in my 13-year-old daughter. She loves playing Minecraft and watching TikTok, and will do that while I do chores. She has to be told to help, even though I have mentioned to her on multiple occasions that she will make more of an allowance if she VOLUNTEERS to help with duties around the house. 

I hate the fact that my coworkers are lazy and I have to pick up the slack, and I feel somehow that is somehow a deficiency in my management style. But also, I would like to teach my daughter the OPPOSITE of that behavior before she enters the workplace. 

So, what to do?

TL;DR - lazy coworkers who don’t help, and a daughter that doesn’t chip in on chores unless asked multiple times, how do I motivate them?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.",24Oct2019,1

276,"So, tonight was an awesome night. I have an awesome job and I get to be around awesome people. Lots of awesomeness happening all around. But I said some things that seemed cheap/ insincere and still have anxiety and I know it will keep me up tonight if I dont solve this. 

Backstory: 

I work with an individual who has a developmental disability,  he is very high functioning and takes D&amp;D classes which I also participate in. We watch a show about D&amp;D every week and the show is hosted out of the same place we take the classes. We are even involved in the story that the show revolves around. ( I'm also pretty close with the DM, he was my boss at one point and we have remained good friends)  

A few weeks back I got into a car accident, leaving me to use public transportation to and from work as well as take the individual I work for to and from classes. If his classes get out late, the individuals father picks us up and then drives me home since I live about 5 mins away from where the class and show take place. 

It just so happened that, tonight, the father was going to the studio around the same time they were live streaming the show. So he offered to bring me and the individual with him and then he could drive me home afterward.  

I took this as an opportunity to mention to the individual that they were streaming the show and maybe we could watch the show from the room we play D&amp;D in while they're streaming in the other studio and then we could talk to the cast after! (I knownsome of the cast too from working with them) The individual loved that idea, so off we went.

We get there and my DM friend sees us and INVITES US INTO THE STUDIO TO WATCH THE SHOW AS THEY'RE STREAMING. It was awesome!! Neither me or the individual expected that! 

After the show we were all talking and my DM friend asked why we were at the studio and I butchered the explanation. I was just so hype from having watched the show in person that my mind boggled. 
I half explained the public transportation thing, half explained the individuals dad's part in it, left out the fact that the main reason we were there was so that the individuals father could take me home at the end of the night and overall sounded cheap. 

My anxiety:

I'm afraid that the way that I explained it made it seem like we came in hope of being invited in. Almost like we expected to be invited in. I dont want my friend to think that that was my end goal by being there, but I also dont know how to make sure he knows that without sounding insincere.... Especially with how terribly I explained our reason for being there. 

My mind is in a whirlwind right now and I dont want my friend to think any less of me for a misunderstanding.",24Oct2019,1
277,"It’s not anything saucy, debaucherous, or dramatic. In fact we’ve had a wonderful relationship on paper, we don’t fight, we have good sexual chemistry, etc.The real issue is, I think we have differences in fundamental areas (wanting children-not wanting children, not the same sense of humor, I don’t feel like I can have deep sincere discussions with her because she tunes out or isn’t interested etc) that will not be satisfying long term.

The real issue is I’ve felt this way for a little while, but she is going to visit her family and go on vacation early next month; should I wait until she gets back to break things off, or just nip it in the bud? Things are very amicable and we’re even in love to an extent (I know that sounds odd) and I know it will hurt her a lot, so should just rip the bandaid, or wait until she’s seen her family so I don’t ruin it for her?",24Oct2019,1
278,"This is a long post but bear with me please. Also excuse typos and other errors! 
My sister (28F) recently moved to the US with her 2.5 year old daughter and her 6 month old son for her Masters degree.  She got a really amazing scholarship with a living stipend and wanted to use this opportunity to get autism therapy for her daughter who is on the spectrum, since these services were not as good as in our native country. 
She moved in temporarily with her brother in law who lived in the same city and planned to move into her own apartment in a month. Now since she was studying full time, she needed help with childcare so she hired a sitter from a website. She was tight on money and tried on a few nannies, until settling on one, let’s call her Tina. Now Tina, who was in her forties, seemed good with her children and things seemed to work out, until she noticed some concerning things. Tina was often picked up or dropped off by men who, for lack of a better description, looked like they were from the rough side of town, with tattoos and piercings etc. 
Tina was also attending classes as probation for a DUI, my sister dug around a little and found out that Tina had a previous conviction too for committing battery while under influence. Odd things started happening and Tina would at times take things like my sisters phone charger along and then return them later. 
Needless to say my sister was not okay with leaving her kids with Tina anymore so she told Tina her services were no longer needed. She didn’t have any sort of confrontation with Tina though since she was already scared and just wanted Tina to leave. 
Soon afterward however, things started getting worse. My sister commutes to her university via bus and subway and often has to make the commute late at night. One night she was coming back from university when she noticed that two men, who looked a lot like the men Tina used to hang out with (same ethnicity), had been on the subway with her and had followed her to her bus. She then got off the bus and the men got off too. This scared her of course so she ran to a nearby store and had asked for help. A lady was nice enough to drop her home. 
When she got home, she called the police and told them everything, however the officer who responded told her they couldn’t do much by what she had described. 
She stopped commuting alone for a while but a few days ago, she had to made another trip out with her kids. This time it was broad daylight and she went to a grocery store. She noticed a man tailing her again. He drove past her on a bike a couple of times and gave her a creepy grin. She freaked out and ordered an Uber home. She noticed a car following her to her apartment but she couldn’t see who was driving. She got home and locked herself in. Her Brother in law was out of city so she was freaking out by herself. She called the police again and reported the whole incident. This time she managed to take a picture of the guy who had been following her but it was grainy. The officer once again told her they couldn’t do much at the moment. 
Since my sister was in panic by now, she called up some relatives who lived a few hours away and is currently staying with them. However, she is scared and clueless about what she should do. She’s contemplating leaving the country but that would mean abandoning her daughters treatment and her education. There’s been no help from the police and she doesn’t want to move back to her apartment. We, her family, are thousands of miles away and we don’t know what to tell her. Could she be imagining things? Could this be related to the sitter? My sister believed her apartment may have been bugged too and she’s convinced something is really wrong. What should she do?",24Oct2019,1

284,"So, I'm an 18 year old, dating a 16 year old. I really like them, but I've been noticing that we've had some problems recently, mostly on my end I suppose. It's not exactly with *them*, just sorta their circumstances and habits. 

One thing you may have guessed by now, is that they are in highschool and I am not. This means I can't really see or talk to them during the day, for except one day where they have a few hours off between classes, and we will go drive somewhere on a date. A simple solution to this lack of time together would be to hangout during the night, but I can't do that either because their parents wont let them, and they won't defy them. I understand asking someone to defy their parents is a lot, but if I can't ever see you and it causes other problems between us, why should I be with you? It's not that I'm demanding, it's just kinda taxing for me. And I'm not asking to see them every day for hours; I work and I can't do that anyway, and even then that's still a lot to ask of someone. And I'm not demanding they conform to my schedule either, it's just a few hours a week is little for someone Im supposed to be in a committed relationship in. 

Next problem: their family. I understand you can't blame someone for their family, and I'm not. However, I still have to deal with their family, and her family's effects on my partner which also presents it's own problems. So there's the scheduling thing caused by their family. But then there's also the fact that I can't be near their family, not for a character judgement or something, but in what my opinion is homophobia and controlling tendencies. My partner may tell you otherwise (which is another issue). This means I can't see them perform in any extracurricular activities, or be with them if their family is in the vicinity. Their family is also a bit abusive in my opinion. One of their parents and sibling makes requests that if my partner had to perform. If they don't, they'll be punished in some way. That's typical in families, but these aren't normal request to me. They're something that the sibling or parent could have done themselves, or had to be made due to a shortfalling of the sibling or father. The requests also come often, and either take for the little freetime my partner has, or drains them of sleep they may need for work or school. The parents are also generally controlling, in ways that hurt my partner (in my opinion). 

Now, once more I must say I understand that this can't be controlled and that it's kinda typical. But I must also say that I've had a similar experience with my father. He made me even more depressed than I would be anyway (much like my partner), and was quite controlling. I did my best not to listen to him and find coping mechanisms, as well as finding ways to do what I want and lying to him. I ended my relationship to him very shortly after my 17th birthday (I was very blessed to have divorced parents and a smart mother). Why did I tell you this? Well, it's because of my experiences and my quality of being an adult that I can't help my partner much. I can say ""Don't listen to your family"", or ""Don't do that/Why can't they do that?"", or ""Just do it anyway"". However, my partner doesn't listen to me. They won't even listen to my urges to talk about their problems to their family. Which leaves me to just listen to their suffering, which, and this may be selfish, is really taxing. I'm not good at comforting people, and my response to problems is to find a solution. So it's hard when my partner has these problems, but I can't do anything about it. And I do care for them, but i can't do anything with that caring except feel empathetic. 

Okay, I know this is quite long, but I have one last thing to bring up. If you don't want to read the rest of his that's fine, and I'd still love any advice you have anyway. So, we kinda have a hard time talking. They're kind of awkward, and I'm not very talkative. But I still do my best, and I dont mind silences every so often when I'm with them. However, there's still some problems. One, we don't get to talk that much. Even if I text them, they're usually at work or school. It doesnt change the fact that we can't carry out conversations through text though. We do call every other day or so in the evening though. I would like this, if it weren't for a few things *combined*: 1) I have a hard time listening to people 2) They usually are whispering or in a loud place, making it hard to understand 3) I like to at least two things at a time, 4) They are usually preoccupied with something, meaning they don't often respond to what I say, and 5) There's a lot of silences, which I try and fail to break. So what this all means is that I have to stop what I'm doing and sit and focus on the call to talk to them, but still I can only hear them half the time. They are preoccupied with something, whether that's other people, something they're working on, driving, or falling asleep. Meaning, I have to sit through silences because they're not talking and can't listen. Oftentimes I'll try to talk, especially when they end a thought or something. I'm a pretty quiet person, so I have to think to talk and the rare times I do talk it's important to me. I can't really do it any other way. But their response when I do talk is often times silence or ""mmm"" followed by silence. And I don't know if I cant bring it back up because they may have just been disinterested or think I'm boring. Meaning: less conversations and more hurt. 

Finally that's all. Thank-you if you read any or all of this, and I'll have a lot of gratitude if you provide any advice. I understand I may be acting poorly, if you say so in any way I won't respond badly and will still listen to you. I will however continue to respond with my perspective on the situation, which hopefully won't be frustrating. If you have any questions just ask. 

Thank-you",24Oct2019,1

286,"I really don’t know who to go to about this, and I don’t feel comfortable at all talking to anyone I know personally about the situation, it makes me uncomfortable and sad to think about. I’m 19F, and if I’m being honest I don’t really remember my cousins fiancé’s age, but I think he’s closer to the age of my parents than me. We’ll call him Lucas. Tl;dr at the bottom.

My cousin lives in China, and she met this guy on POF and ever since that they’ve been together. It’s been a year now and he proposed, so now they’re engaged, and I was very happy them. Over the year they’ve been together, he’s been taking trips to China to spend time with her.

The more he spent time with our (immediate) family, the more we started to like him, and I saw him as family. I would refer to him as my cousin, even before they got engaged. I found him pretty relatable, since he was into video games like I am.

My mom, sister, and I went to visit him at work for a little, and then the 3 of us planned on walking around town after.

So after all that, we went home. My sister told me she had to tell me something. She said that Lucas texted our mother, that he felt more attracted to me, than he does my cousin, and that he wasn’t sure if he was moving to fast with my cousin or what.

I was immediately shocked, and started to tear up. I felt sad, since I genuinely saw him as family. He just gave me all this equipment to help me start streaming games, and now I feel dirty having it.

My mom doesn’t know that I know, and I don’t think my cousin does either. My mom is a lot closer to my cousin than I am, so I’m not sure if she knows. I really wish my sister didn’t tell me anything.

He’s having dinner with our family next week, and I’m not sure if I should go anymore (if he’s still invited). My boyfriend was going to come too, and I don’t think I want to tell him yet, or at all really. I’m also worried that this might cause some problems in the family, like my cousin finding out and hating me. What if they break up, and my mom starts resenting me?

I don’t know if I should keep the equipment or not either.... I really wanted to start streaming, but now I feel wrong, so I’m not sure....

I don’t hate Lucas or anything, and a part of me still very much views him as family, but I also feel conflicted. I honestly don’t know what to do, or how to process any of this.

287,"I love my dog. Times have been so hard and he’s the only one whose there for me. I’ve had him three months. He’s around 4 months old now. He’s a Belgian Malinois. I rescued him from a family who had mixed puppies and didn’t want them. he was basically dropped off at my doorstep. When I saw him everything clicked. He laid his little head down on me and fell asleep in my arms. He is my everything. My life has gone to shit. I daily debate killing myself, but this very big four month old pup is always relying on me. He keeps me alive. Issue is he’s a very hyper breed and I work all day and he refuses to potty train. So he has to constantly be kenneled and I hate seeing him kenneled and knowing he has to be kenneled at all. He just literally will not potty outside. My house is a literal sh*t show from nights I don’t kennel him. It just sucks because I hate having him kenneled all day and all night. If I don’t kennel him he will bark his ever loving ass off at night as well, resulting in complaints from my neighbors.  But I hate having him constantly kenneled so I will try to leave him out at night even if it means my mornings are constant cleaning and dog walks. He’s a good boy. He nips at me, won’t potty train, and barks at night, but I feel these are very common signs for just a very bored puppy with an owner whose never owned a dog before. I refuse to give him to anyone else. I’d never get an animal and give it away specially since he has become my only family. I just need some options so he doesn’t have to be kenneled much and barks less! He’s a very big little dog, but a huge part of my life. I’d do anything for him to keep him happy.",24Oct2019,1

I want to develop a way, some sort of morning ritual, that will cause me to fall into that hyperemotional state so that I can be productive.

I think I've realized that drugs like caffeine induce this to some degree - give me a lot of anxiety and energy as a result. Unfortunately, I'm hypersensitive to caffeine and suffer if I start consuming it regularly. I'm sure other drugs induce that state as well. Maybe that's why so many brilliant writers are alcoholics.

**If you wanna skip it all, tl;dr: Abused by Christianity as a child. Boyfriend now a christian. Went to church with him and got flashbacked into the next century. Now completely hate Christianity while he loves it. I love him but this is a PROBLEM. Help.**

Long story short, when I was young I was basically born into a cult. My mother was raped, essentially the two of us were kidnapped, and I was indoctrinated into the worst of Christianity - fire and brimstone, fear, hellfire and damnation, and that you are forever cursed to burn in hell if you don't accept god, AND he accepts you back. (that last bit is important, bear with me.)

We got out when I was fairly young, but not before I went through the whole bit of trying to be the best little christian I could - I remember praying every night, and being confused why there was never any response. What was I doing wrong? In my ignorance, I asked the priests why. It was emphasized that I was broken in some way. I was taught that as a female, my only purpose was a brood mare - to make more little Christians. No physical abuse that I remember, but a lot of mental torment.

Anyhoo, fast forward to adulthood and me and Christianity aren't exactly on the best of terms. Unfortunately I inherited a few none-too-pleasant mental illnesses from my biological father, anxiety and ADHD being in the forefront. Anxiety + existential dread = yuck. But my whole life I've tried to leave behind the fear and pain that Christianity instilled in me, the feeling of being inferior, and a slave to my own fertility. Not a huge fan, but I was doing better! And I had a wonderful boyfriend who supported me in my 'recovery', for lack of a better word. He helped me unpack and work through the damage I went through as a child. Together we were making progress.

Aaaaand now he's Christian.

He's always been very philosophical, and in the last year after he was laid off, spent a lot of time doing soul searching and  researching philosophy further. He was raised in a christian family, but had always sort of shrugged it off, and never seemed that into it in any way. And then he came to the realization that christianity is the best from a purely logical standpoint, and while he says he doesn't support what happened to me, he thinks morally it's the best teaching the world has to offer (his mantra is the vs. what scenario, and I have yet to be able to raise another religion that's 'better' than Christianity at raising a moral populace. The fact that it's through fear and terror is irrelevant.)

While this was... not comfortable to come to terms with, I love him and I was willing to try. I was raised in a cult, after all. Not 'real' Christianity. While I never expected to convert, I went to church with him in an attempt to see the good side he was clearly so enamored with. I went with tentative hope, for there were cookies and a bakeoff and smiling people.

I left even more broken than before, and my dislike of Christianity had curdled into outright hate. I'd gone hoping to see the good side, the nice side, the comforting side. I saw indoctrination, brainwashing, fear cloaked as 'love', and a screaming pastor who emphasized the brokenness of man, how we are nothing without god. For someone struggling with a broken brain and a god that won't answer, that meant that I truly am nothing.

It broke me for two weeks. I only recovered to functionality by locking the whole damn religion thing back in the pit of my head where it belongs. To his credit, my boyfriend is still here and supportive - but keeps trying to reopen that door. Just today, he wanted me to try to address what the pastor said that so bothered me. And every day now, he's watching some video of devout Christians discussing politics and spouting the glory of their god. 

I'm just so... uncomfortable. I love him, but this is becoming more and more of his identity, and I don't know how to stomach it. It's not like I WANT to hate Christianity - quite the opposite. I want to move on more than anything, and I almost had before my boyfriend had his awakening. It's almost like I'm bitter... like everyone's over there just petting this wonderful dog that gives them so much happiness and love, but when I tried it bit me and gave me rabies. I was able to ignore it for the most part until it was literally in my face every single day. And now I feel myself becoming more on edge by the day, and I hate it. But I'm not sure who to ask. I'm trying to find a therapist, but I know that I'll get worse before I get better.  Which also means I have to budget the time for several breakdowns, and that is NOT in the financial cards right now. 

This is likely a stupid rambling post, but maybe someone can get a kernel of usefulness out of it and shine a light on what I should do. People who have been hurt by Christianity, how do you move on? How can I accept this part of my boyfriend, without intrinsically also accepting that he supports the basis of what happened to me? Most importantly, how on earth do I move past this? I'm becoming a bitchier swamp witch by the day and I am not okay with that.

295,"Let me start off by saying that we are in a committed, loving relationship. We have hard times, but the good times are VERY good times, and are far more frequent. We're willing to work through any issues that come our way because we'd like to be in it for the long haul. I'm still trying to understand mania, and he's only more recently developed it so he's still learning as well.

When he's manic, he's extremely irritable and aggressive. He claims that he can't control himself when he's manic and thinks I need to just find a way to deal with it. Sometimes he spends the entire day being frustrated with every little thing I say or do, saying I'm being really annoying or getting on his nerves (when I have done absolutely nothing unusual) and other days he switches back and forth between snapping at me and acting sweet and happy. During manic phases, I'm scared to say anything at all to him in case he snaps at me. Note that I'm an extremely emotional and sensitive person. I have autism, which is something that's completely new to him so he's still learning and trying to understand it.

When he's manic, my mental health gets worse. I become extremely anxious and depressed, which only adds to his mania. We need to find a way to work on this together and come up with some sort of a solution. We've started to realize that during these days, having a little time apart to see friends or do something nice for ourselves can sometimes help, because we end up both cooling down. Sometimes this isn't always possible or convenient though, like if we're on vacation or need to go somewhere/do something together. 

On days where he's super manic, I feel as if I'm in a toxic or emotionally abusive relationship, which is extremely stressful. I shouldn't be scared to talk to my own boyfriend about my feelings because he'll only get mad. He is my number one best friend and support system, and I'm a fairly codependent person, so not being able to rely on him for support during these times is extremely difficult. I feel alone and helpless. 

I'm trying to get prescribed xanax for my anxiety in general, and maybe just take it every day during manic episodes, since I get insane amounts of anxiety and end up being overwhelmed and having really bad panic attacks (which also adds to his mania). Does this sound like a good idea? Any other suggestions or advice?

So there’s this girl that I’ve see around campus a couple times and today I saw her in the cafeteria with a group of girls and two adults and I’m like oh that must be some sort of team and sure enough I saw they had shirts that said golf on them. So I went to my schools website, hit the link under athletics which lead me to the women’s golf and sure enough I found the girl. Before you say that this was creepy I mean what else are the rosters listed for? Like if you play a sport in college you won’t exactly go unnoticed. So anyways I see her listed and underneath her name it says where she’s from, and I’ll be damned it’s a city not far where I’m from and we played against them in high school. So I’ve found her Instagram and thinking about switching my bio so that it lists what high school I graduated from and that I’m going to the same school as her. There’s no doubt she’ll recognize the name of my school and possible follow me back because we have something kinda in common.

I'm still in school working part time, if for whatever reason they cannot pay their loan I will not be able to cover it without dropping out of university.

Tonight they asked me again because they have to close the deal soon, I started arguing against signing and they said some pretty mean things.

**If you wanna skip it all, tl;dr: Abused by Christianity as a child. Boyfriend now a christian. Went to church with him and got flashbacked into the next century. Now completely hate Christianity while he loves it. I love him but this is a PROBLEM. Help.**

Long story short, when I was young I was basically born into a cult. My mother was raped, essentially the two of us were kidnapped, and I was indoctrinated into the worst of Christianity - fire and brimstone, fear, hellfire and damnation, and that you are forever cursed to burn in hell if you don't accept god, AND he accepts you back. (that last bit is important, bear with me.)

We got out when I was fairly young, but not before I went through the whole bit of trying to be the best little christian I could - I remember praying every night, and being confused why there was never any response. What was I doing wrong? In my ignorance, I asked the priests why. It was emphasized that I was broken in some way. I was taught that as a female, my only purpose was a brood mare - to make more little Christians. No physical abuse that I remember, but a lot of mental torment.

Anyhoo, fast forward to adulthood and me and Christianity aren't exactly on the best of terms. Unfortunately I inherited a few none-too-pleasant mental illnesses from my biological father, anxiety and ADHD being in the forefront. Anxiety + existential dread = yuck. But my whole life I've tried to leave behind the fear and pain that Christianity instilled in me, the feeling of being inferior, and a slave to my own fertility. Not a huge fan, but I was doing better! And I had a wonderful boyfriend who supported me in my 'recovery', for lack of a better word.

I'm already on the edge of beginning the 25th day of my life, single, but already working on a job that I feel is a safe haven (nobody there asks me anything unusual aside from things related to a job). My brother doesn't work (for 1 year already, although there was a period where he's been jobless for 3 years), but tries his best to get my attention to something, even though he's being rude almost every day.

The problem started in the beginning of October - brother wanted to make a present for me on my coming B-day, but as always, I don't know what I want, since I already have more than enough: I live, sleep and eat; I have a job; I can't wish for members of a family to change their attitude towards me and, most importantly, themselves, but that's fine. ....It seems he got tired of it. Then my brother decided I should have a normal PC instead of a laptop and then we (me included) went on a hunt for parts. The hunt was successful and we managed to make a decent PC. Yeah, it had an old HDD and PSU, but I'm already grateful for the present that my family made (even though I had to take part in obtaining the materials). That's when it got worse. (At that time, I began having sleeping troubles, but I think this issue is unrelated to the main issue)

Today my brother asked if I wanted an SSD and asked to lend some money for him to order it. When I told him that the PC family made as a present is already enough for me, he again got rude and started persuading me to. I couldn't - all I wanted right now was to sleep. At the same time, I started thinking - why am I paying for my own present? Why must I even know what present I'm getting?

At this point, I'm lost and feeling drowsy and empty. Is there anything I can do to stop my brother from doing this? Is there anything I can do to actually begin wishing/looking for something that I ""want"" (not ""need"")?",24Oct2019,1

318,"Hi,

This is my first Reddit post so please bear with me. Thank you.

I have an Asus laptop that's a little more than two years old. My brother updated the Windows OS one night without plugging in the charger, thinking that the update would finish in just several minutes. It was an automatic update, and well it lasted well over an hour. The battery life ran out, and the update didn't finish. When he came back, the laptop wouldn't proceed to the start menu anymore; it just got stuck in the loading screen with the ""Windows blah blah 38 percent updating"" message. 

We took the laptop to a service repair center. The repair guy said the HDD had to be replaced and then the system reformatted, so I bought a new one from their store. So the laptop started functioning again, and it seemed that everything was alright but only for a while. 

After around two weeks, the laptop wouldn't even boot anymore and the keyboard stopped functioning. We brought it back to the service center, and the repair guy told us the keyboard had to be disabled and that we had to buy an external keyboard and pay for more repair services.

I thought something smelled fishy, so I decided to have the laptop fixed somewhere else. But then this other computer service center tells us something worse: The motherboard is broken (!!!) and I'm better off buying a new laptop. 

I'm really, really, really just baffled about what's happening. It all started with just a failed update, so how did it come to this? The laptop was worth about $800, and my brother has been using it with extreme care (except for the one-time failed update) for two years or so.

I've been told repair shops tend to have these shenanigans to keep you coming back, and they sometimes even replace some of the expensive parts with cheap China-made ones. Whattheheck?

I'm incredibly annoyed, angry and frustrated. I don't want to shell out money to buy a brand new laptop (it's not cheap!!!).

HELP GUYS? Any insights and advice will be greatly appreciated. Should I just toss away this now useless laptop and buy a new one? Should I have it checked in yet another service center? I seriously think I can't trust any of these repair shops anymore. I feel like they intentionally broke more parts to get me to pay more. :(((

TL;DR -- Two-year-old laptop stopped functioning after a failed Windows update. Brought it to repair shop. Had the HDD replaced. Two weeks later the motherboard purportedly is broken, and laptop is now useless.",24Oct2019,3
319,"Throwaway account obviously. Sorry this will be a long one, a lot to unpack here. This all happened when my family was on holiday, me my mum, dad and my aunt, uncle and 2 cousins sharing a 4 bedroom villa in spain. My family were planning dinner and where to eat. I said I wasnt feeling great and didnt want to go out. about 9 oclock my aunt came home alone and said the others had stayed at a bar but she wanted to come back (I dont think she knew what was gonna happen fyi, same as i didnt)

Half an hour goes by, when my aunt says shes going in the shower, I stayed watching youtube on my laptop in the kitchen, some more time goes by and I need the toilet, cant go in the onsuite my aunt will be in there (so I thought) go to the shared bathroom walk in to the scene of my Aunt using a dildo on herself. I froze, I didnt know what to do or what to say.

Now this is where it really gets fucked. I've always been into older women and my aunt is hot. are you meant to find an aunt hot even if she is a pretty women? this is why I'm confused. 

A few seconds go by of just silence but It feels like an eternity but then my aunt said ""dont worry u can watch"" and restarted pleasuring herself, no idea why I still didnt leave, she had me in some sort of trance I knew this is weird but I stayed. She then stood up and grabbed my penis through my jeans and told me she wasnt being satisfied by my uncle anymore. Again this was awkward as fuck but I never left and I dont know why.

Before I knew it i was for a lack of a better term balls deep in my aunt. We did the deed and she said ""that was the best sex she'd had in years"" and she thanked me and said ""i needed that"" (I'd be prouder of myself if it wasnt such a fucked situation) she went back to her room and I went back downstairs. The rest of the holiday was awkward but nothing else happened. 

A week after the holiday she text me saying she wanted to meet me in a hotel and for me to sleep with her again and shes sent me numerous nudes and videos of her. I dont know what the hell to do or what to say to anyone about this.

TLDR
 I caught my aunt masturbating and then had sex with her and now I'm confused as fuck.

342,"Tl;dr: I think my boss is a criminal and a parasite and I want to assist an impending court case against her

So I \[23M\] started working at this company about three months ago now. I'm very iffy about the sort of work this company does and the amount they charge marginalised people (most of our clients are immigrants, non-native English speakers, mentally ill etc.) for value-less work. Today, for example, I billed a single mum $1000 ""on account of hours worked"" when I'd say less than two hours had been dedicated to her case and most of the work she could have easily done herself (filling out forms with basic details etc.). 

The best way to describe what this company does is that it connects people with debt to a lawyer. We search for people already in trouble and charge them extra for work that our lawyer does. Most of my job is marketing. We advertise to clients that we have an ""experienced team"", but really we just have a good relationship with one (1) barrister. Basically we send the barrister work, and then bill the client his fees plus our fees. The issue is that we don't do any work for the client. The whole business model works off marginalised people not knowing how to get a lawyer. Our lawyer's fine with it cos he gets a good amount of work, but he's oblivious to how much we charge.

Also, I think my boss has a crook history. Every now and then I come across documents at work relating to a court case that happened a few years ago. I can't give away many specific details but I think someone sued, or tried to sue, her for pretending to be a lawyer. She made me go through our marketing material shortly after I started there and remove anything that might suggest that we're a law firm or offering legal advice. She definitely worked at a law firm before starting this business, but rarely talks about it.

Anyway, today my boss got a call. The caller didn't say who she was but she sounded like a middle aged woman. She was asking questions like ""Are you accountants?"" and ""Are you tax agents?"" My boss kept saying ""No"" and asking her who she was, why she was calling etc. The caller just said ""We're tracking everything"" and then hung up. My boss sent the number a text asking who she was. She got a response saying ""\[LAWYER'S NAME\] SC, here to stop people like you"". She sends a message back saying she's going to report the call to the police or something, but receives nothing back.

The whole thing could be fake and just a prank call from a disgruntled client or something. But if some lawyer is preparing to sue my boss, could I get in contact with them and feed them all the evidence they need? I have access to all the invoices, client files, everything they could possibly need. I could make the case against her airtight. 

Like I said, I've only been here for three months but I can tell that something's dodgy about this place. Also, they don't pay me ridiculously well and I'm studying at the moment so I wouldn't mind losing this job. Yes, there was a confidentiality clause in my contract, but I have ways of getting around that.",24Oct2019,1
343,"Hey there,

long story short I'm really stupid, when it comes to women. I mean really stupid.
I'm from Germany and I'm currently working in Swiss for a few days. Yesterday, I was a little bored after work so I went to the neares gym.

At some point I went to the leg press. You know this thing where you sit and have to push weights 45° up. I used this device before and there is always some sort of lever, which locks the weights at some height. At some leg presses you have to figure out how to move the lever and it can be pretty tricky. So was it with this one I had here. It took me a little while how to release the lock and I think about myself, that I'm pretty nifty. Keep this in mind, I think it is important.

Where was I? Oh right, I went to the leg press, put some weights on, fiddled with the lever and started to push some weights.

Right next to me there was the shoulder press which was used by this awful pretty girl. It's an understatement to say, that she was way out of my league.  I mean she was clearly working out for some time.  Please don't consider me as superficial, but from my experience I think at some level appearance matters to most people. The shoulder press was placed in a way to the leg press, that she could look at me the whole time.

After a few minutes, she left the shoulder press and I immediately occupied it (after I removed the weights on the leg press ofc.). When I was done with my first set, she came back and put her towel on the leg press I used before.

And then... she came to me and asked me something. I couldn't understand it. Maybe because I was baffled, that a girl like her was talking to me or maybe because of her Swiss-German accent.

So I mumbled (in German) something like: ""sorry I didn't understand, could you please repeat?""

She repeated whatever she said but again, in Swiss-German and I wasn't able to understand it ... again. But it was something about weights.

So I was like: ""could you please repeat it again?... you want to know how much weight you have to use?"".

After that she tried it in German and this time I understood. She wanted to know where to apply the weights on the leg press because she had never used it before, and I was like: ""wat?"".

After my confusion settled, I showed her. And after that I sat down on the shoulder press and I watched her. The funny thing was, that she sat down and pulled the lever for the weights in no time.

So I was just sitting there in confusion. I mean she clearly had used this leg press before. All you should know is, that I'm not very confident about my body. I'm pretty thin and me going to the gym is sorta pointless. I just do it to prevent back pain.

So could anyone explain this situation to me?

356,"We were at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida when I met him. He had the fanciest watch I'd ever see and that's where it started. I got to go to France with him and meet his father and the CEO of Louis Vuitton as that who they sold their company to, we went to New York for new year's and stayed in an empty house that was furnished THAT day for us by Thierry Despont (the architect of the flame on the torch Lady Liberty holds) and got to tour his offices as well. it was all very posh and I loved it. 

this pretty girl who got her clothes in high school from Sam's Club. I fit right in, as you could imagine. my french was lacking but I could keep up. 

one day I'm at work, I get a butt dial phone call. I heard shouting, a car horn, lots of gravely sliding sounds and finally just screaming. he had his side chick on the bike with him and got caught with a butt dial during a car crash. I left him immediately. 

but being dumb and impressed with the people I had met so far, i let him talk me into coming back.

eventually i found out he was a raving lunatic, he would scream in my face til his face turned red, spit everywhere. he would break my dishes for no reason. he would insult me and just be horrible. and one time when I tried to leave, he was clinging onto the hood of the car as I tried to shake him off.

I left again and this time when he called and tried his bullshit, I broke my flip phone in half. that felt so fucking good. I drove back to my home state and back to florida. I found a job working for an airline. 

every few months since the butt dial call he has been contacting me, my friends, my neighbors (I'm guessing the real estate listing with my name on it, and the white pages.) for the past 15+ years. I have blocked his  calls, denied his fb/insta/LinkedIn requests. 

then last week he got in touch with my friend in florida and told her his 5 year old son died of cancer.  pretty fucking awful but I still didn't want anything to do with him. he is married and has kids. why does he need to talk to me?!

this morning I'm holding my phone and it pops up that mandohelico wants to be friends.   all day I spent in a panic attack. I was torn between blocking him for the 8653rd time but I didn't. I said I was sorry to hear about his son and he said he was sorry about the way he treated me. I'm guessing he's thinking all the bad things he's done and the cancer was his karma.

did I go to far? should I have kept him out my life forever? was this just because his son died and I felt badly for him? I don't know why I added him ooiun Instagram but I told him if it gets weird,  i'm out.

363,"I'll keep this to the point:

My brother suffers from horribly low self-esteem, possibly depression, and I don't know how to help.

He graduated (barely) from a decent college a few months back and has been struggling to find a job since. Recently, he managed to find one in a supermarket doing fairly menial (but important!) work; however, after 1 week he's quitting, saying the menial and monotonous nature of the work is harming his mental health, and that it's a reminder that he should be doing something 'more successful' similar to what his friends are doing. 

A bit of background: my parents took a relatively hands-off approach to parenting and if I'm being honest, spoilt us, particularly my brother. Me and my brother are quite different people, and I've always had an element of self-drive and motivation that my brother seems to lack, and so whilst the hands-off parenting approach kind of 'worked' for me, he should have been disciplined and motivated much more rigorously (imo). He's spent 90% of his waking hours the last few years either gaming or socializing, constantly going out with his friends and doing a moderate amount of drugs, particularly weed. He's never had a job. My parents are struggling with how to deal with the situation.

So, a part of me just wants to say 'get a grip, this is how the world works, you gotta do things you don't wanna do and put a shift in'. However it's becoming increasingly clear that his mental health is not in a good place. He likely suffers from some kind of generalised anxiety disorder (I would know, I've suffered from anxiety issues in the past which are now under control) and is possibly depressed - although his constant socializing with friends would be evidence against this? He routinely says things like 'I'm a failure'/ 'I'm not as successful as...' and similar things; clearly his self-esteem is at rock bottom. Me and my parents are trying to get him to talk to a mental health professional but so far he's resisting. My dad wants to take a much tougher approach, including charging him rent and possibly kicking him out the family house, whilst my mom is too loving to consider anything like that.

Any advice on how we can help him? Has anyone else dealt with a loved one in a similar situation? Any advice is truly truly appreciated x",24Oct2019,1

I was taught to clean up after myself. And I do. But I have to clean his room too?
I was taught to make money by myself and buy things that I want like a phone or computer. He bought his own phone but he was given a laptop from my mom for free! I still don't have enough money to buy myself a laptop.
He always hits me and when I hit back, but harder, it's my fault! I even tell my parents when he does something that pisses me off and guess what, they don't do shit about it.
He comes in my room without knocking while I'm undressing? My fault I didn't lock the door.
I lock the door. I get screamed about always locking my door.
I literally am going crazy. Everything is he does annoys me. He even forgot my birthday gift when ALL I ASKED was a drawing. Even my cousin who's only 2 years older than him got me something.

367,"When my husband and I were first engaged I was terrified of meeting his parents. His mother historically HATED all the previous women in his life. I was overjoyed that she didn't just like me, for the next few years she would hug me and buy me (shitty $10) presents and I felt LOVED. For the first time ever. Until I met my husband I've never felt like I actually had a family.

Recently.... the Deep South personality of my in laws has started to show. 

&amp;#x200B;

My FIL is in his 90s and starting to lose it. Last time we were there he went on a rant about n\*\*\*\*rs while praying. I wasn't there to hear it as I had been in a different room, but my husband mentioned it later in the 3hr car ride home. I WENT BALLISTIC. I don't appreciate that sort of language AT ALL. No decent human being would. Not the language, and not the mentality. I didn't mention... FIL was a minster before the dementia set in. He should certainly know better than to behave like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're coming up on the holidays and I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't mention that my husband's ""mom"" is actually his aunt, that he was adopted as a baby but his bio dad is still around. Bio dad is quite a piece of work and I've never heard him say a thing that wasn't cruel or just plain unthinking. So now I don't want to see bio dad OR adopted dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

But wait! There's more!

&amp;#x200B;

My MIL I loved so much has now crushed the heart of her granddaughter who is now expecting in January. Why? Well again, we're in the DEEP SOUTH so if you guessed ""she's not married"" then you're right. This is the sweetest young thing (early 20s, so not toooooo young) with a heart of gold and she loves her grandmother and still wants to bridge this gap that I'm afraid will continue until reconciliation is too late. My heart aches for this poor girl and my sister in law who's also being ghosted.... and the grandson as well just for the sake of affiliation. But of course, it was OK when my husband had a child out of wedlock. Southern morals for you.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I don't want to see my racist father in law for the holidays (or ever,) or my husband's asshole bio dad, or my cold-hearted ""christian"" mother in law. But I love my husband so much I wouldn't ever want to hurt him. He'd never demand that I go but quietly suffer if I don't. What the hell do I do?

373," I'm not sure if this sort of post is allowed here but I won't go into the gory details if that helps, honestly it's just been bothering me a lot and I would like some outside opinions.

So here is my story. When I was 18 I started my first ever relationship with a man (21 at the time) that I met online. It was honestly something I never expected for myself, I had never experienced male interest before (I lived quite a sheltered life) but due to personal circumstances I greatly feared that I would never meet anyone, and perhaps if I didn't allow him to pursue me I would lose my only chance of knowing what being in a relationship was like. So we met. We would end up being together for a few years, good times and bad times, he always came to visit me as often as he could and I did my best to be the best girlfriend I could be. The problem was I was incredibly uncomfortable with a lot of physical contact, but he seemed somewhat obsessed with it, it seemed whenever we were together he had to be touching me somewhere and if I complained he would get upset so I would just let it happen, I thought it was what girlfriends were supposed to do anyway. Eventually the relationship progressed to the natural step, I was terrified but agreed as I had made him wait over a year for it and I felt bad. I didn't enjoy it, it didn't happen often. The final time it did happen the assault occurred, I remember his apology being that he had ""lost himself and wasn't listening to me"". We broke up shortly after but he didn't seem to understand why, of course I no longer trusted him and the event left me in pain and shaken for days.

So years have gone by and I'm still suffering from the event, I struggle with physical contact, I flinch even if I smell someone using the same aftershave he used.  After recently telling my doctor about it and she asked me if I had ever considered taking police action against him. The trouble is as much as I worry about him doing this to other girls, I can't help but think about how it would ruin his life. If I could get it proven I know that he would face such stress and persecution, I don't know if I can do that to another person, even one that I hate. Any advice would be much appreciated, I can also go into more detail if that's helpful. Thank you for your time.",24Oct2019,0

What happened was, we met for the first time after we broke up 2 days ago. ( we were having a long distance relationship and while we were keeping in touch after our breakup, we were not able to see each other in person )

I don't know what actually happened between us but we had sex and during the sex I started regretting it talking to myself I literally fucked up this relationship because I'd been managing the situation really well after our break up, but now somehow we were having sex. Almost unwanted but almost desirable. Every piece of emotion was surging through me.

Morning after, we had breakfast together, had lunch together, talked, laughed together and everything was exactly the same as before. I felt like maybe I could give our relationship another shot if that was also what he wanted, because he was still a nice person and we we were still compatible.

The problem is, he didn’t want me as a girlfriend. He told me he still loves me and doesn’t wanna lose me, but we wouldn’t get back together, at least not in the near future. He added, he'd be okay keeping in touch with me, but somehow he's not really seeking someone to be in a relationship. He told me he would like to befriend with me not fucking each other then and asked if it would be very selfish of him talking to me while I'm not prepared to stay friends with him. I said it might be, and his eyes got watery then he started crying immediately.
I felt like he just felt really sorry that I had to go through all this.

Been living in my current townhouse for about 4 months now, everything seemed normal and was a nice neighbourhood. 
Recently about 1 1/2 months ago I realised my neighbours (the town house directly adjacent to mine) had been leaving their bins out every week and hadn’t brought them in once. It didn’t bother me at first as I thought they may have been just lazy. But then a week ago I put a notice in their mail box (for a party I was having) and they had an abundance of mail which looked like it hadn’t been check for a while. I was a bit concerned as there was no one coming in or out of the house.  I’ve only ever heard like a small bang noise come from the garage once, but that could have been wind. 
I thought they may be on holidays but why leave the bins out if you are going away for so long.

I have a feeling I'm asking the impossible, but I'd like a second opinion.   
My monthly food budget is about $328.96(3000 NOK) and today I had a dentist appointment that cost me almost all of that. I've got $21 left(200 NOK). The next payday is 15 Nov, in 22 days.   
How do I do this? 

My plan so far is to by $20 worth of bananas so I can eat them after going to the gym. Then I will eat as much as possible at work, fruit and whatever is being served in the social zones. 

Any better idea?",24Oct2019,1
397,"So a couple months ago my gf's close friend died in a climbing accident. I had met him a couple months prior and went climbing with him and my gf once but that's it, I didn't really know him or the relation with my gf but evidently they were pretty close since she was really devastated (rightfully) when she found out about his death. 

It's been 3 months now, and every week my gf posts multiple instagram stories about him saying ""I miss you"" or quotes like ""Dont hold your feelings for someone until it's too late"" every single week multiple days a week, publicly. 

I dont know how to feel about this because we have been together for more than a year and while his friend was alive.

I confronted her indirectly about this by saying stuff like ""you really miss him"" or ""i can imagine you were close friends"" but she doesnt respond with anything elaborated. 

Am I being an egoistical  douchebag by being bothered by something like this? Should I confront her directly about this?",24Oct2019,3

I used to put a lot of pride and hard work in my grades, now my lowest grade is a 73 (which is bad for me, because my lowest is avg 90). My appearance has gone downhill and I don't get ready unless it's something formal/ I have to. I don't care about my friendships as much as I used to, sure they're cool but we're just not as close.

399,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for nearly a year, and it seemed after about seven months he just dropped the effort, yes he still comes visit me, but not as often as he used to and doesn’t make half the effort to try see me like he used to. Doesn’t really bother texting me anymore or even checking if I texted him, when I go into our conversations it’s just numerous messages and questions from me without a reply. I’m starting to get sick of this, he texts all his friends and bothers with them but no me, and I don’t understand why he doesn’t want to talk to me too? I understand that the honeymoon stage is gone, but is the relationship supposed to drop this much that I barely even get a reply back. He sometimes ignores me in person and we fight every time we drink (e.g last weekend he left me drunk in a town on my own while he walked home, and his friend eventually came out to find me, not him) Every time I tell him about me being depressed or feeling suicidal, he ignores me. I’m at my wits end and I absolutely love this guy but I can feel myself gravitating away from him and wondering if I should stay because he’s just not making much effort, or should I stay and wait until he realises? I do tend to nag if he asks me something that I’ve already told him in a message that he hasn’t opened yet, and tell him maybe if he opened my message then there wouldn’t be a problem, but it just seems to make him care less, should I stop nagging and maybe he’ll realise or what? I just am really confused and I do love this guy but to me I feel as if it’s not 50/50 and it’s pushing me away. Ive stopped telling him how I feel too about depression and suicide because I feel as if I’m a burden, so I don’t think that’s the problem either. Can anyone give me advice please.",24Oct2019,1

When we were friends, we used to have nicknames we were known as. Nicknames that everyone else called us as and that we used as our Facebook username and whatnot.

So, I'd like to think of myself as a people pleaser; a bit of the self conscious type. I overthink what people think of me quite often, how I look and act Ect. But I'm pretty tired of feeling this way. Your mind can only handle so much negativity; You want that freedom to be yourself.

Sadly, I'm in that state of constantly feeding the negativity. So certain thoughts just are almost ingrained inside my noggin to the point where I can't just let things go. 

When my boyfriend may make a comment about a certain person, maybe pointing out their appearance, it makes me think, ""what does he think about me?""  Or, ""What do people think of me?""

I want to be able to not care at all, about how I am viewed, be weird and not give a shit. If there are some outcasts out there who embrace it or just people who would know how to help, I'd love to listen to some of your advice :)",24Oct2019,1
405,"Hello r/advice,

Let me give you some background information. 
I bought a bunch of old furniture out of the inheritance of my great-uncle. To me it was old junk, and it is old junk except for two chairs that have a design that catches your eyes. 

I was planning to sell those chairs and make a little father-son fund to do nice things with. I call my dad about it and he offers to do research of the chairs and sell them for me cause he was selling all sorts of stuff at the same time, and cause I know he likes to do it. What we did not know back then is that the chairs are from some world famous designer. 

After a week or so when we have contact again he puts the ad online and boom, his phone is glowing red from all the incoming calls and messages the second he put it online. He tells me this, very excited, after he already made a deal with someone. The fact that he did not console with me, who owns the chairs really put me off. But in the moment of excitement and craze he just did the deal I guess. Later he finds out who designed these chairs and he apologizes to me for making the hasty deal. 

He sold the chairs for 600 total while bids were going up and up, ending at 2000. Now my dad says he is a man of his word and he will make it up to the guy who bought for 600 by giving him 50% of the amount above 600. So for 2000 that would mean the guy would receive 700 dollars for chairs he wouldn't even end up owning. This is where I get pissed off. On this particular site where my dad places the ad there is a buttload of scamming going on and my dad is doing people favours on a platform where reputation means absolutely nothing. Because he is a 'man of his word' it meant my dad paid me 1300 instead of 2000. And paid 700 to some guy.
Other than getting a one star review and my dad going against his morale compass there would be no repercussions. 

The chairs did end up selling for 2000 and he did end up paying the man 700. 

So to finish
- Should my dad pay me the remaining 700? 
- Should my dad just have told the first guy no?",24Oct2019,2
406,"There's a guy who I'll name Alex just for simplicity. Just so you know, I am a young High school female student. I try my best in everything and I feel every guilty for every little thing I do or don't do.

Anyways, so Alex is a new student to my school and just like how I was last year, I didn't know anyone. He's kinda like and we both live in families who move around a lot.

I got close to Alex and now I would say we are very good friends. I enjoy being around him and he's been my first guy friend who I spend a lot of time with. He even comes to my house and it can just be us two for a couple hours just playing a couple video games together.

Everyone in my friend group ships us two and even kids from outside my main friend group tells me that I should start dating him.

As a kid, I've always been told that I'm not allowed to date until after high school and now that I'm older, I watch my older siblings out of high school dating someone and my parents are 24/7 talking about mistakes he's making.

So growing up like that and watching how relationships made my parents disappointed, I tried my very best to never get a crush. It wasn't until a couple days ago when my best friend told me, that she was 90% sure I had crush on him. I don't know what it feels like to have a crush and whenever she tried to tell me the signs I kept thinking that it was either he's a really good friend or he's my first guy friend I've hung around and that there's no way I would like him like that.

A couple days later, coming onto today, I keep thinking what it would be like to have a crush. I don't even know if he likes me that way. I mean my best friend says I do but I don't really know. If you want to help me he is always tapping my head, putting his arm on my shoulder and calling me short, pulling my bag everywhere, when I look up out of the window of the bus, I sometimes catch him looking at me, he's always willing to hang out with me and stuff like that. I just think that that's normal stuff guys do with their friends.

I don't know if I like him like that, but I'm starting to think I might... But like, if for any crazy reason he likes me like that, I'm not allowed to date him since I'm still in HS, so I don't know what to do.",24Oct2019,2

409,"Hi there! I (F19) need advice desperately. My best friend (F19) was in a secret relationship with a boy who follows a different religion than we do. For contextual purposes: we live in an Asian country that adheres to cultural practices very strongly.

She went and told her parents about the boy and now her parents know everything even the fact that her little sibling has helped her with meeting the boy.

Now the little sibling called crying to me saying that the mother told her that it was no point praying or following the religion if her eldest child is going to behave like this so she (the mother) might as well kill herself and go straight to hell.

My best friend when I spoke to her, just complains about her parents being unreasonable and wants to just run away.

Literally run away from her problems.

Yes, her parents are strict but she knew the outcome of what would happen if she got involved with this boy, especially since the boy's parents are pretty racist towards the community she belongs to.

The relationship is quite new and I was quite taken aback by how quickly she thought about a future with him.

I don't know whether she has genuine feelings for this boy either. 

So my question is, how do i tell my best friend that it is not just her life that is being upheaved by her forbidden relationship but she's also jeapordizing her sibling's future as well as destroying her relationships with people around her?

She gets very defensive and shuts people out when she feels like they are not on her side so I don't know how to do this in a sensitive manner.

411,"Okay, so Yesterday at around 11 p.m I got a friend request from a guy. I accepted it and like 20 minutes later he inboxed me. He sends me the wave icon, so I sent it back. He didn't respond until like 6:30 in the morning. He sent me a reply saying ""Hii"". I then responded like 4 hours later. The thing is we have been talking all day. At some times we would text consecutively but sometimes he would respond like 30 minutes after because he was at work. As I looked at his facebook profile, I kind of found him familiar. We had actually gone to middle school together but never talked, and right now I am in my last year of college. He kept messaging me all day which I guess made him interested in me I would think. I kind of cut off the conversation like 30 minutes ago because I had to do homework lol. I don't know if he will message again but if he does should I go through with it. The thing is for his work he goes to different places so he travels. Sometimes he comes back to our hometown. I know I might be taking it to an extreme but if something, were to happen between us, should I go for it. The thing is I have trust issues and I never open myself to meeting guys. I feel like they just want to play me, and I have seen it in relationships with friends. I am almost going to be done with college in like 6 months. I don't have a job right now but I plan on getting one in like 2 months. I don't drive yet but I plan on to, I just have to believe that I can. I am 22 years old so I don't know.

412,"
I’m a shy and introverted person and I prefer texting than calling and I have a friend which I met online months ago. We connected so fast due to having the same interests and I was happy that I could finally have a friend online. The first few months were mostly chatting, and it also resulted with my friend confessing to me. It didn’t end badly cause I said, “We shouldn’t rush things first however we’ll see where this friendship goes”. I’m just a bit cautious cause online relationships are risky and mostly resulted in break ups.

Anyways, we still continued chatting after that however he was a bit affectionate than usual. He sometimes suggested on calling and oh boy, did I prolong it (sorry). I’m just nervous and I don’t even know why. When I get some calls (though it’s extremely seldom), my nervousness isn’t as intense as him suggesting a call. My heart beats fast just the thought of talking to him. Could it be because I’m not used to getting frequent calls?

It took about a month after his confession that we ended up calling each other, it went well and I’m relieved. Suprisingly, I had fun. He later asks, if we could possibly have a call next week. I said, probably and it was 2 weeks later that we had another call. Then a week later before another one.

The last one, we didn't have a call although we planned it. We just prolonged the chatting, he was upset about it. I was just waiting for him to say it as always. 

He then suggested that I should be the one to give the signal to call since I'm the one who's anxious about it. I said ""If I'm the one who gives the signal then it will be for a long time cause I could go for months without a call."" He didn't mind about it though he keeps saying that he misses me within a week without a call.

And now it's been a month and a half without calls and a few chats because we've both been busy and just recently we talked and he said that this would continue for months (especially the next two months) until he's not busy. I said I figured as much cause what he's doing is important and ain't easy.

I think it's a hint that I should call but I think I'm gonna disturb him and I don't want that even though I miss him.

Will it make him happy if I suggest that we call? I've read that some guys want if the girl make the first move/initiates a situation. It makes them feel special too.

What should I do?


TLDR: 

Met a friend online, who I connected so well and he suggested in calling but I'm nervous about it. Just the thought of talking to him makes me nervous. A month later we decided to talk through call and it went well and so are the other calls.

However, the last one ended in him being upset without a call even though we planned it. We just prolonged the chatting cause I was waiting for him to say it.

He then suggested that I should be the one to say the call since I'm the who's anxious about it and it's been a month and a half without calls and few chats.

Recently, he said that this will continue for months (especially the next two) since we're gonna be busy.

I think that's a hint that I should call.

What to do?

However, as she was scrolling, I was noticing her other searches. They included about 50/50 men and women. Some of the searches, up until last week, were her ex and some guy she had a thing with right after her ex. These searches were not daily as far as I could tell. Seemed like once every few weeks. The recent guy was more frequent than her ex, but she really never seemed into him (he wanted to move forward and she didn’t want to) and did seem caught up on her ex at the beginning.

These searches were present through our whole relationship as far as I can tell.

The other guys were random guys I didn’t recognize and seemed to pretty much all be one time searches.

She messaged the lady then went to the bathroom and left her phone opened. And I know it’s not great, but I checked out her texts and messages real quick. No communication with any of these guys, and that was it.

I took on the job because I needed some serious money after not being able to find another job 4 months after leaving my previous one. I found the job alright for the first 2 months but as the year progressed, I found myself being drained mentally and physically every single day and not having the energy to get myself out of bed and in my car to go to work. What makes things worse is that I work on a target every day. Before, I was able to hit the target while still feeling tired but 2 months ago, the target was raised to what I feel is impossible for me to reach. 

In the first 2 months, I was able to fill out my routine of waking up, going to the gym, go to work, watch TV when I get home and then go to sleep.

I fail to build connections with people, I cannot make friends and no matter how much I improve myself, nothing happens. I’ve been going out and talking to people everyday and I have no luck. I’m not shy, but rather not confident 

So after going out so many times and failing, I began walking up to girls telling them “I’m a virgin and I’m horny. I really want to fuck someone” without hesitation.

I tried online dating and failed. However, I am thinking about catfishing someone with a more attractive guy.

430,"Whats up Reddit. I'm currently an undergraduate freshman studying in Hong Kong and recently I feel like my life has just been spiralling down the rabbit hole. I completed High School in Canada and had multiple universities (western, ryerson, McMaster for those of you living in Ontario) there I could've chose from to pursue my degree , but due to pressure from parents (who lived in Hong Kong) I eventually gave those options up for a supposedly more ""prestigious"" university in Hong Kong. I am not blaming my parents at all for this decision as I was the one whole ultimately made up my mind but that certainly played a big factor to my final decision. 

Fast forward to today, after experiencing approximately 2.5 months in my University and Hong Kong as a whole, I have simply become depressed and I feel like my will to study and to attend my classes has been going down. I have also found it extremely hard to make friends due to the language and cultural barrier present within the campus (Cantonese is the main language here, which i'm not fluent at) as well as the fact that I am currently not living on Campus (I commute to school) leading me to making 0 friends in my past 2 months. I have also joined clubs and participated in events etc, but  events don't happen often and I rarely see the people I meet there ever again due to a large campus.

To compound my problem even further, I am struggling severely with the material being taught here, and despite trying my utmost hardest in my subjects, maintaining a High GPA to transfer out of this University is almost impossible. People around me seem to already be very well educated on the subjects I am taking and this is apparently because their High Schools in Hong Kong already offered these courses whilst mines never has. My professor also bell curves the exams, making my results seem way worse than it really is, as I don't flat out fail my test and I study frequently.

And lastly, For those of you who already didn't know, Hong Kong is currently in the midst of a political shit-show and riots have simply just became a part of our daily lives. The atmosphere, both politically and socially has become straight up depressing, with an evident divide in society. Overall, Hong Kong just dosen't seem like a place with a really bright future, with rent prices sky high and Job competition extremely high, as well as the current political situation added on now too.

445,"Hi reddit, I need your advice. 

I employ a nanny. The lady comes in and takes care of my kid when I need to work and she's not in daycare. Nice lady and has worked with us since my daughter was 1, now she is 3. She has her issues but overall I am happy with her work. She has 2 kids, the youngest a son who's 26 now. A few days ago she came to me and asked if I can pre-pay a fairly large sum to her, an equivalent of 2-months' paycheck or a bit more. In explanation of why she needed that, she said she promised her 26-year-old son that she'd buy him a new computer (and a fancy one based on the price point) and she wants to deliver on the promise, ""because he's a good boy"". I was a bit flustered and said at the time, NO, since I couldn't afford it (my check hasn't landed yet and I'm reluctant to take that money out of savings). Yesterday she asked me again if it'd be possible, and I told her I'll think about it, now that my first fairly strong NO was ignored. What I wanted to tell her is that I think it's ridiculous that her 26-year-old son is asking her to do this, and that he's not working and is still dependant on her. At 26, I was buying stuff for my parents, not the other way around. Actually, make that 20, juggling 4 jobs and college. I think she needs to tell him to go find a job, no matter how big of a good boy he is. On the other hand, having that as a reason for discord is unpleasant, and she seems very determined to do this. I'm confused as to what should be done. Another side thought is - if she raised her kids to be like this, what will she teach my daughter?

So, should I:  
\- Give her the money because her work I'm happy with and technically can probably afford it.

\- Tell her no and suffer the consequences of an unhappy employee

\- Look for another nanny because it's a terrifying thought that she's raised both of her kids in a way that they're both still dependant while close to 30 yo",24Oct2019,3

I live with both my parents and younger brother. For most of my life, my parents have been quite restrictive (e.g. having to be able to see what I'm doing on my laptop at all times). I've been really fucking sick of it ever since they started putting these restrictions in place, and I fucking lost it tonight.

So for context: I am a bit of an introvert, but I do well at school, and have for my whole life. I am interested in technology and am familiar with linux etc. Just recently, while I was on holidays, my parents started pushing me. My dad decided to look through my phone while I was asleep (including my texts, Instagram posts, DMs, photos, even my motherfucking reddit account), and woke me up in the middle of the night to have a go at me. He went mad over the fact that I had jailbroken my iPhone, and when I tried to explain why I had done so, he would just cut in and yell. This escalated further when he brought up a post I had made on instagram and reddit, claiming I was a racist, homophobic alt-right white-supremacist (it was an ironic joke about hitler and the swastika - nothing serious). I got pretty upset by this of course, and couldn't sleep that night. I then wake up the next morning, and my dad had fucking wiped my phone and deleted my instagram account. He shouted and yelled for multiple car trips about me being a piece of shit who will never grow up to be anyone and that he thinks I can't change.


Note: *I finished my yearly examinations yesterday, for which I spent hours preparing for...*
Fast forward to today. Just after my dad got home, he asked for my phone, because he ""needs to get to the NBL (Australian Basketball comp) as fast as possible"" or some shit. I hand him my phone - and he fucking lied to me. He immediately heads to screen-time and sees that I used reddit for 2 hours and throws a fit about it, telling me he's gonna give me a ""nokia brick"" because he's ""fed up with this shit"". I tried to explain that I had no homework and that he was being unreasonable since I had just finished 7 yearly-examinations and that I deserved a bit of time to do nothing. He yells more and sends me upstairs - while he looks through all my shit again. 
 He even fucking tried to get me in trouble for changing screen time settings that he changed himself, and won't admit it.



I don't know what to do... my parents don't understand me, give all their attention to my little brother, and treat me like a fucking 5 year old. I'm so sick of this shit and I wish I could discuss my different ideas, politics and everything else without being yelled at or told I am wrong. 

The only thing I can control in my life is my laptop... my parents don't understand linux and would have no clue how to even open my browser... but the point is, they would if they could.

474,"It may be because I was only child, but I have always had a difficult time setting up boundaries with my mother. I am now 30, married, own my own home, and have a stable job. I still can't figure out how to navigate our parent/adult-child relationship.

My mother recently discovered that I had small tattoo, in memorial of a friend that had passed away. It is about 1 1/2"" x 1"" on my right forearm. I did my research before committing. I researched and interviewed artists, checked with my employer (as well a researching how tattoos would be seen in a career field I was considering moving back into). I even tried out a henna version a few times before committing. I went as far waiting until the 7th anniversary of my friend's passing before getting it, so that I could figure out if it was something I really wanted to do.

My mother is being irrational. She continues to treat me like a child even though I haven't been one for many years. I tried explaining to her what I stated above, but she wouldn't even let me begin to speak. Now I have to see her this afternoon, and I know our time together will be unbearable. She controls every conversation, and always knows which buttons to press to maximize my guilt. I know she won't be satisfied until I beg for forgivness and promise to remove it. I'm not sorry, though. I do not regret my decision, and I will keep it. How should I go about this conversation, and just begin to setup boundaries in general?",24Oct2019,3

478,"Hello everyone,

I am in a 4 months long distance relationship, and my gf wants to major medicine. At first when I met her I really was okay and supported her, but as I got to know her better, I just feel that medicine is not for her.

She is really sensitive, like really really sensitive. She does not like pain, and she always feel scared and anxious about many things. Gets emotional really easy and is clingy. She feels like crying most of times if she fails something

She wants to help people, but I still did not understand really well, I think it is more of a ""I was not able to help myself so I want to make other people happy"" But really almost every job helps people in sort of a way.

I also wanted to major medicine but gave up on it because of job availability and no prosperity, 14 years of majoring for barely 600 euros monthly pay, so it seemed really bad and I have other interests. But I just love researching about it a lot, about mental illnesses , drugs effect on conscience and brain, personality types... But I do not see her being that interested as I was, or interested at all about spending free time reading about anything medical related.

Her exam is in July next year, but I do not want to talk about it now with her, I just do not also believe she would manage to have entire day busy and just studying as she feels tired a lot from preparing chemistry, biology and driving school.

483," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

486,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I just need advice
 I'm a recent graduate who moved back home. I haven't gotten a job in my field, but this weekend I start working elsewhere in the meantime. 
 My parents have been fighting bed bugs for years, but don't have the financial backing to have an exterminator come in, so they've been fighting them on their own- sprays, diatomaceous earth, and bedbug covers for mattresses and such. Every time they think they're gone, they appear in another room; most recently mine. I can't deal with this, and I've talked to them about getting an exterminator to fumigate the house, but they just say they can't afford it and get mad at me.
 It's also hurting my relationship. My girlfriend is still in school, an hour and a half away, and we only get to see each other every few weeks, when I usually stay a few days with her. So trying not to bring them with me to see her the last few months put strain on us, and then it happened. She immediately prepped for it to stop it before it got bad and hasn't had any issues since.
 I want to move out soon, once I have my own car and can afford rent with a friend. But I have to deal with this until I do, and then have to worry about not bringing them with me. 
 I just don't know how to convince my parents that they can't do this on their own and need to save up money, but between normal life expenses and having my little sister about to go to college too, they can't find the money. But it's just gross and I don't know how much longer I can deal with it.

487,"So I made a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m someone who dated a person of a different culture for about 3 years. Everything was great- we were in love, I knew I wanted to marry this person, I thought they were truly the one. I even was starting to shop for a ring. 

Problem is that her parents did not approve of our cultural differences. I tried to do everything to keep them satisfied- convert, learn the culture, etc. However in the end we broke up because my ex decided they were tired of being pulled in 2 directions even though we truly thought we were meant to be together. 

As bad as it sounds after some time we talked and my ex said they wished the best for me and thought our breakup was honestly for the best. It’s been rough for me since I was obviously so in love with this person. We have not talked and cut all ties if social media besides one that we both have- reddit. 

So the other day I came across a reddit post with a comment from the account of my ex. It was an askreddit post and came across the comment without lurking on their account. And what I did was probably wrong. So since they know my personal account I made another one and commented back. Their comment was about an awkward first date they were discussing and I was wondering if it was recent. I asked something like “how did it go are you guys still together” and I got an answer “were still 6 months strong” or something of the sort. The problem with all this is that about 5 of those months cross with our relationship. 

With all this being said here comes my question- do I confront my ex about this? I really want some closure and the truth. If so, should I text my ex and come out directly about the comments or bring it up casually something like “did you leave me for your family or someone else or another reason?” 

I know it sounds childish but I honestly want answers and closure. Thanks for any helpful advice.",24Oct2019,1

Originally one of my female friend's told me she was starting to like one of the guy's. I didn't know either pretty well so I let it be.  
Later on though me and him got to talking about this ""event"" and how we wanted to go. No one wanted to go with us so he said we should go together. We exchanged phone number's and began to make plan's to go to this ""event"" but, in the end I bailed.
Why you may ask. Well, I knew someone else has feeling's for him. One of my friend's and I did not want to go through that situation again. Even though at this point I didn't feel anything but friendship between us I didn't want her to get the wrong idea.  The ""event"" comes and goes and neither of us went. I speak to my girl coworker and now she tells me she doesn't like him anymore. Okay cool. 
Me and him don't talk for a while but then something sparked a conversation and we texted non-stop. Not even minutes between responses. Talking about our favorite YouTube channel's, music, hobbies ect.  We decide to hang out outside of work. My thought's were we were going to hang out in a group. Now he offered to pick me up and take me to one of his favorite restaurant's. I agreed but let him know I would meet him there (I get social anxiety sometimes and knowing I drive myself and I can leave whenever makes me feel better.). 
So, we meet at the restuarant and I ask where is everyone else. He states it was just me and him. I'm like okay cool. (I have no idea if I really am just this stupid.) We start talking so much about work and video's that we kinda don't read the menu and when they came I just ordered the first thing I saw. Dinner finishes and he pulls out his card to pay stating it's his treat.  
Me being who I am and not letting other people pay for me take the receipt and pay at the register. (I also felt bad for bailing before) He attempts to take the receipt back but I'm not having it and end up paying. Afterwards we both still have free time so we walk around the plaza just talking about life and old jobs. 
Now to today
 I still write him and he writes back but I don't know if I have feelings for him. I haven't had these feelings in a long time. Even so what if I confess something and he doesn't like me back. Then I mess up another friendship and it will be awkward to work with him.

It’s my first year at my high school and I made a new friend A (not real name). Me and A were pretty close and we told eachother a lot.

Not to the point of being bestest friends but pretty good for the short amount of time that I’ve known her.

Later in the year I made another friend J, and they get along because A is a very sociable person.

But yesterday while me and a different friend were at a private class that only me and her have. A was talking about me to J.

Earlier in the term she was saying how she felt excluded and I kept saying that she can happily sit and talk with us and inviting her over.

But she told J that she feeling excluded because of me. I recently came back from a holiday and she’s saying since I came back she’s been excluded.

Me and J are a lot closer than me and A, so she told me what A said. We thought about how I’ve already offered her to come sit and talk with us yet she doesn’t take up the offer and hangs out with people she complains about.

Every morning she takes J’s seat, because she arrives later than everyone else due to her parents schedule. She always says she going to move and but never does then J has to sit alone. 

J isn’t the best at social activity and isn’t really friends with many others in our classes, yet A is friends with almost everyone.

So last night we invited his brother and his new gf over, and we watched tv, we drank, and we smoked. We were having a good time. I got pretty drunk and tired, and laid on the floor to sleep. They kept going for maybe 30 mins before it quieted down. I heard his brother go to the back to the other bedroom to sleep and my bf was snoring beside me.

Well it was like in the middle of the night I got up because I wanted water, and it was dark, and when I went back to lay down with my bf on the floor, his back was to me, so I put my arm around him, and tbh I was horny, so I started to play with him. I put my hand on him and was making him hard. I heard him whisper are you sure? So I kept going... he rolled over and pushed me on my tummy, and got on top of me and was whispering how hot I was. And we had sex.

I fell asleep and woke up before him in the morning. When I looked over it was my brother's twin!!! I was freaking out inside, I didn't say anything, I got up and hurried to our bedroom and my bf was in the bed!! So I didn't say anything, I got in and he woke up and kissed me and I was just saying I was really tired. Well he got up and went to work.

501,"So, I’m a 20 year old, male, university student who commutes to a school in the Toronto, Canada area (by car, train and bus) 4 days a week, at the same time every day I commute. 

The last leg of my commute is a bus ride from the train stop I get off at to my school and every day I sit in the back of the bus. After a couple stops, every day, this man, about late 30s to mid 40s, will get on the bus and if nobody is sitting beside me, he will always come sit beside me, no matter how empty the bus is. Today there were only about 4 other people on the bus with me when he stepped on, plenty of empty seats, and he still chooses to sit beside me. Every day he does, he passively brushes his thighs across the sides of mine (I’m pressed up against the window, I’m a bit below average height/size for an adult male and he’s about average), will rub his legs against the back of my knees and legs and whenever we turn corners he’s putting all his weight into me. He tried to make conversation with me a bit the first few times he sat near or beside me, I’m not much of a talker and get a lot of anxiety in public, so I’d give bare bones responses and refuse to make eye contact, and eventually I spend the entire ride with headphones in, not breaking gaze from the window to my left from the second I see him at the stop to when I ask to be excused from my seat when we get to my school. About half the time he will place his hand on my shoulder as I pass by him, his hand not in a restraining grab, just placed on my shoulder as I pass by.  This is the 7th week with instances like this so far, what happened today made me really consider getting another opinion on this. 

I’d just like to add, I’m bisexual, so it’s not that I’m uncomfortable with the idea of a man being into me or anything, I’d probably be just as uncomfortable if this was a woman. 

I deal with a lot of anxiety in my life, so I wanted an extra opinion on the matter to get an idea if this is something that I’m overthinking, or if this is actually creepy and something that should concern me as I do have a tendency to overreact and over analyze things.

Hi I’m 17 years old and I’m from Australia, you may say I have it good here ugh there’s living creature trying to eat me I have free healthcare, free education, help from government etc. Yes I do have these to help me yet I have completely given up on life, my life is just beginning as I graduated high school but I feel like nothing is changing I feel empty and dead inside.

I live with my parents which I, grateful for however it sucks and I want to move out but I can’t, I’m trapped. I can’t get money or a job as they need the government benefits which is money given until I’m 18 mid next year, I don’t get that much money from them due to financial issues which I can understand but I hate being at home, I’m becoming overweight and my parents blame me for eating bad and not exercising when that’s not the point because all they do is buy fast food.

Lately I haven’t been eaten at all and it’s causing a yo-yo effect.., I constantly ask for them to make better food because fast food is getting me sick and throwing up, but they just say ‘yeah okay’ I even ask to cook if they buy ingredients but they won’t let me. My dad complains I’m lazy yet sits down playing destiny all day and when I ask to get a job he says no I’m really confused on what to do I just feel so trapped and dead but every time I try and change and do something it doesn’t go the way it’s meant to.

If anyone has suggestions I’ll happily listen as I’m really tired of my parents, I know I sound selfish it’s just most of my friends already work while I’m stuck at home being overweight..",24Oct2019,2

I'm would consider myself a solid average attractiveness. I'm not big on the bars.

514,"Hi everyone and thank you for reading this,

So first off, my ex and I were together for 2 1/2 years, I was living with her pretty much every single day throughout that and we had a great relationship, some of the best times of my life were with her.

It get's complicated, so earlier on this year, I woke up one day and we were sitting together and she said out of the blue that she wanted a break, I agreed to this because there was nothing else I could do and left. After hounding her for a week because I didn't know what was going on and demanded an answer, I went back to her house after this time and asked what's going on, and she said that she wanted to break up.

A few months later, I asked her why she broke up with me but to no avail, she didn't give me a solid answer and I still don't have one, in one of her Snapchat stories on those ask me questions things, she said to someone who asked a question about what happened to us that she ""Ariana Grande'd me"" which i'm confused about still to this day. Now, she's gone through a bit of a roller coaster journey with me since we broke up but in short, I didn't take it very well and I kept trying to pester her and ask her what is going on, if there's any chance of us getting back together and all this but I realised in the end that it was a stupid move to do any of that.

She's had a small rebound relationship since us that lasted a few weeks, she's not the most mentally stable individual out there and she's been taking acid and all this to allow herself to continue through life, I know she's had multiple sexual encounters with other guys which is obviously fine but even knowing this, I still get myself worked up and angry.

Fast forward until this month, she's been on a date with a guy and we were speaking about it, she didn't seem to enthusiastic about the whole thing at least to me but she's potentially going on another date with him this weekend. I have a girlfriend who I've been seeing for the last month and she's great but seriously, I don't think I was ready to move on quite yet and I jumped the gun, and that's not fair on her at all.

I want to surprise my ex with some flowers, chocolates, the whole nine yards and say that I still care about her and I want to go on a date and break up with my current girlfriend, at least that's what my heart is telling me.

But I chased my ex for months to no avail, so my logical sense is just telling me to leave it and let her do her own thing.

I’m kinda tight on money rn and I’m debating if I should bring a gift. I was thinking a card and a $20 gift card to her favorite store. This is the first birthday that we’ve celebrated together so it’s not like she’s ever gotten me a gift, but she’s gotten our other friends gifts on their birthdays, and she’s mentioned that she “knows what she’s getting me for my birthday”.. I don’t know if anyone else is bringing a gift. Should I get her a gift card or just not bother? Also, please don’t suggest to buy her drinks/dinner instead because I don’t know how much that’s going to be and I’m not really comfortable with that.",24Oct2019,1

So I separated from the military 2 weeks ago (only served 1 year and some change) due to histrionic personality disorder, got out Honorable, got most portion of my GI bill, and I’m back home. But.. my mother isn’t accepting of that. She thinks that I have no job prospects on the civilian world and that I wouldn’t be able to manage anything in my life. Maybe she’s right or not but I want to make the best of my situation. I also have my brother who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and I understand why she’s reacting that way. How screwed am I on this? It’s been making me feel sad to think I can’t do anything if this is true. It’s even been robbing my sleep and my anxiety has spiked up. I really am trying hard to make best of my situation by actively looking for jobs and applying and getting back on track with school. Gladly I start next semester with school and still gonna be waiting on people to call me for a job interview and hopefully eventually a job offer. I just really wanna know if getting a job with my mental illness diagnosis would affect it? I’m really scared of the future financially at this point and feel lost.

I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",24Oct2019,1

525,"Yesterday was my last day at work. Long story short, I’ve worked with this individual before about four years ago and when there was opening at the place I was, she transferred wanting to work with me again. She was good at her job and it was great. And we had great a relationship. Let’s call her D. 

Now I think about it about seven months D was into the job, for some reason the office drama started and I was getting cold shoulders from my bosses. I had no idea why. 

Yesterday I got a text from my other co worker (my trustful source) that D has been showing texts from her and I to my bosses (work rants) and two other girls in the office. I was blown away with this information because I thought D and I had trust between us. I’ve supported her through her hard times, she would also support me. I can’t believe such thing. I know I can’t believe 100% since this wasn’t confirmed from D herself however all the speculation and puzzles I try to match, it makes sense. She was two face liar.   

Next week I am starting a new position at a different  location. I am afraid my previous bosses would call and tell them negative things about me. And I am mentally and emotionally distraught how someone can do that to me when I had their back.

I want to start fresh and get rid of all these mental stress/emotional I am having right now. I am traumatized to think if this will happen again at a new place. Can’t trust ANYONE.

Anyone has any advice to how to move on?",24Oct2019,3

I’ve explained we’re not and that we just like the mess about. Someone mentioned they think this girl likes me.

I’ve stopped with the flirting for a week now to see if anything changes but she’s still the same. I still don’t know whether she’s into me or not so I guess I’m asking a question with an obvious answer. Do I be upfront and tell her I’m not interested in dating her? Or ask if she feels anything toward me? The reason I’m struggling rn is because this girl has been rejected a lot and she gets upset by it a lot too and I don’t want to be one to add to that.

529,"I can provide more context if y’all want/need, but I think the best way to share what’s happening to me is an example, so here’s my current situation.



I woke up about half an hour ago, and it’s now 8:00 AM. I have a project due today at 1:30 that I have, perhaps, 20 minutes of work left to do on, and plenty of open time in my morning schedule. My other classes are fine with no project work due.


And yet, I’m absolutely terrified. I woke up with knots in my stomach, stressed about everything I have to get done, if it’s right, if it’ll be accepted, and so on. About fifteen minutes of that kind of fear passed, and suddenly my mind just mellowed out. I went in under a minute from ‘there’s so much to do you’re fucked you should change majors’ to ‘no wait I have plenty of time I’ll be okay, and this is just one class’.


Which is great, except that I know from experience by this point that I’m liable to go right back to self-loathing, fear, and panic just as quickly, and just as seemingly randomly. I’ve spent the last two months constantly flip-flopping -sometimes on a daily basis, sometimes basically hourly- between overwhelming panic and general acceptance/chill.

531,"I'm not very well at the moment. I didn't get diagnosed yet but I'm psychologically not well. I don't want to say that I'm depressed because I'm not diagnosed because I'm too afraid to go to a doctor or smth. Yesterday a friend mentioned that she will be in a hospital for a few months which hit me pretty hard. Plus I have so many tests coming up in school but I can barely learn because when I have free time I likely visit my grandma who is in hospital because of health reasons. +I'm doing a course to become a paramedic. Because of the paramedic school I have to take classes every 2 weekends plus all vacations I have in school. So basically I can't get sleep for a few weeks until I get a weekend. Also the whole depression shit that is going on at the moment is really hard.

Next week is school free for most students. Except me because I have to take classes for the paramedic shit. I really love it but I could use some spare time. But because we don't have school next week the teachers expect every student to make progress in their 18 page long essay. But I simply don't have the time to do any of it. 

Point is I have so much to do and so less time. It's really hitting me hard. I'm at an all time low at the moment with all the stress depression and friends and family in hospitals. I really want to get to a psychiatrist or smth but I don't know how and everytime I mention to my parents that I'm not well they hold me a lecture about that they are stressed too and are doing everything for me so that I have time to learn. They seem really stressed to... Even more than I am. Now I feel bad because I know what they are doing for me and that I shouldn't even be stressed because they keep the house clean so that I don't have to and can learn.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It's just to much at the moment for me to handle. And nobody takes me serious. And it's the good right to not take me serious because most of the times their even more stressed than I am.

533,"This is sorta a weird one, because I can't decide whether to be relieved or upset or depressed or what. Basically I was suddenly told by my Mum (who I live with) that my Dad was in hospital last Thursday in great pain and his cheeks had swollen massively. I don't see my dad too often, mainly cus I'm too lazy to walk that far, but we have a perfectly good relationship. So obviously this scared me quite a lot. The Doctors said worst case scenario it was cancer. He went into surgery on Friday since they needed to do that to confirm what it was, we weren't allowed to visit him so I went to work as usual. On Saturday he was well enough that we could visit him, so me and my Uncle and his girlfriend went up to see him. He was in the parking lot of the hospital walking around in a suit vaping, which just sort of makes me chuckle, as it's very him. 

That's when he told us, it was definitely cancer, in his tongue, but as soon as we learnt that he also told us that the Doctor came in on his day off to tell my Dad that it was most likely already all gone. During the surgery they cut a huge chunk of his tongue off and they're around 80% sure that they got it all. We will learn whether or not they did get it all within two weeks, but even if there is some left it will just be a few months of chemotherapy and it'll be gone. So obviously we all have a mix of emotions there, especially since our family has dealt with cancer before. I had it as a child, and the doctors thought it might leave me unable to walk, maybe that's why I feel like I'm having so much trouble dealing with this. 

The thing is, obviously my dad is not okay, he will have to go through a lot of speech therapy and even then he may never be able to talk properly again due to how much of his tongue is gone. On top of that at the moment he's in severe pain due to related infections and is having difficulty eating etc... 

The main problem with this is, I don't know how to react or treat him. I've never been good at showing my emotions to family except my Mum really. I'm trying, but I have a hard time even hugging my Dad even though I want to. We're not distant and he didn't bring me up in that 'toxic masculinity' way, hell I'm one of the least masculine fellas you can find, even had a doll as a child. However, I've always found comforting others difficult as I tend to overthink. On top of that it just makes me feel really awkward and I'm useless at it.

I've just sent him a text to say that If there's somehow anything I do to help to let me know and that i hope he feels at least a bit better soon. At least well enough to eat some good grub. (My step Mum is a very good cook) but i can't help but feel it was awkward and I don't know if I'm truly doing anything to help. 

Dad always tells me and my bro to visit as much as possible and that he misses his boys (mainly when he's had a bit to drink) but honestly I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, it was largely getting my feelings off my chest too, but I really would love some advice if anyone has any. Also apologies for poor grammar, when I type emotionally (I guess that's the accurate term) my grammar tends to take a nosedive. It will also probably be a bit rambly.

Tl;Dr: Dad has cancer, but as cancer goes it pretty light. I want to be there for him, but I'm very awkward, will sending my well wishes awkward or not cheer him up? Can anyone with a similar situation give me any advice or give your ten cents? (is that the right term?)",24Oct2019,1

538,"I have been in this position for about 2 years. My immediate supervisor and immediate coworkers are great people, although we get on each other's nerves. However, my boss's boss and same-level coworkers in other departments can be really nasty. 

My boss's boss openly gossips about her employees with other employees and encourages us to make fun of each other. The expectations are unreasonably high. I am often asked to do things by the end of the 8-hour workday that are physically impossible to complete in less than 14 hours. The manager yells at and makes fun of my department whenever we ask for help/clarification on something. She has also been telling the whole office not to help us out at all and that it's our fault that we're always behind on our work because we talk so much (we literally only talk to each other when it's required for work; my coworkers are nice people and I like them but we aren't friends). In our staff meetings, she specifically credits the other departments on all their hard work but never mentions my department at all. 

I tried to quit a while ago, which really upset my immediate supervisor.  I have been feeling so beat down and bad about myself because of this job -- I only hear about the mistakes I make, my poor performance, how I'm not fast enough or independent enough (everyone in the office has been doing this 10-35 years, I have been doing this for 2). I was genuinely shocked that anyone would actually want me to stay. I had assumed it would be a relief to get rid of me. 

He encouraged me to ask the manager for accommodations, which she agreed to. It was nice for a while, but now they're just making my life harder in other ways. Last week I accidentally walked in on a meeting I thought I was supposed to be in but actually wasn't. It shouldn't have been a big deal but none of the managers who were in the meeting have even made eye contact with me since.

I have been in an abusive relationship before and it felt a lot like this. There were enough good times to make me feel like I could take the bad, but when it got bad.... it got really bad. 

All of this says ""quit your job,"" but I have some really good reasons not to. 

First, I am getting ready to apply to grad school next year. I need two letters or recommendation, and have exactly one connection from undergrad that would be appropriate to tap. I have poured a lot of myself into this job with the hope that someone from here will write my second letter of rec. I don't have time to establish new connections. My immediate supervisor is nice but also very honest and I fear he will decline to write me a letter if I leave on bad terms.  

Two, I am in school (getting other classes out of the way before grad school) so I need a flexible schedule and good pay. I'm looking, but not finding that anywhere else. 

Third, I really don't want to leave my immediate supervisor and other immediate coworkers without me. 

Four, this is my first ""real job."" I know that coworkers and managers won't always be nice to me, work won't always be easy, and at the end of the day this is just an office that I go to for several hours a week in exchange for money. I should learn how to deal with it. I'm an extremely sensitive and hardworking person and I really just want to do a good job and be good at what I do. I need to take criticism less personally and let the office drama roll off my back better.

But at the same time... I will cry about work when I'm not even at work. I come home from work and my head is still spinning from being screamed at, overwhelmed, trying to get five million things done at once. It's taking a toll on my relationships outside of work because I can't calm down anymore. It gets better for a while, and I think I was silly to ever feel overwhelmed, and then it gets worse again and I can't function. I am in therapy and it's nice but not really helping me to cope with my job. Part of the reason I am going to grad school is because my therapist encouraged me to leave this industry due to the pressure.

What do I do? Do I stick it out for another two years (applying to my grad program in winter 2020, hoping to start the next year)? Do I leave and hope that it's better somewhere else?",24Oct2019,1
539,"So I’ve been living with one of my good friends for about 3 months now. Ever since about the second week we moved in, her boyfriend has been here everyday. I am not exaggerating when I say he’s here right when she gets off work until the second she goes. Sometimes he’s even here when she isn’t. He has his own apartment about 10 minutes away and I just don’t understand why he can’t be there. It’s gotten to the point where her and I barely speak because he is here all the time. Her boyfriend doesn’t try to talk to me either. He only talks to me if I talk to him first. He’s honestly kind of rude and it pisses me off. They are so absorbed in each other and it’s so unhealthy. I want to talk to her about her boyfriend being here all the time, but I don’t want to make things awkward. I’m not good with confrontation.

541,"I \[23M\] am looking to rent out a room in an apartment in a major city. I have found this great room in this great apartment that I'd share with 2 other people. The room itself is a decent sized room, however it also includes a loft inside the room. The room has a decently high ceiling (10-12 ft) and plenty of space for everything I need (desk, drawers, couch, tv). The loft has enough room for a king bed, little bedside table, basically its enough for my current needs. You can't quite stand all the way up, but its close (I'm also not tall so not really an issue). My question is whether having your bed in a loft becomes annoying having to go up and down stairs to get in bed/access bathroom in middle of the night, is childish/not a good setup for a young professional. My initial thought was that it was a cool idea and also would allow me to have basically 1.5 rooms for the price of 1. Any and all advice or experience with a similar setup would be greatly appreciated.",24Oct2019,1
542,"I’ll try to keep this short and simple. My boyfriend and I got invited to a Halloween party on saturday night by one of my coworkers.  I have/had a group of coworkers I was very close with. We’re all in our early twenties and party together and i have even taken 2 vacations with this group of people. Three of the people in the group are my best friend of 7 years (let’s call her Alice) &amp; a couple (let’s call them Bella and Edward).  Bella is the one who invited me. I have gone to tons of their parties before. I was surprised about the invite because I have recently found out Bella is constantly talking bad about me behind my back and tries to start drama. I confronted her over text and got no response.  We literally have never spoken about it because work isn’t the time or place and we don’t hang out anymore. That was a month ago. At the same time, Alice &amp; I had had a small dispute that we got over quickly. Edward was apart of the dispute &amp; got caught talking crap (just like his girlfriend) and now won’t speak to either me or Alice. My boyfriend isn’t very fond of these people because of the immature drama they’ve put me through these past couple weeks. When talking to my best friend about the party she said “oh, i’ve known about it for weeks. i just haven’t mentioned it to you because i wasn’t sure if you’d be invited.” She tells me i shouldn’t hold a grudge and should come to the party. she also got annoyed when i mentioned a potential costume for my boyfriend because her boyfriend is already going to be that. I’ve told all of this to my boyfriend and he doesnt think i should go, but will go with me regardless for support. There are a few of our other coworkers who want me there who are going. I want to go because I want the social interaction, but do i really want to go to THEIR party after they’ve been dicks to me these past 3 months with no apology? I also feel like if i don’t go they’re gonna talk and accuse me of isolating myself with my boyfriend (another reason they’ve been asses). I know this is all very immature but I just want to know what you all would do. Should i go to the party?",24Oct2019,1

544,"(Tldr below) 
I just got married last month and we have a one year old child together. I have been attending a very expensive cosmetology school since June. I took cosmetology in high school 10 years ago, but I only completed half the program because I felt like I didn’t fit in. I decided to go back because I felt like I’d been floundering in my professional life, and even though my husband tells me I can stay home, we are barely holding on financially and I wanted to contribute. 
I realized last month that while I enjoy going to school and being around the girls, (I’m 26f and very social). I had been avoiding clients and dreading doing actual services. I only liked the downtime. 2 weeks ago, after having a talk with my supportive husband, I stopped going to class. I realized I don’t want to have a career that involves hustling to get clients, being on my feet all day, and really no consistency. I wouldn’t even say I have a passion for hair. I do enjoy cutting hair but that’s more of, I enjoy doing one haircut on a Saturday then I’m done. 
Also, the schedule makes doing anything jobwise outside of school nearly impossible, especially with a family. I go m-w 8a-7p. I definitely feel like I can be better using the time to bring in money to my household. 
When I told my school friends I was dropping class, they kind of just told me that sucks and removed me from their group chat. That really hurt as I have a lot of abandonment issues, but I understand. 
With way attendance works at the school, if I don’t show up Monday, I’ll be dropped from the program. If I quit now, we will only have to pay back half of my loan, which is just a quarter of tuition as I had grants as well. 
Part of me wants to stick it out but I feel like that’s the part of me that’s driven by fear of abandonment and letting people down. I also feel like I’m failing my family because I was so excited for this when I started, mostly because I was gonna have stability and a career. I’ve been scouring the internet all week trying to find something to validate my choices, but I just feel guilty.

Can someone please help guide me to what I need to do? 

Tldr: As a wife and mother in a financially struggling family, should I quit cosmetology school for good knowing that I most likely won’t want to pursue it as a career, or stick it out and hope for the best?",24Oct2019,1

Wasn't sure where else to post it and was having trouble finding stuff on google. I asked my parents and they don't know what it is either.

I'm not sure and I'm going to ask about it). Then it says backtime below that (in the earnings section) and it takes out a bunch of money in backtime, nullifying the extra money and leaving me with less than I got last time I worked that long (less than $100, which messes up my budget a bit).

557,"To preface this, we are a mildly dysfunctional family.
My mother raised me and my brother mostly by herself, and her communication issues that seem to border on aspergers have somewhat been passed down to me (17) and my brother (16). The aspergers comment was hyperbolic, but I said that to highlight just how fraught communication between us is.
Not on a daily level. On the daily level, things are just fine, she's an amazing mother and I really love her. But when it comes to medium-big issues, she can be really unpredictable in how she chooses to handle things, because she overthinks things *a lot*, and my brother and I, being equally incapable of talking things out, encourage this behaviour. 

When I went to see her (living with dad atm) , she slipped into the conversation quite casually that she went to the GP about several lumps in her breasts. Me and my brother were completely silent. I just kinda stared, and my brother just looked up from his phone all panicked then went back to his phone as if he wasn't listening. No one knew what to say. My mum looked really unusual, because she doesn't usually do that kind of face, which made me even more worried, but that kind of thing doesn't usually show on my face. 

Im just like, uhh... Its not, uh.... Cancer is it? And she's like i dont know. Very possible they're just cysts, and I pull out my phone to google the likelyhood that its cancer, and my mum being a black woman and the lumps being movable, it turned out that yes, it's possible they're just cysts. I said something about that. I dont remember how the conversation ended, but it eneded pretty quickly.

Next time I saw her, about a two months later, I was staying with her for her to look after me after my wisdom teeth were pulled. The night I was leaving, actually as I was going out the door, I hugged her, and asked if she found out for sure what the lumps were and she said yeah, they're cysts. I said thank god and all that and left. 

I don't really believe she's telling the truth.  I've lived with her for 16 years, and I could tell she was overthinking something when she told me that. She said it so quickly and basically pushed me out the door. 
If there's a cancer scare, wouldn't it be the normal thing to do be to call your child and tell them that there's no cancer? Why would she only tell me when I ask? But the thing is, that's also the kind of thing I can kind of imagine her doing, but I find it hard to believe anyone is that autistic.
I'm worried if it's because of the way we reacted when she first told us about the lumps. It was so awkward, and the way she said it, it was like she was testing the water. I feel like her thought process is that, we are so unable to handle it properly when it *might* be cancer, that she couldn't trust to be normal if it *is* cancer.

My mum is also exactly the type who would hide it until she's right about to die just because she doesn't want to worry us or be the centre of attention. I swear, she would actually do that.
   Plus, she's so glad I'm finally seem like I'm doing well. I moved in with my dad after a mental health scare and two month hospital stay and she was *so* fucking stressed during the time I had been home right after discharge that I ended up asking to go live with my dad, and she was happy I was going somewhere else if it meant I'd be happier. I just know she would hide cancer if it meant I'd be okay. She would genuinely do that.

I don't know what to do. If she does have cancer and she doesn't want to tell me, do I just leave it alone? If it was anything else, I'd do that, but that feels really wrong in this case. We dont express it a lot, but I love her and I know she loves me. Anything she does, I know she'd do it out of love for me and my brother, but if she does have cancer, and she doesn't tell me and my brother until it's late, that would be really really stupid on a lot of levels.

But if I ask if  she lied to me, I have no idea how she'd react. She'd a) dig her heels in, or blow up at me for accusing her of lying wether she was telling the truth or not, or b) break down and tell me the truth. How do I ask? What if she actually does have fucking cancer, which I'm startinf ti believe is the truth? What do I even do? How do I react? I don't. Know what to do. I haven't even talked to my brother about this. I have no idea what he's thinking, but he's equally as good at sniffing out my mums bullshit as I am. I dont know what to do here.",24Oct2019,1

We were very close. 
She’s repeatedly broken up with me as a friend for various reasons and then comes back with what she claims are valid reasons for why she dumped me. 

The last time she sent me a message out of nowhere saying that she realized she does not want to be my friend anymore because of her reasons. I said ok, not sure what I did to you but I wish you the best and I’m no longer able to trust you the more you do this. I’m 25 and feel as though I’m too old to be doing this over and over again, If someone wants to walk out of my life, so be it. I was born alone and can stand alone no matter what. 

She comes back about 4 months later accusing me of not caring that she walked away, not valuing her opinion about my relationship and things she accused me of doing in my relationship. And a slew of other things from years and years ago that I apologized for when she misunderstood or anything that I’ve done where I was at fault. 

We talked it out. We’ve been trying to set up times to hang out but some part of me still holds resentment that she repeatedly has told me that she does not want to be my friend anymore but that I still forgive her when she comes back. 

I chalk it up to her own insecurities or struggles that she projects onto me and even admit my own fault to myself and to her when I feel it’s due.

Now that I'm moving out soon for college and I'll be on my own, it might really help me when I most need it.

I'm \*extremely\* hesitant though. For one, I'm afraid it'll reduce job opportunities. As in, I can't go to some workplaces with it. Secondly, I'd hate to put my family through the process of getting a service animal, and I already have dogs in my house that may conflict with it. Thirdly, I'm afraid it might not even help. I can see how it \*could\* help, as I get triggered a lot and have ""episodes"" quite frequently, but I'm worried that I'll go through this trouble only to waste everyone else's time.

That being said, having somebody to help me when I'm terrified to even go outside or see other people would be life-changing. I've gotten better with that, but I'm still struggling. 

I'm afraid I'll fuck things up, but should I seriously consider this?",24Oct2019,9

For starters, I make sex jokes a lot, but never implying that I want to do things to other people. Stuff like ‘lol ok suck my dick’ is one of the things I do say, but never like ‘we’re the only ones here ;))))’  bc I do have a boyfriend and it would make everyone uncomfortable. I am a bisexual girl with a preference for vaginas bc I’ve never had tried dick before (my boyfriend is a pre-op trans guy) so there is literally no way I could try dick without cheating or taking a break. Bf is okay with this, we’re using what we have atm.

To the point: My coworker Matthew is a 39 year old straight guy who I got close to because we’re open about our lives (huge mistake) and because we both like girls.

On Monday we started asking each other (and another coworker/driver who later left for a delivery) what would we do for $1 million. I asked him what he would never do but would do for that amount of money. He didn’t come up with anything and he then asked me the same. I jokingly said ‘I would suck dick’ bc I joke about never doing it before and really can’t atm (it’s all a game so rules don’t apply). We laughed about it then went back to work.

Around 10:40pm, I was on the phone with my boyfriend when Matthew texted me saying a comment I had said made him ‘feel funny.’ I thought I had crossed a line and said something fucked up (he makes fucked up jokes, I tend to just make fun of him) and I asked him what was it. He kept saying he couldn’t say it and that I wouldn’t like it so I “threatened” to complain that he made my order wrong and I was unhappy with it.
After a few more texts about us joking around, he gave in and said:

Matthew: When u made that comment about sucking dick.. it turned me on a lil 🤤

I got disgusted and told him to unsend it and he said it was too late and tried changing the subject. I started crying because this was the second time he has made a comment like this but I had called him out and he said he wouldn’t do it again hence him hesitating to tell me. I hesitated to tell my boyfriend as I felt disgusted with myself as I am younger and I feel like this is my fault. He said it was okay and that he wasn’t mad at me, Matthew said it and I didn’t provoke him in any way (he’s way older and I made sure to never imply anything).

I know it isn’t like other people’s problems but I cry thinking I’m about to go to work soon and I don’t want to go. He ruined a good friendship and I feel unsafe now. I can’t tell a supervisor as it’s already a shit show.

I have his Discord and stuff where we've chatted one-on-one a little along with in a group chat. But, I digress. Last night during stage crew for the fall play, he seemed to start sitting closer and closer to me gradually. Like normal, he helped me with most of my tasks and stood by me a lot, following me back and forth on stage a bit to keep me company. When I sat down to do  a painting job, we started randomly talking. Eventually, the conversation took an odd direction. He began to say something but hesitated and decided not to, to which I told him along t he lines of, ""Well now I'm curious! Just say it!"" He then told me he sleeps naked. I didn't really know how to respond, so I just (truthfully) responded that I do too. We then proceed to talk in depth about how it's more comfortable to wear no clothes to bed and stuff. Shortly after, he removes his flannel which lifts his undershirt a great bit. Not sure if it was intentional or not, or if including this is even necessary. Overall he just really compliments my painting a lot and is really nice. I like to be around him and he really just makes me feel like a good person.

My skill level in IT is entry level at best. I went to school for it (votech) and went to college for 6 months for ITNA. Didnt like their program so I dropped out and got a job at uhaul as a mechanic. I've been here for two years and I know alot of stuff is automotive now and only some in IT.

The interview today for the IT job is over the phone. I always butcher these. Idk I guess it's because it's over the phone and I seem to get nervous easier.

Because I don't know everything but I'm a fast learner and can figure things out on my own if need be easily.

Example here is: yesterday I got a call from another IT job I applied for that was ""entry level"" and they asked ""have you ever used active directory and are you proficient in it?"" And I said ""yes I have but only a little bit"" and he replied ""well you dont seem cut out for the job, sorry have a nice day"" and hung up. Ok I've used AD before but I dont know everything about it. You'd have to kinda show me around it a bit but once I'm caught up I'm fine and I'll catch on quickly. This is an entry level job wtf.

Me and my best friend know each other from 7 or 8 years. We always did everything together, whenever one of us had a problem the other one was always here to help, when I had problems with my family she even hosted me for like an entirely year. But lately she met new friends and people, me as well too, but unlike me she seems to have changed the rapport we had before. It seems like sometimes she's irritated by my presence, she seems irritated even by the way I speak or I act normally. She has acquired a different tone, the way she talk to me now is all ""know-it-all"", she always make me feel like I'm stupid or something. This really sucks. When we are with our company or with other people she acts normal like she used to be.. but when we're alone she start with the attitude again. She's really treating like I'm some sort of perfect idiot, or just like my level is not high enough to get treaten well. And it happens WHENEVER I say something, sometimes I'm even afraid if what I have to say is something that I can say out loud, and it's stupid because I know a friendship is supposed to make you feel comfortable enough to let you be yourself. She's acting like this for a month now. Like this, every single day. 
Lately I let some ""toxic"" friendship go (3 in total, based on the advice of this my best friend too), and I'm so sick to continuously close good friendships, especially this one in particular. I'm afraid to say all this things to her, because every time I try it seems like she doesn't know what I'm talking about.

Today, there was a girl at the gym. She was standing in my way clearly waiting for me to say something to her. I ignored her and grabbed my weights.

I saw her again and she looked at me, like arms length from my face, and I ignored her even though I felt obligated to say something and she eye balled me. 

This isn't the only time this has happened. My bullies were primarily female growing up. From 7th to 9th grade I was bullied by girls for being weird or fat. I was a fat kid growing up and was homeschooled. I was quiet because I was more matured at my age due to my parents divorce when I was 12.  So they thought I was weird and fun to fuck with. I was never really normal but I kept to myself. 

I'm not sure what to do but I don't know how to interact with women. I'm honestly fucking afraid of them because of the implications if I mess up or am misinterpreted. It's so easy to make men look like rapists in public. It's so easy for a story to change if she wants to play that way. I don't know what to do as this has started to affect me professionally. I had a female boss who I directly reported to and I was so afraid of her.

How can I stop being scared of women? They were my largest source of public humiliation growing up and it has certainly conditioned me to never assume anything good comes from interacting with women.

I'm not afraid of my mom, sister, or family though. I recognize this and I see it doesn't make sense but I dont know what to do about it because even though I'm aware of the issue it keeps happening.",24Oct2019,26
577,"Hi everyone,

I'm 23 and have a decent job as an Analyst at a Fortune 500 company. I don't hate what I do, but I'm unhappy due to a combination of team/HR issues and a lack of interest in learning more technical skills that would boost my career path. 

I really enjoy the ""project management"" aspect of the job - talking with coworkers, learning more about their day-to-day, and creating tools/driving efficiency. Because of this, I'm thinking about transitioning to a sales career. 

However, I've never really done anything with sales and I'm afraid I'd be taking a pay cut to ""test out"" a new career path.

580,"I didn’t know how to word the title excuse me, but I feel like I have no direction, and for the first time ever. I’m genuinely frustrated.

Alright so my day basically consists of; Work, Gym, Go home, play games and go to sleep. Rinse, and repeat. This cycle has basically gone on since mid June or basically once the feeling of graduating high school wore off. I didn’t go to college because I wanted a year break + I wanted to use that year to also decide if I should even consider college as an option because of the huge debt, and I don’t know what I want to do anyways. My goal is to basically secure a career that I love, but I don’t know what I love lol. I’m a huge sports guy so maybe I could look into that, but I also wanna be my own boss. Own my own business, stuff like that. I don’t wanna get stuck in a dead end job, and be unhappy with my position by the time I’m 40. Lately I’ve been just going to college, and get my degree in something like nuclear engineering or something that’s in actual demand as I have no real interest in anything so why not chase something that could guarantee something like 80-100k a year that nobody really knows about? 

Also let me tell y’all about my shitty social life :)

So like I told y’all earlier. My life consists of work, Gym, home, video games and sleep. What does that mean? I have basically no friends. I tend to use this excuse for my lack of social skills, but I was depressed a couple years ago because a lot happened to me and to people I loved so I kind of cut everybody off and basically stopped talking to really anybody for a year. My social skills left the window. I used to be able to hold conversations, I could talk for hours, I was what you called. A social butterfly. After that fiasco that happened a year later, I’m the quiet guy that doesn’t talk and is a hermit. Now I’ve gotten better over the last year with the help of a friend (F) but she’s gone to college so I’m basically by myself lol. 

Anyways I’m just frustrated because I have no direction. I have no true interests outside of sports and overall. Life sucks. 

I need advice lol. I don’t want y’all to think I need answers as I need to figure this shit out on my own, but advice would definitely help.",24Oct2019,1

It was a simple task, it took me like 5 minutes to solve those online quizzes so It wasn't like I was giving them my time for free on a massive task.

Anyway when I finished the work the kid laughs when I sent him my address to complete the payment and said ""hahaha definitely not"", So the thing is I have logins data that they haven't change, **I could contact their Teachers and spill all the truth, even the parent of one of the kids, I can also retake my quizzes and make them fail, even the quizzes that I didn't take for them.**

Hello all! I’m not sure if questions about yourself like this are allowed, but I feel like I need to ask. I always type posts like this, but never end up posting them?!
Do you think my life is fine enough.... or do you think my head is seriously causing issues? I don’t know. I don’t even know if I have adhd/add, but people have suggested that I do. And others have even TOLD ME I do. Like they were certain. Does this sound like it?! do u think I should get help.
-dad has adhd
-he always tells me that my mind goes “a million miles per hour” but honestly, I feel like I can’t feel my thoughts going quick but I know he’s most likely right because I’m super talkative,a fast texter, can always think of something to say but I don’t FEEL it?sometimes I feel empty headed.
-people say I talk fast. And am loud. I get told to be quiet, I can’t hear my voice being too loud?
-I feel like I’m QUICK but slow?!im literally so lazy and I’m sitting on my bed right now with a giant mess every where .but I always have so many plans and goals to accomplish! -I quit school every single time that I promise to finish. This is the main reason I feel like I need to seek help.... ever since 6th grade I’ve had a problem with attendance I don’t think I’ve ever gone a full week since then. And now I’m in 10th. I’ve wasted years. And I don’t really leave my house, but at the same time I DO A LOT and have so many experiences and friendships. Also:what’s going through my mind is “will this seem like it’s written by an add person?, should I type it in a different way?”
-have been told I have no filter 
-quit school again for like the 4th time after 2 weeks, decided to do online school but I literally haven’t done any assignments in over a week . And haven’t been thinking about it I’ve been focusing on self improvement. And reading?
-am super worried that I will be able to find no job that I can COMMIT too. Omg. 
-ugh I love words and conversation and I ask EVERYONE questions. I’m the opposite of “don’t talk unless I’m talked to” 
-change my mindset a lot?! 
-I literally cannot focus on anything boring at all even though I get excited of the thought of learning things.especially in school 
-overly confident but care WAY too much what people think of me. At school I couldn’t think much of anything else besides what everyone was thinking of me! Even though I knew at the same time they weren’t.
-used to be convinced I was autistic 
-love attention, and I get it (: 
-NEW BOYS CONSTANTLY. 
-want to go to college but I have no clue how that will even be possible for me, I GIVE UP. and I know I’m in control but I seriously feel like I HAVE NO CHOICE. I literally cannot because I’m LAZY?! 
-constantly yelled at by my parents for stomping too loud?! 😂
-the boy I’m currently talking to says I’m super forgetful so does my bestie but I actually thought I remembered better than most people lol, but I get it 
-omg i journal and I’m way too personal in my journal. So embarrassingly personal.used to feel derealization I think. 
-self control problem. Drugs and drinking problem. I drink soo much and smoke weed and I’ve taken lsd and pills. I notice I feel way more active when I’m sober.! Like I can’t stop talking. Like I have so many words to share. That nobody even cares to hear probs, but at the same time people say I always have something interesting to say.
Btw my mbti is most likely:ISFP
I’m super shy btw, well it’s more like I get shyer the more I get to know someone. Like I’m super loud and obnoxious, but I can also recall going to my besties house one time and didn’t even say a word once cause I was so shy 😂
Omg I’m so shy that I feel pain and boredom that I wish I could talk because talking gives me pleasure. 
This is so embarrassing, nobody even cares huh😂but I’m gonna post it anyway. 
-an ex guy I liked told me that My worst quality is bringing up topics I shouldn’t, being insensitive but he said it’s cute like I a little kid. I think I do it because it brings thrill to the convo? 
-OH GOD, I’m terrible with secrets. I literally confess everything. Even secrets that aren’t mine. I feel like I CAN keep a secret, but in actuality I cannot. 
-repeat mistakes 
-careless 
-had a fun summer and had the police called and I was “missing” 
- I feel like I have a life people crave though, the fun part of it, and I love talking about myself and I always ask my parents questions about my mind. I used to think I was autistic and would type essays explaining why and honestly it made so much sense. 
-walk weird, am pigeon toed 
-used to have an eating disorder. First time calling it that actually. Threw up my food
-I literally send long text messages to my besties every single day and always feel guilty about annoying them but I can’t seem to stop. But they still text me everyday 😂
-quit everything. Quit softball,quit singing,quit dancing,quit basketball and soccer 
I used to dance around crazily in my house but maybe that’s being a young kid. Oh I jump a lot! And I used to spin and be distracted when i played soccer when I was like 5. 
-Used to be smart?!advanced classes, good grades, leadership. Do I sound stupid btw? but it all ended in middle school, people think I’m stupid and maybe I am. But my brother says I have smart clever humor, but im also such a dummy and I used to touch my hair nervously without even noticing 
Why am I typing so much ? It’s fun 😭😂
-get told I’m ALWAYS smiling. People will say”You missed me didn’t you?” Im always laughing and happy and positive 
-have been told a lot I’m the nicest person people have met and I’m super loving!!. I have no mean attitude problem 
-IM A STARER. Do you think I need to fix this?! I literally stare at people so much, people have told me they think I don’t like them because of the glares but I’m staring out of amusement! I love people
-used to be obsessed with mbti and literally thought I was each type at one point except the judging ones.

I live in California and I don’t have a car. I can get around pretty good on the bus and I’m saving for a car right now. 

Fitness is my number one hobby and has been for 8 years now. I never take time off of the gym unless it is an intentional rest period. I’ve worked really hard to be able to lift the weight that i do, I meal prep, etc.

I go to the gym at 6am every morning and have to be to work at 9. My gym is like 3 blocks away, I walk down a main road but at 6 it’s pretty dark and mostly empty. I don’t live in a bad area but there are many transients and homeless because it’s LA and that’s pretty unavoidable here.

It takes me about 8-10 minutes to walk to my gym. My street is pretty dark but once I’m on the main road it’s slightly more lit. There have been a few creepy instances, like a man singing to me, I saw a guy walking across the street with a stick and he saw me waking and stopped and stared at me. I was really scared that time because I thought he was going to cross and attack me or something. 

Anyway I was thinking of getting a little bike just to ride to and from the gym, it’s so close to my house. I would be a 5 minute bike ride.

I thought about getting some equipment and working out inside my room during the months it’s dark in the morning but I really will regress in my gym progress because I can’t fit everything I need in my room.

589,"Conflicted whether/how to ask for money

Throwaway 
20 y/o SB here (21 in 6 days) I’m pretty new to being a SB and I have 2 scenarios here (both of them being my first experiences with being a SB) on whether or not I should ask for money (I need it for some bills)

1. We first met August 25th. He’s 29 (he’s young but I know for sure he has it. He is a professional poker player and he’s shown me plenty of, even recent within in the last month, articles of him winning some pretty big tournaments). We got along great and I made the mistake of sleeping with him the first night. After that, I continued to stupidly make the mistake of continuing to sleep with him without ever actually establishing a relationship because I actually started to really like him (and I think he at least somewhat likes me). We’ve seen each other many times over the past couple months because we live really close. Even though we never actually established an arrangement, that is the premise we met under so would it be inappropriate to ask him just for a couple hundred? (If not, would it be better if I offered to pay it back?) (S/n Is it too late to ask for an arrangement at this point? How would I go about bringing it up now?)

2. I met this one about a month and a half ago. We met and he liked me and wanted to have an arrangement. We met again and we started with a PPM. We’ve only had one meet because he’s been really busy with work but we have been keeping in contact through text, etc. Same question applies, would asking him for money be appropriate since we’re still in the “PPM” stage? We just talked about moving to an allowance the other day and he said he would like to when his schedule isn’t as busy. He does live about an hr from me and I can’t travel to him.",24Oct2019,1

605,"I asked my mom when I was first going into the **all-boys school** to let me change but she didn't listen. I asked her in August to let me move but she said in an aggressive tone ''WHY WHAT'S WRONG NOW?''. I said I was unhappy and really didn't want to go anymore. Last year I wrote a fake note saying I was going to the dentist just so I can get out of there. I just couldn't stand being so alone in school. The office rang home and my mom picked me up and drove me back. 

The real reason is that I am **unhappy** in there because there are no girls. I have no friends I feel so alone all the time and isolated from society. I just hate it so much. I think about life in a mixed school on a daily basis. I just can't do 2 more years of god damn misery I just can't. 

I'm sorry if this isn't a good enough reason for people but I cannot handle it anymore. I know others will just say ''that's life deal with it'' but why bother if the option is there. This is my last chance at life. If this doesn't work I think I will give one more shot but just stop going altogether. I don't know how I am going to do that but I'll find away. 

Back to the question **how can I convince my mom to let me move school?** (asking my dad isn't an option he does everything my mother says and doesn't really make decisions for himself) Thank you for reading I hope somebody helps me out. Good day",24Oct2019,2
606,"Well, to start, Hey I'm anxiousdude2424, I just created this account, but might keep using it  
I'm university student, 21 years old, gonna be 22 next week and I don't know what to do with my home situation.   
Main thing is my dad (71 years), he had multiple strokes 2 years ago and his personality has partially changed since then, he had to quit his job and pretty much spends the whole day at home drinking and watching tv, occasionally he goes for walks.  
He is depressed and on meds, shouldn't be drinking and smoking the way he does, he doesn't bother any of us when he drinks or anything like that, but according to his psychiatrist drinking will only make his situation worse and might just lead to dementia. I've never been reeeeally close with him, but it has been way harder since the stroke, he has way less patience and just doesn't listen to others anymore, his memory also has been affected so he ends up just telling the same stories. 

My dad just sits in the living room all day and all the time I'm in the house I just stay in my room, I don't know whether I should try to interact with him more often and if I should bring up the alcohol thing again, since he doesn't seem willing to change. On top of all that he said he is thinking about divorcing my mom (which goes out of her way to please and take care of him) and just being friends that share the house with her (which sounds really weird to me, but honestly, it's up to him, his relationship).  


I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like he is wasting away his life and living here kind of sucks, but my country is going through a recession and there's no jobs right now, especially on my area of study, and my uni course is full time",24Oct2019,1
607,"17 year old here. Just like so many in my age group, I'm pretty sure I'm depressed, whoop wee, nothing new here folks. I feel like this is such a common problem, and that people will take it as a joke when I say that I'm depressed. The only two people I ever opened up to were my friend, and my school counselor. Tbh, I wasn't even going to open up to my counselor, it just happened because I was in such a horrible mood, and I even had some dark thoughts, I sent her an e-mail, and when the meeting happened, I felt so unready and I just wanted to dismiss everything. Everything actually went well, and I felt better about myself, so that was nice. When I opened up to my friend, it was because he was actually diagnosed with depression, and he told me, I wanted someone to be there with me, and to help me, he did just that, and he gave me tips on how to deal with stress and the depression. I want to open up to my parents, to show them what I am going through, to tell them all the secrets that I know about them that they don't know that I know. I haven't cried in 3 fucking years, and it feels like I am building everything up, I don't know how to release it, is it ok to cry? Will I regret it? How do I do this? Everything has been going to shit, I came to this subreddit a couple of weeks ago for advice, and it felt amazing getting an answer, to see that someone took time out of their day to answer a random persons cry for help. That was different advice, I now want to know how I should tell my parents, who don't believe in depression, that I am depressed and that I need help, the thing is, not even my siblings believe in it, they laugh whenever I talk about mental illness, just 10 minutes ago (no exaggeration, it was one of the reasons as to why I came here) my sister laughed when I hinted that I may have a problem, she literally told me to ""Go cry in your room"" That hit me hard and I honestly don't know what to do, any advice would do, any place, any website, I just want an outlet, something to help me, I don't want to be alone anymore. How do I get my parents to believe me, or should I wait till I'm 18 to get my own help?",24Oct2019,0
608,"Hi, I'm new to this group because, well, I need advice. My appologies if this isn't the best writing, I'm pretty shaken up right now. 

My parents have been married for over 25 years. Recently, they decided to drive across the country to visit a close friend in the south and then up to Illinois to visit my grandma (mom's mom) who unfortunately is in the early stages of dementia. They stayed with their friend for three days and managed to stay three days with my grandma for three until they got into a fight.

I guess they were out at a bar and my mom wanted to leave to go home. My dad didn't want to and continued to hang out with friends so my mom walked home. I'm not sure how far it is from the house but I know its not very close. She definitely should've called a cab. Once my dad made it back to the house the fight intensified and my mom told my dad to get out. So he did. He started the three day drive back home. 

My mom called my sibling and was acting so delerious (go figure, I would be too). She told the story and was asking my sibling to pull out money if she wired her $1,000. My mom also said that she was going to be flying home that day to ""beat my dad home so she could grab her stuff and move a bed into our shop"". My mom didnt want anyone to pick her up and wanted to take a cab home so we ""weren't getting involved"". She ended up letting my sibling pick her up instead of taking a cab for an hour to get to the house.

I'm freaking out a little. I'm not quite sure what to say or what to ask. I don't even know if I want to really. We all live in the same house (my little family is currently waiting to get into a rental). So I'm going to have to see them. The shop has heat but no bathroom or shower and a relative uses it frequently to work on cars. I just don't understand why she doesn't stay at a friends? Or why she didn't stay with my grandma who is losing her mind and my mom gets to see pretty infrequently? What if they are both telling their own versions of the story just to make themselves sound better than the other? Why did my dad even fucking LEAVE? Who does that?! 

I'm staring at her bags packed in the hall and I'm just wondering what someone else would do in this situation?",24Oct2019,1
609,"Well here goes.

During a job interview for a software development company, I remember the interviewer (lets call him John),  asked me about what my future plans were in 5-10 years. I shifted that question away but somehow I still got hired. Okay cool.

Fast forward to a few weeks back, John and I were just chatting away and that question came up again. I brushed it off saying that I’m still at a self discovery phase but the fact that I’m just here for the money and to feed myself.

I really can’t fathom how others are able to see what they want to be in the future. I just can’t. All I see is waking up every morning feeling miserable, work 8-9 hours, head home feeling even more crap, rinse and repeat for god knows how long. It’s been 5 months in and I feel exhausted, and the thought of quitting the job came to my head but the bills ain’t gonna pay for itself. 

Its really sad to think that this will continue till I reach retirement age or something I don’t know.

Real sorry if this is not really under advice and I’m just ranting away but well, any help or advice would be great.",24Oct2019,1

622,"Hi, everyone! This is just a subject I've been thinking about for a while. Essentially, my parents are both extremely successful and high-achieving (my mother is a really well-respected lawyer and my dad is deputy head of a top law school). They were both from normal families and got where they got through working super hard and being super ambitious. 

On my end, I did really well at school and I'm currently on a prestigious course at a very top university, and I was told throughout my life that I should aim to be a respected academic or something similar. (I should say most of this doesn't come from my parents, who are wonderful people that value my own happiness above all else). 

However, this is just not what I want out of life. Firstly, I love my hobbies (piano, juggling, running and a bunch of others) and I get a lot more fulfilment out of spending a good few hours with them/with friends than I do studying for marginal gains in exams. Secondly, I LOVED the experience of teaching teenagers as part of a program I did in high school. Teaching a subject I care about at a normal school as a normal school teacher seems way more appealing to me than the stress of being an academic, or a lawyer, or an actuary or the plethora of other suggestions I've had. I also feel like I could do just as much good for the wider community as a schoolteacher. However, a part of me still thinks that this is all just a cop-out for me and that I'm looking for an excuse to be lazy and not apply myself. I'd just really appreciate some advice; is it lazy for me to aim lower than people say I should? 

I'm really sorry if any of this came across as bragging. I wanted to provide some context and should stress that I'm not a whizz at anything by any means, and indeed am totally deficient in many areas (practised every day but couldn't tie shoes until I was 16, for example). I'm just looking for some reassurance that I'm not being lazy and it's fine to settle for a 'less prestigious' job than my immediate family.",24Oct2019,2
623,"Some background-

 I live in upstate new york on the country side. I never had family willing to teach me to drive, my dad is always sick, my mother lives far away and was working 2 jobs till she also got sick (both cancer). I got close once but got in a major accident that totaled my car...30 minutes before my road test that i had to take in an unfamiliar city because of my college schedule. After that I was scared to drive 3 years. I still panic in the passenger seat sometimes if i think the driver does not see something. 

Present-

I am in my late twentys, my dad moved out when i was 16 to take care of grandma. I think I may have cabin fever, living as a hermit for so long with very limited human interaction, my home often feels like a prison. I struggle with addiction. I would really like some therapy or something but I cant even rely on a ride to get to a doctors appointment.

My grandmother just passed. Me and my father relied on her when we couldn't make ends meet with my dads SSD. before she died she made sure my dad had a good car. We were talking about keeping the old one registered/insured so i could learn on it. now it looks like we cant afford that. When i proposed to my dad that i could learn in his new car, he did not appear to like the idea. its probably the last car he will ever have and does not want to give me the opportunity. 

I feel utterly lost and powerless, my family is incredibly poor...I just really need some kind of help.

so my question boils down to= how am i, with no reliable family, no car, no income, in a remote rural area supposed to learn.

So we've been here in Austin, Texas for some time now, we came to visit our relatives, and will go back home to Denver, Colorado next week.

After I found out about Anderson and my mother, about their past and relationship, I got frustrated, angry, sad, disappointed and couldn't handle the situation I was trapped in. On one side I had my mother's relationship in the past with Anderson, the lies and what they did for seven years, on the other hand I had my father and loved ones who didn't know anything. I was clueless and didn't know what to do.

Yesterday I took another walk with my mom, I opened the subject about her past with Anderson, once again, and I could see how nervous and stressed she looked. She clearly didn't want to talk about it again, but I wanted to ask more, to understand and to now what to do. We talked and I started to ask questions about why she did it, why she lied and how she accepted to live like she did, which was against her norms and values, etc. Mom replied that she didn't want to talk about it, that it should be left in the past. I didn't take no for an answer and demanded that she talked with me. She started to open up and we continued our conversation.

My mom was sorry that she lied to her parents and all the loved ones, she wanted to tell dad about it, but she couldn't and she doesn't want him to know about her past with Anderson, never ever. I asked her why she did it and went against everything, her norms, values, etc. She didn't answer, so I asked if she today regrets her former relationship, and if she really was in love with Anderson. Mom said that if she wasn't in love with him she wouldn't have been with him for seven years. She continued to say that it was never the idea to form a relationship with him, she would only live there for her studies, but that she fell for him and fell in love after spending time with him in his apartment. That they got together very quickly, she had barely been there for a week.

I asked if she regretted leaving the US and Anderson, to go back to Syria and marry dad three years later. Here I was devastated, she said she felt really bad after breaking up with Anderson and leaving the US. She wanted to live in Syria for her family, to be close to them and marry to form a family. But at the same time she did not want to leave Anderson, that she had a good time with him, and that she had an extremely hard time after leaving him, it took a couple of years before it felt better. She concluded by saying that Anderson is forgotten, that she loves dad and me and that she has a family today, that I should let go of the past and that I should not focus so much on what she and Anderson did. I didn't know what to say so we walked back without saying anything more.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how my relationship with my mother will go back to normal again and what we will do with the secrets and lies, because only me, mom and Anderson know about their past. I'm still angry and it doesn't feel any better, what should I do to understand mom and her past choices and decisions. I feel that what she did back then was wrong and not fair to me or my father, even though I wasn't born. I can't see it as something good or fair, I hope you don't aswell, but I am clueless on what to do and how to move on.",24Oct2019,0

627,"I need some help im at the end of my rope and i don't know what to do.
So i have a 2yo dog and he is a very big boy and is an angel 90% of the time but the other times he is absolutely terrifying. He has bitten two people and myself many times (only ever biting hands) with no reason and little to no warning, he has some problems with resource gaurding but that has never resulted in a bite. 

He gets in these wierd moods? Where he will grumble growl and sometimes snap at me or my partner this happens at random times without being provoked in any way so we will not touch or acknowledge him until he stops then he gets put in solitary and scolded.
The most peculiar time he does this is if we leave the house and come back in a certain ammount of time. (for example if we are out of the house for anywhere over 10 minutes and under 1 hour) he will be super happy to see us just like any dog happy tail wagging and playful behaviour and then out of nowhere he will sometimes growl and snap at me or my partner. Usually i can disingage him and than calm him down and he will be fine just like nothing happened happy loving cuddly. 
After any time he has bit me he gets his punishment ( put in the bathroom away from all his people with the lights out and the fan on) . Afterward he will be very submissive and act like he knows that what he did was wrong and that he is sorry ( lots of kisses and wanting of affection and pats ). 

I Love him so much and this breaks my heart to say but last night he did something and i dont know if it is the smartest idea to keep him. ( we have not had any incidents in over 3 months not even a small grumble if he is eating and you're close by he has been soo good )My partner picked me up from work last night and we got home everything was great he was happy and excited to see us , sometimes he will jump up putting his forepaws on my shoulders and give me a kiss on the face to welcome me home only if invited up. It was about 2 minutes after we walked in he wanted to do his jump up and kiss thing and he was just fine so i thought why not and i invited him up for a kiss , this is where things went terribly wrong. As he was up giving me a kiss my partner patted him on the head and all of a sudden i have a 200lb angry dog snarling in my face! I could not get him off of me my partner offered treats of extremely high value to try and lure him away but nothing would catch his attention he was holding me and snarling and inch away from my nose. I could not move, he wont usually bight if you stay still and dont panic he will usually calm down and its easier to de-escalate the situation without a bight occurring ( the only times he has bitten is when he is in one of these moods he will slowly creep closer to you and if you flail panic or move quickly thats when he will bite). My pertner could not grab him and i could not move to cover my face or to get away without being bitten. At this point he was getting worse not better and he was getting angrier. It felt like an eternity and i have never been so afraid in my life i thought he was going to maul my face... but in the nick of time i spun away from him fast enough to get my face out of danger but he bit my thumb and index finger breaking the skin on my thumb. ( its not his worst bite but i think it was more of a miss ) . I slowly but sternly walked away trying to disengage him but he followed me nipping at my ass and the back of my arm until my partner could get him outside and away from me. 

I really love my dog when he is good but he has these unpredictable moodswings that could be potentially dangerous.we have done so much training and working with him and i see improvement but this last incodent has scared me and i dont know if i can trust him anymore. 
Is this something that can be fixed or is euthenasia the only thing i can do. I dont want to loose him he is my best friend but my safety and the safety of others is more important. I want to keep him and working on/with him but sometimes i feel like its beyond me , is he able to be rehomed or is he going to have to be put down. 

I feel like i know the answer but i need to hear it from an unbiased person or persons, Please reddit help me im so broken right now.",24Oct2019,0
629,"Hi everyone, 

Throwaway account here because my main account is the same for my other social networking sites. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do with my younger brother. 

His existence hinders me from achieving a good future. 

A little backstory so you would understand the problem.

I'm an American currently living in Asia with my brother. My mom lives just a minute away from us. 

About 5 years ago, before I graduated high school, my mom got into a gambling addiction that drained all funds for college. She spent every single cent we had into gambling. I was forced to work to support myself and my brother right after high school. 

Thankfully I could speak another language, the language of my mom's country of origin, so I was able to earn at least 4 times the minimum wage in this country. Thankfully there were jobs that needed my skill in that language. I managed to save up enough money, and after getting in contact with my aunt, who flew down from my mom's country to the country we're living in after hearing all about it, managed to run away from my mom with my younger brother. We got a place and I worked harder to support him so he could finish High School.

About a year ago, my mom came back into our lives. She started earning money and got rid of her gambling addiction. She helped us move into a bigger place closer to her. I was told that I could go to college if I wanted to, so I quit my job and started studying for college. I recently took some college entrance exams and I'm waiting for the result. I've been working for about 3-4 years by then. 

Now the problem is... my younger brother. 

My younger brother has not done anything in the 4 years since he graduated High School. 

I cannot ask him to work because he would only be earning minimum wage in this country, which is very very low. He does not have the same language skillsets which allowed me to earn 4 times the minimum wage. I speak like a native, he can barely speak. He's also at a disadvantage when it comes to being hired because we're foreigners in the country, the company would have to pay for his working visa. That's an extra cost the company would not have to pay for if they just hire someone from the country instead of my brother. 

I cannot ask him to go to college. We don't have enough money to send the both of us to college right now. My aunt, knowing that I could make it in life better with a college degree, as (not to brag) I am smarter, more socially capable, and have work experience, it would be best for me to go to college. 

As for my brother, we think the best path for him is to join the US Military. 

Rather than doing nothing in a country that he cannot do anything in, my aunt and I believe that if he goes to the US Military, we would be saving more money, which would allow for me to go to college. 

My brother seems to be against the idea, and my mom is indecisive over it. 

If my brother stays in this country, he can not do anything here. Even if he graduates college here, the same problem still arises, he has nothing to differentiate him from anyone else. He would still work a minimum wage job but might not even be hired because of the working visa problems. 

If my brother stays in this country, we'll have to spend more money, thus not being able to save enough money for me to go to college. I'm sure I'll see some people saying ""you could work while you're in college!"". Unfortunately, knowing my friends' college schedules, and knowing that the only job I'll be able to get is a job which requires my language ability which is during the day, I will not be able to work while I'm in college. Minimum wage jobs would not hire me because of the working/student visa problem, I cannot apply to other jobs that need me because it's during the day when I would have classes. Scholarships... I just don't think it might be possible for me. I'm smart but I'm no genius. I understand hard work would get me somewhere, but after not being able to study for 5 years, I'll have to compete with fresh high school graduates. I don't think I'll be able to. Student Loans are not a thing in this country either as far as I know.

I had to work for years to support myself and my brother, and now that I have a chance to achieve my dreams of going to college, my brother hinders me. 

I understand that he may not want to join the military, that he may want to do other things. But right now, I don't see any other choice for him. There is nothing he can do in this country. He can't go back to America, we have no relatives in America right now. If he goes, he would be going alone doing everything on his own, which he has never done. My aunt and I just believe that the military is the best path, so he could get a job, hopefully get education too if he pursues it, and it could also help him settle in America after everything. 

As for me, I can stay in this country in Asia. After I get my college degree, since I can speak my mother's language, I have several options for me. I can go to America, I can go with my aunt, I have so many options open for me, as long as I graduate college. That can't be achieved with my brother here. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I convince my brother? I understand that it may be hard for him, but it was hard for me too to take care of the both of us. I had to make so many sacrifices along the way for him. I just wish he could do the same for me so we could both achieve a better future. Today's pain is for a better tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I want to go to college but I can't with my brother in the country with us, want to send brother away to somewhere he could work in and be useful so we could have a better future for the both of us.",24Oct2019,0
630,"Brief history: In 2013 I entered a graduate program. I had an assistant-ship and my grades were good, things were great. In 2014 at the beginning of the semester I started struggling and eventually took a medical leave. The official diagnosis was narcolepsy with cataplexy. In 2017 I was ready to go back to school. I emailed my adviser and we started making a plan. And then I don't remember anything after that. Life happened, and I'm sure my adviser thinks that I have dropped off of the face of the earth because I just ceased contact. I honestly don't have any memory why. The entire year is blank. 2018 - 2019 consisted of trial and error with medications, an unplanned pregnancy, and a serious decline in my mental health. 

Fast forward and now things are better. I still struggle with my mental health, but I've been working on it and I'm in a much better place than I was. I've found medication that almost completely controls my narcolepsy symptoms and it has been over a year since my last cataplexy attack. My oldest daughter is in preschool and my youngest will be a year old in two months. I feel like I'm ready to give school a shot again.

But my problem is, I have absolutely no clue what to say to my adviser. I don't have an explanation for why I ceased contact, other than I seriously can't remember anything from the year 2017. Do I mention my mental health? My kids? Or do I just simply say I'm ready to come back to school now?

I've been putting this off for so long, terrified of failure. I know all I needed to do was open the computer and start typing an e-mail to my adviser, so I did. But then I was stuck. I have no clue what to say. Any advice is much appreciated, but please no judgement, I've got that part covered myself.",24Oct2019,2
631,"Hey all, this is going to be a long one but I figured I'd include all the information that I feel is important to what's happening. I'll include a TLDR at the bottom. 

I graduated from college in May of this year, and moved to Georgia with my boyfriend of 2 years. It seemed like a good move, as all of our mutual friends are in GA, there were good job opportunities, and I didn't have a job lined up right out of college. I''d also always enjoyed visiting the area with my BF. I realize now that I never really stopped to ask myself what it was that I really wanted, but I can't change the past. I'm currently at the point where I'm trying to figure out what it is that I do want.

Anyways, we were living with his parents until we could save up for our own place, and allowed ourselves to fall into a complacent state of just hanging out day to day (WoW Classic came out and we played it pretty hardcore those first few weeks, gaming has always been a huge part of our relationship). I should also mention that I was feeling a lot of pressure and stress in the weeks leading up to the panic attack that don't involve the relationship. I didn't know what kind of job I wanted to look for, I had to start searching for a car, I had to switch my license over to a GA one, I had to find a new dentist (I let my teeth get pretty bad in college), I felt I had to make new friends in a new place, I had to get my real estate license per my parents' request (I'm so lucky and they paid for my schooling, so I felt I owed it to them). We had planned to use the first week in September as a springboard to launch our job/car/friend searches. It was a lot all at once. Plus I was on my period, so hormones factored in nicely I'm sure.

The day of the panic attack in early September, I woke up feeling pretty normal, if not just a little under the weather. I sat down at my desk, looked at my boyfriend and all of a sudden had a ton of intrusive thoughts I've never had before. ""Who is that guy? Do I really know him? Do I even love him?"" I tried to reason through them saying of course I love him, 2 days ago you told him how excited you were for your future together and you meant it, these are just normal ""end of honeymoon phase"" thoughts and anxieties probably, as the rest of your life is starting. I'm also worried about things working long term, as my parents' marriage almost fell apart due to my dad's infidelity. It was probably normal to be thinking all of those things, I told myself. The feeling of immediate panic subsided a bit, and I turned my focus to what I was doing on my computer, but then the area around my ear started to feel all tingly, like it does before something goes numb.

It was a feeling I've never experienced before, and my mind went into full panic mode. Why is it tingling? What does it mean? Am I okay? I told my boyfriend how I was feeling and he reminded me that I'd just gotten a new headset that was pretty tight on my head, it was probably just pinching a nerve. Looking back, he was probably entirely right. But I was a bit beyond consolation. Over the next couple of hours I felt nauseous, weak, panicky. I convinced myself I was having a stroke, or something was incredibly wrong with me, so we went to the ER, where they told me I'd had a panic attack and should consult a primary care physician about an anxiety disorder (I'm seeing a new physician later today). I felt better after being told nothing was physically wrong, but the panicky, anxious feelings never subsided. 

I stopped enjoying things that I've always enjoyed, I couldn't eat, I couldn't stay asleep long, I had terrible dreams, I felt like I didn't know myself, my boyfriend, or our friends anymore, and that life wasn't really real. There was no love, no happiness, just constant anxiety, pain, and sadness. I started obsessing over why I was feeling (or not feeling) all those things, and my brain latched onto the idea that I must not love my boyfriend anymore, and that we should break up. I didn't want to just immediately break up and run, however, as it's been the most fulfilling, healthy, loving, beneficial relationship I've ever been in.

I could always be myself with him and never felt I had to change. I could always be honest without being judged. My GPA improved in school, he's always pushed me to do things I'd previously chickened out of, he's always been interested in my hobbies and passions, and he makes me laugh like no one else can. He supported me when my childhood dog passed away and I didn't get the chance to say goodbye, when I threw my back out and couldn't walk for days, when I found out that my dad cheated on my mom and had moved out. The list goes on. If you'd asked me a week before the panic attack if I saw a future with him, I'd tell you I've never seen anything more clearly. We both want the same things in life, and we work really well together. I worry and stress over everything, whilst he has the amazing gift to only worry about the important things. He's my best friend.

So, instead of throwing away a wonderful relationship and believing what my anxiety filled brain was telling me, I sat down and told my boyfriend everything I was thinking and feeling, and we agreed to give me a chance to work through everything before we decide on whether or not to stay together. I flew home to Pennsylvania to be with my family and to give my boyfriend and I some space. I started seeing a therapist, but haven't really had enough sessions yet to know whether or not it's helping. 

The pain and tightness in my chest has subsided a little, and I feel more positive about my bf and I working through everything, but there are still dark moments where I think I might be lying to myself and I'm just scared to let go of a man I deeply care about, move home, and restart. Those dark moments bring me to what I really need advice on. My bf and I are planning a little vacation for next weekend, just so we can see each other, check in, and see how we're feeling with no distractions. When I'm feeling positive and more like myself, I think about reuniting and I'm excited to be around him. When I'm more down, however, I feel so anxious and panicky about it. What if I still feel like I don't know him or want to be with him when we see each other again? I know that the only way to know for sure is to do it, but I'd love some insight on how to go into everything with a more open mind. I'm not sure if the anxiety and depression are making me feel this way or if it's the relationship. If you've read this far, you're incredible. I didn't mean for it to get this long. 

TLDR: I had my first ever panic attack last month and since then I feel like I don't know myself, my friends, my boyfriend, or what I want in life anymore. I don't know if anxiety and depression are causing me to want to breakup with my boyfriend, or if it's the other way around, and the relationship is causing the anxiety. I've never had relationship anxiety before, and my current one with my bf has always been a happy and healthy relationship. I know I love him. I'm seeing him again in a week after a month apart and I'm incredibly nervous. I could use some advice on how to approach everything with an open mind.",24Oct2019,1
632,"So at my school, class participation counts from 50% to 70% depending on the subject which takes a huge toll on my grades. I also have trouble listening to others, so it's difficult for me to realize when to take notes or do an exercise, I am basically non-existent in class.
I know there are teachers that offer alternatives, however they mostly consist of graded extra work which stresses me out significantly more than speaking in class.
I can somewhat manage my anxiety now and I sometimes do speak up but it's definitely not enough to ""pass"" the subject.

635,"So me and my boyfriend made the stupid mistake of moving in together after only 3 months of dating... Long story short we got into a big fight last week (of him cursing me and my friends out and telling my friends I’m evil and tried to turn them against me), and so he ended up moving back home (which is a whole different state). Clearly there is so many red flags when it comes to him (insecure, explosive) and we are just not working out. We also want totally different things after I’m out of school, however, even though everyone and and every sign is telling me to stay away from him I can’t help but think about him everyday... I miss him so much even though he hurt me so bad, I’ve been having constant anxiety from this on top of my already existing school anxiety. He already told me he’s done with me but I don’t know if he is saying that  because he is genuinely over me or because it would be easier to forget about me if he ignored me... I want to reach out to him so bad even though I know that probably nothing will come of it... Is it a totally stupid idea to want to talk to him? Or should I just let this go.",24Oct2019,1
636,"Okay, some backstory.
My dad died a few years ago due to lung cancer, and my mom promised to him that she would quit before the end of the year. That was two years ago, and she kept smoking due to the stress (she worked two jobs, getting me to school is kind of difficult since I don’t go to the school in my town, etc.). Fast forward til recently, she’s dating someone and they made it a team effort to quit smoking together.

How they’ve done it so far is they slowly had less and less cigarettes a day, before moving onto a vape pen, but right now they’re off of that, too.

Yesterday (as of posting this), I caught her boyfriend smoking and he doesn’t know that I know. I felt really overwhelmingly “guilty” (don’t know how to describe it) and I didn’t say anything when he came back inside.

Part of me really wants to talk to him about it but my biggest issue is that I’m absolutely terrified of confrontation like that and I know I’m going to start crying and I don’t really want to guilt him about it.

I’ve been trying to think of things to do, whether it’s finding where he hides them and breaking them or leaving him a note somewhere where my mom won’t find it but he will.

I tried asking me girlfriend about it and she’s tried giving me some solutions as well but I’m not really sure what to do. She pointed out that it could be a one time thing, so I intend on looking out for it more now. It could’ve just been a one time thing though because we’re moving this Saturday and it’s been pretty stressful on the both of them since we have to balance work and school on top of it.

How should I approach this?",24Oct2019,1
637,"A little backstory.  
I suffer from depression and have social anxiety.  
My friends are always very inclusive and I always try to get to their meetups.  
A month ago one of these friends announced a halloween party, coming next week.  
I was stoked and super hyped. I was absolutely going to have an amazing costume!  
Yesterday another friend in this group asked if they could bring some friends along.  
Turns out its about 10 to 15 people. I'd have managed 3-4 new faces. But 10 to 15 people are just too much.  
After that request was allowed, I feel like backing down would kill the mood for everyone involved.  
I dont want to lie to them, I also am too afraid of too much new people and am absolutely sure that I would show up and sit there silently, being nonexistant. Especially if smaller groups start to build (which is going to happen for certain).  
I am used to it, but damn.. I would rather be at home and do something else, then feeling like being brain-AFK or on spectator mode during a party.

640,"Hey guys, hope you guys are having a good day. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

I'm 23, in my junior year of college (i switch majors). And school just isn't for me. I don't even believe school, depending on what career you want, is important unless you're going to be a doctor, fireman, lawyer or something to help society in a matter-ful way. I don't make the best grades. And I heavily believe that school is just a government cash grab (student loans, paying for parking????, etc). It's ridiculous. 

Ik most of NA society has been told that that is the way to do things. Get a decent job, have a wife and kids with a dog named Spot. And white picket fence in a simple neighborhood. But honestly, I don't think that's my path.

645,"I wasn't ever the type of person to be jealous. At least that's what I thought as a kid. 

I'll keep my problem short: My friend is in her dream college and is learning more about art and is developing at a whooping rate. She is also getting a whole lot more recognition online. But I can't help but feel too jealous. What do I do?


I hope you read the rest of the story as to understand my situation. Maybe this story would be better suited in r/AITA? Who knows...

 I believe jealousy comes from dissatisfaction with your life and the achievements you've made. Than again you could just be an arse that doesn't want others to be happy. I don't believe I am an arse, just really sad. And I know that.

 But it just feels like she got everything she wanted. She fought for it sure. But I fought for my dreams too! I have been through hardships and straight up isolation, rejection from kost if not all my peers and self inflicted anger issues that have been getting in the way of my socialisation. I am angry and sad. We get that. But then why does she get to have friends and just turn me down even though I was with her from the start? 
. 
.
.

Long story ahead. I had a fight with an online friend, who in the end wasn't ever really a friend. She was just part of a fandom that is very very small and the first person I had talked to about this subject for YEARS. It was exciting! And I thought we were friends! 
I was with her from the start. Ever since she had first started a few years ago. I thought we had a connection. But no. Eventually she got more and more noticed! More and more attention. And lil ol me was left behind yet again. I understand that I am not the best person to hang around with. I never know when my anger issues can rise up.

Either way I was on vacation with a bunch of chicks who were really bad for me and caused me to have a panic attack right after a huge earthquake in my country. After fighting with my mother, the girls I was on vacation with,and being left alone in a bus stop (in general everything was going to shit. Not to mention some other aspects, I am keeping this brief), I turned to our group chat with a few other girls. I couldn't take their cold shoulder anymore. I felt like they weren't friends to me and I felt betrayed even though it was unjustified. I told them how much I hate them and I hate them as much as myself. I hate them for leaving me alone and that I hoped they would be alone like I am. I just let em have it.

For no reason. Completely unjustified. 

I calmed down days later when I finally got home. I didn't tell anything to my parents because they were kind enough to pay for our trip and I wanted to let them think I had fun. I didn't. 

I tried apologizing to her and the girls. But it didn't work. She blocked me from her ig, the main place we would talk to.


Either way I know she has a DA. While I don't like thinking of her as a person I really like her art and characters. Think of this as an competition. I kinda want to be as good as her when it comes to art and making comics and even surpass her. I felt the need to surpass her and idk why. 

Either way. Recently she said how she got to an art school on a Discord server we happened to be a part of... And I feel my inferiority issues acting up again. Everyone is so much better than me and I feel inadequate. Like I am nothing. I hate feeling this way and since I recently started working on a hospital where every single one of my college classmates is better than me at everything, this feeling has only been getting worse. I feel terrible. I feel lost and I feel like I am crap.

I can't stand being jealous of others being netter of me and of them finding their dream job. I want to be happy for them and for her I really do. But I feel despised by everyone without even doing anything. Before actually doing anything.",24Oct2019,1
646,"Sorry for this being long. Me and my girlfriend (25/M &amp; 24/F) are on the verge on ending an almost two year long distance relationship. The distance has seemingly never been an issue. She says that when I saw her last I was acting like an asshole, by doing things like making her feel like whenever she would get made I wouldn’t take her seriously. For example, she got upset that we couldn’t find a place to eat, because I thought that she was going to pick and she thought I knew where to eat, and she got upset at me when I got mildly upset when I said “man cmon, it’s just this!” Please note that I never have yelled at her including this time and simply said it out of frustration. When I saw she was upset, I promptly apologized and told her that I’m sorry I made her feel that way and that sometimes when I get a little frustrated, it’s not that big of a deal to me, but I now realize that she may not necessarily view it the same way and that I would look out for that in the future. 

When we were being intimate later on, I gagged while performing oral sex and asked her in a nonchalant tone, “hey can we go take a shower first, please” and she was devastated by me doing this, saying that she thinks she never wants to have sex with me again. Keep in mind that I have an incredibly sensitive gag reflex and actually have to take over the counter medication to help it, and she knew about it too. After seeing her so upset, I freaked out by having an emotional outburst (which is on me) because she was getting so upset. She knows I have anger issues and she has actually been helping me control them in the past, and since being with her, I’ve only had an outburst like this once before, months ago. I sincerely apologized and I’m only human and not perfect, but that I would do everything in my power to make sure my emotions are in check (by even enrolling myself in therapy). 

She slighted this and told me that I always say that I’m going to fix things or work on myself but that I only do it for two weeks and I go back to being my old self. She’s told me that she hasn’t been sexually satisfied with me in months and things that I’m doing get to her so much and that this was the final straw. For the past two months, I have felt that mostly every week she would be upset or I would do something wrong (unintentionally) or she would take out her anger on me, so I asked her in a calm voice why was that happening. She said it was because she was nervous about her future because she doesn’t know what she’s going to do after college, so she would be more volatile these next few months because of it, and I told her that I completely understand and that I’ll keep that in mind and to please let me know if she wants to talk about it. I’ve always told her that to please let me know if she ever wants to talk about anything and that I would never force her to tell me anything she didn’t want to tell me, and that I would always be open and nonjudgmental. 

This last week she tells me that the reason why she’s so unhappy with me now is because little things that I’ve been doing these past few months have been piling up. I’ve told her why she’s just been blaming it on her uncertain future and why she just wouldn’t flat out say it was because of things I would do. I’ve always said to please tell me things she doesn’t like that I do so I can fix them ASAP and that I wouldn’t get mad about it. She said that I should just “get” things and that she shouldn’t have to spell things out for me, even though at the beginning of the relationship I told her to please flat out tell me things to fix or whatever and she agreed. I told her I feel embarsssed that this whole time I’ve been just here enjoying life while she has been resenting me more and more each week and asked her why she didn’t tell me any of this before and she said that I was playing the victim. 

Since were doing long distance, we obviously can’t have sex all the time, and because of this we haven’t had sex since late July. The last few visits, we were unable to have sex because of various circumstances. She said her sex drive was going down and she initially blamed it on other things but eventually told me it’s because I don’t know how to please a woman. 

She told me I was immature and that I can’t fix nothing and that I’ve always been full of shit and I make things worse. I reminded her that I always listen to her and gave her examples of how I always listen to her and take responsibility for my actions to at which she said I was playing the victim again. She wouldn’t like when my parents would send me care packages in the mail because she would say I’m being pampered and babied by them, granted that her parents don’t do much for her anymore except pay her bills but that’s just how she was raised. I told her that I would start to become more independent and I honestly have. 

The weird thing is is that i haven’t even cried at all. I kinda feel numb. I’m heartbroken and sad and I’ve lost my appetite completely. Part of me wants to get back together because I miss her so much, we did share a lot of happy memories together, but part of me actually feels a sense of relief that it’s almost over because for more than half a year, I’ve felt like I’m walking on eggs shells around her, being ultra carefully about what I say so I wouldn’t offend her, and I’ve felt like I have to be on my best behavior around her. I haven’t been truly relaxed around her for a while now, and when I would bring that up to her, and would I would bring up when she would tell me things that hurt my feelings, she would say in a sarcastic voice, “sorry?” I knew that if I did that to her, she would get mad, so everytime she would get mad at me, I would tell her the same thing NOT out of spite, but to point out the hypocrisy to which she got mad of course. She would tell me things I would be doing wrong almost every week and at one point, I told her that I would sincerely listen to her, but I can’t change everything about me nor should I and that I would do my absolute best to give her what she wants to which she said she would back down a bit, but then about a month lasted she started it again. I’ve also felt that she’s put a strain on my relationship with my family as I feel more distant from them for various reasons.

She started shit while I was on vacation with my family. She says I take her for granted because I rely on her forgiveness too much and that there’s a line of girls and guys waiting for us to break up. It seems to me like she ignores the times that I have been mature and listened to her and have helped her and only chooses to look at the few times I’ve failed. For example, when I visited her one time, she called me annoying and she implied that she couldn’t wait for me to go back home so she could have some space, and that hurt me a lot but I choose to handle it like an adult and not freak out but yet she seems to not realize those moments that I do. Another example is that she recently told me she had doubts about us because she has never been with a woman and regrets not experiencing that to which I could’ve been so upset but again I handled it like an adult. I always take responsibly for my faults and it rarely seems like she does because she has told me that she hates to be wrong. She’s told me that I vent too much to her so I really limited what I would vent to her about. So just stuff like that. 

I feel terrible about this because I still genuinely love and care for her and I don’t want her to be hurting like she is now. We haven’t official broken up yet but I feel like she’s waiting for me to do it because she says she never knows when to exit a relationship. I feel confused and awful because this came out of nowhere. I’ve lost my appetite but at the same time feel a sense of relief. I have certainly done things in the past that have hurt us (unintentionally) to which I take full responsibility, but I can’t help it but think that she also contributed to where we are now, which according to her, is me turning it around on her and twisting her words. So please help me, I don’t even know how to feel right now. She blames it all on me, so please help me, how much is all this my fault.

647,"Okay so I’ll be brief with this even though my head is all over the place.

Sister and her fiancé have been together around 8 or 9 years, have got a one year old and he proposed not long ago.

Me and her fiancé work together. 

Today I was helping one of my clients with her phone and as I opened it her conversation with him came up. There was a weird inappropriate message from him. I closed it quickly and she hadn’t seen that I’d seen as the phone was facing me and she was sitting opposite. I was finishing up what I was doing on her phone said she was going out for a smoke. I also helped set up bed phone so I know her pin code to get into it, her birth year. 

Well I hopped quickly into that conversation whilst on her phone and saw very inappropriate messages and genital pictures from both of them to each-other. The first message was from August, and it was very dirty so I’m assuming there was a lot more before the conversation was deleted and started over again. (I know it’s wrong to look through people’s phones but obviously it was very concerning)

I ran into the other room where my co worker is (we get on very well) and told her to come with me to look before she gets back from smoking. She was equally shocked. 

So my heads been all over the place today. I feel awful for my sister and her child. This will definitely affect my family big time, and also me as I work with him. I’m preparing to leave my work place after Christmas. 

Should I tell her? Or should I wait until after Christmas? I don’t want to ruin Christmas for her and my niece because it’s likely she’ll move out of her house and I don’t think the stress will be good before the holidays. I can’t tell anybody else in my family yet because word will spread quick and I don’t think that’s fair on my sister. 

I’m definitely planning on telling her, it’s just when to do it. I’m also planning to take a picture of the messages so I have some sort of evidence instead of just me and my co workers word. Any advice will do. Thank you",24Oct2019,1

649,"I recently met the ex gf of the man who stalks me. He was quite abusive to her and is also stalking her now. I'm quite attracted to her both due to the common connection from him and from other things we have in common. One thing that really made me attracted to her is that she said he would always talk about how he would abandon her if she ever had a child (ironic because he's an unemployed drifter college flunkout while she's a doctor), because I've always wanted to have a child and be a good father.

Neither of my friends supported me when I cried. They said that breaking up is normal and that I'm gonna be fine. This week one of my friend needed me and I was there for her. We both registered to a contest, and I even tried to do not better than her because I know what this meant to her. Now she turned my back, and acts like I don't matter.

When I was a young boy about 6 or 8 I was constantly being groped and touched by one of my classmates who I would classify as M. He tortured me everyday in elementary and he would threaten me with scissors. He took advantage of me in every way shape and form. Needless to say, it took me until last year for the realization of how backwards I am and how insecure I am stems from that experience. I've always hated him after I had realized what he had been doing to me. The things he did to me leaned me towards liking men, and not that I'm homophobic, but I hate it. I hate where it comes from, and how much it affects me. He made me insecure to trust anyone and I'm afraid of meeting anyone anymore. I don't want to be their friends anymore. I used to be a happy kid until he came along. I can't feel who I am anymore and it hurts. 

I've grown a seething hatred towards him and myself. It's been so long but I'm still feeling the effects. I thought that with more experience I'd get over it, but today I couldn't help but break down. I need some closure in my life and I don't know what to do with it.

653,"This guy I have been dating for two months now is great but one problem. 

We will he having sex and all a sudden he will just stop, and get up and do something else.

Last night he was eating me out and I was very close to orgasm and as I was able to cum he stopped doing it and said “sorry” and sat up against the bed and closed his eyes. I had to finish myself off and he looked at me funny while I did it. After that I got up and left.

This has happened every time we have had sex except for the two times when he was very drunk, we finished those times. Every time else has been this antics of his.

He won’t even tell me why. I’m considering giving up on this because it is too frustrating and I am starting to take it personally.

I did try inquiring about his sexual experience but he refuses to tell me about how many past partners and says “it’s not a woman’s business who a man sleeps with”. Which is ridiculous. If he didn’t have problems I never would have asked.

I’m just trying to get us to a point where we can enjoy sex together because right now I am not.

655,"And once I told him.. things changed dramatically.  He got what he wanted.  Multiple calls a day, turned to days of silence.  Blatantly ignored, but he’d manage to indirectly rub what he was doing in my face.  He’s never posted on social media more in his life.  I’m talking like 30 posts a day.   

I honestly don’t even know how to start moving on from this?  It’s one thing to be rejected, I could’ve respected a rejection.  But to know an entire friendship wasn’t even real?  That the person doesn’t even exist, and was just a fake persona to get me to become vulnerable around him.  Thinking we were so close, when in reality he only got close to me to hurt me?  How do I even move on?  I deleted him off of everything.  I even changed my phone number.  I cut out all of our mutuals, and I know all of this is best for me.  

But I can’t seem to feel any better about this.  Our last phone conversation was him telling me how he’s tired of always being the one that talks during our convos, and he’s tired of leading convos.   Which isn’t true, but I digress.  Overall just a lot of complaining.  I just went with it.  Smoked a bowl after, and I went on my deleting spree.  It’s only been 3 days, and I kind of feel guilt?  I don’t even understand my emotions entirely.  There has to be something wrong with him though, right?  Normal people don’t do this.",24Oct2019,1
656,"TL;DR I got ghosted by someone special a few years ago and am wondering if I should reach out to their parents via social media to ask of their well-being.

Some context: it's been five years since this person, whom I had deep connections with, dropped out of contact with me. I was young and infatuated---on discussing feelings, we decided to become best friends. Also, they were only a year older than me. Long story short, they had a profound affect on my life and we had mutual respect and admiration.

They had always had poor health and had spent a few weeks in the hospital, but on returning to school they were fine. About a month into school they got sick again and had to (I assume) drop out entirely. We continued to keep in touch through gmail and texting but only for a few days, then...nothing. I only saw them once in person and that was half a year later and we had no time to talk; they knew I saw them, and I knew they saw me.

Nothing for another year until mutual students they had known disclosed (more like I overheard) that the person in question was in the hospital (again) but this time for internal bleeding. Serious, very serious; I tried reaching out but to no avail. At that point, I assumed they were dead. And I have thought so, for years past.

I should mention they have never had social media, but their father does. I don't want to be a stalker or a creep, but I know that even if I reach out it won't look very normal. it's not like I can message him and say ""By the way I knew your kid five years ago, although you and I never met. Can I ask about their well-being?"" Intentionally my heart is in the right place, but I can see how it looks from the outside.

I'm asking because it's left a pretty gaping hole in me these years past. Things not resolving, just dropping off the face of the planet...I know some might say I dodged a bullet, I'm better off without them but I just don't know.

What's the right thing to do? I don't know if the circumstances of getting ghosted were really a true decision. I appreciate your feedback.",24Oct2019,0

So, I graduated in the spring with a BA in Philosophy. I'm looking for some advice from this community now that, after a little trial and error, I know roughly what I'm aiming at in terms of the personality of my career path. I'm just pretty bad at knowing what specific careers are out there.

I know that I like to be a community leader, to talk to large groups of people, to explain things, and to mentor people. I'm pretty articulate in person and I have always gravitated towards community leadership roles. So right now I'm looking at some options like being a college professor or maybe working for community building non-profits or some kind of other social work/public interest work that revolves around *taking care of a community.* Also, not super interested in working with children.

So if anybody knows more careers/jobs in that vein, I'd appreciate it a lot. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything (since I only thought of 2.5 things). I'm a pretty hard worker when I care about what I'm going after.

- always stares smiles and laughs at me in a shy way 
- always nice to me and jokes a lot
- tells me about her personal life
- texts me when i don’t come to class 
- always thanking me
- told me she’s introverted but says she likes being around me
- sent me SFW pictures of her journaling her day
- has sent hearts in chat usually in a thankful or light hearted way

So its been a few weeks since i broke up with my girlfriend, she told me she doesnt feel that \*spark\* she's supposed to feel anymore but told me she still really loves me so she suggested a break. (we still talked and hung out as friends after that) after a week of this she said lets just try to be friends and give each other a little time maybe in the future well gat back together or something but she doesnt feel it rn i was fine with that. Couple days pass me, her and a coiple more friends go shopping she wanted to buy a pair of jeans, she did and after we all went home she told me how bad it felt for her that i didnt even look at her when she tried them on or said anything and a lot lot lot other small things like this happen everyday. (we talked every waking hour via text and i facetimed her every night. She asked me to do so) I was pretty fucking depressed after the breakup but tried to hide it. A few days ago i told her that i want to have a little bit of time before becoming normal friends again as i was depressed becouse of the breakup and suggested we shouldnt talk or even meet for a few days or weeks, she was FURIOUS like ive only seen her this angry like 2 times in my entire life (we were friends before dating) and when i tried to explain that i need this time if she wants me to be her friend again she wouldnt even listen just stormed off and told me i can do whatever the hell i want and she doesnt care anymore. Now im feeling even more depressed than before and i dont know what to do i cant think of myself ever falling out of love with her so if i want to be her friend (which i really want to becouse i care about her and want to support her) ill have to suffer if i see him w another guy or anything like that in the future.

666,"Hey, so I’ve been having a rough time making a decision so I’ve turned here for some thoughts. 

I just graduated high school, I’m from a small city in the prairies (population is just under 200k). To be completely honest, I hate it here and I want to get out, and the fact that this city has little industry, high paying, and just decent jobs all around are hard to come by unless you know somebody basically. I also hate it because everyone is so close minded, the crime rate is terrible compared to most places in Canada, and it’s just an ugly city in general. 

I want to start post secondary school into the next year, however I want to take this chance to move out of here and start fresh, meet new people and because I’m more introverted, i want to figure out things in my own way. 

My problem is, is it unrealistic to move to goto school when you can’t really work full time and support yourself? I have a education fund from my parents and could use student line of credit for everyday stuff, but don’t want to end up 20k+ in debt over two years. 

What are other people’s experiences of moving out on their own for school in a different city? Obviously I want to find a roommate to help cut some costs but I wanted to hear about what others have to say!

667,"Long post incoming.  Will TL;DR below.

I have an anxiety disorder and CPTSD from 2 decades of childhood religious abuse.  I escaped that life, went to college 7 years late and got a degree at 30.

I have been with my company 20 years as of August 2019.  It was the first company I joined after university, and I have climbed my way to a nice middle role as a program manager designing customer and employee experiences.  Over the years, my roles have all focused on process analysis and improvement, and I've legit saved the company at least 5 million per year in the last 10 years.

Until about 18 months ago.  My boss left the company and my department was merged with another.  My process improvement role was already filled with their own guy, so they had me work on designing internal learning experiences for this global expansion.  Basically the same role, but the output being effective training material instead of process changes.

I did that through Nov last year, and the manager was pleased with the results of my work.  He told me he knew it wasn't my choice of role, but if I stuck it out until annual review, I could move to a new role more in my wheelhouse.

Them he left the company and in Jan 19 I was moved under a new manager whose team curates policy documents.  This was not my kind of work.  No deep dives, no investigations, no creativity at all.  Just receive new policy, format it properly, and then stick it up in out internal web so if anyone needs it, it's searchable.

It drove my anxiety through the roof.  I went from being super extrovert working with people creatively to solve complex problems that improved people's work lives, to sitting in a cube with my head down processing documents all day. 

 My mind wandered and it became hard to focus in the tedium.  I was plagued by intrusive thoughts and no matter how many times I asked for different work or a short assignment on something else that was more in my experience, I was told there wasn't anything for me until I outperformed in my current role.  The intrusive thoughts got worse, and I was sleeping only 2-3 hours a night because it took me hours to shut my head up.

Both my anxiety and my resentment grew greater, but my peculiar quirk internalized the resentment as ""what's wrong with you that you can't even process documents until March?""

Then March came and my annual review said I didn't perform well enough in my document processing role, so they froze my pay rate for a year, denied my annual bonus, and told me I had to spend the next YEAR in the same role and I had to beat production goals within 2 months or be fired, then maintain the rate for the whole year or be fired.

That broke me.  But 20 years in at the company I call home is big sunk cost.  So I nosed the grindstone and hit numbers in April and May, but I was losing my mind.  Intrusive thoughts constantly, still not sleeping at night, feeling tightness in my chest almost always, daily panic attacks from catastrophizing until I spun out

June 1 I asked for medical leave and was approved for short term paid disability for 90 days.  I started counseling and began working on my shit.  Then 6 weeks into the leave, they denied my pay saying the medical paperwork my doc and I provided didn't prove disability.  So they'd let me have the time off but not paid.

So we lived off of savings for 3 months until it was gone.  

I went back to work Sept 1 because we were out of money, but I wasn't well enough to really be doing so.  The same patterns continued only now the intrusive thoughts were all about suicide.

Oct 1 I got my first paycheck since June.  Oct 3 I got called into the bosses office to be told my production numbers were dropping.

I had a dissociative episode after the meeting and lost about 4 hours of time.  I came to at the Hospital, apparently having checked myself in because I wanted to kill myself.  They kept me overnight and gave me something for the panic.

I have reapplied for disability with the ER documentation and a write-up from the doc about the dissociation episode.  So I've been given another 90 days unpaid to get help and get better.

But I'm afraid we're going to lose our house because we're out of money and Nov 1 will be the first month we can't pay the mortgage.  My wife is underemployed and I've been the big breadwinner for the last 15 years.

This isn't helping my anxiety and I don't feel like I'm ever going to be right in the head again.  I have been homeless in my 20s.  I'd rather die than do that again.

I am completely lost.

Advice?

TL;DR - work situation exacerbated anxiety disorder making work situation worse.  Disability time granted, but no pay.  Savings gone.  Afraid we're going to be homeless.",24Oct2019,1

Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally.

669,"Hey guys. I graduated a couple years ago with a 2.05 gpa(shit I know) and now I have the motivation to go back to school. However, I can’t get into a simple college program where a 2.33 gpa is needed. 

My high school marks were awesome(4.0 gpa) but I am being told that my high school marks are irrelevant because I have a uni degree. 

That being said, the college degree is a sports science diploma and my degree that I have is a general arts degree, so the two are completely different. 

Am I doomed with my 2.05 gpa or is there a way I can negate my shitty uni degree and still use my high school marks??

The reason why i want to join this gang is because I feel so fucking alone. I don't get along with my family and I don't really have any friends. I always stay home all day and do mundane things like play video games, hit the gym, or go outside for a bit. When I go to school I always see groups of people who are in clubs hang out and do find activities. I had a friend who joined a anime club and found a kind and bubbly group of friends. He even found a girlfriend, whos a very attractive girl that I can only ever DREAM of being with. He doens't talk to me anymore.
It makes me so fucking that I cut myself once and picked a fight with someone at my school because the anger built up in me was unbearable. I feel so worthless. So lonely, I feel depression and so envious of others.  
I am making a serious dedication to improve myself and be happy but that process will take a while.

671,"I've written and rewritten this post countless times, on several subreddits from r/relationships to r/AITA, hovering overing the 'post' button for a while then abandoning it and logging out of my throwaway. I've wound up here because ultimately I think I just need advice on the situation.

2 weeks ago today I lost my virginity. I'm an average 21 year old guy and I've never had any level of self-esteem or confidence, particularly with women, so this was a pretty big deal for me. It was with someone I met through work and got to know for a few weeks beforehand, then she ended up coming over to my place late on a Friday night. She knew I was a virgin, was patient, and we had a really nice night - I couldn't have asked for a better scenario... apart from the fact she has a boyfriend.

I'm ready for the onslaught of backlash; I know this doesn't make me a great person and it was selfish of me to go ahead with everything, knowing she had a boyfriend waiting for her at home. I don't even know much about their relationship except that she's not particularly happy with him, and they've been together for just over a year.

Keeping it quiet hasn't been a problem, but today it really hit me when my friend/colleague asked me if anything happened with me and this girl, as she'd noticed we'd been getting close over the last few weeks. I denied there was anything going on between us and then started feeling guilty I'd had to lie to a close friend. Ultimately this is going to continue when people ask about my sexual history, and I have to continue saying I'm a virgin.

Being a virgin never really bothered me. Anyone I'm that close with knows I am (or, was) a virgin and it wasn't something I felt ashamed of, I just don't know how I feel about having to continue saying it when it's not true.

So, r/advice, do I continue to lie about my virginity, and lie again when I meet someone else and ""lose"" it? Do I reach out to this girl's boyfriend? Do I talk to her about it?",24Oct2019,1

Me and my brother got closer but my parents (who I still live life with) were hard to get through to and are still trying to accept this. They are trying their hardest tho and I am so thankful for this.
My grandparents and other family members are super homophobic. My mom doesn’t want me to come out because of my grandparents. I already know they will blame my partner for like making me gay or something. They will also berate my mother and try to talk her into forbidding me from being gay (yeah I’m an adult. They can’t do that but it will still suck for both me and my mom).
Sounds like it’s a no brainer to stay in the closet but are a few problems.
1.) my relationship with my grandparents has suffered. I know they won’t love me fully if they knew that I was this happy with my gf. I’ll resent them forever, but I’ll also be an a** if I never give them a chance to act differently.
2.) it’s getting harder to keep this a secret. After seeing me with my girlfriend, my mouthy cousin figured out I was gay. Now I have to treat her like a queen if I want to keep this quiet.
3.) I envy everyone in my family who gets to bring their significant others to holidays and family dinners. I want my partner involved but having them as my plus one at a wedding was risky enough.
So what do? Is it fair to deny my grandparents the chance to prove me wrong if I think I will get chewed out for being gay? Or do I owe it to them and my family to give them a chance to love me unconditionally? Do I risk my cousin revealing my secret? 
I know a lot of people will tell me to move out and be openly gay living somewhere else, but am disabled and can’t live on my own right now as much as I want to.
Thank you for any advice, friends. This is giving me such incredible stress. I want to just come to a decision and finally be at peace with this chapter of my life.",24Oct2019,0

674,"Sorry for the long post in advance. Last year I graduated college and came home to pursue a career in my degree. I know, hopeful. I wasn't in the best spot either; my girlfriend had just left me, I was working the same dead-end job and the only thing I had picked up in my degree field was as a security officer. Despite those shortcomings, I was happy, confident, fun, social, funny, mature, knew what I wanted, and was able to control my depression. 

In this time I re-met an old friend from school who's been on and off again with me, mostly because I'd leave. I started learning about her life again, supported her and her son where I could and we very quickly became romantic again. Everything was at an all time high with her, and I learned to love her and want to spend my life with her.

Then I joined the Army and was taken away from everything I had known. I've made great friends in my time so far, but I've lost everything else about me. I've become shy and antisocial. I'm insecure and not as fun to be around. I'm emotional, depressed, and overthink everything, which has made the girl I love back off and start to lose interest, despite her best efforts not to. I've gotten close to ending my life because of how much of a downward spiral my life has now taken.

I want nothing more than to go back to my old ways, but despite everything I read and all the work I try to put in, I feel like I'm getting nowhere quick. I want to change and be the best man I can be, the best boyfriend possible, and the best father to her child imaginable. I'm just afraid I'll never be able to get better, and I'm going to lose both her and myself forever and become a shell of the man I could've been. Where do I start? How I become better? Is there still hope? Thank you to anyone that can help.

689,"Hi !

I'm a 25M and I'm bisexual. I've had a girlfriend for 4 years, we broke up and now I'm with a gay boy who's also 25. 

My previous relationship was toxic, this girl was really mentally abusive, I took everything on me, stayed with her longer that I shouldn't have, ended up discovering she was cheating on me for several months. Even though I said that I was ok to open our relationship if she wanted to, she cheated on me. I was broken when I learned about this. I felt betrayed, had made efforts for her and never thought about what I wanted to concentrate all my attention on her. I've been suicidal after our break up, for more than a year. I was 21 at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I met him. I knew I was bisexual since I was a kid but never really had strong feelings for boy, only found some of them cute. But it was love at first sight. It was a bit complicated at first, but we formed a stable couple very quickly. He's so mature, calm and would never do anything to hurt me in any way. He helped me so much getting out of my suicidal thoughts being such a comprehensive and supportive boyfriend. I love him, this feeling never changed, and I'm really happy with him being with me on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, since the beginning of it, I knew our sexual life wasn't going to be what I really wanted. I don't blame him at all, I'm the problem here. I have a huge sexual desire. I would want us to do something sexual almost everyday. I want to explore, try things, discover everything that's possible. He's satisfied with us going intimate like three or four times a mounth, doing nothing adventurous. He keeps rejecting me if I try anything while he's not horny at first. 

&amp;#x200B;

During our first year, I tried to talk to him about thing I would like to try and explore with him. He refused most of the time but sometimes accepted to try some stuff. Those things never really last long, they never turned him on that much. I talked to him about sexual practiceswe could try but also opening our relationship, at several levels. I tried to go initimate with him whenever I was excited, but he rarely was receptive. I began to give up, thinking to myself that he was the perfect boyfriend and that I was the problem here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following years, I went on talking to him about everything I wanted in our sexual life, thinking that he might change his mind, but he rejected this saying that I was too insistant. I totally was. We went on a trip to iceland and I don't know why, but his libido suddenly peaked, and we had an improvised threesome. He seemed to have enjoyed it, but now he's back to his normal libido.

Today, I don't want to try anything intimate with him because I always feel like he will reject me whatever I do, that he will not be receptive. He says he wants me to keep on trying because this makes him feel loved. It melt my heart, but I really not feel comfortable with trying anything anymore. I know that what he has to offer on a sexual side never will satisfy me, but I know how lucky I am to have found someone so mature, supportive and loving as he is.

&amp;#x200B;

This situation is driving me crazy, I've beeen hesitating about whever or not I should leave him for the last few mounth, and I think I could use some advices.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : I have a boyfriend. I love him. He helped me go through tough times. I'm really happy with him, but after almost 4 years of frustating sexual life, I'm not sure if I should leave him. I already know I'm the asshole and I don't deserve him, and I need some advice.",24Oct2019,1

691,"Hi all


In reference to my last post my parents are divorcing for a couple of reasons. I have really good day when I know I will soon be free of my father, and I have really bad days when I realize I never exactly had a father in the first place. 


As far as I know I am not mentally ill, but I do seem to have anger management issues, as I revived therapy for it when I was four. I will continue therapy tomorrow actually, as I have not been since but want to get things sorted out. 


I have a childhood friend I’ll call A. I’ve known him since fifth grade but we only became friends around seventh. I am currently a junior in high school. I move a lot and moved between sophomore and junior year. Before that, I went to a different high school than him. We never really lost contact but talked a lot less. 


After a while it started grating on me but I never brought it up. Eventually, I recently brought up that we now live far away from each other and need to move on in life, as we have very different ones. What he told me was that I was useful and a friend of his. I dropped the subject and we havnt discussed it since. 


A few weeks later I brought up the divorce to him. He seemed sympathetic and told me he’d be here for me. I’m grateful to him for this as I know he’s a great person. However, I’m starting to believe he doesn’t really care for me and instead cares for who he knew me to be. I think he thinks that communication is not very important, to which I disagree. We also have not really seen each other much since we left eight grade. He doesn’t know me anymore and is not interested in what I am now and only sees me for who I used to be. 


Now I’m confused. I miss him for who he was but I know nothing about him now. I believe it would be best for me to just walk away, as I want to start my life over once this divorce comes to pass. I truly don’t believe A cares for me, and that no one really does deep down. I’m ok with it, but I don’t want to continue what’s left of our relationship believing he doesn’t care.

Disclaimer: I’m not suicidal, it’s inevitable we meet the reaper eventually. No need to rush it.

Adolescence was so fun to me, chase girls, go to parties, do drugs, not a care in the world.

Common suggestions:

Family – don’t really have any, dead or distant 

Friends – pushed all away during a bout of depression, working on making more but it’s exhausting

Food/Drugs – trying to lose weight so no turning to food for comfort, don’t do drugs anymore 5 months clean/sober, these both used to be a major comfort for me. I can’t seem to discipline myself to go work out every day. Or even eat within calories.

- called me a bitch and a spastic (truly, some devastating remarks)

- indirectly posted about how everyone thinks that i’m nice but i’m really a snake on her snapchat

- threw paper, a glue stick, a pair of scissors and a stapler at me

- moved my school bag along with my art folder (both of which contain very important gcse coursework) around the locker room, hiding them on top of and in different shelves that they were originally placed in

- falsely accused me and my other friends of bullying her 

- falsely accused me of giving her dirty looks (like, come on, we’re not 5)

- threw dirty paint water over me

- when she found out i went to a teacher about all of the above, she cornered me and whispered, “go cry to [insert teacher’s name here]”

- made several alternative instagram accounts in order to contact me and go onto my page (it is a private account which she cannot see as she was the one to block me. it confuses me as to why she makes alts to do this if she doesn’t want to follow me in the first place)

- made various calls to me while hiding her caller id 

- spread around secrets that i had once told her in confidence 


however, i am not the only one she bullies. she has been reported to various members of staff over the four and a quarter years we have attended school by a myriad of other pupils. what really bothers me is that no amount of punishment or detention has been able to get her to reform. she feels no remorse for those she has hurt and no guilt about what she does. she continues to physically and verbally attack anyone she has a grudge against. 

i have of course tried to reconcile things on many occasions. this had been going on since april and i have given her no reaction, yet the quieter i stay the more she seems to pick on me. she targets me and my friends when there are no teachers around so that there will be no important witnesses.

while what she has been doing is not major, and i do feel extremely childish for complaining, i had to vent my feelings here. it hurts that someone i once considered my best friend has turned on me, along with many others, so viciously.

is there any way i can get her to leave me alone? the more she picks on me, the more upset become. i am worried that i will soon do something to myself that i will regret.

713,"As the title states, I'm 16 years old and there's a gang I wanna join. This gang is a group of troubled and deliquent kids who go to my school. I've talked to them for a while and I get along with them very well. They seem very kind when I got to know them.
The reason why i want to join this gang is because I feel so fucking alone. I don't get along with my family and I don't really have any friends. I always stay home all day and do mundane things like play video games, hit the gym, or go outside for a bit. When I go to school I always see groups of people who are in clubs hang out and do find activities. I had a friend who joined a anime club and found a kind and bubbly group of friends. He even found a girlfriend, whos a very attractive girl that I can only ever DREAM of being with. He doens't talk to me anymore.
It makes me so fucking that I cut myself once and picked a fight with someone at my school because the anger built up in me was unbearable. I feel so worthless. So lonely, I feel depression and so envious of others.  
I am making a serious dedication to improve myself and be happy but that process will take a while. 
That's why I wanna join  this gang I was invited to but I also feel... Like I really shouldnt, because it'll bring me a lot of trouble, but I don't know what to do anymore. 
Also if you're gonna tell me not to worry about making friends because I won't see most of them after I graduate highschool than please don't bother commenting at all. I understand that but I still wanna enjoy my youth and have fun now that I'm still a teenager.",24Oct2019,1

737,"I need urgent help.  I have posted this else where but no luck.

I am in an urgent situation where I need to raise money for school.  This is my story:

An university accepted me and gave me grants for being the first person in my family history to attempt an University.  The financial aid office initially told me in August that all my tuition will be covered through loans and grants.  So I took out $10,000 loan.  I was so excited to be the first to go to an University in my family! My mom would have been so proud.  

In September, the school told me I need $2550 for health insurance if I don’t already have it.  I am 25 years old, working part time and was refused any cheap healthcare (otherwise too expensive).  So I decided to go with school’s insurance.  Again, financial aid office told me that my tuition will be covered by grants and loans.  

Yesterday, our financial aid office sent me an email, telling that I owe them close to $4000.  I went to get things clarified for me at the financial aid office and they said they don’t know who told him he was covered, but he owns school that much money.  But, they said, I could waive my health insurance ($2550) if I get my own insurance.  But the rest will be due by end of this month (October).  The front desk people in financial aid made fun of me openly.  I was hurt, but still mostly worried about where the money will come from. 

Last night, I called a number on Obama care website and got an insurance coverage that is still quite expensive, but slightly cheaper.  I didn’t sleep, looked for jobs/scholarship.  

Today I went back to financial office, they told me that the health insurance I signed up for may not be eligible to waive my school Heath insurance.  However, they did not have written documentation on this information.  I already paid $200 on the new insurance yesterday, this is a lose-lose situation for me already.  

I will speak to some higher up in the school later.  I don’t have much hope in winning this battle...

I currently work part time making $15/hour, taking 15 credit hours and have to pay expensive rent in MA.  I refuse to do anything illegal to raise this money.  Please give me advice/pointers.  I have already tried “gofundme”, and not many people have helped.  I received many negative comments about my own personal inability to make money.  I feel like I’m trying the best I can, also open to hear how you guys pay for college (not loan, but these standing fee).

738,"so basically im turning 19 this november and im completely lost mentally. my life was alright up until highschool because in highschool i got addicted to weed and nicotine and developed OCD, depression, and depersonalization disorder. i had shitty grades and barely graduated because all i did was smoke weed every day multiple times a day for months without a break. my mental health has been fucked up ever since i entered my teen years. i constantly think about getting high and i have low self esteem and no motivation due to my depression. i had a job and wasted thousands of dollars and vapes, weed, food &amp; video games. everyday i wish i could restart my life or could have been born as another human being. nothing brings me happiness, even though i get high i just think negative thoughts about my life while im high and yet i continue to smoke everyday because i developed a fuck my life type of attitude. i also have lots of family issues because of my narcissistic dad who doesnt give a fuck about anybody except for himself, he moved me and my family to pakistan and i feel even more lost now because all i do in this country is watch youtube videos all day and smoke cigarettes. my ocd causes me to overthink 24/7 and i want to fix my life but i have no proper guidance. despite my shitty grades i got accepted to college for business management but my dad did not want me to go because he thinks its a useless program and he doesnt want to fund my education. he is really controlling of my life and my moms and my sisters life. he doesnt let my mom even have a facebook account or a cellphone because hes paranoid that she will cheat on him and i know for a fact that’s impossible because my mom is a very religious person. he has major anger issues and fuckinf yells at everyone for no reason and i cant do anything about it since nobody gives a fuck in this country. i had a passion for music creation and i even started producing beats but my dad would yell at me because he says music is for black people and im not black. i want to go back to canada and go to college and make music on the side but my dad tells me to fuck off and he would rather have me sit in this trash country and watch youtube videos all day and smoke hash and then he complains that i dont do anything with my life. i know im a lazy pothead loser but atleast i somewhat tried to do something with my life by applying to college and shit but idk my dad really pisses me off. i dont know what to do because i have no money and no guidance. someone help me because my brain feels like its melting everyday. sorry this post is all over the place im just typing as words come to my mind.",24Oct2019,2

742,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

I recently became really good friends with this girl from school. However the more and more I talk to her the more I get really concerned for her well being. Before I became friends with her I thought she always seemed really happy and had her life together, but as I've gotten to know her this is not the case.

She keeps being really really sad, like the other day was her birthday and she was crying when she got home because she thought she looked 'ugly' in the photos people took of her. She also keeps crying and saying how her life is shit when shes really clever, has loads of friends, is absolutely beautiful, goes out a lot etc. and it absolutely breaks my heart that she thinks of herself in that way.

Tonight though was the worst she was going to get her hair done and seemed in a good mood but messaged me later absolutely crying her eyes out, she told me her life is so shit and she went and sat on a bridge (like considering jumping) cause she says she knows pills don't work and shes gonna feel this way forever so there's no point in living. I am in absolute shock and have absolutely no idea what to do, I've been messaging her and telling how she means so much to so many people and things will get better etc and she says thank you etc but I feel like I'm making absolutely no difference at all and shes gonna do something really bad. She said she felt shit as some boy from school (who she had rejected) had messaged her telling her she was a terrible person and he had told the boy she liked who has now stopped speaking to her as a result. I feel absolutely awful for her she doesn't deserve to feel this way shes so pure and nice to everyone. 
Also she's only really telling me and one other girl who is her friend how she's feeling rather then all her other friends so I'm worried I'm not enough and she's suffering in silence.  


So basically wtf do I do, I want her to stop feeling this way and just be happy but I haven't got a clue what to do as I feel like shit all the time and I never deal with it, but this is on a whole different level.

754,"Or maybe I'm panicking? This has never happened to me before. I have absolutely never been scared of any nightmares before to this extent. 
Allow me to explain.
This has happened only 20-30 mins ago. As far as my memory goes back about the dream I remember my family being together (my brother lives away, he came home and was sleeping too) and I was sleeping in exactly the same position and everything around me was exactly the same in reality I remember before falling asleep.
     
So the issue was I saw a figure in my dream. I can't tell it was a girl or a boy but it surely could shapeshift into my brother and it would giggle. Something kicked in me and I woke up (in my dreams, it was like a multilayer dreams which has happened previously and I couldn't wake up that time too but less scary).

So when I opened my eyes again in my dream, I remember my phone was under my back and I check it to see it had 4% charge. I remembered that wasn't my actual percentage before going to sleep. I tried couple of times to wake up even the most bullshit method that has failed me before in my dream what they call is ""having an object that can differentiate between reality and dream"". Every time I realized I was dreaming I would try to get out of there and this shapeshift monster would bring me back and I would always see it going past in front of me when I'm in my sleeping position. At some point I even concluded that I probably died and I was stuck in an endless loop because I've been thinking afterlife recently. Just some curiosity. 

Dream had so many flaws in it but issue is every time I supposedly woke up it would try to mimic the reality even better and having failed to woke myself up I was stuck there. I still feel dreamy. 

I googled right away what to do and I couldn't find a better solution.
How do I know that it's not a dream again? What can I do to calm myself down? What was the dream anyways? A multilayered lucid nightmare? I keep telling myself it's not a dream,I have waken up but if I notice a slight difference in reality I might panic even worse.",24Oct2019,1

760,"Hey guys, to post this was kinda hard to do for me, so please bare with me. I’ve always been a person who bottles up their problems and worries and I already told my problem to my friends and family. I just feel like an unbiased opinion would be good.


Here’s the thing: 
This whole week has been a roller-coaster... The weekend before I was asking myself for the second time, of my major in University is really what I want to do. I don’t know if it’s homesickness or something... I‘m already getting annoyed at certain courses while others are fun. Still I’m getting buried with homework and whole books to read over just one week... (I don’t know if I’m complaining about nothing here...)
Because of this I’m thinking about applying for the police academy in my country, which is stressful in itself.

On Thursday I was very happy as first, as I thought I would drive to a concert with my parents and a friend.

And then my mom picked me up from the train station and told me my dad couldn’t bring us, because there is a tumor in his bladder. He had his operation today, but we still don’t know if it really is cancer... On Tuesday I was still quite optimistic about our situation.

We still went to the concert and I had fun, even in University the next day until I remembered the loads of work I still had to do and couldn’t because of a stomach ache (I always get those when stressed out, but it had been half a year since the last time and I didn’t even get it before my first flight or during my vacation this summer).

I was gloomy the whole day and kinda knew that  I needed to cry off all that stress that might’ve been out of worry for my dad and my mum (because of all the consequences that would happen if he really has cancer). Iwanted to call my mom and she didn’t pick up at first, so I was alone in my dorm room, two hours away from home, crying my eyes out. My best friend could snap me out of it by texting and I was trying to be positive again. Well... when I talked to my dad on the phone I cried even more... but it got better again, he even got me to laugh (even though he must be really scared himself).

Today was okay until this evening. I had fun in my lecture, but only because nobody was paying attention and instead posting memes to the group chat of this specific class (I still smile thinking about those :D) and I played soccer again after a two year break because of mental health reasons (it’s nothing serious I swear! It was only that my old coach ruined the game for me and I needed time to ‚breathe‘) and it was a lot of fun.

Now my boss from my part-time job called me and said me I couldn’t work for them anymore, because I was too slow for all the time I’ve been working there and that some people complained because I forgot or didn’t notice certain things (I want to add here, that I sometimes only worked once a month!).


All this negative news this week really dragged me down. I really want to stay positive but it’s hard. I don’t know how to. I’m not depressed,  I’ve always managed to stay on top. Even through bulling no ‚bad thought‘ ever crossed my mind (other than hating those people :D)  and it still doesn’t now. This week has just been shit and I really miss home (even though I go there every weekend) and this ‚identity crisis‘ of sorts doesn’t make it better.
So of course I‘m sad and kind of mad.
I just don’t know how to cope with this other than telling people. I’d like some honest opinions or encouragement, that’s all.

Thanks if you made it through all of this and still decide to answer my post! :)",24Oct2019,1
761,"My Spanish teacher sent an email to my dad. She spoke to me yesterday about cutting her class and I’ve been trying to tell her I have other things in my life and I can’t be in school everyday. She looks at it as me cutting her class even though it isn’t nothing like that. My dad hasn’t seen the email and he probably will never see it because he isn’t that tech savvy. I was able to delete the email from my phone because  I have the email on my phone. She said in the email that she is going to be writing a referral. I don’t know whether I should respond to the email as my dad or just ignore it. If I go to her class tomorrow I don’t know if she will send me to a principals office or what. She also wants to talk to him on the phone but I know that can’t happen. Should I even go to school at all tomorrow? If I don’t, tomorrow is Friday and maybe by Monday everything would have blown over because the next time I would have her class would be Tuesday. Incase they try to call him, I blocked the schools number from his phone already so they wouldn’t be able to contact him at all. My grades are actually very good so I don’t know why she is making this a big deal that I missed two class periods at the end of a marking period. I want to switch out of her class but it would probably be too late to do that. I’m not is disrespectful student and I always do my work but she is trying to escalate this to something really not that important. My dad is the only parent I have in my life at the moment and he would be devastated if he found out. I need help on what to do.",24Oct2019,1
762,"Hello! I need advice on a difficult problem I’ve been facing recently. I’m currently a senior in college. Credit-wise I should be able to graduate next semester but I’ve really struggled the last 2 semesters with mental health issues and my gpa shows it (we’re talking a 2.0 overall and a 2.4 in my given major). A 2.5 in my major is required to graduate however I’m still not doing well this semester and have been having a rough battle with depression. Unfortunately my chosen career path requires graduate school to make any sort of a living, this means I need at least a 3.0 (there are some schools who will take you with a 2.5 but not many and they’re across the country from me). I absolutely hate the town my college is in. I’m 75 miles from my friends and family after growing up only ever needing to travel 15 minutes to see any of them. I think being so far from home is the direct cause to my struggle with depression. I’m worried that I’m gonna be stuck in this town even longer just in the name of not losing money by transferring in loosing some credits. However, I’m already a year ahead of my peers as I did a full year of PSEO my senior year of high school which means I started my first year of college as a sophomore. Therefore I have the wiggle room to retake my junior year if I needed to. I also found out yesterday my mother has entered stage four of heart failure which means her organs are failing and she only has a year at best. Although her and I have a rather rough relationship, I’d still like the option to be with her this last year of her life. 

To summarize: I need advice on whether I should pursue transferring or just stick it out.",24Oct2019,1

765,"I'm writing my Bachelor's thesis at the moment. I switched to a Bachelor's from a degree that usually takes 5-6 years to complete (I live in Germany). My reasons were personal (family) and health related. I have a lot more credits than I need now, but the switch was eventually better for me. 

Half a year ago, I met someone who is a bit younger than me, and she was already enrolled in her SECOND Bachelor's degree (a Bachelor's usually takes 3-4 years in Germany). She finished the first one and was in her first year of her second degree.

As I was writing my thesis just now, this girl appeared in my head out of all sudden, and now I can't stop comparing myself to her. She already has a degree and I don't have one yet. I'm always worried that some administrative mistake could happen, and that this could snatch my degree out of my hands last minute. I'll hand in my thesis in 2 weeks but I feel inadequate. I do this all the time, I constantly see images of other people in my head, and how they already have their degree. I can't even watch some of my favorite Youtubers right now because I know they already have a degree. It's frustrating.

766,"I went to speak to my line manager last week about development within my current branch and was told at the moment it’s unlikely. I then applied for and have an interview for an internal move to a different branch next week for a higher position. However, my current branch has listened to my reasons for wanting the move and put together a plan on how they can support my development within my current branch. This now means that it would be more beneficial for me to stay within my current role as the training and opportunities being presented to me (and the word used was ‘we PROMISE to facilitate this’). However, I’m worried that if I cancel my interview, I’ve trashed my credibility within my company. I don’t want to create bad blood between myself and the other department.

771,"Hi, and thanks for reading in advance! I'm stuck in a strange circumstance with a close friend of mine, and I feel like I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place. To fully explain my situation, I need to retell the past few months.

A good friend of mine (lets call him Carl) and I left the state we live in for a while to pursue a job opportunity for the both of us in another state. At the time, he was dating the girl I mentioned in the title (Mary). Mary and Carl had been dating for almost two years, but I had known each of them separately for about 7 years, so they were both close friends of mine. While we were away from home, Carl suddenly broke up with Mary over text while intoxicated without any warning. He then insisted they stay broken up after he sobered up.  I thought that was a huge dick move on his part, as he could have waited a few days to tell her in person, but all together I decided it was best to stay out of it as it wasn't entirely my business. In the months since this has happened, Carl has become increasingly difficult for me or any of our mutual friends to hang out with. To make a long story shorter, Carl has done and said a lot of things in the months since their breakup that make myself and our friends no longer want to even associate with him.  Mary is still a member of my small friend group. 

Mary and I have had a very strange friendship, for example a few years ago we both admitted to one another that we had romantic feelings for each other but mutually decided not to act on them and put our friendship at risk. A few days ago, Mary and I had an identical discussion: we shared a confession of mutual romantic feelings. Again, we agreed not to act on it, this time for many different reasons. The biggest reason is that I am in the process of joining the military and do not yet know where I will be stationed. I could be a few hours from home, or sent overseas. I told her I wanted to wait and see what would happen with that, and that maybe we could bring this up again if I was stationed close to home. However, in the few days between that conversation and now, we have spent every night together just as friends but just the two of us, which has never happened before. We have even made plans for tomorrow and the next day. In the time I've spent with her, I've realized that I feel an incredible connection with her, and that I desperately want to pursue a relationship with her. I worry that if I don't make a move soon, I will regret it for a very long time. I still don't know where I will be deployed, but since I am taking a non-combative role in the air-force, I am very likely to be stationed only a few hours from home. The problem I've considered with waiting is that it could be anytime between now and January before I find out where I'm going.

I've asked friends who aren't involved in that same friend group, and they've all told me to go for it, but I figured that it couldn't hurt to get strangers' opinions online. Should I throw caution to the wind and ask her to take things a step further with me, or should I take a step back and wait? I should mention, I no longer consider Carl, her ex, my friend. Otherwise, I wouldn't be nearly as willing to consider dating Mary. Bro-code and such.

TLDR; Should I ask my ex-friend's ex out? Her and I are old friends, have mutual feelings for each other, and have very similar interests. The only problem is that I am joining the military and do not yet know where I will be stationed and have no idea when I will find out.  I feel as though I am in a ""now or never"" scenario.

Emotions exist to tell you that something is “wrong” and I don’t know what my brain is trying to tell me? I’ve already acknowledged that I’ve felt angry, guilty, lonely, sad, disgusted, responsible, regretful, but it doesn’t seem to go away for long. I’m just... so baffled.

As such, I don't exactly see myself or my body in a positive light and I know that I let that affect my choices and actions, but I don't know how to stop. I guess in some ways I don't totally feel like I deserve good things.

 The most recent problem that's come with this is that I've been talking to a guy from Tinder for about two weeks, and in the past week we've planned to meet up and have a first ""date"", though it wasn't specifically called that. I'm *really* anxious about it. All of these thoughts are running through my head, like what if he thinks I'm boring? What if he doesn't find me attractive in real life? What if it's horrible and awkward and scares me off of first dates for the rest of my life?

I know, logically, it's not a big deal. If he doesn't like me, he's just some random guy, it doesn't matter. But I'm afraid of putting myself out there and then getting a bad result. I've always been a person who gets crushes on unattainable people, probably because it means I can avoid getting hurt or feeling bad. Things becoming real scares me, a lot. I should just push through that, right?

777,"I joined a string quartet with friends, one of whom I'm very close to. I'm in high school, and it's a thing we get together for about half a week per month. Originally, they invited me and were very eager for me to join, and I thought it would be a fun group where we would just sight read things. Towards the beginning of the school year, the one im closest to (whose mom runs/works with the group) started to ask me to do anything I can to join the group. I started getting the sense that if I didn't join, they would be out a player. 

It was very fun in the beginning, we spent time together, laughed, etc, and played two pieces together regularly. I am very busy and so my parents weren't very on board with it in the beginning, but I convinced them to let me do it because I had already pretty much promised to do it and I was worried that if I didn't, they wouldn't find someone in my place.

Recently though, I found out that the main thing they want to do with the group is audition for a competition that's very far from where I am. It's in May, and Im pretty sure my mom wouldn't let me do it because of how far away it is, and the very likely possibility that I'll have something come up in May. One of the other people in the group said that they dropped an orchestra that was important to them because of this group. Now it seems like what would have been a fun endeavor is turning into a serious thing that I really don't think I can do.

Now, on the group chat, I'm being frequently semi attacked for saying that I'm not sure I can do certain things. Someone cancelled a rehearsal last minute on a Saturday night, and because of that, I wasnt sure I could do the next day, Sunday (because I would have needed to stay over to make the next day's rehearsal), and when I voiced this, I was told ""you already said you could do the Sunday rehearsal"" and was told that by even the person who cancelled the Saturday rehearsal. 

At this point, I'm not sure I want to be in the group anymore, but I don't want to damage my relationship with them (especially one person), and screw them over by leaving them out a person, but I'm also worried if I don't do something soon, I'm gonna continue to be roped into things that I don't have the time for.

I seek advice since I am still on the edge about my decision tomorrow I got the following options:


Flat A:

My current flat living with my parents would be free to move in for me.
I could keep the custom build kitchen and bathroom furniture.
Monthly rent: 530e for 2 rooms
Bonus: good connection to the public transportation services and I know this area very well, feels like a home for the first time (friends and family are near) 

Flat B:
I gotta pay about 800e to enter a certain cooperative which offers pretty good rents
and the option to move within their living spaces throughout my city.
I would also pay for the built in kitchen which is 1000e (and is pretty nice!)
Monthly rent: 415e for 1 room
Bonus: No further raise of the given rents

What type of business does he have? He helps people get food stamps and medical insurance, does taxes, immigration, bankruptcy, etc. I'm helping him with a bankruptcy.

Prior to him asking me for help, I had actually worked for him for about 2 years but then quit because I just couldn't deal with it anymore. I HATED it. Yes it benefited me a lot with all this knowledge but it was just something I didn't want to do anymore. I was 18 at the time.

790,"To start things off my workplace (a restaurant) is very friendly, new hires are always treated warmly and co-workers often plan casual outside of work events that involve the consumption of drugs and alcohol.  A few months ago a new hostess (20 F) was hired and as we worked several shifts together (I work takeout catty-cornered to the hostess area) I introduced myself and we've quickly become friends.  I'm 21 M, have been with my girlfriend for a little over four years and I'm pretty happy with that whole situation so my intentions have always been friendly.

Now for the actual offending incident, last weekend at an early halloween party put on by another coworker/my very good friend somebody told me that new hostess (we can call her Dany) ""thought I was cute"" and that there was a rumor going around that my girlfriend and I had broken up which was only strengthened by the fact that my girlfriend was out of town at the time.  I was drunk but I told her the rumor was not true and continued to partake and enjoy myself thinking that so long as Mary didn't do anything i had nothing to worry about. That continued for about and hour untill Dany cornered me in the kitchen grabbed my hands, due to my awkward nature and my current state I wasn't sure what to do with my body or at all really. The encounter continued bad follows at least according to my memory.

I think I stammered and didn't say much for a little while I looked for an escape

D: ""you should break up with her""

I laugh uncomfortably, make eye contact with the host who then saves me and after I spend the rest of the night waiting for my group to be ready to leave and avoiding contact with Dany.

Since then I have not told my girlfriend and have seen Dany several times at work we haven't talked but I do catch her looking at me and turning away quickly when I see her.  Im disappointed because I enjoyed being friends with her and being cold towards co-workers is hard for me. The reason I haven't told my girlfriend is that Dany is objectively attractive and I fear it would put strain on my relationship with my girlfriend.

So my questions to you all are
1. How should I move forward with Dany to decrease the uncomfortable tension?
2. Should I tell my girlfriend about this incident?

TLDR: Co-worker tells me to break up with my girlfriend because she finds me cute. What do?",24Oct2019,1
792,"Let me preface this by saying: YES, I was aware they took nudes before finding the photos I did. I have never asked my friend for nudes nor did I have any interest whatsoever in seeing theirs. However this friend is adamantly against having any sexual/explicit photos of themselves online. There is little doubt in my mind that the person in said photos is my friend, and I do not want them to have issues with this later down the road in their career(the same reason they do not want pictures of themself up). Do I tell my friend that their pictures are online, basically telling them I’ve seen them, or just ignore the situation and pretend it never happened??

793,Me and my friend were on Omegle when we came across a video of a man raping a child. I wanted to click away but I told my friend to get a picture of the guys face. I suspected it may be a pre-existing video that someone was displaying for some kind of sick joke. But according to my friend Omegle tells you if the footage is altered. So anyway we got this guy's face on camera although it's not great quality. I want to know where we should send it to in order to have the best chance of him getting put away.,24Oct2019,3

I don’t think he knows about me and his friend, but i’m afraid he will and he won’t want to be friends anymore. Our friendship has nothing to do with my ex; i want absolutely nothing to do with him anymore. I will be the first to admit upfront that i wasn’t the best girlfriend, and i had my issues.

795,"I’m having a rough time and need some guidance. Although I work in healthcare, ironically the people I work with are far less compassionate and understanding than you would expect. I’ve taken a leave of absence from work to try and manage my health condition (I have POTS, a type of dysautonomia), but I had to go back a few weeks ago because I ran out of FMLA. And it was my psychiatrist who wrote me out, because none of the other doctors I see would do it. 

I’ve missed 3 days of work this week because I’ve been too symptomatic to work or even function, and my boss told me that this is a problem and becoming an issue now. I have no idea what to do. Explaining to him how I am feeling is a waste of my time. I have a blood pressure monitor which Is showing drastic changes in my heart rate upon standing and even more so when I go up the 6 steps of stairs I have in my house. I’m talking 50+ increase in HR from sit to stand with BP drop and a 70+ increase in HR with additional dropping of BP literally just going up the stairs. I’m dizzy, weak, unsteady, lightheaded with headache, and it feels like my heart could explode from my chest. 

I see my primary doctor next week , but she doesn’t seem to have much knowledge of POTS. I don’t get in to see someone at the dysautonomia clinic at Duke until May of next year and the medication that the cardiologist put me on in the meantime doesn’t seem to be working. I can’t go on working while feeling like this. I’m probably going to lose my job. What am I supposed to do? I feel so hopeless right now.",24Oct2019,1

I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",24Oct2019,0
797,"I’m used to be the friend that no one actually likes because most of my friendships have been that way. Now I just have a few friends but I can’t invite them anywhere even in those cases when I feel like they actually like me because then I start to think that if I spend too much time around them we won’t get close and that it’s more likely that they’ll start to see me as boring and annoying so I only speak to my few friends left online or when I just happen to stimulera across them. They don’t invite me to places either probably because it’s awkward to be first to ask and probably because I seem to push people away. 

I can’t even make any friends unless I am introduced or that the person does the first move, but that rarely happens because I don’t socialize and my antisocial atmosphere is keeping new people away. I tried to make friends by making the first move, but once I try to talk to someone new without being spoken to my voice just physically doesn’t come out and it’s been like this for four years. I’ve even been in the same class for almost three years and still haven’t made friends with my classmates in my last year of school.

803,"Over the past eight years or so, I have found Quora answers in search results and thought that Quora should be a reputable site for Q&amp;As. However, after doing some research, I realized that Quora is filled to the brim with trolling, pointless questions, poor moderation, and agenda-pushing and psuedoscience enabling users who post questionable answers on the site to get upvotes. While I think Quora is much better than Yahoo Answers or even Answers.com, the fact that the site allows Q&amp;A in a wiki-like format leaves it vulnerable to abuse.

There was this user named *Mark Dunn* who has made answers to questions related to psychiatry that contain an anti-psychiatry bias and in one question ""Should I trust answers in Quora?"", he replied ""You should not trust answers on the Internet without credible sources."" However in all of his answers related to psychiatry, he never once cited a source. I believe he stated that he is a former psychiatric patient and not a medical professional.

This makes me wonder if Quora is not a good place to ask medical-related questions and I should instead consult my doctor, PA, or NP when I have a medical issue. On top of that, Quora seems to be vulnerable to the same kind of trolling and vandalism on Wikipedia due to its open nature. I would like to know what you all think about this.",24Oct2019,1

807,"I think this probably stems from what I went through as a kid.  My mother was extremely strict, to the point of being abusive.  I was constantly walking on eggshells around her because anything I did that she didn’t like would send her into a rage and I’d end up getting punished for something.  Her punishments were kind of sadistic and often involved public humiliation (not allowed food, forced to wear humiliating clothes to school, forced to lie and  and tell a female friend I’m in love with her or something so that she’d stop being my friend, forced to wear shorts and not be allowed to shave my legs, not allowed to use pads and forced to bleed on myself, etc.).  She’d automatically think that all of my behaviors were a sign of me doing drugs, having sex, being a criminal, etc. even though I was a nerdy, disliked kid who didn’t even have that many friends.  She also frequently thought I was lying and hiding something and would question me endlessly to try to get me to confess to things I didn’t do.  

As a result, I’m constantly anxious about people thinking I’m lying.  I get such extreme anxiety around it, that everything I say ends up looking like a lie anyway because I get really, nervous, shifty, and unconfident.  It gets to the point that I start to believe that maybe I *did* do whatever it was after all, and I must actually be lying.  I have a hard time in my relationship with my husband because I try desperately hard to avoid him ever having a bad opinion of something about myself.

It gets incredibly exhausting, and it’s hard to be myself.  As a result, I am a pretty introverted person and really need alone time because it’s the only time I can feel comfortable in my own skin and won’t have to put on a show for other people and pretend to be normal.  Any time my husband has a concern or gets bothered about something, I take it extremely personally.  I try everything I can to “reverse” him having any kind of negative thought about me.

It has gotten to the point that I have stopped doing many of the things I used to do because I get extremely worried that my husband will misinterpret something and think that I’m doing something bad, etc.  I’m not doing anything, but then I convince myself that I must be doing something I shouldn’t.  For example, I used to go to eat for lunch or dinner sometimes in the past.  Now, I feel like going out to eat is somehow betraying my husband.  If I tell him I went out to eat, I feel like he will question why I’m going out.  If I don’t tell him, I feel like I’m hiding something.  And it’s like this for EVERYTHING.  I desperately need alone time, but I can’t bring myself to go do something else because I worry my husband will think something is wrong or that I can’t stand to be around him, etc.  It also doesn’t help that he wants to do everything together, and whenever he does feel like something is wrong, he starts getting confused and questioning me.  He’ll say something like “I don’t understand why you’re so anxious over THAT.  It’s so insignificant,” etc.  I’d just rather not tell him than have to talk about it.

The most freedom I ever felt was when I was single because I didn’t have to worry about all this.  Now I feel like I’m walking on eggshells like when I was younger, and it has made me incredibly depressed.  We got married recently, and I have become pretty suicidal over the past year.  At least 3 days a week (often more), when I get home from work, I go straight to bed and sleep for hours because I’m so depressed and apathetic about life.  I’ve been drinking a lot more.  I often think about suicide methods. 

I have avoided trying to get therapy or antidepressants because I feel like it’s some kind of “red flag” and my husband will question our relationship.  I know all this isn’t logical, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t bring myself to do this because I have such a strong feeling of betrayal tied to it.  I also feel guilty because it will mean we have to spend our money on some problem that *I* have.  I don’t know how to deal with all this.",24Oct2019,2

We love eachother to death but we are not independent enough to get married and we are still in college.

815,"Alright, so I have been putting up with this for over two months.

The kid is 13 or 14.

Every evening, the neighbor's kid is outside, standing in the street. He is hitting acorns with a baseball bat. He intentionally aims at neighbor's windows, cars, etc. It does not seem he is targeting any house in particular, he aims at all. At first I thought he was just swinging, oblivious, but now I notice when he notices the acorn hit a window or car, he does a home run trot. He even watches until he hears it.

I have noticed some small dents in my car that typically doesn't leave the driveway except for weekends. Some acorns nearby, but I don't have cameras to provide proof.

Now I have only noticed acorns, but I can't say he hasn't tried with other things.

I have tried contacting the parents, but either they are never home, or they just don't answer the door. Today he was doing it *in front of his mother*, but she got into her car before I could get to her. The father is a police officer, and I rarely see him home.

816,"Over the past month my best friend of a few years and I have split into different friend groups (not my decision but hers). I understand people grow and change and we are still friends now but I still genuinely don’t know why it happened. We were once so close and talked lots but she suddenly switched and when I say suddenly I mean like boom. 

Recently she text me saying she’s sorry because she did me dirty, which she honestly did. Coming back to school she completely left me even when I waited for her during break (she wouldn’t show up) and would lie to me saying she was busy so she couldn’t see me and left me in the dark. That’s not to say I didn’t do some bad stuff because admittedly I was pretty clingy, but that’s kinda understandable when you’re friend starts leaving you without explaining why.

I miss her a lot. Though she did some bad stuff so did I. What I genuinely don’t get is why it happened and the answer is still unclear. She said she was just as happy with me so why leave? Now I know some people just change, but why feel so guilty if there wasn’t a reason for it.

I think she misses me too. But we are at a stage now where things can’t simply go back to how they were. I just want to see her more, talk to her more. Surely I can’t be the only one crying about this. Is she just as upset as me?",24Oct2019,2

Context: I’m a male on the downside of 48. My wife is 46. We have 3 kids. They’re 21, 18 and 14. Divorce is something that doesn’t happen in our family lineage. We’ve been very blessed. We were both raised in conservative evangelical Christian homes in the South (USA for those of you not American). My wife and I met in college. We married after 2 years. Over time our relationship had its ups and downs, but was pretty strong overall. Sex life was terrible in early years then got better. Then, 10 years ago I got sick and started having seizures. I was diagnosed with epilepsy and had to start taking powerful drugs that alter the way you think and feel and over time has impaired my memory to the point that now I’m disabled and no longer working. Anti-seizure meds are known to ware down the brown as much or more than the seizures do. It’s a double edged sword. This has changed our lives a lot. That and other crazy stuff that has happened seems to have just made her resent me, though she says it’s all in my head and tries to make me feel crazy. It’s very hurtful. Last year and so far this year combined I bet we be only had sex about 5-7 times. One thing that has irritated me is about 4 to 5 years ago she basically just started sitting on her butt and all she does is watch TV. For 6 years I let her homeschool the kids which ruined my oldest kids life and nearly my younger 2 (they’re back in now) Now she’s working again. Even so, as soon as she’s done working for the day, she sits down and just watches TV for hours. She never wants to do anything. She has gained 50lbs. She complains about being fat and goes on and off diets and I remind her that none of them will work if she doesn’t exercise. We basically never have had quite a few things in common, but I’ve always acquiesced to her wishes. I like to be outdoors. I’d like to go hiking, camping and biking with her. She refuses. I’m really sick of it and want to just drive away and try to find someone I can be happy with, yet the thought of hurting her, my kids, even my in-laws and upsetting my parents bothers me. I feel like my life is slipping away and I am going to miss out on so much I wanted to do, yet I also feel like I would be a total dick if I left my wife. I don’t know what to do.

821,"Hi, so, my father and Stepmother have always been, messy. On the 6 months out of each year that I stayed with them growing up, I would usually spend a good portion of my time cleaning up after them. They just do not clean. It was better when they were both working but 10 years later it has just gotten worse.

A few weeks ago I came to visit for the first time in over a year. A year prior, there was a bad fight and I was kicked out of the house. Both of them were on drugs and my step mother, who had just given birth, had turned into a monster. I had moved back in to help with the baby, but things turned sour very quickly and I became a sole unpaid housekeeper and nanny while also trying to find a job as they had taken my savings from me and I had no money to my name. The house was spotless when I left. When I came back not a week later to get some clothes, they had already started letting trash and diapers pile up.

Anyhow, upon stepping into the house after a year of not being here, I was appalled. I wanted to turn and leave. I decided to visit out of the blue as I hadn't seen my dog (he lives with them) in over a year and I missed him. 
I literally felt like I was walking into an episode of hoarders. Trash piled everywhere, old baby food scattered across the floor, dirty, maggot filled diapers strewn about the house. The bathroom was filled with tampons and old pads, it was absolutely disgusting. I got to work on doing what I usually do when I visit my family, cleaning up their shit. We put a very good dent in it between me and my dad (he ""seems"" equally appalled by the disaster, but he is equally responsible for it and will not change his habits. Nevertheless, when I start cleaning, he typically does too.)
When I left, I told him to please keep cleaning, neither of them are working right now so there is no excuse not to. Take the time that you aren't working and fix up the house so that you aren't so depressed about living in a shithole.
I came back to visit again and it was, unbelievably, WORSE than when i left a week ago. I don't know how. Its like they were purposefully trying to undo everything I did.
The only area that seems only slightly the same as when I left is the bathroom, and its still piled high with diapers and garbage.
The house smells like a landfill. I can't believe my baby brother is living in this wreck. The moment I get back home I want to do something, but Idk what. My stepmom has done nothing but attempt to blame ME for the state of things, ""I don't know what you did to your father's bedroom but it was SPOTLESS before you came to live here."" but I know shes mentally ill, I know shes on the defensive right now, and probably still on drugs. I know she doesn't mean it so I ignore her. I've suffered at the hand of her emotional manipulation for 10 years but I don't let it bother me anymore.

At this point, I need to say something. I asked my dad if he could get a cleaning crew in here but he said its too expensive. He keeps saying he'll clean it up but I can't keep coming up here just to make sure my brother isn't living in a landfill. I have a life I'm building for myself and I can't emotionally deal with this anymore.

They need help. I don't know what to do. I am emotionally exhausted just looking at this fucking place.
I planned on getting some pictures and video once they left today to run errands but my dad lost his car keys and we just spent literally 5 hours tearing the house apart to find the keys with no luck. The house looks pretty much the same. But as of now, I'm stuck here until further notice.
I am the only one they let into the house because they suspect I won't say anything, but things need to change. If it was just them, I would be sick of trying to help them and would be long out of their lives by now, but my brother is involved and things need to change. The day I saw my brother putting a moldy pudding cup he found under the couch near his mouth is the day I said enough is enough.

If anyone has any advice on where I can go for help without them immediately losing the baby, please let me know. They just need help. They need a second chance to keep this house in shape. I just want to help them, I cannot do it alone, and neither can they.

Please, help us!",24Oct2019,2

823,"I write this with tears in my eyes because I fucked up again, so sorry that this is super inarticulate. I'm a 16 year old female who has been incredibly shy/quiet/introverted my entire life, but this past year its gotten really bad. Here are some examples:

\- I joined an academic team at my school last year and I went through the entire thing talking to no one except for the one person I know personally

\- I was denied a leadership position in my high school's marching band to a person younger then me because of what I suspect to be my shyness.

\- I joined the debate team last year and I froze up in a debate in front of the entire school.

\- Yesterday I had a debate tournament and I was too shy to actually go up and speak (Even though thats the entire fucking point I know) and I got called out for it and now im sad.

\- I haven't made a friend since freshman year and that wouldn't have happened if it werent for being introduced by the people around me. 

To make matters worse I am heavily involved in my community local-politics wise. I intern at a local state delegate's office, I canvassed with my dad during the 2018 midterms, and I'm in charge of a local branch of a national movement. At the state delegate's office I'm known to be super quiet and haven't really interacted much with the politician himself which is uh not fucking good, my dad did most of the talking during the canvassing, and I have only recently been put in charge of this stuff and frankly I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't know why I chose to do these interaction heavy duties, I just felt like I had a duty to do it (because I care a lot), so I did my best which isn't enough.

Now I feel like i'm disappointing people who expect me to be this great charismatic leader n shit. Ironically, I've actually given a few speeches that have gone shockingly well, but its hit or miss, and that just kills me.

It is the thing that is holding me back. I never talk in class and I never talk to anyone, and when I do its painfully awkward. I'm thankful that I have a good friend group, but they are here because I've accumalated them since preschool or I met them through a friend. I'm too awkward to actually go up to people, and if they come up to me, I don't have much to say and I don't give them much to work with, so I basically reject them without wanting to.

The worst part is that i'm unhappy on my own. I get lonely easily and I don't enjoy doing things on my own as much as I would with other people, but apparentally my brain is broken and I can't fucking talk to people.

I'm so worried about what I'm going to do after HS. I'm too awkward to approach people and I have trouble making human connections, and I've picked a human connection heavy field and I have college coming up, where I'll know little to no people.

Please help me. my confidence and self esteem is just so low and I don't know what to do.",24Oct2019,2
825,"I am 26f. Currently work full time customer service corporate job, live with my boyfriend, and go to school full time for corporate communications. I don’t want to really stay in corporate customer service but my managers have told me they chose me over everyone to offer mentorship to be a manager here one day. I told them I wanted that but I’m not really sure. I work in the auto industry and it’s not remotely my passion. My passion is cooking and health and fitness as well as personal growth, yoga, etc. I also don’t even know why I’m studying communications, I just wanted to finally finish my bachelors degree finally. I’ll be done next summer.

I recently lost 65 lbs with about 10 more to go, am left with stretch marks. I only have one friend who has been my friend for 11 years but lately I’m not sure if I should be friends with her, I mean not really but she made my boyfriend feel disrespected and also she is cheating on her boyfriend and said she has suicidal thoughts. I will be her friend but maybe I’m socially inept and shouldn’t be? My relationship with family members is all not very good. Mom is very mentally ill, uneducated, hard to deal with. Dad likes my stepsisters more than me it seems. Sister is just so judge mental I don’t feel I can be myself around her. This is the third time my boyfriend and I have dated and I’m not sure if we’re toxic or how we can become healthy. I feel insecure and jealous of his female friends, I have a particular lifestyle and he has adapted to me but feels he lost himself, but he never gives his opinion. Part of me sees a future, but I have like no friends who would even attend my wedding, I think he feels controlled by me and I don’t want him to, I don’t want to have kids with someone if I think we might divorce or something some day. But he really is a sweet guy but I can be so critical.

I am irritable and not very nice I feel. I’m so focused on calorie counting most days. I kinda want to pursue getting super into weight lifting and figure competitions and stuff like that but am not sure. When I get home after work I cook dinner and then really just want to sleep. I’m always tired. I don’t really have any hobbies I really like to do with my boyfriend. I feel bored.

831,"On Tuesday morning, on my way to work, I was on the freeway in the left lane. I was coming around a curve going about 70-75 when I saw a car at a dead stop in my lane. I slammed the breaks hoping I had enough time to stop, when I realized I didn't have enough time, I tried to swerved onto the shoulder to avoid the collision. After swerving, I saw the reason the other car had stopped. The guy before them lost control and hit the median and his car was partially blocking the left lane. In a split second decision I cut my wheel even further left slamming my car into the median and rebounding to the other side of the freeway on the right shoulder. Fast forward an hour and a half, there is a traffic jam which results in a 4 car pileup and one of the drivers didn't survive. While reading the news article later in the day I discovered the traffic jam was caused by an earlier accident that closed down the right lane. My accident. I have spent the last 48 hours dwelling on it and no matter what anyone else says, or how much I tell myself otherwise I can't shake the thought that it was my fault, or that I could have prevented this from happening if only I was going slower.

Quick backstory, I go to an all boys grammar school. I’m an introvert. I have a relatively small friend group (about 10 friends but only like 5 that are close). I have one girl friend(a friend who’s a girl) who goes to an all girls school, and we never really meet we just talk over Instagram. Pretty much all of my friends are introverts like me. I don’t play sports or go to any clubs. I don’t have the best body but I’m not overweight or anything, just sort of chubby. I’m like 5’10 or something. I spend most of my free time playing video games. My hygienes pretty good. Don’t really have any talents. I’m not smart. And I’ve never been in a relationship before but I feel like I’d be alright cause from what my girlfriend has told me, I’m really helpful with supporting her when she has a problem.

Speaking of that girl, I realised I had feeing for her but I knew she’d probably say no because she had told me like a week or 2 before hand that she had never felt like she loved with someone before. I told her how I felt and long story short, we’re still friends, good ones though but as I said, I was expecting that so I’m fine with it. She now has a boyfriend (I think). I say that because it doesn’t say on either of their Instagram accounts that that are, but a couple of days ago, the girl posted a video on her close friends story of them messing around with each other at like 1:00 am, and someone that goes to my school and I’m in a group chat with said that they are so... I feel obsessed about her though and I can’t get her out of my head.

I don’t really have anyone to talk to so I don’t know what to do.

I’m just wondering what I can do to get a girlfriend or what I can change that’ll help.

Do not even get me started on jobs, football players make millions for literally running around and kicking a ball, whereas the actual military who genuinely risk their lives on a daily basis make minimum 20k a year. It's fucking bullshit. Also, it's the same with youtubers; they make millions for literally talking in front of a screen. 
People have also got so fucking lazy and unhealthy. They sit around watching youtube all day doing fuck all, and then complain saying that they do not have time to do things. People also complain about the world being polluted or whatever, but then they do literally nothing about it except putting it on their Instagram story. WHAT THE FUCK WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH?! RAISE AWARENESS ONLY FOR EVERYONE TO DO FUCK ALL ABOUT IT?! There are also now apparently millions of vegans, oh don't even get me started on that bullshit. Veganism is pathetic. You are a human. You are a mammal. You are the dominant species that has pretty much conquered land. You are supposed to take pride when you tear apart that chicken.

835,"I’m a junior now studying CS. I hate my life so bad and yet I know I’m supposed to feel lucky I’m born in this position in life.

Here’s the deal. I know what I want to do with my life. It’s unconventional with a high failure rate but you know what, it’s what I want. I want it badly. I don’t want opinions. it’s basically running a business. I’ve always known I wanted to do my own thing but no one takes that seriously. I used to have a company in high school. I started working for myself at 14. No one gets it. No one gets the fucking clue. What do you think would make me happy? I know what would! You don’t want to work for someone else? No no no, you must be depressed. I started this new thing a year ago, and I’m getting better at it everyday and I will make it support me one day. I have to. Most people already failed this business.

What’s the point of finishing school? It’s absolutely killing me. I would stick it out if I could, but I don’t know if I can complete it. It’s so hard and it’s not what I want anyway. Why do it? Should I just grit my teeth?
Whether I’m making 25k a year (can you live on that? Can I get a job that pays that without a degree?), or 60k a year, living in a 400 apartment or 1000 apartment I’ll still be miserable. Because either way I’ll spend my days not doing what I want. Until I make what I want to make work. And well if I don’t make it work in the next 5-10 years I’ll just donate whatever I have away and kill myself.

I really don’t know if I’m depressed or not. I don’t think. I’m happy when stress goes away of shit I don’t care about and I can just work on what I want. How to do that in this world? Being on the streets not having the resources to pursue what I want CERTAINLY wouldn’t make me happy either.",24Oct2019,1
836,"hi, i’m at a loss so any advice would be appreciated greatly.

so the situation: i work in retail and my work offers an order pick-up system where you just make an order online and within hours it will be ready for you to pick up at the store at guest services. i did this as a way to acquire plan b as there would be no time for me to get some at planned parenthood. my manager was the one who signed the order off to me at guest services (as we have to show photo i.d. proof that we are the receiving party of the order). i should note i did this all while off the clock.

however, come to find out that it has got out about what i ordered in the workplace. i spoke to a few other managers and they confirmed the only person besides me who would have known of my order to possibly share would have to had been the one that gave me my order at guest services that day. i should note that i left out certain details, such as what i ordered and the manager involved while speaking to them.

i know i should speak to HR about this, but i’m just conflicted and very nonconfrontational. i’m also scared that nothing will come from this and my manager who violated my privacy will cut my hours if he were to find out i complained about this, as he is the one in charge of scheduling. however, i just feel so uncomfortable and hurt that he would share my order which is suppose to be private with other co-workers at the work place. people are starting to talk behind my back and have even asked people that i’m close to at work if i am pregnant! i mean, this should be against some kind of rule or privacy thing, right?

837,"Hello. So I'm a full-time college student still living with my mom bc it's close to the school and there's no real reason for me to move out until I'm financially stable besides the fact that I can't stand my older sister. She is so irresponsible and entitled, it actually saddens me. She moved back in with us a few years ago after being kicked out of a relative's house for not respecting their rules, staying up late and playing music at 2/3am. It was driving them nuts so they kicked her out for that and various other reasons. She also was blowing her money and didn't really care to finish school. So she came to us and didn't work for the first 2 years, AT ALL. She didn't contribute at all. Not with money, not with chores, not with food, nothing. So entitled. The only reason she got around in her car is because she was still getting financial aid money. Any time my mother brought up a job, she would flip out on her. It was  very easy for my sister to take advantage of my mom, who's a more submissive kind of person. 

The only reason she did eventually give in and get a job is because I finally said something, and I was still only a teenager in high school at the time. Idk, I was so angry and upset at the whole situation and I came across aggressive enough so she listened. Someone was finally calling her out on her bullshit. She started contributing like a hundred or so a month while my mom was struggling to pay the rent. 

Lately though my sister has been a wack job. She feels so entitled to yell at my mom for simple things. The other night she was yelling at my mom for an hour straight (I wasn't there) over an article of clothing that mom donated that used to be hers, even though she gave it to her. She woke up my mom up late at night just to harass her about this. It got to the point where my mom had to even sleep in her car for a bit to get any rest. She went back inside after my sister decided to calm down and shut up. But this situation is just evidence of how much my mom lets my sister get away with. She can scream and yell and act like a big baby and get away with it. And I'm SICK of having to deal with her. I hate being around her. She feels no responsibility towards anyone, not even herself and her own life. She does not really care to develop a real and stable relationship with her siblings who she hadn't seen for years prior to moving in with us. 

My mom found a cheaper place because she was struggling to pay our current rent for a long time. I would help but I'm a full-time student studying hard sciences for medical school and I'm planning to provide for my family in the future, I just can't risk my education right now. And you know what my sister tells my mom? She told her that I should *also* be helping out and that my mom makes too many excuses for ME. ME? She's not going to school, she has no job, no plans and I'M the one my mom is making excuses for? 

She says illogical shit like this all the time while simultaneously making excuses for why she can't get ahead in life. She is a dysfunctional person and I can't move in with her, and idk why my mom is allowing this. My sister isn't sure if she wants to move in with us because it's a much smaller space, but if she does, i don't know how much longer I can cope with this. It's gotten a lot worse lately and it's distracting me from the things that I need to focus on. I hate this.

Thing is, when we were at the conference, she mentioned that she liked a certain kind of sweets, that don't exist in the country she's living in now, but only in her homecountry and the countrys next to it (coincidentally, where I live). I thought, it might be nice to send her a package with some of it and maybe another little thing for christmas. 

I'm not sure whether it would be awkward to just send her a present half around the world. Other problem is, I don't have her personal adress, and I cannot ask for it without being suspicious, taking away the surprise, so I could only send it to the lab she's studying at, which would be even more awkward.

843,"Hello I am a 17 year old girl from Kansas. As I am 17 and a senior in High school I have been planning for college. The problem is that I have a 2.5 Average gpa and a 22 act score.          
I am very very average. But I want to go to Pittsburg State University, which is rough 3 hours away from me.     
I have applied for PSU about a month ago, but they never really looked at it because I have been waiting for my fee waiver to be sent off with my transcript.      
I have talked to my admissions rep and she like “Oh you’re missing a math credit! You also never took chemistry!”      
Now I knew that I need 4 math credits for a kansas state college but I didn’t know about the chem credit. But all in all I was looking to graduate on time.      
So I planned on talking to my counselor to help me switch one of my classes next semester so I can take a online class for the math credit.      
I did that.        
She pretty much told me “You been having a rough few years... I will not do that.”         
Mmmmm. Great.      
I cried and left.      
She apparently called my mom about this.       
I went home and my parents gave me the “I rather you go to a school thats lets you stay home. Maybe a online school or something.”       
Something something stress levels something something anxiety.        
Now til this happened, I been having a great year so far so I thought I could do it.        
But pretty much everyone but my one other friend(f18-19) has pretty much told me to not waste my time.      
But my friend is also pretty average in terms of grades and such and got into PSU and wants to help me also get to PSU. Also she is a year older than me so she is already in college.     
We’re pretty alike tbh.         
But since it seems like everyone didn’t want me to, I canceled my application.      
I told my friend today and she said she would even pay the fee to reapply because she thinks I can really get in.         
Should I reapply?? Or not waste my time??
I really want to go but my support system is not helping.        
          
TLDR: No one but my friend believe my very average self can get into the school I want so I canceled my application. Should I try again?",24Oct2019,2

845,"Title is pretty self explanatory. I’m an 18 year old woman in my first year of university (I live at home as not many people in Ireland actually live on campus unless they live out in the country). Ever since coming of age I feel as though my parents are struggling to come to terms with my independence and my personal rules.
My parents are extremely strict when it comes to the WEIRDEST reasons, such as ordering food and throwing it into the trash outside as, according to my mom, a means of ‘hiding it’. 
I was met with a very interesting situation once I got home today to find my dad on my laptop shuffling through my gmail. He apparently found PayPal receipts of me ordering food to the house and was very unhappy with this fact. 
I have my own income, and if I want a burger I’ll order a burger. It seems like such a stupid reason to be writing this post, but my parents attitude towards me doing NORMAL shit like ordering food is insane. Not only that, but my mom especially loves digging into me about my weight. I am not overweight by any means, just curvy with a little bit of a stomach. Overall I’m slim enough with a sharp face. To my near perfect mom though, I found out that I am unlovable by men and if I continue looking as I do now I have no hope of getting with my current love interest. 
It is worth noting that me and my parents are quite close. I tell my mom about anyone I’ve met in uni, gone on a date with etc. I expose my more vulnerable relationship side to her when necessary to get some of her advice. It seems as though today she decided to speak her mind about certain matters in a harsh way that genuinely hurts my feelings. I trusted her with possibly embarrassing situations that happened to me with a certain person recently and instead of her, what appears to me now, fake support I got backlash for...ordering food to the house?
I don’t understand how much stricter it can get than getting in shit for something as plain as this. As a child, I was never caught doing anything horrible (or, better yet, never even did anything bad??) however my parents have it engraved in their mind that from a young age I am a liar. These speculations come from small hiccups of honesty that I had as a kid concerning trivial things (which honestly I can’t even recall now as I type this in a somewhat blind rage). It annoys me how my trust is tainted by my past when I was a CHILD. I know I have not swallowed all the encyclopedias of the world and that their experience in life is much greater than mind however due to this I would expect a bit more tact towards their only child?

Overall, I am very upset with the distrust between me and my parents. My dad jumps at every opportunity to expose me for trivial things as he’s a nosy cunt and my mom thrives off of the pursuit of making me miserable. I know they love me and want the best for me but knowing that I am legally an adult they cannot be punishing me by taking away my laptop (I giggled at that) or monitoring my expenditure when I work my ass off for my own income. I feel trapped in an endless loop of a feeling of guilt whenever I do something as wrong as accidentally put a dirty cup from the dishwasher onto a clean shelf. I’m sick and tired of constantly being under their thumb.
I respect my parents but I am growing tired of the near emotional abuse I am experiencing on a day to day basis. I would like to once again highlight that I do understand that this may be a means of them trying to help me in life but...what help does spiking my anxiety levels and providing me with limitations a 14 year old should get?  

So, redditors, please enlighten me on how to tackle my current situation. How do I confront them? My mom is super overprotective and my dad thinks im like Fiona in the tower from Shrek (yet in constant ogre form according to my mom). I would like to apologize for the messiness of the entirety of this personal essay however I could honestly care less at this point when my family life is crumbling.",24Oct2019,1

He has some European-ish features (think Siberian), whereas his father looks completely Mongol/East-Asian. Although he did have green eyes.

For the census I have always check-marked Asian, considering my background and how TR(mostly)/AF/KZ are all in Asia. I’ve been confused since I was small, on whether to list Asian/European/or other. What do you think?

I look Latin &amp; European/White-passing. I am light-skinned with a neutral undertone, dark brown hair that looks almost black and brown eyes. People are always surprised when I tell them that I’m Asian. Some don’t even believe me and go, “No way. You’re white!” or “You’re not Latina?"" They question the validity. 

These are my DNA results:

\[48% Turkey &amp; the Caucasus\]—— \[26% Central &amp; Northern Asia\]—— \[13% Southern Asia\]—— \[8% Iran/Persia\]—— \[1% Japan\]—— \[1% Greece &amp; the Balkans\]—— \[1% Balochistan\]—— \[1% Baltic States\]—— \[1% Eastern Europe &amp; Russia\]——

Would I be considered biracial by American standards? Hapa? Or? I believe the census does consider Turkish European.

860,"The title might be a little misleading. I don't really have trouble meeting new people. I talk to them and get to know them pretty easily. The problem is, I don't know how to make it happen more with the same people.

Whenever I visit my little hometown on break from school, I see all kinds of people who I used to go to school with and who I still get along really well with, and who I wish I could talk to more often. I also think they really enjoy my company (which is saying a lot, because I'm pretty self-conscious about that kind of thing). However, it's only ever in passing. They're basically people I talk to if I'm waiting in a line or whatnot. We never hang out just for the sake of hanging out, and we are completely out of contact with each other, but they've been pretty clear that they've missed me, and I only see them a couple times per year. They're fun people though, and I wish I could talk to them more often.

Basically, what I want to know is, how do I get to trading-phone-number terms with people. I'm horrible about this, and not just with new people. I have really good friends who I have literally no way to contact outside of seeing them around campus or showing up on their doorstep. If they moved, I'd never hear from them again. This example is more of a laziness thing, but it speaks to the fact that I still have virtually no experience with trading phone numbers.

It feels like it's not supposed to be a big deal, but the pragmatic side of me always pictures their thought process going like: ""He's giving me his contact info because he wants me to contact him, and I wonder what for,"" and then when I or they call or text and have no particular reason for contacting them, things fall apart awkwardly because I have nothing to say, and they wonder why I went through the effort to get ahold of them for nothing.

Also, another reason it probably feels like a bigger deal than it is: None of them have ever asked to trade phone numbers.  Of all the nice conversations I've had, none of them have ever tried to keep in touch. Given the situation, it's not surprising, since I'm not known for being very gregarious, and I'm the one who abandoned them for school to begin with. However, it still makes me feel wary of them actually enjoying my company, despite bountiful evidence to the contrary (Trust me, most of them like me. I would be the first person to start doubting that.).

I did give my contact info to one of these people before, but it was for a very specific reason, and we stopped talking not long after that because something very embarrassing happened through text, and neither of us wanted to address it ever again.

868,"So I live on the 4th floor of my apartment complex and I can just about see or hear anything that happens in the courtyard (my windows face the courtyard where people walk their dogs and what not). This afternoon I heard what sounded like two dogs fighting so I got up and looked outside to see what the hell was going on. I saw a guy with two leashed Chihuahuas and he was holding them back from each other. I guess the dogs were fighting and biting at each other from the noises. So he decided it would be a good idea to hold the dogs up in the air by their leashes, this was basically choking the dogs. Then he puts them back down and slaps them across the face HARD and tries to kick one of them as he walks back into the building. 

I am pretty sure this guy lives below me as I've seen him and his two roommates (two girls) in passing. I think that the dogs belong to one of the girls or something because clearly this jackass is not a dog person. As I was wondering if that really was the same guy I heard the bedroom door in the apartment below me slam shut and then heard dogs scratching at the door. I have heard this scratching noise before but never really thought that it was those dogs. We have a pigeon problem so I just assumed it was pigeons dicking around on the roof above me. Anyways I am fairly certain that these dogs and this guy live below me but I am not sure what to do. I also think that he's locking these dogs in a bedroom all day until someone else comes home which in my opinion is pretty messed up. The units we live in are pretty big 2 bedroom units so it's sad that the dogs are stuck in a tiny room all day.

874,"Background: I am a somewhat pot head and a dedicated JROTC cadet

(For those of you who dont know JROTC is a 
 Military based class that you can take in high school in America possibly other countries but im not sure)

And i am planning to join the military once i graduate highschool. 

So last year i started smoking pot with my friends. One day one of the two friends im hanging out with pulls out a small plastic bag with two very small gummy bear looking things and he tells me that its acid.
I knew what it was because a few months before, my friends all told me they were tripping for my friends birthday. But ive never been around someone when they were tripping. So they take it and im baked out of my mind because i had just started smoking. And a few hours later they start telling me that they're seeing things move and stuff like that and it sounds pretty crazy to me at that point. A few months go by and ive built up my weed tolerance. 4-20 is coming around and my friends ask me if i want to trip with them. I say let me look into what exactly the drug is and if i should be taking it my freshman year of high school. Eventually after some simple research i decide to take it. We have a fun night and after that i did it 4 times after that. I quit it because i decide that im not going down the right path for my military plans. I continue to smoke and eventually quit that for a month. 

Current day: im half way through the first quarter of my sophomore year in highschool doing well in jrotc and started to work out a little. Ive hung out and smoked pot a few times and my same friends tell me that their tripping this Halloween and me being high asf agreed to do it. My problem is that im worried about becoming a further pothead and possibly addicted to acid and abandoning all hopes of joining the military. But it really seems like fun and i wont have a bad experience and if i only do once i should be fine and not become addicted.

Im sorry that this was so long but i figured youd need a good backstory to give me valid advice. What are your thoughts?",24Oct2019,1
875,"I know, this is probably a very commonly asked question; this is something a lot of people struggle with. I've heard a lot of people's opinions and suggestions but nothing has worked. Nothing. In three months, it'll have been four years since we started dating. For the life of me I cannot let her go.

We started dating when I was pretty young, I was a child mentally. I wouldn't say I was unprepared for a relationship, I was just immature and handled certain situations regrettably. But ultimately we were happy together. She was happy with me and I was happy with her. I won't get into why we broke up because its very specific and I don't wanna run any risks. But I will explain some back story:

We dated for about 6/7 months (which is a very short time, I know). She was my first love, and she is the most beautiful girl in the world. I would've done anything for her because the love i felt for her was more intense than any other I've ever felt before. And there has been others. I've dated about five girls since, maybe six, and I have loved them, but not nearly as much. The feeling isn't even comparable. To give some clarity to how intensely i felt about her, I have several mental health issues and I've been seeing psychologists and psychiatrists since I was about six years old. I have verifiable evidence from my doctors that she literally made a number of these issues go away. I've had brainscans done more times than I can count and the doctors noticed a huge difference in the time I was with her. It was almost as if most of them went away just from her being around. My levels were reading good and brain activity was close to normal for once. She was my whole world. Everything I've done since I've been with her is for her, directly or not. Doing her favors every couple months (still), and trying to impress her by getting somewhere good in life. I know its a terrible mindset and I'm really, really trying to break it.

Every couple months for the past three years, I text her and then we end up talking non stop for 12-15 hours. Sometimes I see her and we hangout and I can feel myself return to that weird normal feeling in my brain. But when we text its always so nice, shes supportive and we catch up and tell each other interesting things. Sometimes give each other advice about stuff.

At the beginning of 2018, she was asking my best friend about me. About how i'm doing and stuff like that. Obviously he told me. Then we started talking pretty consistently for a while. I think in april I told her i missed her. I sent her a pretty lengthy couple of paragraphs and she reciprocated that feeling. I forget exactly what she said but it was somehting about how she wanted to reconcile what we had and stick to it but she needs to be in a better place. She told me about how I was the best boyfriend shed ever had (which suprised me because I was not her first love) and that shed never had anything as healthy as what she had with me. She wanted it to last because I made her happy, but she needed to get her shit together. Obviously I wouldn't be making this post if it worked out. I gave her time and distance and we both found others.

I just watch her get into relationships and see them fall apart and I know she does the same. I ruined my second relationship because I couldn't get her out of my head. I ruined my third relationship because the only one I wanted to be around was her. And I let the same thing happen for the rest. I am currently dating another girl and she is wonderful and she makes me feel very happy and shes very loving and affectionate. I love her very much. At this point I've come to realize that my ex will never ever know what she wants, pursuit is useless. So I just wanna let her go because I want to make this relationship last. I'm very happy where I am, I want to stop thinking about her because it's driving me crazy and it's stressing me out. I can't take it. 

But do I actually want to let go? Will I be rewarded for more patience? I want her back in my arms so bad sometimes. It kills me to see her so unhappy with these guys.

I'll explain more if I'm asked. I just don't know what to do. Thank you.",24Oct2019,2
876,"I have technical and social problems on Reddit. Am I doing something wrong, or is Reddit not suited for this behavior?

# Intro

I'm an older user who's passionate about privacy and security. I am not very social. I come from the days of hyperlinks, Yahoo, and sorry for the curse word Digg. A few days ago posts popped up stating Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers got hacked. I'm a NordVPN customer, since they also got hacked I instantly investigated the matter thoroughly. I was surprised to find how unethical NordVPN worded their response on the hack.

# The Baddies

NordVPN was cunning enough to never blatantly lie, but they withheld important information thus made the hack's impact much less serious then it really is. In other words they appealed to less informed customers and investors. Normally I wouldn't be surprised about this type of behavior as most successful companies behave this way. The distinction is that NordVPN provides digital security and works on a trust basis. Similar to a safety deposit system at a bank. The bank won't give you the blueprints to everything in order to prove to you that it's secure. Instead you rely on what others say about the bank and look at the way they operate. Based on that you make conclusions and decide to trust or not. Without that confidence the business model does not work.

# Social Issue

The social issue I have was most of the comments on Reddit does not represent the truth (or potentially my truth). I found that most subreddits that covered the topic had extremely short replies voted to the top. I understand people don't want to spend a lot of time to read or reply, but I'm confused how complex technical conclusions can be made so quickly.

# Technical Issue I

I tried to reply in a short manner in the NordVPN subreddit. After commenting I found it had a karma limit. The comment was automatically deleted. I tried to reach out to the moderator 2 days ago, but have not gotten a response yet, but I was not ready to give up yet!

# Technical Issue II

This time I decided to comment in the technology subreddit. I spent a lot of time to write in detail with references to my statements. I used \~1,400 words and 8,800 characters in my response, but was not able to submit. Sometimes I would get an error stating ""10 000 limit"" and other times it would not say anything or do anything after clicking ""comment button"". I deleted some parts got it down to \~1270 words and \~7640 characters, but it still did not want to work. I tried switching to markdown editor and then it worked, only to notice that the post was automatically deleted again! I would like to link the post here, not sure if it was links that cause my post to be deleted. I would like to link it for someone to go over it, but I don't want to risk it yet.

Thanks for your time! My questions are sorted by importance, you certainly don't have to answer all of them.

1. Do you think Reddit is not the best place to discuss technical matters in detail?
2. Is this social problem common on (large) subreddits?
3. Has anyone had similar technical problems with commenting (both message and karma limits)?
4. Is it better to wait for someone who's opinion is valued by the community to cover this topic, or is getting attention while it's hot more valuable?

She is naturally a very reserved, somewhat cynical person, but last year around this time I noticed that she was a bit standoffish and hot-headed with me and a few of our other friends. Her mood swings went on and off her a few months and all of us were concerned about her but never said anything about it to her face. It eventually passed.  Flash forward to this year and the same thing is starting to happen again except this time, she has started cracking deprecating jokes about drinking alcohol and mentioned that she is having regularly occurring panic attacks. Once again, my friends and I are all concerned about her but the most worrisome thing happened today when she asked me in passing if I had noticed that she has been acting differently lately. I told her that she had been distant. She agreed, and then told me that she doesn't know why she's acting this way. Then mentioned that she thinks that something is emotionally wrong and she had been having depressive episodes recently. That was the end of that conversation as we didn't have time to talk any longer.

880,"So I need advice, I (18F) have recently started dating someone (18M) and I feel really good about it. Things between us are great and especially considering that we’re still so new. 

I have grown up in a very mentally and emotionally abusive household, I’m fairly sure my mother has some form of munchausen by proxy. I have very little privacy and I feel trapped. I’m currently gathering the finances to move out but until then I’m stuck here. I have no family to turn to and I don’t want to be kicked out again. In July I was kicked out because I had asked to go to six flags with my at the time boyfriend. I have an annual pass and so does he, I would be taking the Metrolink with him so I wouldn’t even need to borrow the car, I was just asking because I need to ask about everything. I was told how ungrateful of a child I am and how horrible I am and that I treat my mother with no respect. She ended up kicking me out of the house at 10 at night and my dad picked me up the next morning. This is just one example of how randomly she can blow up. 

But anyway, I want very badly to go out with my new boyfriend and to not have to sneak around. Sneaking around is virtually impossible because she tracks my phone, and has a ring security system. She is disabled and stays at home all day with nothing to do, so she controls my life and my privacy. Since I was a child I was afraid to express myself sexually in any way, for example masturbation. She had basically punished me whenever I seemed curious about anything and told me how wrong and disgusting it was and how I would be disgusting. It kept me from expressing myself until I was 17. I’ve recently identified as bi and have no intention of telling them unless I have to. I have no way of really avoiding telling them if I want to be with him at all. So far he’s just brought me food at work and tried to do whatever he can to see me without it being suspicious to my mom. 

Another reason I don’t want to tell them is because he’s Mexican. My parents are white and as much as they deny it they are racist. My ex boyfriend is Arab and looks fairly white. They liked him for about two months until I mentioned that he was Iraqi. It doesn’t matter that he’s born here, both his parents are here legally, both his parents work and are good people, and it didn’t matter that he was a good person. They began to treat him like shit and treat me like shit for being with him. I was told that he would “sell me into sex slavery” and that “Muslim men control their women”. Muslim isn’t a race it’s a religion, and the only religion in his family is that his mom was raised catholic. My point it they’re unnecessarily racist and that’s what created such a ridge between him and I and most of what led to our breakup. I worry that they will do the same thing to my new boyfriend and I don’t want to allow that to happen to him. Unfortunately I see no way of being able to see him and have fun on dates without telling them. Until I pay for my own phone and phone plan they can track my phone, and while I live under their roof they can technically have whatever rules they wish. Even though I’m 18 I have nowhere else to go at the moment. I’m getting there, but not quite yet.

887,"So this may come off as me being a p**y but I started a job two weeks ago doing delivery driving for a business(not food) and best way for me to put it; I hate it. I’m only 18 so if I were to quit it wouldn’t cause any hardship to me but I feel awful. I have rank anxiety and this job makes it go through the roof, I live in a city where most people can’t drive and full of people tweaked out as there’s a meth epidemic here. I constantly deal with people flipping me off cutting me off when I’m not even doing anything wrong, trying to drive the best and as safe as I can. 

Today I had a guy on a bike going down a busy road with two lanes, no shoulder or anything you basically ride the curb and I was making a turn into a parking lot, the biker was beside me so I stopped and intended to let him cross before I turned but instead he somehow falls off of his bike and what it looked like to me as I was watching thru the mirror, basically kicked back and fell on his back in the grass and started screaming at me even though I never touched him with the vehicle whatsoever and starts loosing his mind on me. 

After work today I just broke down, I can’t handle the stress and everything else that comes with this job, I am always on a tight schedule and basically feel rushed all day to get everything delivered and out of the 10 days I have worked here so far I’d say 7-8 of them have been terrible. However me being a people pleaser I just smile and act like I enjoy the job. The job isn’t hard other then walking basically 6-7 miles a day. But now I feel terrible because I honestly don’t even want todo another week of this job but I know that if/when I quit I will get likely ridiculed by the other employees which will just make my mental issues worse off. I’m stuck I just don’t know what todo. I could give two weeks notice but then the following two weeks will be full of comments and whatever else as the people who work at the business have to say, they are all boomers so they won’t take it very lightly I’m sure. Or I can quit tomorrow and not even go back again which would make me feel terrible. What should I do?",24Oct2019,0

891,"Hey folks,

Been working at a new place for about 18 months now. My boss is nice and we get along well, but he's incredibly busy and I rarely see him.

My position is new and somewhat more mobile than my co-workers. We have one main site and a satellite office, and I helped hire one person to work at the satellite office, who I now supervise. I also supervise an employee at the main site.

During my first review, around the same time as I was helping hire the satellite office person, I suggested that I spend one day a week at the satellite office - I was responsible for an employee there, after all. He agreed and we put that down in my review as something to complete every week.

Since my job is more mobile, on days when I had a bad cold or cough, I would ask for and work from home. The first time I did this, my boss emailed me to thank me for my dedication. I took that as permission to keep doing it, so I stayed home and worked every once in a while when I needed, in an attempt to keep my germs to myself.

Things were going fine until about three months ago, when I made the same mistake twice in two weeks. While they weren't major, they were boneheaded. I apologized and owned up to them.

Boss pulls me into the office to discuss, tells me this ""won't be an easy conversation"" and we start talking about my two mistakes. I offer a way to prevent them in the future and he agrees to my suggestion.

Then he tells me that there are other things to talk about, and I'm confused, but ok. Apparently, others in the main office are upset that I'm working from home on occasion when I'm sick, and that I've done this as much as some of the others have called in sick. He then also tells me that some have complained that I'm 'picking and choosing' which office to work in when I work one day a week at the satellite office. He tells me that some of my co-workers don't trust my judgement and think when I'm not there, I'm not working.

I am stunned. So stunned I don't know what to say and my brain short-circuits. I have never had this impression from anyone, except for one co-worker I'll call Becky.

Becky has been there for a long time and she is very smart and very good at her job. Despite this, she is also insecure and instead of using her brains to mentor people, she uses them to destroy people she sees as competition. When I got this job, others in the industry warned me about her.

The phrase 'picking and choosing' is something she says often, so I know that this ""lost the room"" impression is coming straight from Becky.

Boss tells me to only go to the satellite office when I really need to, and to no longer work from home when I'm sick. ""Take a sick day if you need a sick day."" I'm shocked and don't know what to say, so I agree.

Fine. I haven't been back to the satellite office since then, and I now bring my germs into the office. 

We had several crazy weeks and I worked a couple of weekends in a row. I went in to work Tuesday after a 12-hour shift the day before and I'm not feeling well, but I chalk that up to being tired.

Wednesday I get a migraine, the worst one I've had in years. I call in sick and eventually take my meds for it, which I don't like to do because it leaves me feeling like I have the flu. The pain, however, is so bad I take it. 

I spend the night in the bathroom and I called in sick today. I need sleep and I know I'll be fine tomorrow.

Because I've missed two days in a row, Boss now wants a doctor's note. This is NOT standard procedure. Fine. I go to the walk in clinic and sit for a few hours with a bunch of sick people for a doctor with no knowledge of my medical history to give me a piece of paper that I have to pay for.

I am pretty furious at this point. I've done everything he's asked. The mistakes I made have not re-occurred, and there is nothing to fault me on. The numbers for my job are way up, and I've had praise from several co-workers.

I will bring in my note tomorrow. But I'd like some advice on how to talk to him about this. The privileges that he agreed were necessary are still off my plate, and while I can go to the union about the sick note thing - and I will if I have to - I'd like to avoid that. 

Any phrasing language you can give me can would be really helpful, because right now I want to storm in there and yell, which is not helpful, obviously.",24Oct2019,2

Shes friends with this really gross guy at our school (17 m). I call him gross because even though she has told him shes not interested in guys and especially not him, hes constantly trying to kiss her and touch her and ask for hugs while shes in class. Shes a really smart girl and she knows hes doing something wrong but she doesnt try to stop him aside from saying no and laughing every once and a while. She says that she doesnt want to ditch him because once she says shes going to be there for someone she doesnt want to leave them. (I dont get that at all). Hes also known for doing these things with other girls. One of my guy friends told me a while ago that the guy tried to get with his ex gf while they were dating. He also manipulates my girlfriend. If she doesnt see one of his texts asking for a hug and shes already left school, he'll say ""whatever. I dont care."" If she doesnt pay enough attention to him he'll say that she doesnt care about him. I think hes disgusting, like I said shes told him multiple times that she doesnt like him like that and she never will, but when they're alone he'll try to touch her legs and kiss her. He does this in front of me too. I have no idea what to do, I want to tell him hes a piece of shit and that hes gross, but my girlfriend still cares about him no matter what he does. Hes also older than both of us, so I'm kind of scared of him too. Any advice would be appreciated, I feel like shit over this.

It took me a hell lot of guts to step out of that household at the age of 18 and move to a different city. Every day has been a new challenge for me. Mentally, I kept denying that I'm depressed. If I had admitted that to myself, I would've actually believed it and felt depressed, which would've led to suicidal thoughts, and maybe even death. My parents have forced me into a field I'm not at all interested in. Meanwhile I'm extremely passionate about a lot of things, from art to cooking to science to psychology, you name it.

900,"Hi friends, a few years ago i was depressed &amp; suicidal. My older brother is my best friend and he is one of the people i decided to keep living for. Im doing a lot better now, and others tend to rely on me more for emotional support. Over the last year, my bros mental health has gradually dissolved to the point that I am genuinely worried for him. He already has a therapist, but he leans on me for encouragement too. When I was struggling the most, I hid my feelings and ended up sorting myself out without much help, so when I try to reflect on my own experiences, I can't draw on any particular example of a supporting person. I don't know how to help him - I'm overwhelmed and terrified of making things worse because I know how sensitive I was when I felt like he does now.

 I live far away from him and we can only talk over the phone, so I can really only give him my words of support.

Here's the thing: she has already told me she loves me only as a friend, and she's got a crush on her classmate. Not to mention, her life is happy and various, while mine is boring and monotonous. There's no reason to fall in love with me.

906,"My mom died of a stroke yesterday, which means I'm now guardian-less and have to find somewhere to stay. The problem is that all of the people that I can think of staying with suck in their own way. 

I'm currently staying at one of my aunt's because she lives right next door. Living with her probably wouldn't be that bad. The only negatives with living with her is that she's very loud and that her apartment only has 2 rooms (the other is taken by my older cousin), which means I have to sleep in the living room with my grandma. Speaking of which...

My grandma wants to move out of my aunt's so that she and I can live together, but she really doesn't have a concept of privacy and she worries way too much for her own good (ex: she worries that if I don't eat or drink something every 4 hours or if I don't wear a jacket if it's under 70 degrees. I know that's just her way of caring, but it gets very annoying very quickly). She's also a neat-freak, which causes her to make her and those around her to add 5 extra steps to a 2 step task (ex: instead of having one bed set, my grandma has two. One for decoration and one for actually sleeping in). Also, she has too many people stopping by to see her; many of which I don't know, and that makes me uncomfortable.

I would rather chop off my own foot than live with my dad. 

Finally, there's my other aunt that lives 5 hours away (her living 5 hours away is already off-putting). The only reasons why I want to live with her are that my mom said if anything happens to her, she'd want my aunt to be my guardian and because I fee the closest to her out of everyone else on this post. Everything else about her household is very chaotic. My uncle really doesn't care about anything except food and I'm pretty sure he's cheating on my aunt, and my younger cousin is very undisciplined. I know that my aunt is going to make me babysit her and I don't want to be stuck babysitting a kid who's known for jumping on coaches, climbing on tables, and throwing tablets.

My ideal living situation is for me to live by myself in a small house/apartment that's close to some stores I can walk to and from, but I highly doubt that's possible since I'm 14. 

Please don't hesitate to tell me that this post isn't the type of advice that sub was made for.

My sister who is 16 and my mom have been arguing for over two hours now regarding a chore she didn’t get done.


My sister started being verbally disrespectful so my mom, as punishment, said she’s not taking my sister anywhere this weekend, one of those places being the DMV for her driving test.

My sister then, not wanting it to be cancelled tried to take my moms phone out of my moms hand and ended up on the ground trying to get the phone from each other.

I stepped in and got the phone and gave it back to my mom while keeping my sister pinned till she cooled off. I got off of her and she then went searching through my moms room for my sisters phone which my mom had just hid from her for punishment.


She found it and ran into her room.. and 10 minutes later they were yelling again - She then pushed my mom and I had to tackle her in a sense and hold her down till I felt she was done.

I was reached out to a few days later by a friend of a friend(19M) who was also at the party, telling me he and I hooked up and asking me if I had any STDs.

I was bewildered, I didn’t know that anything had happened between us. I told him no. But I was very unsure of how to feel.

I have a girlfriend, and am afraid that if she finds out she’ll leave me. But I also know I didn’t want this, and absolutely could not consent (my other friends remember me drinking at least 20 shots of Whiskey before I left the room and went back to mine.)

I feel like I was taken advantage of but I don’t know what to do, he says he was drunk as well, but I only remember him having 2 or 3 shots.

I’m just lost, and any help would be appreciated.",24Oct2019,1

914,After my divorce I struggled with getting my life back together and downspiraled into poverty. I JUST got visitation rights and this upcoming Saturday I would like to go with my son to the local hobby shop and have him pick something out. I barely make ends meet and I don't have any other ways of having extra income. Would anyone want to help me make my dream a reality and paypal me something to the tune of fifteen bucks so I can get him something?,24Oct2019,0
