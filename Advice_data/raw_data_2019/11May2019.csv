1,"I’m a 16 year old male, approaching on 17 and am in my junior year of high school. The class that I share with this classmate has students of multiple years, she is a senior and will graduate.

3,"So this is a really late night post. Basically I just found out my brother didn’t go on the trip he said he would. I just found him in his room just playing a game or something. I know my mom believed him, but I didn’t. So I went to check if he was really on his trip. I so desperately hoped he was, but there he was in his room. I told my mom about it because I couldn’t sleep. I think he thinks I betrayed him. I’m so worried about him.. what do I do? I’m so afraid he’s gonna do something. What can I even believe from him still? Did he even go to a therapist or did he lie about that as well? I don’t know anymore. I’m freaking out like crazy please someone help me.",11May2019,1

5,"It's treatable and common thank God, but still... Not what I want... Had a surgical procedure days ago and needed a swab beforehand, got the call today that I tested positive for it. So I guess I've been asymptomatic for awhile, he's the only person I've been with sexually within the past year /following my last routine checkup. The nurse on the phone said I had to let him know as he will need to be treated for it also. I don't really know how to go about telling him this? And feel uncomfortable doing so, but I guess it would be wrong of me to not contact him... In case he goes on to infect someone else or something I don't know. I just don't need to deal with this right now really, I'm obviously going to get the antibiotics for myself and everything. But I am still recovering from a surgery, and if I contact him I'm afraid of the stress it'll bring on me.

Any advice on what I should do?",11May2019,1
6,"Ok so I got a random friend request on Facebook. He seems to have mutual friends with me with people from my high school. He message me asking if I wanna ""chase the bag"" I told him ""Sure?"" So he told me basically he buys Postal Money Orders from his ""Plug"" and deposits it in the other person's bank account and he gets 40% the other person gets the rest. He has sent me multiple photos of the money, money orders, people he has done this with to. I haven't done anything yet but I'm just so curious. I was planning on asking him if he would go with me to the postal office to verify the money orders to. If he refuses than it's a red flag.",11May2019,1
7,"I have a 5yo going into kindergarten next fall. I’m currently a server and make decent money part time, but I just interviewed for a full time leasing agent position at a luxury apartment community. A friend could get me in. There is potential for promotion and actually having weekends one day, but that would take time. Great company and benefits and a new career door opened. 

But I’m worried if I take the job my family would have almost no time together, both immediate and extended, as weekends are the typical get together time for everyone. If I stay in my current job I can have more flexibility but no benefits, however I am also an artist and designer with a good amount of freelance experience and want to work towards making more money from those avenues. And, there are always other office jobs available - maybe at a design agency? 

I’m so torn because the opportunity is right there for me to take, it would better me financially and create security for our future, but I don’t want to sacrifice valuable time during my son’s formative years when he still wants to be around me at all. We would have just a couple hours a night together as a family, and a couple weeks of PTO per year. Just the thought stresses me out... send thoughts!",11May2019,2

9,"So people are trying to kill me.
I am being watched and stalked by abusive family and crazy random people. They’re trying to isolate me and break my mind so I can’t defend myself against them and become unnatached to reality/feeble to do whatever to. 
Doctors won’t give me meds and misdiagnosed me. People are saying I’m stupid lazy want attention but I am a legitimate intelligent person I’m realer than them. 
They watch my every move and hack my electronics and raid my things. Spread rumors about me and ruin everything so I have nothing and nowhere to go. They found out my plans and I’m being watched heavily. It’s been like this my entire life but I only now realized this. 
They try to make me look sick and crazy and homeless all these years. 
People are invalidating me from their manipulations. 

So I have nowhere to go. No money. Been induced into psychosis from the cognitive dissonance state I’ve been in for so long (to make me not know if someone’s bad or not/to not trust my perception and instincts).
They took my soul from me. I’m empty and trying to not be puppeted at this point. They learned my secrets to counteract me and try to play on my weaknesses. They’re currently trying to steal my identity and copy what I do and who I am. What’s been done to me is very sick. I feel all I have left is suicide to make it stop because they’re trying to turn me into another person I am not. I can’t allow this to happen to me. They stalk me and say they’re worried about me but I’m okay when I’m alone and around normal people until the lies reach them and they change. I’ve always been fine until they start trying to create scenarios to confuse me or make me upset or go crazy then try to punish me. No one has ever helped me my entire life just taken part of it or looked the other way. I’m not sick I don’t need help. I need to get away from these people.

I have no privacy.
If I talk to someone even something small they tell everyone they copy me and they try to destroy me.EVERYTIME. They make up lies in their heads about me and it gives them this sense of they can do anything they want to me. They’re evil and taken over. People do not view me as a human being because of my abuse they think they can do it to me too. They think I don’t matter. They dehumanize me. Like I’m an object. I’m starting to think it’s Human Nature at this point. Even seemingly good people will try to do it to me too.

I’m not sure how to get away
I feel like it’s too late. I feel like I don’t even own myself. They do.  I can’t be used and destroyed for profit any longer.Even now I can feel myself being watched it’s like this quiet seething.

Don’t say I’m schizo either
They’re evil people wearing masks and I see right through them and they want me off the earth.  
Is there a way out of this?",11May2019,1
10," My housemate and I have been looking for a place to live once our current least is up. We found a place that sounds perfect for us on Craigslist. We checked into the property and only found it listed as ""for sale"" but nowhere was it listed as up for rent.  We reached out to the email address provided and were told that the man's name was Mr. Sylvester. His family had moved but they decided they wanted to keep the house and were looking for someone to rent for the next 4-5 years and take care of the place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because he was deaf, he preferred to speak over email or text, and provided his number.  After some hellos, Mr. Sylvester sent us a very informal application to fill out that basically asked about our names, jobs, ages, pets, and how long we were looking to rent. An ID was requested for and provided, but no other specific personal information was asked for.  After submitting the application, we received the following texts from Mr. Sylvester:   [https://i.imgur.com/YtuPQi2.png](https://i.imgur.com/YtuPQi2.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been joking this entire time that this may be a scam, because it's Craigslist. That said, it seems like we're at a place where we may be asked to send money for a holding payment to take the house off the market, with the promise of keys being sent in the mail, and we're not sure how to proceed.  Mr. Sylvester had mentioned that they are no longer living in the area, but I think I would be much more comfortable sending money if some kind of tour or inspection of the property was given beforehand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would never send money without that anyway, but in a situation like this especially.  Any tips, advice, or things to look out for in a situation like this? The house sounds too good to be true, so I'm trying not to let my hope get in the way of rational sense.",11May2019,1
12,"As the title says I would like to propose to my boyfriend. I want to do it when we go to Japan for the first time and I've talked to his friend over there about how to do it and for the most part I have everything figured out. Almost.

I know that its very unusual for females to propose to males so I'm at a lost for what kind of ring to get him. We both have promise rings and I gave him a stainless steel ring and for this one I want to give him silver for sure. But I'm at a loss in regards to what exactly I want to give him. Any advice in this matter would be very helpful and I would love to see pictures for inspiration if possible.

Thank you!",11May2019,1
13,"My phone died and I went on her tablet to search something up. As I typed, it indicated that she had searched for porn in the past. I don’t want to “rat her out”, but I also think there needs to be some sort of authority to tell her that looking at porn at her age is not okay. I do not want her to get misguided by the exaggerations the industry is known for displaying. 

Do I tell my parents? Do I talk to her?

I’ve already configured her tablet so the web is inaccessible. I’m not sure what to do from here.

14,"I live in Eugene, Oregon on a dead end street. The end of our road has always been communal parking for my neighbor and I until about 3 years ago. 
The dead end of our road is actually an easement that leads to an abandoned home with an overgrown yard. The owner of abandoned home parked a crappy 93 Mitsubishi expo right in front of the easement on the street. 
Instead of putting it another 10' forward so it would be on his property and out of the way, he left it right in the center of the road where it is a major eye sore. It also interferes with our parking, as both my neighbor and I have essentially lost a parking spot a piece. I have two work vehicles and juggling them around has become much more effort. 
I called the police 2 years ago and told them about the car and they said they had 3 days and they would send someone out to ticket it. I called back after two weeks and they said that they would not move, tow or ticket it unless it looked abandoned or if someone was camping in it. My neighbor called the police more recently and was told the same.
It seems ""someone"" managed to get the car unlocked, but the clutch appears seized so the car is not mobile and ""they"" weren't able to push it onto the owners property.
Any advice on how I or ""someone else"" should proceed with the removal process would be greatly appreciated",11May2019,2
15,"Over the past two years or so Ive been facing this social problem which I have no idea on what to do, and at this point its breaking me down and can no longer stay strong. You guys are my last resort.

Here it is:

I have a 'squad' of 6 people, including me.

Person A : uses me (school, general favours, etc) and when I indirectly and sometimes directly say no to him, he slowly starts throwing shade at me and makes taunting remarks whenever I am around, when confronting this behaviour, he says its just a joke and temporarily becomes nice.  He has the habit of being blunt and too dominating in convos, and always retaliates when someone answers back to him. \~ all the other people in the squad are aware of it some are even scared\~

Person B: The good dude of the group who is pretty tight with me but now im slowly questioning the friendship as i see some hints of us distancing away due to Person E talking about me (more on this ,below).

Person C: The not respected dude, this guy never speaks up or stands for himself, and is often treated as the scapegoat of the squad by Person A. This dude knows that he is not being treated right by Person A, but when taunting remarks are made, he just laughs it out and doesnt ever answer back, I often try to back him up and support him.

Person D: The dude that only is there when the group goes out for social events or just simple gatherings. Neutral person.

Person E: Known this guy since elementary school, both I and him were the skinniest dudes and got bullied about it and developed our insecurities about our bodies.  Had an on/off friendship with him but friendship was pretty stable in the past few years. This guy is a really loyal person and would often give in a lot for friends, but is quiet and easily feels peer pressured.

Me: Not the perfect person, but I like to stand my ground and I too, retaliate back but only when something wrongful is done to me or when I am being treated wrongly. (Thanks to Person A for helping me develop this skill ....)

**Heres the problem:**

Whenever  I am out with Person A and Person E, or Person A and Person C. Person A  'teams up' with the other, and slowly pick away at my mood  by making taunting remarks once again, they would continue for easily half an hour or so; until I cant hide my expression and frustration seeps out onto my face. (From what I think, the reason why others side with Person A, is because they are too ""scared"" to face his consequences of being verbally harassed, and by talking crap about me behind my back, and by doing the others favours so that they feel obligated to side with him).

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I have changed my physique to a pretty muscular build, and I've noticed that Person E has slowly become jealous of me as he is still the really skinny guy. Where ever I go, other colleagues and classmates comment on my change in physique and praise me for the dedication. Iv'e noticed that it has burned him inside slowly; so from seeing this I told him that I am willing to help him to get bigger by helping him to train correctly and by giving him tips. He was appreciative of it from what I think...

 *Few Weeks later:*

Person E, started working at a bank and asked if I wanted to give in my resume for the opening positions since his father works there as a high up, I would be able to get in quite easily. So I did. Person A did too. BOTH of us got in. 

Then at work, people once again comment on my physique and Person E feels bad, Person A notices that he feels bad and that his insecurity is being skinny. From that point onwards, Person A always brings up convos regarding 'body', just to put more fuel to the fire. 

Person A has done more favours for Person E, than me. So once again he is 'obligated' to side with him. 

Person E is tight with Person C and B. 

Person A realizes that so he tries to break the friendship between me and Person E, so that E can cover D and B. So this way the whole 'squad' is against me and kicks me out.

Today in a conference, Person A and E team up on me and basically got me to a breaking point. They even tried adding strangers to the convo to make fun of, and humiliate me but the strangers didnt.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole scenario seems very childish, toxic, immature, and is often overlooked at as 'just ignore them and itll be fine' by the people I have talked to irl. 

I have also been suffering some lows in life in the past 2 years and this thing is really not helping and it seems that I can no longer go to anyone but the internet now...

Advices will be EXTREMELY appreciated. Thanks bros/sis.",11May2019,1
16,"Hey there people of reddit, hope you can help me.

(Just so you know, I´m about 13, but not gonna say an exact age because internet.)

So, heres my story. Ive been dating this girl for about eight months now, and Ive been wanting to have my first kiss with her. I know Im somewhat young, but I feel like Im ready. My friend was going to rig 7 minutes of heaven at the next party he throws for me and her so that in the game I can kiss her, but I was thinking I wanted it to be like, not, in my friends basement. I was thinking we could sneak out to meet up at the high school and after a while try and kiss there, and I asked someone for advice, and they told me to talk to her about it. So I did. I told her that I wanted to kiss her and that I wanted to meet up sometime, and she agreed. The problem is, I casually mentioned it last night, and then she said:

¨Honestly, the more you push it the less Im wanting to do it.¨ She talked about how she was still (like I am,) somewhat new to ¨the whole dating thing."" 

I respect her, and her decision, but I also really want the kiss to happen. Im thinking of still going through with the 7 minutes of heaven idea and just not meeting up elsewhere, but I need advice... Help!",11May2019,1
17,"Hey everybody,

Me and my friends have planned out a holiday for this year June in Kavos. The thing is I thought I had enough money to go for the holiday but turns out I did not as I had lost money on an phone that I bought (£400) and taking my dog to the vets due to her not being well. I spoke to my friend about it but didn't listen properly and was asking when I can get the money. One friend did say that he'll pay for my ticket which is a generous offer but I said no as I don't want to waste his money on me.  I told them that they can book it without me and I can definitely come along on the next one.

At this point right now I'm tight on money and do not have enough to go. I've explained this to my friends on many occasions before it was booked and I just found out today that my friend did pay for my ticket without telling me. I'm annoyed the fact that he never messaged me or spoke to me before paying for my ticket and just went ahead with it. 

Am I in the right or wrong in this situation here?

21,"Some backround to explain before being judged. In 2016 I leased a Mercedes Benz that was brand new, it was 50k but I got an amazing deal bc my grandpa co-signed for me and had amazing credit. My payment is pretty low of only 330. I also had a really good job at the time and made amazing money so I could have even afforded double. 

Fast forward to 2018, he died unexpectedly January 2018 and I had just quit my job the month before that. My plan was to take a month off celebrate the new year and start my business. Then he died which threw EVERYTHING off. His wife (my grandmother) is older than him and has late stage Alzheimer’s. It was a mess. 2 weeks later my moms mother passed. 2018 was the worst year of my life. 

 After he passed he left a mess of things not taken care of, my dad quit his job to take care of my grandma and we were left with their house that was completely unlivable due to her illness, to put it mildly the house was filled with rats. We had to clean it all out (40 years worth of stuff) plus have it renovated. While this was all happening I started a business (which did awful and I lost thousands of dollars)

Currently. I am out of money, have not been working due to severe anxiety and depression (I’ve been seeing a therapist since January) and my car lease is up in August. I have no clue what to do bc buying it out would be the cheapest option but I doubt they will approve me. And Idk if I can find a job that is local before then. I definitely can work and push myself if it is local. Any help will be appreciated.",11May2019,1

I admitted it to him but didn’t tell him the full story, I slept at hers that night (didn’t have sex with her) but omitted that when I first told him. He found out about the fact I slept at her place.

We’ve both talked about it at length, I told him that I feel fucking horrible and I want to be a better friend in the future. He accepted my apology and things have been pretty much back to normal. However he talked to one of my close friends about it at a party and he’s still reeling, and I’m worried that I’m gonna lose him as a friend - I wasn’t supposed to know that he’d talked to my friend about it either

I seriously love this guy, I’ve known him for ages and I would gladly do anything for him and I really really don’t want to lose him as a friend. I want to bridge the topic and tell him to talk to me about it so we can get through it. I know I fucked up well and truly and I just want it to go away.

25,"When I was like 10 years old, to get my teeth ready for braces, they pulled some teeth. One of my molars didn't have an adult tooth under it, so they put a little spacer that went around the tooth behind it and had a bar that went up and then back to hold the space open. Then we moved, another orthodontist did the braces, and was supposedly planning on just putting a fake tooth there once my teeth were straight, but he just blew it off and then retired. My parents kicked me out when I was 17, and I moved in with my grandparents. I'm not sure if they even knew about the spacers, and by this time my braces were already off. I guess everybody just kind of forgot about it? I'm 29 now, and a couple years ago the spacer broke, and it's not been a problem so I just kinda forgot about it. This morning I noticed my gums kinda hurt back there where it is, and I looked and it's been pushing the gum line in front of the missing tooth down to the point where it's like a quarter of an inch lower than it is on the other side, at the tooth in front of the space. I'm not working, I don't have insurance, I'm living in a shelter/halfway house type place. Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do to get this fixed?

26," I figured a lot of people on here are atheists, but sometimes I feel like I'm having a religious identity crisis. I'm 26 years old and was raised Jewish, but I was never very interested in religion growing up. I later started exploring Christianity and read a lot of parts of the bible. It sort of awakened a stronger faith identity in me, but at the same time I didn't care to go to church and take on a ""holier than thou"" attitude. I don't like to use the term ""spiritual"" because I feel like that's a cope out word for someone who is borderline atheist but doesn't want to claim to be so. For a long time I identified as agnostic because sometimes I feel there is a God. I'm actually afraid of God, or at least of the fact that there might be a higher being in the universe. I'm afraid if I DENY the existence of a God then my life will go to shit or I might suffer some consequence for denying God. God is suppose to be all-loving, but I'm still afraid to just come out and say I'm an atheist and don't believe in God. Reading the bible did make me feel more faithful or believe in the power of faith, but at the same time I think religion can be mind-numbing. A lot of people who are very religious tend to consider themselves superior.   


I guess everything in moderation, like I guess you don't have to go to church or practice Christianity to be a Christian. I guess the idea of hell also frightens me as well. It's hard to settle on one religious identity. I went through a lot of my life so far without practicing religion or being very religious, so I might as well have just been an atheist I suppose. I also can't say that I expect God to do everything for me in life and smite my enemies if I ask him to do so. Also over time being an atheist has become associated with edgelords and what not, but I don't consider myself an edgelord or anything.  


It's like, I don't know what I am, or what I want to believe. Part of me wants to believe there is a God and the other part of me doesn't. I suppose I could be faithful in silence, like I don't feel you have to brag about it to strangers or anything, just as long as you practice what the bible teaches. I feel sometimes religion has a way of changing people, sometimes for the worse. Maybe I just need to sit down and ponder what it is that I actually believe and what I want to believe in. Even if I identified as an atheist I don't think I'd be one of these people who just bashes others for believing in God or worshipping him but at the same time, as I said, I'm partly wanting to believe in God. It's like I need a sign or just need to go on some spiritual journey. Maybe I need to read more religious literature or something.",11May2019,1
27,"Here’s my sitch, thanks for reading.

I’m currently in a funk. I’m working in retail and it pays pretty well plus benefits but I know it’s not something long-term for me. I’m in school for business but it’s gonna take a long time to get a degree and it’s getting very hard to balance both working full time and school. 

I go back and forth between wanting to quit my job to do school full time, and quitting school to work as many hours as a I can and hoard the money to invest/buy property.

I think I’m becoming depressed with how my life is going. I have friends at work and out of work, and I have a good relationship with most of my siblings, but I feel lonely and isolated some of the time. Like no one really understands me, or puts in the effort to inquire about my struggles. I feel that I should date and meet girls, but between school and work, there’s limited time to meet people, and how am I just supposed to meet people?! I tried a dating app, but haven’t had much success. 

I’m good at my work, but there’s basically no foreseeable upward growth. I also do well at school, and I feel that it’s a shame to lose out on getting a good degree just because I can’t juggle it with work.

More recently, I’ve been very addicted to my phone, checking apps and news and markets all the time. Many hours at a time, even during class and at work. I’m getting massively addicted to my phone and I am procrastinating the things I need to do. I feel that it’s such a shame and I sometimes feel like I need to just break out of the funk and just do shit! But then I go on my phone and waste time until it’s so late that I’m gonna be tired the next day.

I know that I’m not clinically depressed, although depression does run in my family. I feel that I’m depressed due to my circumstances and can’t seem to focus on anything these days besides markets and news. 

Thanks for reading all this!!! I’d love to hear some insight/advice on my situation :)",11May2019,1
28,"I need help seriously. I’m 27F and working as a language teacher for foreigners. And last term I had a his class and at the end of the semester he started to follow me on Instagram. He said “I accidentally found your Instagram” How people can find someone’s account accidentally. I have no mutual friends with him.

I wanted to block him, but I didn’t wanna cause problems in my school. I’m not allowed to hang out with my students and could be fired. And unfortunately if I talk to my boss about this, my boss might fire me. In my country, people don’t like people who possibly make problems.

But he kept talking to me on IG and said “I’m really appreciate what you did to me so I wanna pay this kindness back” and then it piss my bf(32M) off. Also when I posted a story, me and my bf and a female friend, I tagged them and then the student started to follow my bf. So my bf and me argued, because he wanted me to talk about this to my boss but I didn’t want to make problems. Also I wasn’t sure if it’s good idea to block the student. Because I didn’t want the student to talk to me about this in the school.

After all, I explained “I could be fired because of this situation and I know you follow my friends(not only my bf), this is my private account so I will block you” and blocked the student.

And the next day, it was today, I got CRAZY LONG MESSAGES from the student from his new or the other account at the midnight. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do. Any advice? Please.",11May2019,1

I never got any say or any closure and as far as I knew we both had expressed a lot of interest in getting back together. She wasn’t my first girlfriend but I really cared about her a lot and it’s hard for me to try to want to pursue something with someone else.

31,"I've always been a shy person, but at some point that shyness turned into anxiety. I'm a total introvert by nature, and this combined with having social anxiety makes it extremely hard to maintain friendships. All this is a recurring problem in my social interactions.

I recently had to cram for finals, (I'm a college student) so I have had no time for my friends. Now that the semester is over I want to talk to my friends, but I freeze up when I try to communicate with them in any way. It's been like two weeks since I've talked to any of them.

I think I'm mostly afraid of the exited, happy, animated response I'll get when I first see them. I missed them too, but I can be easily overwhelmed by strong expressions of emotion since I'mso timid. I then feel guilty that I can't show that same degree of emotion in return, mostly because I'm overwhelmed. I most certainly feel that way, but I can't show it well.

I'm afraid I'll come off as not caring that we haven't seen each other in so long. Or that I didn't miss them, or that I don't love them as much as they love me. I am totally aware I'm overthinking this, but I can't help it. Please give me advise on how to make this easier.",11May2019,1

34,"If anyone has been in a similar situation and can give real step by step advice/logic/tips please I’d appreciate it. Thank you.

So people are trying to kill me
I am being watched and stalked by abusive family and crazy random people. They’re trying to isolate me and break my mind so I can’t defend myself against them and become unnatached to reality/feeble to do whatever to. 
Doctors won’t give me meds and misdiagnosed me. People are saying I’m stupid lazy want attention but I am a legitimate intelligent person I’m realer than them. 
They watch my every move and hack my electronics and raid my things. Spread rumors about me and ruin everything so I have nothing and nowhere to go. They found out my plans and I’m being watched heavily. It’s been like this my entire life but I only now realized this. 
They try to make me look sick and crazy and homeless all these years. 
People are invalidating me from their manipulations. 

So I have nowhere to go. No money. Been induced into psychosis from the cognitive dissonance state I’ve been in for so long (to make me not know if someone’s bad or not/to not trust my perception and instincts).
They took my soul from me. I’m empty and trying to not be puppeted at this point. They learned my secrets to counteract me and try to play on my weaknesses. They’re currently trying to steal my identity and copy what I do and who I am. What’s been done to me is very sick. I feel all I have left is suicide to make it stop because they’re trying to turn me into another person I am not. I can’t allow this to happen to me. They stalk me and say they’re worried about me but I’m okay when I’m alone and around normal people until the lies reach them and they change. I’ve always been fine until they start trying to create scenarios to confuse me or make me upset or go crazy then try to punish me. No one has ever helped me my entire life just taken part of it or looked the other way. I’m not sick I don’t need help. I need to get away

I have no privacy.
I’m not sure how to get away
I feel like it’s too late. I feel like I don’t even own myself. They do.  I can’t be used and destroyed for profit any longer.Even now I can feel myself being watched it’s like this quiet seething.

They’re evil people wearing masks and I see right through them and they want me off the earth.

35,"I started working full time minimum wage at some retail place 8 months ago just so I can have some money coming in while waiting for my electrician apprenticeship.  When I started there I told them I would be leaving as soon as I got someone to take me on as an apprentice (it’s really hard to find someone to take you on).

One day I decided to get a gun license for personal use, but my work said that they would pay for it so that I can sell guns there. The problem is it takes a couple of months for the actual license to come back and now two months in-still waiting for my gun license, I got someone who’s willing to take me on as an apprentice. Now I told my work that I finally found someone to take me on and they’re trying to get me to stay by telling me they paid all that money for my gun license even though I told them when I started working there that I was waiting for an apprenticeship.

TLDR; got a full time job and told management I would leave as soon as I got a apprenticeship. A few months in, they decide to pay me to get a gun license so I can sell guns, but two months in of still waiting for my license, I just got told someone can take me on as an apprentice before I even got my gun license.

38," I (f 24) tend to forget things I have to do all the time (I don't forget what I did but what I have to do). My boyfriend gets angry every time he asked me to do sth and I forgot to. He's right, I mean he shouldn't be telling me all the time ""remember to bla bla"" but I hate it when he calls me irresponsible, and that he's afraid of me causing a mess. A few weeks ago I forgot to turn off the heat. The other day I left the oven on the whole day. I try to double check the door so as to be sure I didn't forget to lock it. But I get a little obsessed with those things. 
Another problem that I've noticed is that when I'm working or studying for an exam I need to focus, I start reading, I'm paying attention and out of nowhere I start thinking about sth else (usually a wish). I assume this happens to almost every person in this planet, but still bothers me not to be able to manage my attention spam. Most of the exams I've failed were because I got distracted doing the test (really stupid mistakes). I hate myself every time this happens, and it happens a lot. .
My friend told me that maybe I have this problem because I'm always busy (working, studying, going to the gym, playing soccer), but when I have a day off I forget to do important things anyway. And I've also tried setting up a reminder, and when the alarm goes off I remember what I have to do, and on my way of doing the thing I have to do, I forget what I have to do. (Sorry if you got confused)
Last year I tried therapy, but I didn't like it. My therapist told me that maybe I have experienced something in the past that I can't let it go. I thought it may be the death of the best dog I've ever had (eight years ago) or the fact that I gave up on my dream. Anyway, if I figure out what is it that I can't let go, how can I let it go? I don't think that's actually the problem. I've always been like this, even since I was a kid.

51,"I am currently a freshman in college going to be a sophomore soon. I am facing a huge decision in terms of what I want to do in my career. I am going pre-med right now, and have completed a years worth of biology and chemistry courses. My parents strictly want me to go pre-med, and it is very difficult for me to change their minds otherwise.  


I have been into computer science ever since I was a kid and am very proficient at it. I love to program in my spare time and create projects. It has been an interest ever since I was young. This is the field that I want to go into, but my parents are strictly against it. The thing is, I have been considering medicine also, and I do find biology and chemistry interesting topics. I do not loathe the material, and certainly do well in it.  


The problem is that I am scared of a lifestyle as a doctor. I want more free will in my life to do what I want, which seems to me right now as computer science. I am scared of having to be in school until my 30s, and then just being locked down in my job with little else to do with my life if I decide to do medicine. I feel like I want to have the option to explore my own life through the path of computer science and from there, be able to do what I want.   


The things preventing me from doing computer science are two things. Firstly, my parents are very against me switching out of medicine, likely for the fact that they believe any career outside of medicine will not grant a good life and career (indian parents, I am a first generation college student if that is relevant). Secondly, I am worried I am too late. I have already done a years worth of classes in chemistry and biology, and very little in computer science and math, meaning that I will be a year behind all the other computer science majors. It seems just easier to go the path of medicine so I will be able to stay on track.

She fooled around with another friends boyfriend/baby daddy 2 months back when her friend had just had a baby with him. And she also is in love with a guy named ""Andy"" that's her friend who has a girlfriend and decided to agree be his ""side hoe"" as he puts it. She's not a bad person, just doesn't necessarily respect boundaries of other women and sees no problem  with what she does.

Anyways, she has a friend from high school, we will call him ""Travis"" that she's known for a long time and recently started to like him. He showed no interest in her and when she asked if they can be more he turned her down because he doesn't see her that way. Well, about 2 weeks ago she asked him to hang out with the two of us.

He friended me on social media and we started talking, things got more serious and we went on a date and it went very well, even though I knew it was wrong. Him and I are now dating (fast yes I know). And I told her two days ago that him and I are together now. I hadn't told her previously what I was doing because she has severe mental health issues and was afraid to make her issues worse but I figured she would be hurt if I kept it from her longer. She is incredibly angry and upset with me. I can't stand that I hurt her. I feel like a terrible friend and an awful person. What can I say to her to make it okay? Do I just give her time? 

TL;DR 
Started dating a guy my friend had a crush on even though she is interested in multiple other guys. She is furious with me. I feel horrible. How can I make it right?",11May2019,2
59,"Hi everyone! So for my job (firefighter) we have to go through training every so often, and my brigade has decided it is going to be doing it at a place across the country which is 85 miles for me.

They have Said it’s residential meaning we can stay there but I’m going to commute as I have to look after a disabled relative (wash, cook for) etc.

It’s only for 13 weeks Monday - Friday afternoon but yeah it’s the first long commute I’ve had.

Has anyone had any long commutes? Any advice to make it more enjoyable?

61," 

I am currently a student in a BS/MD program at a large public research university, where I am accepted into medical straight out of high school. One of the great things about being in a BS/MD program is  that we don't have to be the ""typical premed"" and can be free to pursue  non-medical interests and hobbies, since for our program we only need to  maintain a 3.5 GPA and score a 507 MCAT. Unfortunately for me, I took the whole laissez-faire attitude a little too far, and barely applied  myself throughout my undergraduate years. I took a lot of AP and advanced level courses throughout high school, and through connections I had with friends, was often to get old exams for classes, which were  similar to the exams I ended up taking, which made studying for classes an absolute joke. By the end of my sophomore year, I had a 4.0 GPA and had several volunteering and research experiences under my belt. It  seemed like I was all set, with minimal effort, making me feel like I was just the smartest guy in the world.

Then  the shitshow that is junior year just hit me, and now everything is up  in the air. This was the first year where I wasn't prepared for my classes from AP and prior studying, and it hit hard. I managed to finish  this year with a 3.9 GPA and maintained my research and volunteering,  but I had absolutely zero time to study for the MCAT, and I sacrificed  everything to maintain my grades.  I have not opened a prep book, taken a course, or even taken a practice test and just had no clue as to what  the MCAT would be like. Furthermore, I have had several health issues  this year, and fell into a depression due to some family issues and the stress of the academic year. I have developed no study skills or strategies, and I just recently took the MCAT and was too dumb to void  my scores, even though I knew I failed. The scores will come out next  month, but I am sure I did not hit the 507 I needed -there's just no way in hell, given that I never studied for any of my classes. Our program is not very forgiving of not hitting the MCAT score, so I know I am  going to get kicked out. It is just a very depressing position for me  right now, knowing that I had an acceptance to a top-tier medical  school, and somehow managed to fuck it up at the most crucial time.  Furthermore, I have lied to my parents about everything (I have said I  was studying for the MCAT when I have not), causing immense strain in  our relationship and an inability for me to explain my situation to them  (if I were to confess, they would probably disown me and I would lose them forever).

So now is the part where I ask for help. Where the hell do I even go from here? I am going to be a senior in the fall - which means its too late for me to try to change majors or careers. No medical school is going to accept a washout and failure like me, and it just hurts knowing how embarassing and stupid my situation really is. I can't retake the MCAT, as I delayed it several times and used up my three allowed attempts for the year. I just do not know what to do now, because I know I still want  to become a doctor, but clearly lack the maturity and discipline to do  so, and am hoping to find a way out, other than painless suicide. This is the lowest I'll ever go, and I don't know how to come back from this. I would appreciate any help. Thanks.",11May2019,1
62,"I hate my life from every aspect. Because of the stupid fuckers who are my parents, my life is a mess and is pointless.

My parents raised me in a way that I never had a social life, I'm 18 now, virgin, never had a girlfriend, don't have friends either, I was never allowed to go out  (I'm still not), I never touched one cent of pocket money  (my dad is a fucking private school director and my mom's an English teacher, so don't tell me about financial issues cause there aren't any) I'm not even allowed to do part time jobs. Every year all my electronic devices get confiscated until summer break (I managed to steal some money from them and got a classmate to buy me a phone that can access the internet), my grades are below average, I'm not allowed to do any kind of sports at all, I don't have a bike, I can't close my room's door even if I'm just changing my clothes and I'm forced to do those stupid religious rituals even tho I made it veeery clear that I'm an atheist (they think it's just a phase like adolescence).

And here I am, there's one month left until the final exam, I'm far from ready, I'm clearly gonna fail and ruin my whole life with it because my father made it pretty clear that if I don't graduate from high school, they're kicking me out with no money nor shelter nor any knowledge of the whole fucking outside world.

65,"So I’ve known my friend for 3-4 months and we’ve gotten pretty comfortable with each other talking about deeper things than casual talk, but nothing romantic. I do find her very attractive, but i personally think she wouldn’t be a very good girlfriend because of our personalities.

This past week we were hanging out at my place and she ended up asking if she could sleep the night because she was super stressed out by her roommates and didn’t want to talk to them. I said yes because she seemed more stressed than I’d ever seen her before so I offered to sleep on the floor or the common area and she said we can just sleep my bed. 

I asked again and she said she was sure so we ended up falling asleep on different sides of the bed. I woke up really early in the morning to me spooning with her and my whole body was pressed against her with morning wood and my hand on her thigh. I freaked out so I quickly moved away from her and tried to go back to sleep and then we both ended up waking up sometime later.

She never mentioned anything about me cuddling her and I didn’t either because I didn’t know if she even knew. It was a huge accident on my part and I wasn’t conscious when it happened. I feel like I sexually assaulted her, but everything was completely normal between us in the morning so I don’t know if I should apologize. I feel terrible about doing this.",11May2019,7

I've been with my gf for almost 2 years (Lived with her for almost just as long) And it's safe to say that I do love her. However, there are many times that she does get under my skin with a lot of the things that she does.

She mocks me
She criticizes me
She likes to be overly lazy and not helping around the house
Never cooks
Doesn't do laundry
Likes to use the excuse that since she just got home from work, that she should be just relaxing, and not taking care of our dog that she bought.
When on her time of the month, will use that  as a reason to not do anything, but go to work, as well as lashing out at others.

On mobile , and I've always sucked at English. What's good. 

Sorry it's kinda long . . . 

I've been working at this non profit thrift store for about 3.5 years now (September will be my 4 years) and the last two of them has been utter hell for me. One employee was hired that I ended up training and having under me has been harassing me( not sexually or verbally. He's bought me gifts worth hundreds of dollars and he has an overall creepy vibes, had admitted liking me, and gossiped about other co workers to me) . I filed a long complaint against him with HR but they dismissed the harassment claim and said that it didn't apply to what they say is harassment and that they ""talked"" to this employee. I've asked for him to keep his distance now that we are in different departments and I've declined a promotion to stay away from him. 

But  now he's constantly in my work area when he can be working in his own , he doesn't talk to me but him being around constantly makes me very anxious and I get shakey and anxiety sweat( which is so gross btw i hope you never experience it) . I came back from a two week stress leave and it's been two weeks since I've been back and I'm close to quitting but I love my job so much. I've told my manager 4 times within those two weeks that he's coming in the back where i work way to often. 

Today at work i left half way through my shift because i had a huge anxiety attack that this employee induced. I'm at a loss , what should i do now ? Contact labour board ( I'm in canada) about my situation? Should I confront this employee again (I've told him to leave me alone about 4 times in 18 months ). I really want to keep my job it's so secure and the money and benefits are amazing but this is affecting my mental health greatly .  I need some advice reddit.

71,"I'm gonna go straight to the point, 18-M dropped out of school in 9th grade, haven't completed 9th grade. Why did I drop out? Parents separated when I was 13-14ish which led to me to anxiety and depression, felt weak and destroyed to see my mom in that state and couldn't believe what was happening. All that school stress + family stress forced me to stop going to school because I couldn't take it anymore, I thought of ending myself to stop all this shit that's been damaging me mentally and physically but whenever I thought of doing it, my mom would come in my thoughts and I imagined how fucking lost she would feel, I already saw her in so much pain and I couldn't possibly damage her even more. I belong to an Indian family so parents separating is a very, very rare thing to happen, I didn't even know that could happen back then. We moved to our moms-sisters apartment in '15 and I've been at home doing nothing since then, couldn't talk to my parents about my mental health because I thought it would've made the matter much worse.

Almost 5 years later I'm still regretting about dropping out but that's in the past and I can't go to school now, I still have no idea what I'm gonna do in the future. I thought of joining a culinary school and becoming a chef but I researched about it and found out that you at least need a 10th grade certificate / diploma. At least in India.

73,"Ok so.
 
1. I live on my parent's property in a camper while I finish my degree. I pay them $150 a month to live here. The camper's kitchen and bathroom aren't functional so I use the house as well. The apartments for 50 miles are all way overpriced and out of my budget. 

2. I have PCOS which comes with pretty bad fatigue, mood swings and depression/anxiety. I have panic attacks every so often but they aren't as bad as they used to be. It's recommended to keep stress down which lowers cortisol levels blah blah blah. I am on really good medication that helps, but stress relief is still the name of the game.

3.Social events not only exacerbated my social anxiety but they wipe me out mentally and make me feel a bit like crying. Even just thinking about being in the middle of a boring ass conversation about how I'm doing at school or ""what I've been up too"" is making my eyes watery. 
(3.5 Small talk is the bane of my existence).

4. My program at school is very competitive and is just about my threshold for stress. It helps that its in a field that I excel in, but it is still stressful. Outside of school and my part time job, I really don't have time for anything stress inducing. My downtime needs to literally be that: downtime. 

5. Days I have ""off"" (doing work at home): Friday. 

6. My parents host a dinner gathering for their church friends every Friday night. 

7. My parents + my parent's friends and I are complete opposites when it comes to religion and politics but we get along ok when thats not the topic. 

8. But, on Fridays they gather in my parents living room to sing songs (badly) on a poorly tuned guitar and are all way to buzzed on the jesus koolaid for my taste. 

9. They are extremely loud. Its like 100 banjo players anniversary symphony playing over a hoard of angry cats while screaming children drag nails on a chalkboard. Or thats what it feels like to me.

10. Everytime I have to pee or I want something to eat I have to go inside. I get bombarded with 

""Hey [my name, said way too sweetly] How are you, how's your cat? Is school going well? Are you dating anyone? What's their name, I'll add them on Facebook! Anyway where've you been? How come you never come to church? Oh did you get some food? Would you like to pray together?""
 
.... And often all of this includes people (basically strangers, usually men) touching me (rubbing my shoulders really hard, hugging me etc), which makes me want to literally scream, jump  out of my skin and punch them in the bits.

11. I have, in detail, told my parents this is an issue. 
My dad who is a true type A extrovert says things like 
""UH I am an introvert too, I like my alone time like anyone else"" (which is something extroverted people like to say - completely misunderstanding that they are absolutely not introverted). I have tried to get them the leave the side door and front door unlocked so I can get to the restroom without having to see anyone but they refuse. 

12. 
I am really hungry right meow and I'd like to go inside and make a sammich but I don't think I have the energy to go in there :( they usually don't leave for another 4-5 hours.

74,"I graduated college a year ago &amp; so far I've realized that college is complete bullshit &amp; a total scam. My degree has gotten me nowhere. I've worked &amp; currently am working a dead end job that will lead nowhere. I have no clue what to do with my life &amp; I'm certain that if I go to grad school, it will not help in the slightest &amp; I'll still be struggling to find a decent career.

I still live with my parents &amp; I have vague plans about moving in with a few buddies of mine,but the idea of being able to afford to live with roomates seems like a laughable joke to me. I'm certain at best I'll probably be living in some crappy, cheap motel one of these days.

My social life has been crap. I can barely count the amount of times I've gone out &amp; socialized on two hands. I have friends back in college who seem to have more friends than I &amp; actively socialize &amp; it makes me so jealous because I want that kind of life. Even when I socialize I feel like a spectator who has no impact on anything &amp; if I wasn't there, no one would care. I'm honestly convinced I could die tomorrow &amp; no one would care.

My depression &amp; anxiety have certainly gotten much worse than it was in college. I have random episodes where I want to burst out crying over how hopeless my life feels &amp; it's starting to impact my productivity at work. Normally my depression subsides when I'm at work, but apparently that's starting to wear off.

75,"Very very long read ahead. Skip to tl;dr at bottom if you’d like. 


I’m (25F) and have never been a good student all my life. Barely passed my schooling and somehow managed to get into University. 


Generally during the first few years of my degree I was just getting by scoring mostly Cs. 

Things happened in my personal life that really pushed me from being an already terrible student to an even worse one. My very close cousin died suddenly and that took the biggest toll on me but I always acted like i was fine so no one ever knew how bad it affected me. Didnt help that my cousin’s actual cause of death is a secret only a few people know. 

It was meant to be a 3 years course but I kept failing and retaking subjects and was just failing even the simplest ones again and again, on my 5th year I took it real far and just avoided uni and essentially dropped out (student visa expired and i didnt renew) but i stayed in that country for a few months on tourist visa. (No one knew i was no longer studying)

I returned back home and my family and friends just assume i have completed my degree but thats not the case. 


I reached out to my uni after a year and found out that I still need to complete 7 subjects and my thesis.


A little background on my uni is that they’re more focused on expanding their campus and have been commercially driven to take more students to get the money. Found out that each subject will cost me 600-700USD and that is not inclusive of the visa and application fees needed as I am an international student. Uni has a resource fee that needs to be paid every semester as well. The uni has been losing 80% of its lecturers who were actually passionate about teaching due to terrible management and have replaced them with seemingly sycophants who got the job and pride themselves in always failing students. I have anxiety just thinking of the uni. If i do go, i would need $$ for subjects, application, living. 

My problem is that I am honestly not in the headspace to complete my degree because I think I have unresolved issues but the main reason I need to complete it is because I add zero value to anyone’s life right now and just feel like a waste of space everyday of my life. 

I live in a country that recently suffered a backlash from an implementation of a draconian law (which u can try and guess pretty accurately but i wont be able to confirm or deny as that pretty much will make me easy to detect) unemployment is a big issue here and even more with the fact that I have no degree. The country encourages people to do business because there simply is no jobs for locals. Local businesses would rather pay foreigners with lower wages. 

I’m unemployed, living with my parents and have just been picking up and sending my younger siblings to school. 

Tl;dr I really really want to do something with my life but again (1)im a terrible student (2) i have no recent work experience (3) money is definitely a problem.  (4) i think i have mental health issues, am confident i do a lot of avoidance coping (5) how can i be a better person? (6) I really want to be better. 

Can anyone please help be a beacon of light in my life? I’m spiralling and cant seem to ask for help in person.

Flash forward a month or so and I realized the film program was quite inadequate and I wanted more, thus leading me to apply for transfer.  I had already applied to Syracuse in the past and was fortunate enough to get back in there for film. However they didn’t give me any money this time around, making the total cost an insane amount. I was also denied from my top school, NYU, which I truly thought I was going to get into. I wanted to stay in a city very badly and also still have access to all the resources of a city as well. This leaves me with a few options right now.

1. Attend Syracuse U for the rest of my college career. Still does have a good film program, just not the environment or school I truly want. Also very expensive and my aid appeal was denied 

2. Attend a local community college for the next year that has a transfer agreement with NYU Film and hopefully attend as a junior

Shes been through a ton of stuff like my brothers dad beating her when they together and getting her to take the fall for drug possession, While she was pregnant during that time with my older brother. Then a year later my father leaving her because she wouldnt abort me. Then struggling to live on her own for 3 years before she met my stepdad and he moved us into his house. My stepdad lieing to her about being divorced. During the time with my stepdad she was very abusive and still is. She chased my stepdad around with a knife around our house. Almost crashing his car while we were inside, causing him to take my little brother and walk home without us. Over the next few years constant drunken verbal fights between them. My mom would always beat up my stepdad and I'd wake up with blood around the house. Sometimes hed run into my older brother and Is room,(I was maybe 12 or so when he would do this) to make an attempt to get her to go away, she didnt. They would always get us involved some how. This caused my big brother to rebel and smoke weed, sell drugs, get suspended from school constantly, develop sociopathic behaviors like stealing money and lieing to everyone until my stepdad kicked him out and moved to California to keep doing all the same stuff. My mom involved my big brother in my grandpa's conflict(hes a Vietnam vet with PTSD and a pill problem, my grandma died during my childhood as well and he lived with my uncle after.) 
My grandpa was fighting with some dude who he was having a relationship with, got my mom(who wasnt aware of it) involved, leading to her taking his problem and throwing it on my big brother who was 14 or so at the time. Which definitely had some impact on him.

My mom is a very kind &amp; flawed person who will both mentally and sometimes physically damage her kids. She'll also protect her kids like most mothers would, she helped me get my own apartment, gave my brother money to help himself with his BS. She'll also make our problems hers as well without even asking.

I dont know what to do about the whole situation. I've told my stepdad he should divorce her but hes already been divorced with 2 kids(my older stepbrothers who are grown adults)before and doesnt think it will be any better for my 2 little brothers. I've told my mom she should go to therapy and she says she has and it doesnt do anything, which leads me to think she just refuses to be helped.

82,"(I’m new to reddit, so if this is the wrong sub lmk) 

Basically I turned 18 last August, so I’m an adult now. The gist of my issue is that when I turned 18 I decided to “try and act like an adult.” This half involved trying to slow down my thoughts, take responsibility for myself and rely on others less, try to be more rational and understanding, the works. 

The other half involved looking More critically at my interests and attempting to give up anything I thought was immature. I deleted my anonymous social media accounts (which I mostly used to interact with fandoms and post art) and left all “non-personal” discord servers (fan servers) I tried to play fewer video games and created a new YouTube account that wasn’t subscribed to lets play or comedy accounts. I didn’t cut everything off at once or right away, but even the lingering things I haven’t been able to get rid of I always view as “something I’ll stop soon” 

I’ve also had a bad habit of muttering and pacing around since I was a little girl (not like crazy person muttering, I just like to craft narratives and dialogues and fictions, and sometimes I just unconsciously say it out loud) that I’ve been trying, unsuccessfully, to shake. Every time I let my guard down I just... do it without thinking, it’s very embarrassing.

The hardest part of all this was stopping posting art on social media, I used to have a decent following and would get instant satisfaction and recognition on my work, whether though discord or social media, but now I’m the only one who ever sees the things I draw. I want to draw for myself and to improve, but the lack of praise has been really detrimental to my motivation for creating things and pushing my art to be as good as possible (so as to be as presentable to others as possible) I just draw the same things again and again when I’m not studying, it’s fun but not what it used to be.

Overall recently I’ve realized how much less... enjoyment I’ve been getting out of the day and wondering if this is the wrong move? I want to work hard on self reflection and self improvement and I don’t want to make excuses for something I should really be trying to achieve. Should I ease up or is it worth it to do this now so I won’t have to later 

Uhh also a lot of other posts on here say this so [18F] is that how this works?? Maybe?",11May2019,1
83,"I don't know where to begin.

I believe I have severe depression.

I have an insane amount of trouble focusing. I have to reread paragraphs, sentences, hell even words over and over and over again to truly understand what I'm reading. I feel like my mind is not really ""here"" in the present, and it gets so easily distracted by the tiniest sounds or thoughts. It's taking over my life as a writer and my whole sanity.

I'm in a writing job that I'm sick of, partly because of my lack of focus and partly because I'm running out of creative ideas. And every time I take a day off, I return to my job with feelings of dread.

I lack time management skills and I feel like my whole day revolves around my writing job. I want to start writing books that I actually care about and start auditioning again (I'm also an actor) but I feel like my hours and days go by so fast. That, and after my current work day is done and over with, I'm too burnt out to even start writing or finishing one of my books.

Since I'm a freelance writer, my income fluctuates greatly. I don't have any type of insurance. I want to see a therapist, but I'm afraid of the costs and showing signs of weakness to another person, even if they're a professional.

I feel like my mind has split into two and they're constantly battling against each other. One is screaming ""get help"" while the other is saying ""no, you can overcome this on your own.""

I never used to be like this and I'm not sure where this all started. I feel stuck, lost, helpless, and very very alone. My social circle is comically small, and I don't really talk about my issues to the friends that I have, simply because we're not that close.

Hell, I don't even know if this is the right place to post this kind of shit. But thank you for reading, whoever you are.",11May2019,1
84,"In 5th grade, someone transferred over to our school and it didn't take me long to not stop thinking about her. But I was 10 and felt that I was too young to ask her out. The next year, one of her friends asked me out for her in her presence, but I was too nervous and gave a stupid answer that haunts me to this day. ""No thanks. I'm full."" Wtf, me? Anyway I finally asked her out 2 years later, but she was already talking with someone. Eventually I got into a relationship with someone else that lasted through high school, but we broke up for reasons unrelated. Now I live 200 miles away, she has a kid, but is single, but I think it's definitely too late because our careers are in full effect and we're too far away. Yet, I've always regretted saying no. I just wonder if it would be a horrible idea to bring it up and ask her what she thinks and if it could've happened eventually. I'm sure she definitely won't want to start a long distance relationship with someone she hasn't been near since high school graduation. Would I be a creep if I did this, or is it a bad idea in general? I just want some closure but I feel like this might make things worse.

87,"So details about the situation

I work at a local pizzeria. It's technically a food chain, because it has several locations, but it's local to our area and each store is independently owned. So it's not really like a corporation. Meaning there's no HR to contact about this.

So we have one employee, I'll call her Amy, and she just works regular shifts. She's a sophomore in high school and 16. 

Then the other one, I'll call him Josh, is a driver for our pizzeria. He's about 20 or 21, I'm not too sure about when he graduated, but I know it was at least two years ago.

Anyway, they've apparantly been flirting for a while, but Amy previously had a boyfriend, and Amy's ex was actually concerned about some of the things Josh was saying to her. I only know this because she was complaining about her ex to another employee.

Today is what makes me most want to report them to our store's owner/manager

Basically, they were just flirty and saying like really sexual stuff. Something along the lines of ""swallowing a cock"" was brought up, and also a conversation Amy and Josh had where Amy was talking with Josh about reaming him and stuff. 

It's just gross and makes me highly uncomfortable, both for how they talk to each other, and the fact that he's 4 or 5 years older than her. 

Would I have good enough grounds to make a complaint? Would it be a good idea in the first place?",11May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

My ex (M 21) and I (F 21) had a hormone filled drunken hook up after a year of not seeing each other. We used absolutely no protection, I'm not on any form of birth control, and he did finish inside me (Sorry for TMI lol). We were both out of our minds and not thinking straight. 

So, the day after this occurs, I get a notification on my phone that it was my day of ovulation. Of course, the tracker isn't exact, but I get cramps with it so I knew I had ovulated that day any who. By the time I had realized the extent of my actions the night before, all pharmacies in town were shut down and I was unable to get a Plan B.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 12 days now since this occurred. I have become paranoid that I'm pregnant. I know I'm currently too early to take a pregnancy test, so I have nothing to help my stress/to find out whether I am or not. My period should be coming soonish, but I've been stressing about this since the night after. I haven't had any implantation bleeding/cramps so I take that as a good sign?

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fact that I'm a 21 year old, regular periods and had sex the day before ovulation, what are the chances of pregnancy?/What are some good early signs to look out for?

97,"I've been kind of crushing on this person from one of my classes who I've next to these past 3 months. 

The reason why I planned to confess was because I'm graduating, and felt like I would regret never telling them how I truly felt.  (Despite all of the advice I got from one of my friends not to write a letter since my crush and I are at best friendly acquaintances/classmates, and to just ask them to hang out in person, I still wrote the letter as I have anxiety, and wanted to give them time to think of a response)

2 days ago when our 2nd last class ended, I slipped the letter into their hands and quickly walked away without saying a word. 

I had folded it into an origami like envelope, and added tiny jewel stickers to seal the corners in a slightly artistic way with some black tape, as I am a creative/artsy individual person in general. So it looked like an envelope wrapped like a present. 

Also, I lightly sprayed several layers of my signature perfume (Beyonce's Heat Rush) on the cover so that the scent would stay. (I'm a girl btw, lol not sure if this is relevant enough to mention, but yeah)

In the letter I basically stated that I found them cute and liked them, and that I was sorry for playing it too cool. Also, I didn't want to come off as extremely creepy, so I made sure to mention that they don't have to reply in any way if they end up feeling uncomfortable and that I literally won't bother them again, so that it would mean the ball would be in their court. I signed it off with my real name.

Today was the last class, and we had a final exam. I came in late so I didn't have to face the nervousness of having to speak to them about the letter right before our final. 

They were to first person to finish writing it in about 30 minutes, which was pretty fast. My heart sank when the door closed because I assumed they purposely did this to save face and signify that they aren't interested. I kind of expected this as we don't know each other super well. 

10 minutes later I was finished writing mine. 

To my surprise, when I opened the door and turned to my left, they were waiting against the wall near the door. They handed me an envelope with my name and ran off. I peeled off a sticker, and opened up 2 folded papers.

To sum up their letter:

1) They want us to be friends. It was stated twice. 

2) They really want me to ""bother them"" 

3) They really want me to text them and that they are waiting for me to do so, and in the chance that I don't, they might try to first (cause we already have each others' numbers to begin with)

4) They are very patient, and that I can take my time, and it's okay if I never do so if I'm too nervous, so no pressure

5) They wrote their number again in case if I lost it, and signed it with their full name

I just have so many mixed emotions right now. I'm sure I just got friendzoned because I put a lot of heartfelt effort in the letter and they were touched enough to respond, but aren't interested enough in me. 

I've done some googling about being friendzoned, and that the usual generic advice is that if someone says they just want to be friends, it very likely means that they are not attracted to you romantically. 

I wouldn't mind being friends, but I still feel pretty nervous.

We were waitging for good moment to do it but never really had a chance, but now something happend that really concerns me.

So, we were at the party and came back to my dorm pretty late. There was my roommate sleeping with his girl (who got wasted few hours ago btw) and were pretty hard sleeping. We showered and jumped to my bed and you know started some fun. All of the sudden she is naked and trying to put my penis inside her. So, I thought maybe she figured that they (my roommate) won't be waken up by us so wanted to do it. I asked to put on the condom. To which she reply ""Noo, let's go to sleep"". Okey? Fine, I lay down next to her and she is starting to move and again trying to do something, again I ask, again same answer. 

I now forced myself to bathroom in which I write this cause I'm kinda scared deep down that she... She might do something in my sleep. I know, I know it sounds really dumb but I don't know. I felt really odd... and uncomfortably.

What do you think guys? Is it me or there is something I should be really worried about?

100,"I am a 32(m). This week has been what feels like one the worst of my life. 

On Monday, my girlfriend/best friend broke up with me because she felt that she just isn’t at a point in her life where she is ready for a real relationship. We have known each other a year. We have almost everything in common. Always enjoyed each other’s company. She also brought me out of my shell. I started going out to bars with her and playing darts. I would meet new people. Things I’d never done and take no joy in. She increased my confidence like I would never have believed. 

Within 2 months of meeting her, she quickly became my best friend, and we started dating. We dated for 10 months. She is deaf (cochlear implant) so our primary source of contact was text since we both work 2 jobs and phone calls don’t work so well with her implant. We would text each other all the time. I work nights, 7 on and 7 off at our local hospital. She works days. I would stay up later during to day to have time with her in the morning before she went to work and vice-versa. 

The Saturday before, we went out like we always had. Everything seemed perfect, like always. She got drunk, like always. I never minded. She is a cute, fun-loving drunk. She was all over me. Made me promise to never leave her. Told me I was the greatest boyfriend she had ever had, and that she appreciates everything I do for her. 

After I got her home, I carried her up the stairs, laid her on the couch, took off her socks and shoes, and covered her up. I put away her implant and made sure her batteries were on the charger. I kissed her on the forehead. Told her I loved her, and left. She had worked all day that day so I decided to let her rest instead of trying to wake her. (Has I known that was our last night together I would have laid down with her and held her all night. Savored the moment.)

The next day, Sunday, she had to work. I met her before work. Everything was fine. We sat and talked, like always. Then I dropped her off at the door so she could go clock in and I left until lunch time. At lunch time I picked her up, took her to get lunch, we talked, everything was fine. Again, like we do almost every day. 

The day after that, this past Monday, she texted me, “Let’s meet at the park.” I agreed. Monday’s were the only days that she would have off from both jobs (most of the time.) It was normal for us to start our day at the park. I got there first because I live closer than she does. I let her know I was there. She responded “I’m on the way.” I said, “Ok. Be careful.” To which she replied, “We need to talk.” 

I know what that meant. I’ve heard that before. I told her that whatever it is we can work it out. We can talk through it. Any time we had a disagreement, we talked it out. Never in 10 months did we argue. Because we always talked it out. 

She arrived at the park. She could see I had been crying. I was crying because I knew our relationship was coming to a close. I had actually fallen in love with this woman. Not just “I thought I loved her.” No. Real, actual love. 

I stepped out of my car and her first words were, “It’s not you. I promise.” Then she explained how she just wasn’t ready for a relationship. 

I left in a huff.  I couldn’t breath. I almost vomited. I felt my heart break. After I calmed down I called and asked her to meet me again so we could talk. She agreed. I told her I did not want to leave with our relationship ending there in a bad place. 

We met, again at the park, same spot she broke it off. I explained to her that I did not want to end our relationship. She told me it’s just not the right time for her and that she didn’t feel emotionally connected to me anymore. The last couple of months had been stressful bcus there was less time together physically, even thought we talked (in some form) everyday. 

I explained that I respected her decision and that I still love her and want to remain best friends. She agreed. We still text everyday. She cut my hair that following Tuesday, like she normally did. And we have had one FaceTime session.

Remaining her friend is very difficult to do. But to see her happy and doing what she feels is right is enough for me. 

This past Wednesday, I received word that my Uncle had passed away. He suffered a stroke a few years ago and lost all function in her left side. His 90 yep mother (my grand) had been taking care of him. She has lost 3 husbands, 2 children, and 5 grandchildren. I feel more pain for my grandmother than for my uncles children with all that she has lost. 

And to top that off, I stepped out on my porch to leave for work and two red wasps stung me on the head as soon as I stepped out. It’s a good thing I’m not allergic.

108,"Edit: sorry about the messy grammar and wording I'm just stressed out and struggling to focus on things.

Where to start with this one. Well I'm 17 and today I was talking to some of my freshmen friends at school and one of them said look at this girls snapchat story so I did. And that's when it all started. I see their story and it says and I Quote ""What would you guys think if you found out I was pregnant"" Now I read this and instantly had this moment of oh shit their only 14 this is very bad. I go to talk to them and they keep saying I'm not I was just wondering what people would think. I hear this and I kinda buy into it but at the same time act cautiously. well, today I found out that it was for sure true. They were using my phone and when I went to pick it back up I accidentally saw her message strand with a close friend and my fears were realized. She was talking to the friend about needing to get tested. At this moment I kinda acted like I didn't know Until another friend of mine explained their thoughts and they had a feeling that the girl was hiding something as well. after a few days of us talking to this girl normally I could tell they were not being truthful and I confronted them and found out the whole story. Turns out that they cheated on their boyfriend and managed to get pregnant from a 19-year-old guy we had never met. At this moment I knew this was 1000 times more serious then it was at the start of all this. from here we've been trying to comfort her and at least hopefully help her through this and get her to talk to her family. though she's not exactly a very responsible person. they were the kind of person who was failing every class and she knew that she was going downhill. I'm kind of at a standstill now We need to find the right moment to talk to people and get this sorted because the hell she is going through is not fair. Someone of that age shouldn't be doing this kind of thing they shouldn't be having to worry about all this. At the start of the year they were such an energetic person now I see them just hunched over all the time or sleeping or on her phone all day and refusing to socialize with others.

109,I don't really seem to get along with him much and he always is an asshole (pardon my French). He always tries to patronize everyone and make himself seem like the smartest man in the room.

And the worst part is I feel like he runs off on me and makes me that kind of person to other people. Is that bad or am I in the right?,11May2019,1

111,"Hi everyone!  So in the past year, I started skin-picking, like a lot, under my feet. (I think it's probably a ''new way'' my OCD has to show itself since I try not to wash my hands as much anymore... anyways). I don't do it to hurt myself, in fact I really hate it when it hurts. I kinda like the feeling of the skin detatching, it feels like removing an old bandaid that was also somehow too tight, I don't know. Sometimes my foot hurts so much that I have to tip-toe on it because putting weight on it makes it worst. I am afraid of the small wounds I make to become infected, and I want to stop doing it. The problem is that most the time I don't even realise I'm doing it. I'm also worried because, well summer is coming, and I'll be wearing sandals more often, and also go at the beach, and I don't want sand to go into the little wounds too. Does any  of you have some tips to stop skin-picking??",11May2019,1

most people would admire, so I don’t know why everything I do/am interested in is suddenly what she wants to do to. 
I’m going to name the person I’m talking about Riley 

When we first became friends about 4yrs ago it was hardly noticeable things, like having the same habits as me and sense of humor, hence why we became good friends fast. One thing we’ve always had in common is our love for drawing, and after awhile she wouldn’t copy my work but it seemed like every time she made something it had the same concept as my latest art. Obviously there’s nothing wrong with taking inspiration but I have caught her tracing art before and claiming she made it, I’ve never confronted her about it because I figured it wouldn’t make a difference. 

She would also do everything I wanted to do. Even though that’s not such a bad thing to have in a friendship, sometimes she took it to far and it got on my nerves. For example my hair, I’ve always wanted to dye my hair crazy colors and talked to my friends about dying my hair rainbow next weekend. Riley asks what brand/type of dye I’m going to use because she wants to dye her hair to. Skip to a few days later and she shows up in class with dyed rainbow hair, (before I dyed my hair) and it didn’t bother me as much as it shocked me because that shit is expensive. It’s 10$ a bottle for each of the six colors + if your getting it professionally done. I dyed my hair anyways because that’s not going to stop me from doing what I want but this hair situation has happened more than a few times with her.

A few months ago I bought a 27” penny board (skateboard) so I could get around easier. At this point in time I haven’t hung out with Riley for a while (I’m currently homeschooling for a year... so is she) and I couldn’t go out with any friends because they were all at school, so I asked if she wanted to hang out at the park so I could skate. That day she decides she wants a skateboard to, nothing wrong with that it would actually be nice to have a friend to skate with. The point when it crosses the line for me is when she wants the same exact type of helmet, wrist guards (she even asked me the exact size I got), skateboard, and design down to the color of the wheels. I informed her that I think she should explore the options that might suit her better and told her that I think she should get a different design than the one on my board. 
Her skateboard is arriving in a few days and she ended up getting the same exact board as me and a painfully similar design as mine.

I think I might just cut off our friendship but it’s hard to do that when you’ve known someone for so long.",11May2019,2

122,"So here goes. I'm 26 years old. I'm over $16,000 in debt; credit card and student loans. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life. It hits me in waves and I'm currently out at sea. It's hard for me to keep a job and difficult to stay in school. Everything I'm interested in doing, writing, photography, music production, don't necessarily require degrees. The people I admire in these areas were successful without going to school. They're extremely talented whereas I am not. I'm very doubtful that I will achieve anything in pursuing my interests as career paths. 

On the other hand, I'm way over working the typical  jobs allotted to me by the glorious qualification that is a high school diploma. I'm broke, so I don't really have a choice, but I don't know how long my current mindset will let me last in these positions. I had a phone interview for a job recently. I freaked out beforehand because anxiety. Miraculously, it went well, but during the actual job I felt like I was going to break down and cry. It was a trial day. At the end of the day I said I would come back. I got home, had some time to think about it and I changed my mind. I sent the boss an email explaining that I wasn't able to commit.  

I've been struggling with pursuing my interests and trying to get out of my head so I can work like a normal person. I don't get any pleasure doing any of the jobs I've had or will be able to have with just a diploma. I don't want to keep going to school and fall further into debt. My depression sometimes makes it difficult to find joy in the things I actually want to do with my life. It makes me believe that nothing will turn out the way I hope for. My anxiety makes it hard for me to be around people. It makes it difficult to work in the factory jobs that are generally some of the highest paying for people with only diplomas. I don't think I'd qualify for benefits. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt in the past. They put me on meds, I stopped taking them. I feel like I'm in an endless cycle. I don't have any friends to talk to so I came here.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi   guys. This is actually my first ever time posting on reddit so please bear with me. Also sorry if this is too political for this particular subreddit. Like I said I’m new so wasn’t sure where to post this.

I'm also not really looking for a political based discussion at all, just advice on how to navigate this relationship with my mom given this new info.

Some background - I (22F) am currently on a weekend trip with my mom who I   haven’t seen in months. We both live in the state of Georgia. We  planned  this cabin trip to hike and whatnot, and I was really looking  forward  to spending some time with her.

We were on the way to dinner when I brought up the Georgia heartbeat  bill. Many of you have probably heard about the bill. If you haven’t,  it is a bill  recently passed and bans abortion after 6 weeks in the  state of  Georgia. You can even face a decade in jail for trying to go out of state for one.

I brought this  topic to  my mom, thinking that like me, she would be against it. Turns  out she is 100% supportive of it and believes after 6 weeks women  should be forced  to continue a pregnancy.

Body  autonomy  is something I feel very strongly about. I am not usually an  emotional  person but hearing this from her provoked something deep  inside me and  triggered a strong emotional response. We started to  fight and turned  around and went back to the cabin instead of going to  dinner.

I just sat outside for about an hour crying and trying to process this.  Crying because I’m scared  for the future and because now I feel like I  actually don’t know my mom  at all. I also considered leaving and going  back home. And I still am.

Maybe I’m overreacting or maybe I’m not. I have friends and acquaintances who are  similarly conservative and I get along with them just fine.

But something about my own mom looking me in the eye and telling me if I was 7 weeks pregnant I should be FORCED to stay pregnant just crushed  me.

My view of her is completely shattered and I feel betrayed. I don’t know how I can spend the rest of  the weekend with her let alone see her in the same light again.

I  am posting here to seek advice/input from anyone who has gone through something similar and how they approached it. Also I don't want to be awful but i really think i need to go home - so any opinions on that would be appreciated as well. Do i suck it up with her this weekend or leave and take time to process?  I can barely look at her I am so hurt.

tl;dr  On a trip with my mom and found out she supports the new Georgia  abortion law banning it after 6 weeks. Shocked and hurt - not sure how  to cope with this.",11May2019,0
125,"I have to be moved out of my dorm in two days. So, I found an accommodation through a Facebook ad and it was perfect. A girl is renting out her apartment while she is away for an internship. I paid my rent for the new place before the end of April even though I wasn’t actually supposed to be moving in until now (mid-May). 

Fast forward to today, I move in and everything goes smoothly. I go to work. While I was at work, I get a message from the girl who’s apartment I’m renting out with a screenshot of the apartment manager emailing her, calling her out for subleasing her apartment, which, unbeknownst to me, is against their lease agreement. She watched me move in. She tells her that I have to officially apply to live in the apartment (read: pay application fees), get approved, and officially sign a lease if I want to live there. 


So, right now, I am freaking the fuck out because I have no idea what to do. My boxes are sitting in the new place (still packed) and I am at my dorm about to have a panic attack because in two days, I won’t have any living arrangements. 

I know I would get declined to officially live in the apartment because I have “bad credit” because I don’t have credit at all... I haven’t established a credit history yet.

Would it be wrong if me to ask the girl I was planning on subleasing from for my money back? 

Luckily, I just got paid, but this one paycheck isn’t enough to make a rent payment somewhere else. I could probably move somewhere with my money back + my check that I just got. Living with parents isn’t an option and I can’t live with friends either. I make about $1000/a month at my job (part-time), so please keep that in mind. Please also keep in mind that I am 21.

I'm really sick of his crap, He works for family and has it somewhat easy, He goes in two sometimes 4 hours later and was still getting a full check until recently when his family got tired of it and only started paying him for the time he was there, this in return meant he had lighter checks. You would think this would be a indicator to try harder right? WRONG. If anything he got lazier. 

We don't share finances, he won't let me manage the money even though he is very well known for not paying bills and lying about it, Spends his money as fast as he can make it but never seems to have the money for things I or the baby need, It's like pulling teeth to get him to buy diapers. I started to feel the pressure, I was already feeling it before due to some nasty comments he would make about me not working (It's been 2 years) He usually only says them when we're fighting but either way they're hurtful. He claims I'm a leech, that I don't want to work, that I'm okay with sponging off him and I don't even try and come up with every excuse not to get a job. Which pisses me off because while he was off screwing around I took care of him for YEARS, every time he messed up at a new job and got fired I told him it was okay and I'd take care of everything, It got to the point he didn't work for 5 years and I was working two jobs to make enough for bills but anyways..We had another fight two weeks ago and this time it was my breaking point, I was already kind of entertaining the idea of going back to work, had applied to some places, nothing serious or major and he seemed ""supportive"" told me he was so happy, and proud of me blah blah blah. Sounds good right? Nope, all of that was a lie.

&amp;#x200B;

Today one of the potential employers called me Monday asking me to come in for a interview yesterday, It's not really my dream job but I was so excited about potentially getting a job I couldn't contain my excitement. The days leading up to yesterday we're awesome, He claimed he was happy, and that he really hoped I would get the job blah blah blah and yesterday came and I was offered the job pending a background check. Well After the interview, hours later after he had already known about the conditional offer, he freaks out on me.

He tells me I'm never going to be home to see my daughter, that HE has to get up and get her ready before work (my position requires early morning shift like 4-5am while he's supposed to be at work by 8am) told me even though it's part time our daughter will be lucky to see me because I'll be gone in the am, getting off in the afternoon and then going to bed early, that I went out of my way so I would't have to watch our child anymore and that I went out of my way to screw HIM over. I saw red and told him yesterday that I didn't care and he wasn't ruining this for me but the truth is he did.

Now I am no longer happy about and I feel guilty as hell for even wanting to work even thought we could use the extra money. I just don't understand how he could twist something so good and make it seem so bad and like I went out of my way to screw things up.

&amp;#x200B;

In reality I just want to provide for our daughter, I want her to have a better life and be able to do the things she wants without us having to worry about money and so I can be financially independent but he's pushing back so much now.

Not sure what to do but I'm supposed to hear back about the background check next week (which I will pass) and I'm dreading it now because I know another fight and nasty words is going to happen.

133,"Hi guys i really need some help cause my brother is driving me nuts and I wanna just rage out and yeah.

I live with my mom (never met my dad) and my older brother (19) who is racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, antisemitic and ever -phobic there is pretty much.

I also have a younger sibling (11) who is undergoing some therapy related to their gender identity, but as of now it currently appears that they are asexual gender fluid.

My mom is at work most of the time so she leaves my brother as the authority of the house. Especially since she got a second job so she even works at night.

My girlfriend and I just started dating about a month ago. We met at a local trans support group in my area and hit it off pretty well. She is extremely kind and I love her to death and can’t wait to marry her someday! Until then we are saving as much as we can for her gender reassignment surgery that she needs - and then whatever is left for a wedding. She is literally the best thing to ever happen to me.

Back to my brother. He is such a fucking dick I hate him. I know it’s terrible to say, but I think it’s OK to hate people who literally hated you first for merely existing. He is super dedicated and even converted to be catholic recently (we were raised Unitarian Universalist and also my dad before he died was Jewish). My brother has made comments like “trans ppl are mentally ill and deserve to die” and “all f*gs are going to Hell”.

Initially he tried to ban my girlfriend from coming over but my mom overruled him and said that she can come over after school. 

My brother doesn’t like this because he is a bigoted control freak jesus freak self.

So he has been doing this lately to spite me. He puts on Gregorian chant (or whatever you call it where monks all sing songs). He turns this up as loud as he can without the neighbors calling the cops.

As you can imagine this is hell on earth for me and my girlfriend, especially when we are trying to be intimate and all we hear is this crazy religious music that literally gives us both anxiety. Hearing songs about “god” and religion and knowing that those who write and who sing those songs believe that my girlfriend and I are terribly sinners who are going to hell simply for existing.

I’ve complained to my mom and her response is that maybe me and my girlfriend should leave the house when he does it but that’s honestly bullshit because it rains a long where we live and also my girlfriend and I cannot be intimate in public areas for obvious reasons and we can’t spend any money on motels for that because my girlfriend is putting all the savings from her part time towards her reassignment surgery.

I’ve tried almost everything. Including calling the cops on my brother pretending to be neighbors who are angry about his music, but unfortunately the cops refused to do anything because they said that the music wasn’t loud enough to qualify as a noise disturbance and since the music doesn’t contain “conventionally vulgar lyrics”, that there is not much that they can do about it.

Can anyone please help me try to improve the situation? I’m not trying to get my brother to love me as who I am because I realize that will never happen, and he probably has so much pain inside as a result of being such a bible thumping hateful evil prejudiced person that that alone is punishment for him.

I just want him to stop blasting his intimating music which gives me and my girlfriend extreme anxiety, borderline panic inducing, and that’s not right or fair to either of us. :(

BTW I also worry about my younger sibling because of my brother acts this way towards me since I came out as trans last year, I can only imagine how much worse he is going to treat my younger sibling when they get older and especially when they start dating. I actually kinda hope that something and happens to my asshole dick brother... I know it’s wrong but... I have the right to live in peace without fear of my life.",11May2019,0
134,"Okay so originally thought I could handle this on my own, but it’s really getting to me. I am a first year in college and an only child. My parents are my actual world, it’s always just been us and I adore them to death. First semester I came out at Bi and they handled it like champs, especially my dad. All was good. 
Second semester I fell for a friend of a friend. Let’s call him A. I found him extremely attractive and instantly slid into his dms etc. We got along immediately, and started going on dates here and there. He’s extremely thoughtful and makes me laugh constantly. Turns out we’ve shared some similar experiences and therefore that made us even closer. I told my parents about this and they were happy and then I casually mentioned that he was trans. I was bombarded with texts and calls. My mom told me my dad (who is the quietest man who never shows emotion) was physically sick over it. My mom’s work rating went down and they can’t sleep. 
They said they would rather me just bring home a girl they would be fine with that, but this is different. They said he wouldn’t pass, and that the family would ask questions. Which my friends didn’t know he was trans, and honestly $5 to anyone in my family ballsy enough to ask. Anyway my mom told me that I’d lose parts of the family. I said I doubted that, and she told me this family secret about how my grandmother started dating a woman right before my cousin and I were born and nothings ever been the same since, and they ultimately made them break up. This broke my heart, as it was clear they would do whatever it took to be a “normal” family. 
My mom then said that my dad told her his relationship with me would never be the same, even if I do end things with A. Which hurt a lot as my dad and I are super close. This made me feel even less apt to end things though, because if things stay wrong no matter what...then what’s the point of ditching my happiness?
I called a family friend who has known me my whole life, and is gay which gave us a better understanding of each other. He was understanding and said I might just have to hide it, despite how I usually tell my parents everything. 
Later my dad texted that we had to talk. “Now.” I denied cuz school comes first and it’s finals time. We ended up not speaking until I came home for a music festival. I walked into the house and his tone was dead his hug was a side hug and he was practically avoiding me. The house seemed suffocating, so I left to go see my mom and the family friend I talked to. They had been chatting about the issue, which I felt would be good. My mom left us to talk irl and our friend was again super understanding. 
That night before bed, with my mom being the middle man and my dad being distant I asked if we were gonna talk about it, or if I should go to bed.
My dad went off. Using wrong pronouns saying he talked to his lesbian co worker and that A is clearly sick in the head and that even she doesn’t understand. Then my mom did the same, except it was the family friend agreeing with that, so I guess in a sense I got played. So here they are so mad at me, wishing they never sent me away to college etc. 
I went to my room and cried and my mom came up to comfort me and I told her A and I are officially dating. She’s kept secrets before that were big, but the next day dad knew. She said I seemed to be wanted to immerse myself into the LGBTQ+ community and was just dating him to do so. And that they made life too easy for me and I was clearly going through my first rebellious stage. 
I finally went off and told her that though I appreciate everything they’ve done for me—private school new car etc—I didn’t ask for any of it. They gave it to me and I’m thankful, but this is the only thing I’ve really asked for. Dad refuses to meet him ever.
So here I am now. Staying over at A’s a ton. So happy until I remember my bliss is making my parents suffer. Then feeling guilty. 
The other day A looked into my eyes and asked if they’d come around. Before I would have said yes, but I have hardly talked to my parents despite how we used to call daily. I told him I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to lie to him, but maybe if I act like nothings changed they will just have to come around.
It worries A that I’m gonna get really hurt from this, especially since I’ve never had to deal with homophobia or anything like that, and that he’s worried I’m being thrown into something that’ll hurt me. 
The family friend, before I realized that he wasn’t on my side, asked me if it was worth it. I haven’t known A long, but I know I feel safe and happy with him. I don’t see why my parents love should have conditions even if they think they are trying to protect me. And if it’s still going to be bad even if I leave A, why would I leave one of the best things I’ve found to be super miserable on all ends? But I need advice
My parents said if I have a kid I’d understand. Any adults have their 2 cents? And will my parents ever come around? I’m not leaving A, but I don’t know how to navigate this without feeling like a horrible daughter...",11May2019,2

Have none. I had a boyfriend freshman year of college, that ended and then about a year later I had another serious relationship. This one has just ended and now that I’m older I just want to take a few years break from dating. I feel as though I’ve forgotten how to make friends. I’m cordial, I know how to socialize and make people laugh and whatever but as far as forming a friendship I am lost. Having a boyfriend for so long who was basically my only friend for years has really affected my social skills and now I just feel awkward the second and third time I meet people. 
For instance, I’ll meet someone, hit it off everything goes smoothly but then the second and third time I see them I just have nothing to say. Like I cannot for the life of me think of anything to say and I feel awkward. Mostly it’s with girls (I’m a girl). I always found it really hard to make friends with girls... is that just me? 
Like once I meet them, do I text them and ask to meet up? Do I ask about their dog? Lol like I feel like a child. How do I be a good friend and actually foster relationships and keep them? Something beyond acquaintances bc that’s all I’ve had for so long and I really want something new.

137,"Idk what kind of advice I'm expecting here. I've worked in the construction industry for years now. For a while now I've been wanting to move out of state, I did it before and actually had some success. Moved back home and had some tough jobs here. 

Experience: I've been painting houses for a total of five years. One of those years I worked for this redneck old man who made it his personal mission to make my job miserable even though I never missed a day and worked more hours than everyone else in the company and still got a bunch of crap every day. One day he really pissed me off and I just walked off the job. I had no choice, I dealt with so much crap from the guy I actually have high blood pressure now and I'm only thirty. Now I just don't want to work for anyone around here because he is good buddies with all the other paint bosses around here, and he did tell me once that he would make sure I never got another job painting houses cause he would tell them I'm a worthless painter. I pick up random jobs to get some cash for food so my mom doesn't have to give me money so the time.


Family: I wish I wasn't complaining so much but my mom works alot. My brother lives here too and he's almost forty and I've been feeding him about 90 percent of the time the past about four years. We're always here together and he just hovers around alot and has chances to work but it just for some reason never happens. I have the feeling that he just knows that food will be there every night. He's a smart guy just always in the mode of telling us, you should, we should, why, all this stuff. Like I said I have high blood pressure or something and I just shut down like I can't handle it.


Job Opportunity: In the state I was planning on moving to I sent some resume type stuff to some companies who were looking for paint sub contractors. They saw my website and pictures of my work and one company wants me to sub for them. Keep in mind this is their first reply since I responded to their Craigslist ad a month ago. It's pays really well. They even offered to help me out financially for the first few jobs. I have the opportunity to actually start making a decent living again after a while. The only thing is it's a big risk to take. Plus I gotta leave my family behind and start all over again. I don't know what gonna happen with my family my brother hasn't had much success in his life and he gets extremely depressed over it, it could be worse if I leave. My mom is a great person and I want to help her but I won't be able to make a living here. I'll basically just be disappearing idk.",11May2019,1

So I’m home for the summer, and my parents are famous for their horrifically bad internet. My brothers still live with them and have to deal with it and have since learned to live with it. I have tried countless times to tell them it’s awful (if only covers 1/4 of the house and the speed is 1 Mb download speed). 

They say it works fine “until I’m home”. How do I convince them that this is a legitimate problem? I do summer school and the pages take 1-2 minutes to load and the WiFi goes out constantly. Not sure what to do to convince them, they’ve told me to get it sorted myself but they don’t want to upgrade whatsoever.

141,"  First let me tell you why I think what I do.


 I'm awful at socialising, I have 0 friends/acquaintances and whenever someone talks to me I stutter a ton.


  Whenever anyone confronts me I can't speak


  At school presentations I can do them but I end up shaking and stuttering a ton (although sometimes I get through them fine) 


  I forget basic things like to brush teeth/shower


    I lose focus a lot, when I think of not losing focus I focus on my thoughts of not losing focus and not what I want to focus on


  I'm very fidgety, I like tapping my feet and moving my hands a ton


  I'm pretty sure because of these reasons I have something going on, but I'm wondering what do I do if something is going on? Like if I get it professionally checked and it turns out I do have autism or something is there any way things get better for me? Is there any way for me to get myself checked without my father's involvement (he's anti vax, and doesn't believe in a lot of doctor stuff)",11May2019,1
142,"I don't know what I want or what to do. Ever since I had a really break up a few years back, I have been really off socially. I was a little controlling and needy in the relationship which I never knew was a side of me that I had, and so I completely shut off to everyone so I could learn more about myself and heal without hurting anyone else. Well, now, I'm much better, but socially I'm inept because I've lost that fake face we all put on so others can like us. I just feel stupid doing some elaborate facial expressions and fancy words just to get people to like me because I've learned to like myself. The downside of that is that I am now very unlikeable to the point where I can't even make friends. And I'm very confused about whether or not I'm asexual too. Because I'll occasionally want to have intimate moments with boys in a cute way, but then I just find the idea of trying to prove myself to someone to get to the kissing exhausting. And most guys I get to know just want to ignore the cute side of a relationship and have sex which just butchers my idea of romance and turns me off honestly. So, what should I do? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",11May2019,1

146,"So where do i start from?...
There was a girl back in high school... 3rd year..
She is actually the twin sister of one of my best friends and i always knew he had a sister but i never really got to know her more.

I was always an introvert until the 3rd year of high school... because that's where i met my now best friends including that guy.
We started going out cafe/clubs kinda and she would come with a girlfriend of hers some times.
I started to get to know her better and she also became a friend of mine.

So first of all, i knew she liked me (i think) because of the body language and the way she was looking at me. I could tell, i can tell when someone feels something when they're near me, i work with instinct most of the time in general.
So i was lile wtf no she is a friend of mine and my buddy's sister i can't do anything wtf...

And sometimes i would ask him for fun ""hey dude if i was with your sister what would you say?"" And he was chill about it ""it's her life who am i to get involved she does what she wants""
But i was still seeing her as a friend 

Now 2-3ish years later after we were chatting for so long i slowly started getting attracted to her and i had a crush... i can't explain my feelings really.
I pranked her once(over text) telling her that i am in love with her and she would laugh and tell me please talk seriously and i would take it so far that i made her believe and then i told her it was a prank... such a mistake my god... i so regret telling her that it was a prank but i was scared for some reason to just let it through...

When i pranked her for this she was in germany and she still is for university.. and she is coming this summer back in town..
Here comes the main story:
About 2 months earlier i was talking to a girl and i let her know asking her for advice etc.. as i said i work with instinct and i knew something wasn't going in the right direction with that other girl i was talking to.. she told me the same thing immediately firstly because she likes me as i said and secondly because she also knew..

Although, the same time she told me that she was also talking with a guy and she asked me for advice because she told her for fun that he hooked with another girl while talking to her.. and i told her leave him because he doesn't seem trustworthy she said ""maybe you're right"" and afterwards she told me that she kissed him once.. oh man i felt the the ground collapsing. I tried to stay calm but i was so jealous because i couldn't do anything since she is abroad..

This guy is a brazilian dude who also studies in germany and he is in the same class as her.
At the end of the day that girl i was talking to, told me it won't work and we should stop talking.
1 month later... she told me that she had sex with him not once but twice.. i felt my soul leaving my body.. 

First of all she was a virgin and that's also another thing that made me attracted to her because i am also a virgin and i thought we were meant to be together and at some point that it would happen.

Now i feel like an idiot because i didn't tell her for 
real and i don't know what to do because she told me that when she comes back forever she won't meet again with that guy they're not and never were in a relationship and i feel so sad...
Because she lost her virginity to someone random she knew for a couple of months in a foreign country!..

It's not because she got jealous of me talking to that other girl because she told me they had sex a long time ago before she even told me about him and one more time recently..
I am really confused guys and i don't really know what to do even my instinct is frustrated and i can't think correctly... 

The thing is i was waiting for her 3 more damn months until she comes and i would tell her everything in person...
But know i feel like backing off and don't wanna talk to her that much.. i don't know i feel betrayed i really don't know what to do guys..

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and excuse my poor structure of this post because to be honest that's the thing that worries me the most at this moment.

I cant do typical work due to health problems, but I'd really love to be able to do delivery work (like ubereats), using a scooter/bike, it's relatively easy physically, you can choose your own hours, and it could make me enough for what I need (I'm not trying to say apps like ubereats are good, they're really horrible to their delivery people and I hate that anyone needs to do this stuff to survive)

The larger way it affects me is with my partner of 1 year. I've definitely gotten better, but sometimes when my partner says or does something I dislike, I blow things out of proportion. When we try to call to talk things out, I come off as condescending and do so much accusing. I'll try to argue against what they say and in the meantime I might say some hurtful things. I'm usually slightly aware of what I'm doing while it's happening, but part of me tells me to keep my anger going until everything is resolved by an overflow of emotion leading to a happy resolution between the two of us. Sometimes this doesn't happen though. Either way, once I've properly calmed down, I always regret it so much and feel like a horrible partner and person. I wanna make it up to my partner, but I always just wish I hadn't acted the way I did. 

Any advice for avoiding these situations and convincing myself to stop after realizing what I'm doing?

152,"Please do not be afraid of being harsh!

So, there is this girl who I have had a crush on for like maybe 4ish months, we are friends, but not super close friends as I really only talk to her in math, but we are still definitely friends and I would *at least* like to keep her as a friend if possible.

I never had a problem talking to her, ya know the standard saying hi in the hallway or occasionally talking at lunch or in class, but then we took a school trip to China, where we kind of became closer as friends.

So the point I am trying to make is that when we were in Shanghai, a couple of us decided we wanted to get drunk (drinking age in China is 18 so it was legal), so I decided to get wasted on Rice Wine and Rum. As I am getting wasted she walks in, to take care of us and stuff because ya know a bunch of drunk teenagers. And as I was drunk I straight up told her I had a crush on her. 

This was all kind of a blur, I do remember telling her, but everything after this point comes from second-hand accounts because I don't exactly remember what had happened. One of my friends who was not drunk, said my crush looked extremely uncomfortable, even to the point of horrified. After this, she left. For like a week, we mutually avoided each other because it was awkward. Even now though, we have not had a real conversation. I do think it is important to note that she asked one of my closest friends if I was ok during the week we were kind of avoiding each other. And through the whole thing, she has been friendly, as if she wanted to forget that it ever happened.

I am going to graduate high school soon (in about 1 month), in other words, I could literally never see her again and we could leave it at that, or I could try to talk to her, but honestly every time I see her I get so embarrassed about what happened I feel my cheeks flush and don't know what to say.",11May2019,1

My best friend is getting married and I am the best man....problem is I dont agree with who he is marrying (neither do most of the other groomsman). My buddy has thought about calling off the wedding twice himself and has had to consult myself and the other groomsman for advice. He has gone from it's done to it's back on twice already and now its moving forward. The fiance is recovering from an addiction and wants him to abstain even though he doesnt have an issue. She has been controlling in other ways as well. That is the least of the problems. My friend was in a long term relationship (4 or 5 years) before this one and then within maybe 6 months jumped into who he is marrying now. They have been together about a year and they dont live together. Another thing is none of the groomsman even know who she is really (this isnt as big of a deal).

I was talking with one of the people about our lives and my drunk self somehow led to a conversation about relatives. I then got emotional when I started talking about my grandparents whom most of them are gone. The man I was talking to gave me emotional support and offered other friends a moment of silence. The friend that I am talking about did not care at all and I saw him texting during that moment. He then talked about how everyone else is a 'poser' and that he will take me to where my relatives are one day (which is unrealistic). He did not offer any condolences and just blamed others for providing me support. I had to leave the party early because of that. The morning after, he texted me that he blamed the drinks, and did not remember what happened. He did not remember the disrespect he's shown the night before. Now he's saying that it was not such a big deal. 
Now I don't know what to do with our friendship. I tend to take everything personally, so right now I just do not want to speak with him. I don't know if I can give my respect back if he can't give me respect for my family. We were good friends for about a year now, but I do not know if I can continue. What should I do? Is this something I need to fix or are we better off on our own?",11May2019,2
168,"If you were to ask me if I was in an abusive relationship I would quickly say no.  that's the thing.  its sneaky. as I'm typing this I still feel like im being dramatic.  but im not.  or at least im not from what my family says, from what facebook post strangers post that I read, they say im completely correct to think this is abusive. thats the thing growing up you see abusive relationships as something off a life time movie.  something with a clear villain.  thats not the case.  a lot of the time I feel like the villain.

its been three years.  we have a two ear old.  I have given everything I have to make it work.  I've made excuse after excuse for his behavior and for his reactions. and thats where it gets dangerous.  thats where empathy becomes self destructive.  he was badly abused as a child so ive tried to protect him. ive let things slide that I shouldn't have. ive known in my heart things aren't as they should be and ive said but its because I did this or it isn't his fault.  at thats true.  a lot of this isn't his fault. however, its not my cross to bear either. he has deamons, but I have to break the cycle. for my son and for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

it starts off small and there is always an excuse. then bigger and bigger things happen and when he can't come up with an excuse is an all out apology.  with presents and coffee in bed and groveling.  then its good for a while....till it isn't again.  you Neve know what will set him off.   

&amp;#x200B;

ive thought I was crazy.  ive thought was dramatic. Ive told a handful of close people I was scared I would end up on the front page of the news. but then I talked myself down and told myself im being embarrassing being as dramatic as all that.  he has hit me before. he tackled me to the ground.  but it wasn't his fault he was on new anti depressants and got too drunk and I asked for it. I enticed him into it by saying negative things.  I bought that.  I should have left then. 

tonight he told me over and over he would never hurt ""our son"" (I put that in parenthesis because the way he said it was insinuating he would hurt me). he said it over and over and over.  he then brought a phone cord in, wrapped it around both fists twice and held it taut like he was going to strangle me. his eyes were dead.  he finally quit and said I was redicuouls to come to that conclusion from those actions. he told me I was crazy.  he then demanded I put on these crotchless panties he bought me (for mothers day??? wtf). I refused and told him to go sleep on the couch.  later he admitted that he was insinuating that he would strangle me.  and I flashed back to when we first started dating and he held a butcher knife at me and then convinced me I was rediculous for thinking it was violent and scary.

anyways he closes on a house he bought in my dads neighborhood next week.  he says he bought it for me and admitted it was to make sure I stay.

So there's this online friend I have been talking to regularly for the past year. She's very active on Reddit, usually posting everyday. She hasn't posted in a month though and I'm pretty worried. She has taken a break from Reddit before but she let me know she was taking a break that time. I'm worried because she mentioned before she has a chronic illness. Not sure what it was specifically but she has told me she could end up in the hospital without warning. 

I have only talked to her on Reddit and don't have any more contact information for her. So it's really hard to know whether she's alright or not. She did get locked out of her old account, but if that happened again with her new one I would think I would have gotten a message from her like last time.

About 2 years ago I (21m) was sort of seeing someone (22f), by which I meant we got drunk every once in a while and made out

This particular night we got very drunk and went to a mutual friends place after and slept on the couch.

I was pretty exhausted and drunk and sleepy, I remember her climbing on top of me and fiddling with my jeans, I remember saying “huh?” Because I didn’t know what she was doing.

She said “we’re having sex” and then within 3 or so seconds my dick was out and she was on it.

I drunkenly went with it for like 5 seconds and then I was like “nah I don’t wanna do this” pushes her off of me and went to sleep.

I honestly don’t know what to class this as? I had pretty much forgotten about it until I saw a glance of her the other night when I was out.

If this doesn’t fit too well here, can you point me to a subreddit that it will?

Anyhow, onto the details.

December 17th, my dear cat Katie was murdered by my mother’s dog.

I’ve been grieving the loss ever since, and the emotions are as strong as ever.

Well, my mother and sister treat me rather poorly about it.

My sister has told me quite a few times to ""grieve in silence because it annoys her."" or ""it’s been a few months, get over it already"".

I raised Katie from a kitten, I saved her from getting killed by the same dog.

I stayed home instead of going on vacation to take care of Katie and her son Bertolt, she had just gotten stitches due to an emergancy c-section and spaying.

This dog killed the first Bert, and all but two of Katie’s siblings.

She has a history of killing cats, and I keep telling my mother.

Just earlier, I cried about Katie. My mom told me to ""cut it out"" and that it was ""everyone’s fault that she died"".

My mother gave her two dogs away to a friend for a bit, and I was crying about Katie in my room.

She told me that ""I lost one animal, and that she lost two"". 

Those dogs dug Katie’s body up twice after I had planted some flowers around her grave.

These are the same people who claim to have loved Katie, but only talk about how expensive she was.

My sister scorns me because she had to bury Katie, and I didn’t.

My mom is threatening to get rid of Katie’s grandson Gilbert, and she treats Bert like he’s nothing.

I feel so alone in this world without Katie, and I am absolutely heartbroken.

I would move out, but I am only sixteen.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I have little to no options at this point.",11May2019,22

This may sound like a really random and stupid question but what do I do?

My sister is diagnosed with autism so it's very hard for us to teach her to blow her nose so she just keeps snorting it back up.

This has been happening for a week now and her nose is starting to bleed because the strength she snorts is intense. She enters a meltdown and panics about the bloody nose.

I thought of a temporary solution but it may make the bleeding worse. I've thought of making her artificially sneeze with some Pepper but I'm concerned this may worsen her situation.

Should we just bring her to the doctor? Proper medication would probably help her a lot but I don't know what to do.

Anyhow, my question is how do you let go?

and this isn't just about someone, this is also about negative thoughts and beating yourself up about mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to be self-aware probably hyper self-aware which causes me to take blame for everything. In addition, I beat myself up too. I feel that I did this in my previous relationship as well. I know for certain it's important to realize mistakes but not beat yourself up over them.. sadly I can't seem to remember it for myself.

In addition, at the end of that relationship, this guy ignored me.. (as a way to get back at me probably bc it's usually what he did) and so I punched him with my words. No, I didn't curse him out but I said he didn't deserve me.. I said he deserved nothing lol. 

I hate being angry but I was when i wrote that message. I don't know if he saw it or ignored me or blocked me but either way it's over. I feel remorseful really I know it was harsh.. but when you spend your time walking on eggshells and apologizing all the time I guess it gets to you.

However, I'm unable to let him go. I don't necessarily look him up on social media but I'm tempted to. In addition, I think about how he's probably with someone else. I am unable to get over that and I certainly don't want to be with anyone else for a long time so a rebound or getting out there isn't an option.

This is taking place somewhere in Kansas, within the hotel industry if that helps anyone.

Just wanted to give an update on what happened to that employee. Which is nothing, absolutely nothing. A few days after posting the original post I go into work. The problematic employee (PE) demands that we have a meeting right then and there. They demand to still be on the clock when said meeting is happening, I deny them that request. They then call the GM and literally scream at him over the phone, I am completely shocked. But in the end PE clocks out and we proceed to have this meeting. Basically in a nut shell we start having a screaming contest with each other in the GM office and PE threatens to walk off the job and quit, which I encourage because this is what I want to begin with. We come to a more calm conclusion without really solving anything but at least we aren't screaming. PE apologizes and asks for her job back, I neither confirm nor deny her request just inform her that I would think on it. The following day I come back to work set on terminating her. Notified my superior, even though it wasn't needed, because I knew he was close to her. And was completely denied the ability to terminate her, even though I have full control over the rest of the staff.

So I move on and suck it up, tensions in the office keep rising and now PE has gone and spilled the beans on why I am the worst person alive to everyone in the office. Granted that isn't many people, but two of them were somewhat friends of mine and told me about it.

A few weeks after I get a glimpse of why I cannot terminate her. I see my GM casually embrace PE....by the hips. He grabs her hips and gently directs her into a different direction and whispers something into her ear. I see this, realize what has probably been going on the whole time since GM's new divorce and decide that for my sake I would ignore it. A month after that my new hire sees PE casually brush her fingers through GM's hair while I wasn't around. New Hire freaks out and tells me about it, meanwhile PE isn't being very nice to New Hire so New Hire puts in an HR call, nothing happens. I come in a few days later to cover one of PE's shifts since I am trying to ""calm the waters"" between us. My head of housekeeping comes up and says that GM most likely wont be here today. I ask why and they reply with because PE isn't here, when PE isn't here GM normally isn't here. I am starting to get this sinking feeling, my maintenance guy comes in and says something very similar only worded differently. He says that since PE and GM are ""together"" that one is never here without the other. That's it, I have had enough with my suspicions, I put in an HR call. HR comes down from corporate the very next day and conducts an interview with some of the staff. Conclusion? There is nothing going on , even though there are multiple witness accounts of otherwise. What happens instead? We all have a meeting where HQ tells me I need to get over some of my issues and adhere to all of PE's problems with me. This includes putting a new master key to the whole building included the GM office, where employee files are kept, putting my hours on the schedule even though I am a manager, and in order for PE to keep her extremely high pay rate ($15/hourly it should be $12 or $13/ hourly) she is now the ""lead"" of the team. Except for the fact she doesn't have any other clearance or extra duties she must do, in fact I have even more to lift her burdens of her base level job.

So now I am convinced PE and GM are having sex even though PE and I are GM's kids age but am what seems like stonewalled from doing anything. Even more recently GM has approved of PE getting many hours of overtime every week, at her $15/hourly. At this point she is making more than me and the rest of the staff are wondering why they aren't allowed for clearance for overtime but she is. I send an email to GM about PE getting too much overtime in order to get a ""paper trail"" started of my concerns so that when my staff inevitably puts in another HR call it will show that I at least brought it up to my superior and that nothing happened.

I am extremely frustrated with the situation I am put in. Is there anything I can do from here, I want her gone but no longer know what I can do to make that happen. I refuse to leave since this is the highest paying job in the area and would have to get a second job in order to pay my rent, which obviously I would like to avoid.

More specifically, how do I go about firing an employee who knows the head of HR on a somewhat personal basis and who I suspect is having sex with my GM? Is there some law I can whip out as my trump card in case my GM confronts me about it when I do inevitably try to terminate her?",11May2019,1

I miss her more than she could possibly imagine and I feel pathetic. We broke up late August just before our anniversary and I still haven’t gotten over it. You’d think after all this time I’d have moved on but I still haven’t and it’s self destructive. While we were together I lost all my friends and the few I have now don’t care about my ranting which is fair but having no one to talk to is becoming impossible to bear,11May2019,1
200,"So my and my boyfriend broke up, and this girl came about and my ex and her started to like each other. Now my ex still likes me and I like him too (we broke up for reasons like he was being made fun of). This girl, I talked to her she’s extremely nice, we got into a fight because she said I was stealing my ex from her. My ex said some things like calling other girls hot and stuff and thick when we were dating so I just let her know. She’s suicidal and does self harm so I feared telling her but I wanted to save her as much as I could from being hurt in the future. She said she had to go and sent me a Tik tok of a crying person and I’m really scared and fearing she hurt herself or is contemplating a second suicide attempt, and that if she dies is my fault. I can’t live with the thought of guilt I have just caused the death of another human. I didn’t tell her out of selfishness. I truly wanted to protect her.",11May2019,0
201,"Hi. I think I am getting ghosted, just wanted confirmations/ thoughts. So I (23F) am/was seeing a 35 year old man. We met through friends so we hung out a few times with a group and one day we had dinner one on one and he told me that he is interested to see if we can have a future. Since then we texted a bit, he was never much of a texter maybe 2 or 3 short convos a week. Sometimes I start the convo/ double text. A couple weeks ago he went on a business trip and did not text me for almost 6 days. I didn’t say anything just my dangling text dangling and he texted apologizing about it. He said he was dealing with extreme work things. I then asked him if he wanted to hang out one night and he said he couldn’t and then asked to hang out the next day which we did. That day consisted of a nice dinner, a lot of him holding my hand, and us hooking up for the first time. It was also the last time I saw him in a couple weeks since he is currently on another business trip and has been for the past few weeks. My problem is that I haven’t heard from him in a while now, 10 days to be exact. I’m afraid he is going to ghost. The only thing giving me hope is that he had mentioned that he sometimes doesn’t want to text at all (anyone not just me) because he feels it takes away from real life experiences and he is still traveling. But 10 days is a long time is it not? What are your thoughts? And I don’t want to text him because I would like to see if he is actually ghosting. Wow that is a large block of text I’m sorry lol. If you got here, thank you. If you answer, thank you thank you. Xoxo",11May2019,1

—Hey.. I can’t see this and not say anything :( I care about you and your well being, and I consider you a friend even if you don’t! I’m bad at communicating most of the time, but I always enjoy talking to you even if I don’t say much. I’m just bad at texting. But I do think you’re my friend even if we’re not close and don’t talk often. And I’m sure people in real life care about you and enjoy being around you, too. You‘re a really cool person after all!

207,"So I made a post about this a while back when it was bothering me, but the situation has now drastically changed and different stuff is getting me down, of course there's a huge mix of family stuff, academics, and other things involved in me being horribly down lately, but I do think this is one of the bigger factors. Backstory: I'm home-schooled (14 M) and I moved to a new town roughly October 2017 (I think, it was around that time.) this town is known for having a pretty active home-schooled community, and that's partly why we moved here, lot's of opportunities for professionally taught classes. so once we got settled in town, I signed up for a speech class, and a drama class taught by the same person. There I met this girl, lets call her Jenny, she was rly chill and we got along pretty well, she invited me to a group chat that her and alot of other home-schoolers are in, including most of her closest friends. at some point I developed a crush on Jenny and tbh it was a pretty big crush, but for the time being I was chill waiting it out since she was going through some crap at the time and didn't need that on her plate. Over the course of a few months me and her got rly close platonically, and she kinda sorta invited me into her friend group where I met pretty much every friend I have now. It's probably one of the best things to happen to me in a long time, whole friend group (AKA the squad) is super cool and chill. They are all nice, not fake, genuinely care about each other, and overall just amazing people. I got really close with a couple of them too, let's call them Hannah and Jess, Jess is an exchange student from Spain living with Hannah, and I became basically best friends with Hannah, Jess, and Jenny. and then the rest of the ""sqaud"" is slowly becoming closer with me aswell, and I love them all. my feelings for Jess grew to be more than just a crush, I cared for her more than I have ever cared about someone who wan't family, and I talked to Hannah about it, and she convinced me to confess. I did, and the feelings were mutual, we both felt the same way, and wanted a relationship. we had plans to present the idea of a relationship between us to her parents in roughly a month from then, (her parents from what we gathered are against relationships, so we wanted to get them to like me first.). that same night, I got home with a text from her dad, it was a group text to my parents aswell. apparently the overprotective father heard she was friends with a boy, and wanted to immediately shut down the idea of a relationship, he stated, and I quote, ""We view dating as a tool to choose a mate, and your son nor our daughter can make those decisions for themselves at this age."" among other things. we were both really bummed out and decided to do our best to stay friends. that lasted a couple weeks, and we were both incredibly depressed, we then decided to go into a minor relationship, handholding, pet names, nothing much more, all in a group setting with the people we trust. and keep it under the radar, and very very controlled. this worked for about a week, we held hands a few times during church worship, and at the mall, and a party. we went to a mock prom made by some homeschoolers and her mom chaperoned, obviously we didn't acknowledge the relationship while there. but her mom overheard me make a mildly inappropriate joke, in a group setting where everyone was playing along with it. She later messaged my mother and said I was ""Objectifying women."" which I was not, I even checked up with everyone at the party, and asked if I was at all out of line, not one person said they thought I was, and they all thought I was just fine. So we told her we would handle the situation, and thought that at best things would just be a little rough for a bit then go back to normal. We were mistaken, we soon found out that her mom was asking other parents if I would be at an event before allowing Jenny to go. Saying she didn't want her daughter around someone who makes inappropriate comments such as the one she overheard (listened for). btw I know for a fact she has heard worse from other kids that she allows Jenny to be around. anyway, me and Jenny decided with this happening, it was best to suspend the relationship, at the very least temporarily, possibly for good, in order to keep our friendship safe. we are currently doing this, and we have been able to hang out at the mall today, though I'm not sure if Jenny's mom knew I would be there. We watched Endgame (great movie btw) and during the movie, Jenny took my hand during one of the more emotional parts, she is very attached to marvel and takes it all deeply. she did this with the other person next to her too, not a huge deal or anything. but afterwards she kept my hand once she let go of the other one. I mean I held hers too, don't get me wrong, it was mutual handholding lol. just like, ok so we plan on having a discussion of when a good time to bring the relationship back would be on Wednesday at church. but I'm having trouble with something, I really really want a relationship with her, more than almost anything, I care for her a stupidly large amount. and it kills me to not be able to be with her, I've been down for weeks now, but this week has been ROUGH. I'm not really eating, not sleeping, failing classes. stuff like that, like I said it's a mix of things but this is really where my mind goes when I'm upset. I just can't decide if a relationship with her will turn out badly, if it's worth risking the friendship, holding hands with her puts my mind at ease, it's calming, and I never want it to stop (god I sound dumb). but I just don't know if I want to put a friendship as close as hers at risk, but at the same time, it hurts to only be friends, we care for each other so much, and we don't want to lose each other, but at the same time we want to give each other the comfort of that closeness, it really helps us both. not only that, but if I lose her, I will most likely lose the rest of the friend group too, and I love them all too much to deal with that, I don't know how I would cope with losing the best thing I have ever had, I've never had real friends before and they mean the world to me. I can give more info if needed, I think I included it all, might make some edit's idk. 
oh and Hannah and Jess both went to spain for 3 months right after the mock prom. that was two weeks ago

TL;DR: met a girl, got a crush, she introduced me to all the friends I have, friends are the best things in the world to me, crush turned into legitimate feelings, confessed, crush liked me back, we wanted a relationship, parents noped the hell out of that, did a little bit of a secret relationship, parents seek out reasons to not let her be around me. we decided to halt the relationship. I'm scared af that I'm gonna lose her and all my friends. can't think straight, can't decide if me and her should eventually resume the relationship or not. 

any help is appreciated, sorry for the long post, hopefully reddit can help me, I'm legit not okay this last week",11May2019,2
209,"So a little background. My girlfriend used to live with her ex in a basement suite. Things didn't go well between them, he ended up moving out, and she found an older lady online to move in to help with rent. 

Things usually are fine as my girlfriend keeps to herself, and when she's home she doesn't leave the room much. Her roommate has always taken up more of the shared space, but my gf doesn't have much stuff in the house so she doesn't mind being leniant. Other than some disagreements with the damage deposit (roommate never paid her half) and issues with her roomie smoking in the house, they seem to at least tolerate living together. 

Fast forward to about 2 or 3 weeks ago. Roommate has a friend over who is sleeping on the couch. Girlfriend gets no heads up roomie is bringing a guest over, nor how long they're going to be staying there. She just shows up. When she asked this mystery person what she was doing in her house, she said she was just visiting / crashing for the next little bit while she was looking for an apartment, and she wouldn't be there very long. 

It's been pushing 3 weeks since then now and she's still there. She doesn't leave their living room, even when the roommate isn't home. My girlfriend has barely even seen her roommate since this started and she is very uncomfortable with somebody sleeping in her living space / kitchen because it is a basement suite. Any advice on what she can do to get rid of this person? She's going to contact her landlord but he hasn't been much help in the past, and has usually taken the other roommates side when it comes to disagreements. I just want my girlfriend to be able to feel at home again. 

Tl:dr. My girlfriends roommate has had somebody crashing in her living room for almost two weeks, and she is unsure of what to do.",11May2019,1
210,"I want to preface this by saying that I love my girlfriend very much and we have been dating for about 6 years (Sophmores in high school). 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is a biology major at a small state school in California and is intending to go to med school following graduation. However, the problem is that she has not been doing too hot in school. She has failed a couple of classes and has a GPA below 3.0. Her MCAT score is not amazing below 490. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has always been her dream to go to med school and I have always been very supportive of that, but statistically her chances of getting in aren't great. I think she understands that as well and has elected to take a gap year, where she plans to take a master program. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do everything I can to help her, but I feel she is wasting her life attempting to get into med school, which may not be a real possibility. I was wondering how do I have this discussion with her. I tried discussing with her about having back up options but she blew me off. Am I just being asshole? Should I continue to be supportive? I just want the best for her.",11May2019,1
211,"So at work there is a woman a few years older than I (I being a 31/m). She's very outgoing with everyone, and kinda flirty, but is a self described prude. She hugs like literally EVERYONE. Except me, I've got a few here and there but the people around me usually get them daily. Just to be clear, I'm not complaining about getting not getting hugs. I'm not really into hugging or touching people I'm not blood related to or intimate with, it just struck me as odd once I noticed it. There are a few other things she's said/done that lead me to believe this.

She's said that she appreciates my company (this is a few month old quote so I don't quite trust my memories).

She finds my Tourettes adorable. I have coprolaila so I tend to swear, a lot, especially on the shift I work with her as I'm super tiered by that point. She said thats what she finds most adorable.

There are a couple other small things I can't quite think of at the moment, mannerisms maybe?

212,So I’m a bisexual female and I was on Amino when a girl messaged me. Then I started getting strange she asked for a picture so I reluctantly gave her one in was just a picture of my face she says I’m cute and then persists to video chat and I’m hanging out with family so I say no then she asks for more pictures I say no and tell her I’m uncomfortable and say bye. Then she says she wants me and needs me so I told her I was not interested then she said she may do something to herself. After that I say bye block her and delete the conversation I have screenshots and I contacted the leader of that amino.

213,"I've been living with my grandma for a few years now and she won't let me go anywhere, when I ask to go to a friend's house (just around the corner) she either says no, or tells me ""ok but be back in an hour"". I feel like I don't have enough time to socialize or do anything with such a small amount of time (this is bad for me because I'm a very shy, introverted person and have anxiety). All the other kids (who are way younger than me) get to go wherever they want for the entire day and don't even need to play 50 questions before they go (""who is he? are his parents home? Did you do your chores? Did his parents say it was ok? Does he do drugs? Are you gonna do drugs with him?"" etc.) . I was 20 minutes late on Monday and I've been grounded since then. I didn't argue with her, yell at her, or try to justify why I was late (other times I do and get worse outcomes). But I wish I could tell her that I'm not a little kid anymore and I turn 16 in two months, I just don't know what to tell her that won't make her upset or make her feel like I'm ""ungrateful"". She's very stubborn when it comes to any of her opinions and none of my points are valid in her eyes. I also lay around the house all day and she wonders why I don't go outside (I have argued this point with her but she still doesn't listen).

The past few days we've been discussing about sex and found out that we both desired it and that it was a great idea, we are making sure to have safe and responsible sex. However, what worries me the most is how will my extremely religious and conservative family react. They have this idea that sex is a bad and sinful activity punished with hell, and even worse if it's premarital. They are also extremely controlling to the point where I got to tell them where I am and who I am with at every moment unless I am at school. 

What should I do? Her family is extremely supportive towards the subject and open minded. We both really desire it and truly love each other.

217,"to start off, i'm a 17 year old girl living with my 19 year old boyfriend and his mom and younger brother. TL;DR at the bottom, this is a long post lol.

&amp;#x200B;

we have a family friend through my boyfriend's sister and she is 21. she had a child in october 2018 through (i think) a one night stand? on the other side of the country. she came back to our city and had the kid. her only job before pregnancy was stripping/escort stuff and also had income from the government because of some mental illnesses and because she's a child of the government (shitty home life and stuff as a teen). at first, she was all lovey with the kid (obviously), but in recent months she's been selling all his stuff for drugs. she's constantly doing cocaine and god knows what else, leaving her kid at other people's houses for days so she can party and get high. she once left her kid with someone's family for over a week so she could go to another city to strip. long story short, she doesn't really have her priorities straight. (i wouldn't care about her stripping if the money went to caring for her baby but all of her money goes to coke). 

my boyfriend and i babysit the baby regularly and she only just started giving him real food. last time we watched him we were told to bottle feed him, and she didn't tell us this time that she had started feeding him real baby food, so we only found out when i was looking through his baby bag for tylenol (teething). this kid is 6 months old, barely fits into his clothes, has only one pacifier, one teether that is made for much older kids so he can't use it, and one old, disgusting bottle that even after us washing it over and over just cannot come clean. she keeps him in his stroller constantly so he never gets to stretch or try to learn to crawl. overall his life is just shit, and yes, we are going to buy him new things for when he comes to our house when we can afford it (we won't give them to her to keep because she will just sell it for coke). 

i should also mention the baby has fetal alcohol syndrome and is showing other concerning signs but his mother doesn't care and won't take him to a doctor to at least make sure he is okay.

my boyfriend's family and i have considered taking him in for ourselves because we love him to death and try our hardest to take care of him, but that obviously wouldn't be right considering i'm only 17 and we are in nowhere near a good enough financial situation to take in a baby. we have considered child services and still are, but i've dealt with them myself before and they are fucking terrible here. i don't want to put him in the system and ruin his life further considering what they put me and some of my friends through. i don't know anyone who is fit to take care of a baby. if we had the money, we would 100% take him in, but we don't have stable enough incomes right now and like i said, i'm only 17. 

boyfriend's mom said we should leave things how they are and just give him the best life possible while he's here. we got him a jolly jumper and a swing from the neighbours next door for free so he can play and learn a bit, but it still just doesn't feel right. he is with us for a weekend every couple of weeks, but he is with his mother or other random families the other times. nothing feels right. i just want him to have a good life.

TL;DR: i babysit a 6-month-old baby of a coke addict and don't know what to do; if i leave him with his mother he's doomed to a shit life, if i put him in the system he's also doomed to a shit life, and if we take him in he'll have too-young loving parents who can't afford to feed or clothe him.",11May2019,5
218,"I'll try and keep this short.

I've been an extremely nervous driver for as long as I can remember, mostly because I got into an injury-free, but traumatic crash about a month immediately after getting my license. For the past few years, I've still made a point to get myself out driving at least once a month (give or take), but I mostly avoid it and rely on others for rides. 

I've decided that I'm getting too old to continue mooching off of people, so on a trip back to my hometown between college semesters I've decided to trade in my junker car for something a little more reliable and bring it back to my college town so I can stop begging my friends to drive me everywhere. 

Problem is, this means I have to drive a 3-hour, 150 mile trip all by myself to get back to school. The longest I've ever driven on my own are quick trips to work or on errands (probably about 20 minutes of driving max), and I usually have someone else in the passenger seat which helps calm my nerves. When I drive by myself, all I can think about is how little control I feel, and every bump in the road that jostles the steering wheel makes me think I'm going to swerve off the road. 

I know I'm a perfectly safe driver and should make it through the trip just fine, but I'm worried I'll be too much of a nervous wreck and get tunnel vision and get in some stupid accident because of it. 

How do nervous drivers cope with taking long trips by themselves? What do you do when you're driving to get out of your own head a little? Is there anything I can do before I take the trip to make me feel more prepared (I'm going to be getting myself behind the wheel a lot more before I leave for smaller drives)?",11May2019,5

220,"I’ll try to compress five years of ups and downs into something short. If I leave anything unclear, just ask. My girlfriend has been toxic since we met. It wasn’t a big deal throughout high school since I thought we would both mature and come to an understanding. Recently, we’ve been living together for two years and are attending the same college. She’s graduating this week and I still have two years left. She wants me to buy a $10,000 USD ring and propose to her by December, something I am not on board with at all. I’m not ready to commit to someone before I’m even out of college. There are a few things making it complicated for me to break up with her. Firstly, we have an apartment leased together until next summer, and I know she’ll be stubborn and insist she gets the apartment to herself despite us making equal payments. It’s two bedroom, but i don’t think still living together would happen. Second, I’m trying to finish school and I don’t want to have to move home (about an hour away) and have to transfer *and* get a new job. I live paycheck to paycheck, but moving home might alleviate some of the burden. Finally, we’ve had small breakups in the past that have left me depressed to the point of physical sickness. I haven’t made a lot of mental health progress since the last time and I don’t think I’m healthy enough to not have problems this time. I have to break up with her, but I don’t know how I’ll get myself out of this situation. Thanks in advance

My partner knows I won't be able to help out Wednesday morning or Monday morning because I'll end up getting back home for around 1am",11May2019,3
225,"We are both autistic. This woman never said she likes me as a boyfriend and explicitly said she only likes me as a friend and ever will, after I had told her that I like her as a girlfriend. However, her brother and our therapist told me she likes me as a boyfriend and was wary of dating anyone only because her previous ex inappropriately touched her. Our therapist also told me her mom told her she likes me as a boyfriend, and she and my mom told me that we are going on dates and she will later want to be my girlfriend if I am friends with her and do not call them dates now. Going forward, I never mentioned that I intend to be her boyfriend. She dropped obvious hints like initiating to hug and hold my hand, asking “Are you nervous?” on a date, a vibe, saying “after we are just friends” she can drive me around and asked what if we are an actual dating couple in the future.

After 2 months and before our 10th date, my mom called her my girlfriend, so I asked her to kiss me because I wanted to get my first kiss, and she said yes and kissed me with tongue. I asked her in person so she would not change her mind or get advice, and a break-up would be worth my first kiss. My therapist suggested I tell the group against my gut instinct and that we are official, and put me on the spot, so I did, but her brother said he will not tell. This should not distract judgment (not arguing, but it is insignificant context in the broad scheme). 2 days later, worried, I asked her if she is upset. She sent me a text saying “We are still friends and we will see each other tomorrow. It is not like we are boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. I just have a different agenda than yours.”. I asked her what I did that made her think I thought we were more than friends, and she said she was sorry she said that, but the damage had been done and was unable to take it back. I repeated the question and asked if we can still be friends ”like we were before we kissed”, digging myself deeper in the hole of agony and despair, and I told her that I will give her some time to decide if she truly wants to be friends with me. I showed my mom the convo, who advised me to apologize and say that I value the friendship and I did and then she apologized too. Ok, fair enough. I later realized that as often when not told something, people think of the worst case scenario, and it was not because I told the group, because she read the text and was already ignoring me before her brother could have told her.

The next day, she rested her head on my shoulder and said the kiss felt good, but gradually withdrew more distant in the next 7 weeks. She did not hug nor sit by me in the car because she feared it will lead me on. My mom talked to her mom who said she only wants to be friends. I ended the friendship because I did not want a friend who was uncomfortable around me, and at our therapists’ office I confronted her in the hall about our text conversation.

TL;DR: While I respect that she said we were just friends, **she made it very clear to me that she *KNEW* that I wanted more, but failed to tell me what I said or did that implied it, and I could have accused her of the same - yet continued to initiate affection and got surprised when I continued. When she said “sorry” it seemed to take it back and I had trouble distinguishing between “friends” when we made out and “friends” when she was distant.**",11May2019,0

228,"Me and my boyfriend (18M) and seniors in high school. We’ve been together for 4 months now and we’re in a serious relationship. 

My parents were out of town last month so I had him over. This was the first time we ever had sex together. I’m not on birth control, but he used protection and he told me he didn’t ejaculate inside me or in the condom. I’ve never had a guy ejaculate inside me so I don’t know what it feels like at all. I feel like he might be lying to me though. 

We had sex the end of last month. I usually start my period the beginning of each month (the first week). They’re pretty regular. I’ve had cramps and my breasts have hurt a lot, which is usually how I feel before my period, but I haven’t started it yet and it’s almost the middle of the month.

No one liked my ex, he manipulated me most of the relationship, an asshole to my friends and family, and overall the relationship lasted 3 years too long. It’s been about a year and 4 months now and almost every time I see one of my friends they ask if I’m dating anyone new or anything like that. I hate this question because I spent my early 20’s in a relationship. It’s not that I don’t want another boyfriend but I’m not actively searching. If it happens cool beans but other than that I’m good. I love the freedom. The past 4 years I spent reporting back to someone. Couldn’t go out with friends or family because I was worried about him and his needs 24/7. So when they ask this question what do I say anymore? I always tell them I’m not looking for anything at all but always get this like sigh and then we’ll you should go on dates blahblahblah.

233,"My niece has a boyfriend, let's call him John. Chances are that he will be her future husband. Now, everyone in the family is in full support of this, my sister(niece's mother) supports this. I also support this. In comparison to her previous boyfriend, John seems like a very decent person. But there is one person in the family that does not like this...my mother. My mother is already 80, she is the only member among her sisters and brothers that is still alive. To be precise, 7 of them and she is the only one still alive. And, it doesn't seem like she will be passing in the next 10 years. Her mind is clear, no real signs of trouble remembering things. So why does my mother dislike John? Because his head is big and his eyes are small are the reasons she gave. But, clearly these are just excuses. The real reason she does not like John is because life will be changing. She fears that this is the real deal, her granddaughter is finally getting married, they will have children and she will be left behind, forgotten. Both her and my sister disliked my niece's previous boyfriend. But this time around, she has lost an ally, my sister is in support of this boyfriend. Her fundamental problem I guess is she does not have any real hobbies, does not talk to other elderly people. The 'joy' of her life was listening to people in her family talk about her, talk to her and listening to her endless complaints. But she feels like she is losing this control/attention. People will no longer discussing about her, her granddaughter will move away to live with John in a new house. She does not like this at all, she wants her granddaughter to continue living with her...and visit John. This is just ridiculous, I don't know what the solution is. Calling her is just a pain, she just spouts endless random complaints about how every one does not treat her right. I am very worried for John. She has not looked at John in the eyes and said ‘I don't like you', but I feel such a day is not far. Her complaints are only getting worse, and I can't come up with a better reason other than that she is being extremely selfish. Other people look forward to the day they can have grand grand children, she however says things like 'The birth of a new generations means the passing of another', suggesting that this marriage and them having children will result in her death.

234,"I am 40 F and BF 30 M.
Know each other for 7 and lived together for 5 yrs.
Loved him a lot. Waited long for him to announce to his family and friends;talk  to my parents.Age difference is a big deal in the culture. Whole time he said he loves me,took care of me well and he said he cannot live with out me.
He want to wait till he can convince his parents and move ahead after his sister gets married,so we are not impacting her life with taboo (our age difference).
Then I asked him we plan for kids as my biological clock is ticking.
He said yes but then came to know hard way that he was not 100% in to the  idea. After few tries going for fertility treatments  and trying for an 6-8 months came to know I cannot have kids with my own eggs. I was devastated.my whole life I wanted to have kids and family life.
Only option I had was to go for donor egg if I want to have that experience. 
I wanted to try that before I go for adoption.So it was 5 yrs together  by the time all this happened.Everytime I felt he was avoiding to move forward with decision of marriage or kids.

I felt something weird going on between him and his colleague of his(married lady with kid). We spoke 
And he cleared nothing to worry about.

We decided we invite his family to visit the country we are living in and we announce. (I moved to new place nearby when they visited)They came I have to ask everyday when he was going to tell them.That irritated him.As I think of it I dont know if I have not done that.my side of arguement I was  waiting for so long I was scared  he will put off till the end of their visit and will never bring that up.
I felt I waited soo long for the moment.
He announced,as expected they did not like the idea.They left and did not treat me well.(probably from their side what they did might be right since they were not able to accept me)
But I felt I have right to vent with him about my feelings. He tried to protect me when they were here. But felt he changed a lot,tried to attempt suicide when they were here and multiple times after they left. It was kind of shock for him or he could not handle it.
Since they left he emotionally abused me(that's my side of story)
In one word ""it felt like hell"".
But  time to time he said you dont know how much I love you and I dont have any life other than you.
Now same work friend became close(?) or we rifted(?),he started giving Importance to her and me accepting her than my feelings. 
Time and time I said I dont like his closeness with her,it feels weird.
He became very private with his phone since then.He insisted I get along with her etc.

One after other I could not take it and I have no friends to vent out ,nor my family knows about relationship.
I am depressed not knowing what is next. 
But when I decided enough is enough I said we part our ways.
But we are still together. We still fight,live together and he do not even speak a word about next plans. Now I dont trust him at all, due to many incidents that happened.
I am just depressed and dont know what is next.I wanted good husband and family. But I feel I am too old to think about that with any other person.I think I developed trust issues now.

 After his parents left and when  all this drama is happening he proposed , I said I want to think about it. Many more incidents happened after that and I am not ready to move forward.
Sametime I am not ready to be like this.(stuck)

My question is why is he doing the things he is doing?What is in his mind?
I feel I am dumb enough to understand his intentions. He is not bad.But what good is he when he says i dont care wht you feel about my relationship with my colleague,she is just friend.I told him to leave multiple times,but he would not. He is smart with lot of Emotional intelligence.
It is not hard to understand what's going on in my mind and what needs to be done etc.

My theory after his parents visit he got cold feet. He dont want to break up right away because of guilt.But he is putting me through all of this so I move on and he dont have to feel guilty about it or he just wants immigration advantage with me.

I dont trust him that he cares about what I want in life but I trust him as a good friend. Sometimes I think I still love him but most times I feel love is gone.
We dont have any social life.
We have good jobs and have good education.

Please help me understand what going on in his mind. 
Sorry if this all does not make sense at all.
I feel like I am living life of lie.
We dont feel comfortable announcing our age difference too I guess? That limits our social life..I dont know.
Help me out please.",11May2019,3
235,"Yesterday, an acquaintance/new friend sent me a flyer for a pride party. My friend is from Indonesia (we both live in the Netherlands though) and sometimes seems out of touch with Western culture, so I thought I should probably clarify the nature of the party just in case (I personally enjoy going to LGBT venues, even though I'm mostly straight, but I get that not all straight people feel the same). When I pointed it out, however, he was really appalled (”Gay as in gay gay?! I'm NEVER going to this party! "") and responded with a ""vomiting emoji"". I got so mad that I ended up just telling him that he sucked, that there's nothing wrong with being gay and then again that he sucked. He responded with an ""Ok, thanks"", so the friendship's likely dead at this point.

 I had had a really rough day yesterday and wasn't in my most patient and understanding state, which is why I'm now unsure if that was the right way to approach the matter. If I had met him in Indonesia (Wikipedia tells me that homosexuality is mostly taboo there), I would have probably explained to him in a calm manner that I disagreed with his point of view and didn't feel comfortable with him expressing those kinds of sentiments around me, but since he's been in the Netherlands for around 9 months now, I had really expected him to know that this kind of conduct is not okay in the least.

The friendship isn't a great loss - it was never gonna go past 'casual friends' anyway - but I want him to know that this kind of sentiment is not okay, while avoiding fanning the flames of his homophobia. In other words, what's the best way to deal with homophobia in expats from cultures, in which homophobia is accepted?",11May2019,0

237,"A little context: I am a 21 male who is currently a server for a large food company. I recently got a job as a daycare and preschool educator. It is literally the perfect job for me. I don’t need a degree yet, as long as I’m working on one, which I am. I love my coworkers and my students, who I already see and refer to as my kids. Now this is where I’m having issues with. 

I still have my serving job. I originally tried to change my availability to make some extra cash on the weekend, but they aren’t honoring that and I can’t physically work two jobs. I go into my school at 9, leave at 4, then server from 4:30 to 11. Every. Day. I worked for this company for two years and feel like I owe my coworkers more, but I’m unable to stand management, the guests, and at this point, the work. I even put in my two week notice, but I’m always dreading going into work. 

The only reason I’m content on keeping it is because of my background check. I’m scared that when the daycare does my official background check, they’ll see I’m currently fighting DUI charges under the influence of marijuana. This was months ago, I’m clean now, and wasn’t under the influence at the time (there is proof of that). Even my lawyer said he is positive he could get me out of it. 


So do I leave my serving job? Do I walk out on the job I can’t stand? Does anyone think my charges will affect my work? Do charges you’re not even convicted of shoe up on background checks?",11May2019,1

My mom is an addict, she’s a drinker and now she’s started to smoke some kind of substance. I don’t know what she smokes, I live across the country from her and I am not in contact with her. I found out from the relative that she is not well. She’s have trouble walking and she falls in her apartment, apparently it’s because she’s drunk all the time.

I blame myself for it because she’s gave birth to me at 19 and she was pressured into keeping me. She told me numerous times that she wished that she’s got an abortion. After she gave birth to me, she got depressed and because we were and are still really poor she never got any help. As I grew, her depression and addiction got worse. Three years ago I moved to go to college, I’m graduating next year. My mom haven’t been well with me in college. When I was at home, I was able to help her addiction. When I left, it took turn for the worse.

Now, that she’s in the bad shape, I’m overcomed with guilt. I knew that my mom could not be an addict if I wasn’t born. I can’t help but think that way because she got pregnant with me in her freshman year in college, she was forced to quit and she never got an education. We lived with my grandmother (her mom) who is a really abusive woman. She screamed at my mom and barely let us stay with her. Growing up, my mom had better and worse periods with her addiction. Ultimately, however, the source of her unhappiness is me. If she could have not give birth to me, she could have been a better member of society and not end up as an addict.",11May2019,4

I have my girlfriend and I'm getting along really great with Alice, a real friend, I tell her my problems she tells me her, like a friend would. In the back of my head though, I keep having thoughts that maybe she likes me, she does things that make me think she likes me. Fast forward a couple weeks, I get a really really strong feeling that she's into me, but I ignore it, I really like her as a friend, and I was dating someone. I break up with my girl, we didn't really like each other, fast forward to now, Alice and I hang out a couple times a week, talk almost 24/7. 

This is were I think I fucked my self up, we start talking a lot, hanging out, doing stuff going places. I joke with her almost the same way I would with my ex before we started dating, and so does she, it feels like flirting from both sides. We play fight sometimes and even wrestle, we'll be in a car with other people and we'll be talking and pushing, joking around in the back. I now like this girl to the max, like crazy, I can't stop thinking about her. 

Problem is, I'm sure she doesn't actually like me, and I'm okay with that, but sometimes she'll be talking to another guy friend, and I'll get jealous, really jealous, and I hate that feeling because I've never had it, not even when we were friends.

251,"Hello,

My girlfriend and I are very close. It may sound stupid, but nothing ever gets between us and we don't fight. We really do vibe and see eye to eye on pretty much everything. The problem facing us right now is that we don't agree on the role of sex and intimacy in the relationship. I personally am for it and think it is an important part of the relationship. For her, it doesn't represent anything good or happy. She has had more than enough bad experiences to justify such an opinion too. We can both sympathize, but it still always seems to be an issue that comes up. 

We are both willing to put in whatever work we need to find a mutually beneficial and rewarding resolution, but we don't know where to go. We can both see the other's point of view, but neither one of us can get over our own side. I'm not driven by lust, but I am just a young man with the typical feelings and desires. For me, the issue is not that we don't have sex, but rather that I worry so much about offending or hurting her even with little things. 

**The big question is: what should we do to make this work better? How can we be there for each other and help each other more while maintaining our distinct views? If that's not possible, how can I suppress or even eliminate my desires and assimilate into her mindset?**

252,"Ok so I am a millennial, not a entitled one tho so I would appreciate some advice on how I deal with my situation.
P.S I'm on mobile and I'm typing this out as it is happening.

So a little backstory:
My family is well off. As in not rich, but also not poor so we can afford a family computer which has served us well for the past 6 years and hasn't given us any problems. Almost everyone in my family uses this computer so we have a lot messaging accounts on it (eg. Skype), including my father's.

So I was watching YouTube as always on the computer and I see this Skype notification  pop up on the side of the screen. And being the curious person that I am, decided to look into the conversation(The message read: just woke up after a nap. I don't think any colleague of my father's would tell him that so please don't bombard me for being curious in the comments) and instantly I see a flood of hearts. My dad... was hearting(pretty sure that's not a word) his colleague's messages.

I wanted to cry, I wanted to call him up just to ask him what that was about, but I decided not to. So I stayed call and collected and scrolled all the way up, to when they first started messaging each other and read everything. 

What I got from it is that this female colleague of his is turning him on and that he suspects my mother to be cheating on him. And that on the first of June he is going on a ""Business trip""  to Bangkok to meet up with her and some other colleagues for about a week.

What should I do? Should I confront him about this or should I wait this out? Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you",11May2019,1

256,"So here's the deal. I have crooked teeth, and not the kind that goes unnoticed as easily as some. Unfortunately for me it was genetic as my teeth were too big for the space that my jaw allowed, also caused an over bite. I want to look into getting braces, but after hearing many horror stories about waking up with braces caught in the skin behind their lips, and of course the very strict food restrictions it didn't sound right for me. I was also curious about invisalign and other similar products.

So my question is if you have/had crooked teeth how did you fix them? And what kind of experience did you have with the method?

Any and all responds appreciated! :)",11May2019,1
258,"A classmate (26F) and I (28F) just got hired to do the same job. We are both student workers who are not licensed. The only difference is that I will be living in their student housing for free, and my classmate won't be. She also has a little experience working in the industry, but honestly not much. 

I just found out that she is getting paid $12.50 per hour, and I am getting paid $7.25. Maybe the discrepancy is due to my living in their student housing? I'm really grateful for an opportunity to finish school without having to pay rent or utilities while getting work experience. I do still have other bills though and student loans.

This just seems like a very large pay gap. I'm worried down the road I'll be resentful. Is this something I'm able to bring up to my new boss, or should I just keep my mouth shut and be grateful? I signed an agreement with the wage on it, and the agreement said I would be working 20 hours a week. Today I found out I will be working 30 hours a week.

If I do keep my mouth shut about it, how do I keep this from affecting my attitude?",11May2019,2

261,"So first of all I’ve felt like this for a while but for the last year or so it’s, in a sense evolved? Into a whole new feeling. Since I (F19) was a small child I always found myself pushing myself away from everyone and everything. My childhood wasn’t the greatest since I had a abusive alcoholic step father. But last year I got married to I really think is the one for me, and I love him (M20) with all my heart, but there’s times where I just start crying because I’m scared that he’ll get tired of me and leave. I admit I’m not the best wife, I don’t clean like I should and I don’t cook, but I don’t have any explanation as to why I don’t. I’ll just be in my room all day and I just float off and the next thing I know it’s time for bed. And I worry that eventually he’ll get tired of it. I’ve brought this up to him, how I feel multiple times, stuff about my childhood and each time he says it’s okay and that he understands. But I then I think to myself that he’ll get tired of this. The constant insecurity and being scared, because who will what to deal with that all the time, and so that leads to me being nervous that what if he decides to look for someone else. I tell myself that I know he wouldn’t do anything, and I’ve told him that to, but deep down there’s something that just says “what if he is, what if he already has” and its just a cycle of one thing leading me to think about the next and I’m tired of it. What is this feeling and what do I do to make it go away?",11May2019,6

265,"Not sure what to do or how to react right now. I’m 21 years old, and I’ve been friends with this person (I’ll call him TJ for simplicities sake) since I was in middle school, we’ve shared our deepest secrets, regrets, dreams, experienced incredible times and we literally referred to eachother as brothers. I would have never let go of my friendship with him regardless of any hardships that we would encounter, every time he was depressed I was willing to drop what I was doing and talk it out with him, I compromised so much of my time and life to make his better, and it confused and hurt me to my core when he dropped me from all contact and acted like I meant nothing to him.
It all started with an argument we had about something I felt at the time wasn’t a big deal, I had grown distant from a couple of my other friends and he was angry about it. It wasn’t like I was the only one who drifted away from my contact with them, it was just one of those things in life where we got too busy living our own individual experiences and didn’t have as much time to talk anymore. 
But TJ had told be that the friends I’d lost contact with actually no longer liked me as a person, they were angry at me, and that he agreed with that sentiment. One of the friends that he was referring to is about to have a wedding, I’ve been invited and I’m still looking forward to going, but TJ told be that my friend probably no longer wanted me to attend, and that my relationship with that friend was irreparable. At the time, I honestly trusted TJ enough to assume that he was telling the truth, and I felt like I had messed up bad. I ended up hanging up on TJ because I was getting way too worked up and emotional, he’d hung up on me countless times since we’ve been friends, and this was one of the very rare times when I had done the same. That was the last time I talked on the phone with TJ. 
The next day I phoned my friend who TJ had told me no longer considered me a friend, and I talked to him about our relationship. I didn’t mention what TJ said (he had told me not to) but I basically asked if me and him were still cool and if he was mad at me for any reason. He told me that he wasn’t mad at all and that he had no idea why I’d feel like he would be.
A week later TJ texted me and told me that he no longer wanted to talk to me. This is when things got really awful. TJ had been telling my friends lies behind my back during that entire week, he’d been trying to turn all my other friends against me, and I’m sad to say that it worked on some of them, some will no longer contact me and the ones that do no longer treat me like they used to. 
I’m not sure who to turn to or what to do at this point, I’m so angry at TJ and hurt by his actions, he’s isolated me more than I’ve ever been before. The only person who’s stuck by my side completely is my sister, but I still feel lonely as hell, I lost so much of what I felt like was my foundation. I never thought that this could happen, and I can’t fathom living a life without my childhood friends.

267,"Ok so i have a few cousins. 2 of which i fucking hate. Theyre siblings. Ever since we were all little they always compared themselves to me and my other cousins and tried to be better than us. While me and my other cousins couldnt give less of a shit about competition, we just always did what was best for us. Til this day all my cousins and i get along great except with those 2 pieces of shit.

Anyways, i think the hate really blew up back in highschool. I graduated a year early and in my whole family ( immediate and extended, i have a big family) they were all super happy and proud of me and i felt great! My mom was exploding with joy and literally til this day doesnt shut up about it. She tells everyone. Which i dont mind except...well my cousins.

You see since i found something unique and nice and out of the ordinary cheat code to life, my piece of shit cousin wanted to copy me and did the same shit the next year. Only he cheated his transcripts from his home country and lied about half his grades. I remember when it happened he started shitting all over me like i cared to begin with.
""Oh your so jealous that i graduated early huh, your not in the spotlight no more""

Even his mom tried to make me jealous at a unrelated family event where she hinted he was graduating but didnt actually tell me, though it was SOOOO disgustingly douchy. After it i was just thinking ""am i really related to that bitch?"" I get it shes his mom, shes proud, sure. But they way she told me it was in a way saying ""were just as good as you"" They get there show off, competition, disgusting personalities from there parents which are the same way. 

Anyways anytime i do anything with my life i always keep it on the down low now. I never let them know shit about me. In fact we literally dont even talk anymore. Only on holidays which is like twice a year and im forced to see them.

My dilemma here now is that i want to move. Theres so much more opportunity in the place i want to go and i just really want to do it really badly!! However to do so i would leave college, maybe continue over there...the details arent important, bottom line is im going my own path, im doing whats best for me and that means im going to go against the norm that my entire family is used to and my cousins are also living. (Just like how i graduated high school early)

My problem is once i do it, the news is bound to get to them. Since my mom is probably going to tell there mom since theyre sisters. Then since theyre close and my mom doesnt want to look like her son is going to go sell drugs, shes probably going to tell them my plans too. 

This is really irritating me cause i dont want them to know fucking jack shit about me!! I fucking hate them and literally once i move im perfectly fine with never seeing them again. I just hate that everythings connected, my mom to there mom. Once they hear the news there gonna probably do the same shit.

I want them to stay in there fucking place. I dont want them to be successful. They dont fucking deserve it. There unoriginal half ass fucking losers. I know it sounds super hateful but hear me out. The shit i do, the shit i plan, the shit i execute, since day fucking one...has been my doing!! My brain!! My goals!! And then fuckers like them just come in, take the details and fucking copy it! I know if i didnt graduate highschool early, he wouldnt have either, cause he doesnt fucking care to!

272,"I’m 20 y/o college student. 

(Throwaway account)

I’m new hire at a popular grocery store in California, I was hired as courtesy clerk.  2 weeks in, and they asked  me to help out the Floral department  in order to prepare for Mother’s Day. Although it is a temporary transfer, I absolutely hate it and want to quit. The manager of this department talks bad about customers and other coworkers behind their back (probably me too). Since the first day I got there she has been nothing but rude and unprofessional to me &amp; my other coworker (also a new hire). Today she humiliated me in front of my coworkers. 



I was told to unwrap a bouquet of roses, and as I was doing it she immediately told me to stop because I was doing it incorrectly. I then asked for clarification, and she said “nope do it right, try again”. Immediately after she said “NOPE that’s not how you do it” and took the flowers away from me.


Then proceeded to say this:


“I don’t understand why you don’t do as you’re told. Like, Am I not communicating enough!? I’m getting the sense that you’re really dumb.“

“Oh, well, I mean, I know you’re not ACTUALLY dumb..”

She instructed a veteran coworker to show me to proper way bc she had to go do something. None of us talked about the incident, we just kept working in silence.


Before I was transferred to the Floral Department, I was warned by coworkers that the manager was really rude and demanding. I was told by multiple coworkers that she made someone cry (that person doesn’t work there anymore). Today a different coworker told me she cried at home because of the way the manager talked to her (she is also new, but doesn’t speak English).

I reported it to the main manager of the store, I told him the situation, and how why felt unsafe working with her. He told me it was too late to train someone else to replace me bc it’s already the holiday weekend. He promised me I could move back to my assigned position as courtesy clerk after the holiday weekend along with an extra day to clean. Although I recognize that I should have spoken up earlier, it was scary to do so on my behalf because I am a new hire. I am already exhausted with homework assignments &amp; this feels like stress I do not need. I really do feel unsafe working with her. Do I have to put in a 2 weeks notice?

274,"If anyone wants to scold me, please don't! The tattoo is permanent, I wanted it, and I do not need anyone telling me I should regret it! 

So, I got a new tattoo because the artist was in my city and had a spot suddenly open up. I jumped at the chance because I loved his work and had a design in mind. I had no time to think it over, so now that I suddenly have it I'm panicking. It looks really good, the style is perfect for me, and the design is something I feel has meaning. However, it's the first tattoo I've gotten that is visible. It's a stripey garden snake (as in it's not scary looking haha) curled in an artistic and cool way that spans about 4 inches on the back of my arm, above my elbow. I don't think it looks bad here, but I'm scared that because it's so visible it will give people a bad impression of me and I'm self conscious! Does anyone have advice as to getting used to being a ""tattooed person"" or feeling confident in my choice? The tattoo represents who I am in both personal style and meaning (it has to do with the stripes), but I'm a young woman and not an ""edgy"" person, so I'm worried that my image will change in a bad way. To me it is an expression of being artistic (I'm in college studying to be a designer after all!), But I'm worried people could think it's trashy.

TLDR: I got a tattoo that I'd been thinking of for a while very suddenly. I think the tattoo is ""me"" and is super well done so I have no regrets about the design, but since it's on my arm I now feel self conscious about what people will think of me. Does anyone have advice on feeling more confident in my choice?",11May2019,1

I made a mistake at work and came clean to my direct manager 
And she just told me to be careful next time and not to do it again 
The client didn’t know yet and I’m sick of waiting
I can’t handle the wait of hell to break loose 

I’ve been here for 3 month, it’s my first job after college 
And there’s a low in my country that says the first 3 months of someone’s first job is a testing period 
Which means if the employer didn’t like the employee they can let him/her go with no questions asked 

Next week I’ll be here for exactly 3 months, and my direct manager will sit down with HR to decide if I will be with them or not

And I’m scared!!! Will they let me go because of that mistake???

277,"This question isn't only about friends but just about anyone in your inner circle.

So, my close pal, she lacks basic sense of behaviour. Let me explain: we take a class together and we often sit in the front rows. During evaluation of the tests, she keeps saying ""yesss!"", ""omg, I can't believe I got that right"", ""thank God!"" etc loudly, while the entire class is silent and focussed. Or another example: whilst walking on the road or while on the escalator, she is not aware of the motion of the people around her or who are coming in her direction and just barely misses bumping into them, which would cause them to come to an abrupt halt. 

I'm not sure if my explanation has been clear, but honestly it's quite difficult to put in into words. My friend is a genuine person with a heart of gold. She doesn't do these things intentionally but it does happen A LOT. I don't want to say anything to her because I hate confrontations and neither am I perfect person. But this sort of 'absent-mindedness' does annoy me.

She is scared/anxious to talk to her boss about it because she doesn't want to be annoying to them, so she hasn't done that yet. Her hours are effecting her heavily mentally as she has been depressed a lot lately.

So I was expecting a response of her but she didn't, not even a thank you. She just reacted (Facebook reactions) to all my messages (like 7). 

I don't know why this affected me so much, I don't usually care about people not answering me. Maybe is because right now I'm a little bit isolated studying for my finals so I'm spending a lot of time alone and not talking to anyone.

My first reaction was to not answer her the next time she talks to me but you are not supposed to do that to a friend.

I also realized that when she talks to me I always have interest in what she is saying or showing me but when I send her something that I think it could be interesting for her the conversation ends quickly.

282,"So my two friends, let’s call them Jenny and Ashley, are in a cold war. Jenny fell in love with the person Ashley used to like (let’s call him Ben).

So Ben and Ashley never really made their relationship official. But everyone knows that “something” was going on between them. Their basically in a mutual understanding. 4 months later, Ben asked Ashley if she has any plans to make it official. Ashley said she likes him but as of that time, that’s what she can offer. After that, Ben and Ashley gradually stopped talking to each other and had different priorities.

Then, again, at least 4 months later, Ben and Jenny became classmates in college. They were the only people who knew each other so they’ve been always together since then. Eventually, they liked each other. And kept their relationship in secret. It was only until a year later that we knew about their relationship. Jenny first told three people. I was one of them.

I think I’m an asshole for reacting this way but when Jenny told me, I literally had no regard for Ben and Ashley’s relationship. I just listened to Jenny at how it happened between Ben and her. Because while we were in high school, Ben and Jenny literally had no connection with each other. They don’t even talk to each other.

Then like any other news, even if 3 people only knew that time, Ben and Jenny’s relationship spread like wildfire to our past schoolmates. Turns out, someone from their college noticed their interactions and spread his observations to them. 

A month later, our past schoolmates started calling Jenny lots of names. How she didn’t even think of her friendship with Ashley and how she agreed to have a relationship with Ben. Jenny told me that this was also the reason why they kept their relationship secret: that many people would meddle. I was shocked with this news because, when Jenny told me I literally didn’t even have any reaction. I thought that it was only okay because Ashley and Ben didn’t really became serious with their relationship.

Ashley then sent me a message and asked me if I knew things about her that she didn’t know. I said yes but didn’t go about expanding what it was about. Then she told me that she feels bad that Jenny and I did not tell her right away when everybody already knows about it. And went on about not feeling like she was a friend to us. She told us that she isn’t mad about Ben and Jenny being together, she just feels bad that we didn’t tell her about it—like she wasn’t our friend.

Ashley now stopped talking to us. We mostly talk online. I tried approach her in person but she refused to meet. It’s been weeks and we are in the same situation.

I don’t want to lose my friendship with both of my closest friends but the only thing I’m seeing here is I have to choose one between the two of them. What should I do?",11May2019,0
283,"Im going to try and make this as simple and short as i can.

My dad:useless, stubborn, and the source of 50% of my moms stress. Useless because he doesnt give a single thought to our household. Our house is a mess and has been in need of construction improvements and fixing for the past 10 years. Something my mom has conplained to him about evryday. He just comes to sleep and eat, then he goes to work. He doesnt even pay for any food or bills because all his work is his failing busniess. Which has also landed him in huge amounts of debt. We get our bills and groceries paid by my disabled brothers $600 a month social security check lol.


My brother: He was born with a variety of birth defects and is severly mentally disabled. He has to be supervised 24/7 and is prone to seizures at any given moment. My mom is the warrior that has been by his side through everysecond of his 19 year old life. Siezures at 2am?....he would have died if my mom didnt wake up and help him. 1000 doctors appointments....my mom. Someone that keeps him company cause he never shuts up?....my mommy. He takes medication but it doesnt do jack shit. I personally beileve that medical marijuana is the way to go but we live in a state where its not legal. 

My mom: i honestly dont deserve her. She manages to stay positive, happy and supportive through all the bullshit life has thrown at her. Shes the most resiliant person ive ever seen in my life. When moms are complaining about their crying 3 year olds she laughs her ass off. Shes stronger that fucking steel. Not only has my brother been the biggest burden and my dad being a useless tool fighting her every night for 20 years, but shes also hardcore diabetic. She pops those insulin shots in her stomach every day and they literally dont help at all. Not a single bit.

Anyways, due to some turn of events ive realized that moving out is probably going to be benefical to me and my family in a lot of ways. My main reason for moving out is my burning hatred for school and my hometown. Ive lived in the same shitty city my whole life and been going to college for 3 years straight after high school, summers included, no breaks. Due to some depression reguarding how i hate school i managed to fail 3 classes this past year and have my finacial aid, the only thing paying for my school cut off. Now im debating dropping out conpletly because im more than confident i can make it out there without a degree but the thing is i invested alot of time amd energy into it and so i want to finish it. Plus my mom would be devastaed if i didnt. Since i plan on taking a break from school anyways since im so burned out and i dont plan on taking out loans once i do return, combined with how i really want to move and start living my life, ive formulated a plan to move to another state and attend another university in my dream city.

Thing is im conflicted if i should move out. I really dont want to leave my mom alone with my dad and brother. Plus moving out to an apartmebt across the street would kill her inside, let alone a completly different state far away. 

Heres the deal, i think its going to be the best route possible. Im going to build up my life and finances so i can be better able to take care of all of them later on. How can i take care of my whole family if i cant take care of myself. At the same time im going to have a little fun and live for a little since my entire life has been in the prison of school. 

I always talk about how im going to take care of all of them when im older and my mom gets super mad. She doesnt want me to help anyone. She wants me to go live my life and not worry about anything. However i would be the biggest dick in the world if i followed through with that. 

On the flip side, if i stay, i dont think i can make any difference at all but get more depressed myself and give my mom mental support when my brother has his siezures or my dad starts with his bullshit.

I was thinking once i get established she and my brother can come anytime and live with me for however long theyd like. Also once i get esablished and figure my life out on my own, i plan to take my brother out of my moms hands, give my mom some money, and let her go live a little since shes been suffering and giving for the past 20 years.

Should i move out or stay?",11May2019,2

The problem is I am afraid I won't fully enjoy my vacation because in the back of my head there will be this constant stress about returning to same job after my trip. 

On the other hand, I feel like I am too tired and unmotivated to do anything about my current life situation right now.

285,"I'm just still a kiddo (M15) but I've been having depression lately. I've talked with my friends that is pretty good with others mental state and she said I'm too self conscious about my behavior. I was thinking way too much about how annoying I am n those things. But now I'm feeling better, I'm currently recovering from my depression. 

Heres the cheesy part. Long story short I'm in love with a girl, and there's a good chance she's into me too so it was going well. But this she way too nice and pure so there's a lot of other dudes that like her. They were below my level so I didn't too much since this girl is kinda into me. But until yesterday one my close friend (CF) told me that he likes her. (First gotta mention that I don't really tell alot of friends bout my feelings to her. Only my closest of friends that I trust. In this case I didn't tell him because I don't think he is worthy enough) I was trying to make him forget his feelings and move on without making it obvious. But I don't think I made it obvious enough because at the end I was forced to support him since he chooses the other path to ask her out sometime.

 Im feeling uneasy since then, I talked with my 2 friend's that is also my crush's closest friend and they tried to comfort me. I felt a little better but the thought still attached to my head. I think that he should have know already about me and my crush relationship since most people already see us as a couple which we (me &amp; my crush) brush it off. (We didn't complain at all though) I never told him (CF) about my feelings and our relationship but at the same time our group (consist of him, me, my crush, and other friends) can see a connection between me and my crush. I really don't know what to do..

Just to add details, my crush is pretty chill to him (CF). She jokes on him sometimes, talk to him sometimes. Yes He did some bad things in the past in context of relationship that my crush know so she should have a basic knowledge of him in terms of his behaviors within relationship. 

Me and my crush have a pretty strong connection that other can see if they look really close, so to be honest about CF I don't really care about him taking her away. But what really bugs me is how do I act to him and to my crush. 

Do I keep hanging around with my crush and dont mind him? Or should I give some space? And thinking about it just making me depressed again. I'm feel empty because it's a holiday right now and there's nothing to do except laying in bed, play games. But I'm bored with all my games, I'm bored with everything which leads me to keep thinking about this. 

What should I do? Is there any activities I can do to clear my mind?",11May2019,2

I got up around 5:30 because my cat was trying to throw up and I put him outside, when my 13 year old mid-low functioning autistic brother comes up wearing a skirt and bra of my mother’s, drowning in perfume, and looking like a raccoon with makeup on, saying how he wasn’t straight. 

This is an issue for a couple reasons. A. My mom is very conservative on this issue, and would absolutely be furious if this happened. At me and At him. B. I don’t want to deal with any of that BS, and while if my mom knew how to handle this with nuance I would as well, she doesn’t so I don’t want to deal with It. C. He’s probably going through puberty, so this might be a sexual things, which neither of us knows how to handle, and I don’t want to handle it.

287,"Hi! So I have an ex boyfriend that was not the best person to me. When we were in a relationship he lied about where he lived, where he traveled, and even about deaths in his family (I do want to point out that the lies about family deaths  were not confirmed so I don’t want to say it as fact, but I’m very sure that they were lies to blackmail me in arguments). He would start multiple arguments every week blaming me for something, making me feel like I had to apologise and I begged for his forgiveness. I never did anything wrong but he convinced me that I did. So I finally plucked up the courage to break up with him (I did this over the phone as I was worried about his reaction). To sum it up he didn’t let me break up with him by making me feel guilty so I had to stay with him. I pretended to still want the relationship because as soon as he thought I didn’t like him, he would get so angry. Eventually I told him that it was all too much and I couldn’t do it anymore, which is when he threatened to kill himself if I left him. This happened almost monthly, I’d try to leave and he’d blackmail me to stay. He messaged my mum asking for forgiveness out of nowhere, kept finding me at college and followed me so he could beg. It often reduced me to tears. He got off at my train station after college and waited for me by the exit so he could beg; he often cried to stop me from walking away or he’d just physically stop me. Even after I blocked him on all social media he would make a twitter accounts to contact me.  A lot more happened but those were the main things really. After I left college I was finally able to cut him out my life. He started to put in less effort to contact me, and now we have no contact at all as he is at uni.  However, I’m quite scared of him at this point, and I was wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to keep me safe, or even just have some reassurance that he probably won’t come back into my life again.

I've been single since February of 2018 and haven't been on a date in months. I only have a GED. I live with my parents in a veritable 'neckbeard nest', but my rooms being cleaned as we speak.

289,"Since my early teen years I’ve had an interest in the military, wars, history, journalism etc. and the last few years I’ve started watching documentaries on conflicts of the past 20/30 years: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, some in Africa. 
These documentaries can range in brutality, some only show interviews and a few short scenes from the lives of civilians or soldiers during the war, other are almost completely made up of first hand footage filmed during combat or moments of violence, I’ve watched dozens of both.
A few weeks ago I realized that I had grown accustomed to the sight of death and killing. To clarify: I don’t have any hate for any group of people, I don’t like it, I don’t want people to die, whoever it may be, friend or foe. It’s just that I’ve exposed myself to so much death that I’m  indifferent to these brutal scenes which would terrify others. 
While some other people of my age haven’t even seen the body of a family member that passed away, I’ve seen executions, beheadings, shootings and acts of terror, I’m scared of losing my feeling of empathy or having these sights change or haunt me in the future.

291,"Hey everyone,
A friend of mine recently struck alot of bad luck and I want to know what to say in order to comfort her.

Her dog (pretty old) was sick due to a spleen infection, but he got surgery and became all better. It was just a scare then.

She is in college and payed for the surgery herself  with the money she was saving for a laptop for college, even though a bunch of her family members request putting the dog down (which bummed her alot).

Everything was fine until a day or two later her father had a work accident, putting him in the hospital for a few weeks, and unable to work (or take care of himself) for 3 months. It was a SCARY accident, might I add.

Just today her dog got sick again (unrelated to surgery) and is in life danger again. She has to pay the vet bills and she fears her money left doesn't suffice. 

She also has ft pay for college and is now  essencially living off of a single paycheck (her mother's).

Plus the stress of school work adds a toll to this. Between it and visiting her father she has to time for herself.

I'm stumped, and I don't know what else to say to her... Talking is really the only way I have to help her right now.

305,"I made a new account for this, for maybe obvious reasons.

So it sounds really  stupid when I write it out like this. But I have been living in a small shared flat with two other people for a few years now.

I don't want to go into too much details, but essentally we have never really figured out the financials. I mean we have agreed multiple times on paper who should pay how much, and we divided it up equally, with some adjustment for the size of the rooms. 

But when it actually comes to paying for a some time now it essentially has been like this: One guy pays half of rent, the other guy pays nothing, I pay half of rent and all additional costs like internet and electricity. 

So right now I'm paying like 540€ when on paper I should only be paying about 300€. One guy lives here for free, or I guess really just owes me a lot of money for rent. Other guy pays about as much rent as he should be, slightly more probably.

Now as I wrote in the title I am really bad at confronting people. I have almost never just asked him for the rent like I should have. I was always trying to work up the courage to ask for the money, but whenever we see each other I just say ""hi, how you doing"" whatever and smile. I fell terrible about myself because of this. When I think of talking to him about the 3000+€ he owes me I get anxiety. At this point I just want everybody to pay the right amount in the future. But talking about that will bring up the whole money thing and I can't deal with that.

I brought it up once and he said that he was embarassed about not paying rent, and he agreed to pay me back (even wanted to take a loan to pay me back), and we calculated how much it would be (2000-something € at the time). We also agreed that everybody would be paying the right amout from now on. But after that just nothing happened, nobody payed anything, I didn't follow up and everything is just as it always is.

So, yeah I recognize that this whole situation is partially my fault. I should have from the very start bothered him to pay the rent every month, but I never did, and now I have no idea how to handle this situation except moving out and leaving everything behind me, which is really stupid, because this flat really is very cheap for the city we live in.

And for the record I am getting along with the other guys just fine. At this point I feel like me and pays-no-rent-guy have kind of started avoiding each other, being in out rooms more often, not talking much. But when we hang out we get along just fine, and I would consider these two people my friends, which doesn't make the entire situation much easier.

This probably sounds super stupid to most people. Maybe you are wondering how I can be chill when a guy owes me that much money, or how we can be friends at all. I'm honestly not sure myself, some days when I'm in my room alone I get super angry at him, myself and life in general, but I just can't bring myself to let it out on him. I just can't see myself starting to confront him or set him some deadline of whatever. 

Tbh I expect people will just tell me to talk to him, set him a deadline, throw him out, etc.. But I know already that I'm just not going to do it, and instead will probably just continue as always...

tl;dr: Flatmate owes me 3000+€ and doesn't pay rent, I have no idea how to confront him, because I'm probably too soft.",11May2019,1

309,"2 years ago, I started training for a 1 mile running event that happens at my school annually in order to break the school's current record. My initial reason for this was to do something no one else could/would do. Especially since i was never the athletic person, but more on the book side. I wanted to shock people, i wanted them to see how much I could do. The type of person I could be. To show the people who talked shit about me that I was getting this award and that my name would be on the record breakers list. Those two years, i trained and learned a lot of lessons but i didnt set the record. This year is my last school year so i started training around 7 months before the event. Now that i've gone through 4 of those months, im starting to feel as if theres no point in pursuing this. Why does the fame matter? Sure it'd feel amazing but running started feeling like a chore to me about a month ago and i used to see a few people from my school which made me very self conscious, thus adding more strain and chore-like feeling. I stopped running a week ago. I'm not sure if i should tell myself to shut up and do the training for these 3 months or just let it be since it doesnt add to my happiness?

310,"Ok, so about 6-9 months ago my old friend group dismantled. Kids moved schools and stopped talking to one another.

This one girl became really clingy to me and was always making sure that I would be at events and that the numbers would match up so that she would be with me (e.g. a small gatho where we were the only ones that weren't necessarily taken). (also at the time I had no idea that she would set them up like this I only found out recently after talking to some of her friends) anyway, I was sort of forced into a relationship with her. I was kinda fine with it because like what else did I have and at the time I didn't think much of it. Then I started getting texts from her friends saying how obsessed she was and how much she talked about me, so I was thinking that maybe this could be an actual relationship so we hung out a bit more. However, as mean as this sounds she isn't very interesting and lately, I have been not looking forward to talking to her and have become uninterested in her. She's nice and I could see myself hanging out with her as friends but I just don't see myself having a relationship with her. But here is my problem, I have found out that she has invested so much time into me that all her friends think we are really serious and because this is a new friend group I really don't want to fuck things up and by doing any form of dumping her in any way I could think of it would end with her friends hating me due to leading her on and stuff like that.

316,"Here’s the longer story (but the TL;DR is at the end): Ex (M22) and I (F21) were together for 1.5 years and engaged for 7 months, when he unexpectedly wanted to postpone the wedding. He had some good reasons (finances, job security, etc), but I think he ultimately just wanted out. Eventually through a month of counseling, we decided to end things and it was so painful, and definitely not what I wanted. It hurt like hell. But looking back, and after doing some self reflection, I realized we both had issues, and we very young and naive. I actually took a lot of the blame for things, realizing that I wasn’t perfect. 

Fast forward a year and a half of awkward encounters and minimal contact, we actually ended up getting back together. It started out good especially because we both had grown from our immature past. But slowly I saw that I think he was honestly just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. I really cared about him and wanted the best for him. He was going through a depressive state and some issues at work, and I was there whenever he needed to vent or talk about things. I didn’t mind being there for him, but the minute I wanted or needed him to be there for me he wasn’t. And he was just passive... wouldn’t start communication, wouldn’t initiative spending time together. I gave him grace because of his depression (knowing personally how hard that is) but it was hard to know whether or not he wanted to be together.

Eventually, he ended up breaking things off AGAIN. But here’s the reason why: he said it was because we didn’t share the same faith/religion (he was a Christian turning atheist, and I am Christian but NEVER pushed my beliefs on him), which I think was just a cop out. The more interesting thing is a week before he broke up with me, his brother broke up with his long time girlfriend.. reinforcing my belief that he was just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. It was hard for me because I loved him... the initial love never went away. It’s hard to forgot someone you imagined spending forever with (and at one time planned to spend forever with). But I just felt used and played. 

THIS IS WHERE I NEED THE ADVICE: 
Two months after our second breakup, he started dating this older girl who looks like me physically, apparently has a very similar personality (so my friends tell me), AND who is Christian. It really tore me apart, not so much that he was with someone else, but that someone I trusted so much could lie to me and use something so personal like my faith as a reason to break up. 

In two weeks, there is a work reunion... and he’s bringing her. And I REALLY don’t want to meet her. I’m sure she’s a very nice girl, and I honestly would probably get along with her. But back when I first found out he was dating her, I went through a bad mental breakdown, full of comparison and depression. It was not good. I’ve grown so much in the last six months and I don’t want to go back to that place mentally, especially seeing him with her.

Any advice? Anyone been through this before? I have to go because I’m coordinating the event (yeah, he sent his RSVP back to ME with his and her name on it.. talk about a coward). I honestly get a knot in my stomach thinking about seeing them together. It just hurts, you know? Any advice is welcomed. 

TL;DR: my ex and I have a very complicated history full of betrayal and a lot of emotion (broken engagement, got back together, lied, etc). He’s bringing his new girlfriend to a work reunion, and I just really don’t want to go but I have to. Any advice?",11May2019,3
317,"My mom just left her boyfriend, they've been together for almost 20 years, bought a house about ten years ago and married about a year ago, she is 57.

Long story short, it has always been a complicated relationship, he was very manipulative, cut her off most of her friends and ended up cheating on her for the last past months. She hesitated on leaving him many times after a few years with him, but she never got through and he always found a way to get her back, via emotional tricks and basically being the only thing she had left.

I'm supportive and have always been, I'm trying my best to be there for her, but I would gladly take advice on stuff that worked for other in a similar situation :)

She had a rough time lately, as her mom died two years ago, her dad was ill and died two months ago and her job doesn't pleases her anymore. She doesn't have many things left beside me and my sister and she is the kind of person that thinks it's the job of a parent to be there for the children, not the opposite, she will accept help from us but won't really ask for it.

If you have some hints on what to say to her, what to do, how to spend time with her, what to be careful of, I'm all ears.

Thanks !",11May2019,1
319,"I’ll be quick- I started going to another gym recently and had been seeing the same girl every day who would workout next to me. Soon we struck up conversation and it was initially about work and regular small talk.  She tells me she’s married and going to meet her husband later for lunch ( don’t know why she brought that up) anyways, we add each other on snap and start snapping all day everyday since. Three weeks later we’re meeting at the gym each day at the same time and and talking on the phone on the way home after the gym each day too. Now she has started with the “I like you” “ I really miss you” stuff which is cool but she’s married. Yesterday she stopped by my job to say hi and we sat in the car for a bit. We ended up kissing and she couldn’t stop talking about how much she wants me but she’s married and doesn’t know what to do. She obviously likes me and wants to hook up with me but she’s married. Now I’m starting to get feelings for her which is horrible. I know I’m the other guy and that makes me feel bad for her husband but we just can’t seem to stop talking. What do I do?",11May2019,1

322,"OK so there is this girl at work that I really like, she has a great personality (the thing I like the most) and on top of that she is gorgeous. We are pretty close together, we laugh a lot we spend time together during our breaks at work and we even went to see Endgame together 2 weeks ago. At that point I didn't know if she was into me or if it was her behavior with all of her friends. But now it's even worst.

2 nights ago we went partying together with 2 other colleagues, it was great. At one point she started feeling sick at the club. I brought her to the bathroom she threw up, she stayed in there for nearly an hour and I waited for her outside the bathroom. My 2 other colleagues told me to come and to enjoy the party, at first I said no, but they came back to me a few minutes later and I accepted. I told them that I would come back to her 5 min later. After the 5 minutes we took her out after I talked to her. I told her that she scared us (she had locked herself in the bathroom).

After having a hard time going back to the car we rested for about 2 or 3 hours. My 2 other colleagues and I were awake, talking while she was sleeping. I was on the back on the car with her, and the 2 of them was at the front. But the thing is that after we started driving, with the seat belt on she was laying on her left side (pretty much on me) I was rubbing and bit her arm during the ride and at one point I had to move a bit and when I sat back she asked to put back my shoulder were it was.

So basically I don't know if she is into me or if it was the alcohol made her act like that. She is a really great girl and I want her near me but the thing is that if she rectect me it may make thing a bit weird, and I really don't want that.

Can you tell me what I should do (I bet you're going to tell me to tell her what I feel) and most importantly how I should do it.",11May2019,1
323,"Hi I have a problem here about my best friend that i've known for 5 years. Lately I have been complaining a lot to my best friend about how she has been to me. She lied to me and manipulated me. I confronted her about it and we talked about it and resolved it. We were also a couple a year ago for about 4 months. 

The problem is is that she kind of left me behind for other people. I don't blame her, because all I did lately was complain to her and teach her 'lessons' as in why she shouldnt have done something.  I know that i should always tell her if somethings bothering me, but now it seems like that's the only thing we talk about. And she is kind of tired about it. It has become to that point where she would rather avoid me. So basically she has found other friends she's having fun with. And i really like that, but I wish that she would also like me. I want to show her that i'm still the fun guy she used to hang out with alot and text with. I don't want to force anything, but I'd like her to be happy when she sees me instead of expecting another 'lecture' or complaint. I would like to be her 'peace' again.

It made me so sad and angry that someone would dare touch him like that, and I said that I was sorry for this treble, awful thing that had happened and that I'd never do that, and that I'd wait for him to be ready, I'd go at his pace.

The day after I promposed one of our mutual friends texted me. She told me that he complains about me behind my back and that he’s telling everyone about how I asked him to prom.

She also said that he does this kind of often and that even his closest friends, who I’m also close to, knew that it was happening.

327,"So I met this guy in school and we became close because of an org. I have a crush on him because he was tall and very well-versed. 

We had this teambuilding for our org and there were alcoholic drinks involved. It was ayt for me but it was his first time to drink. We had this thing where were we formed a circle and everyone gets to open up to the person sitting beside us. Mind you we were all kinda tipsy and he was kinda drunk. I mistakingly opened to him that I have a crush on him but found out he has a girlfriend because of his wallpaper. He was flattered and told me I was very beautiful and wouldnt hesitate to ask me out if he was single. It was over and I proceeded to party with my other orgmates.

I didnt mind him and partied with my other orgmates but I noticed him staring at me. I talked to him and went into the pool so we could talk while doing a bit of splashing. I sat on the surface near the pool while he stood in the pool. He was about to cry and told me how he doesnt want to cheat. I grabbed him and pulled him to the nearest corner near our rooms for that night. I told him to stop crying and as long as he doesnt do anything about it its not cheating. I asked him ""why do you think youre cheating anyway""? He told me its because he cant stop thinking of how gorgeous I was and how he wants me. I got freaked out so I backed up a little and he asked me if he could do something in order to help him forget. Before I could object he kissed me and something happened between us. We kissed many times after that and became really close. 

Our org is now going to NY for a competition and let me tell you, NY made us even more closer. We hung out together by ourselves a few times, made out, kissed while waiting for the train, held hands, and worst is we had multiple sex.

I started falling inlove and I dont know what to do. I dont wanna tell his gf because I dont wanna be in the middle.

Dinner tends to be fast food or pasta

I, on the other hand, don’t feel like I’m ready because I would of liked to pay off my credit cards at the very least before deciding to move out (they amount to over 5,000; it doesn’t include the car loan, car insurance and student loan). Then he says to just look up apartments for himself. I don’t feel like he is including my overall feelings or including me in the process. It sounds like it’s either I move out alongside him or not. I don’t wanna take away from him having the opportunity to move out, but should something like this feel like a process we both consider each other’s predicaments?

337,"Hi, 21[F] here. My best friend [F21] had this weird thing going on with my guy best friend [M21] where she would let him touch her and shower her with gifts, despite the fact he has a GF overseas. I tried not to get involved. They would often disappear at parties together and get sexual. I was at a party a few months ago and they both disappeared again. I knew they were both paralytic drunk so after about five minutes I went to find them and I found them together in a bush. They didn’t have anything to say. My female BF was so drunk that I sent her home in an Uber and told my male BF to go to sleep. 

The next day she messages me saying she felt disgusting and that she didn’t remember any of the night. I told her I found her with him. She then says she thinks she remembers him touching her sexually and that she didn’t want it. I asked him what he remembered and he couldn’t remember anything either. I was raped when I was young so my first instinct was to cut him out of my life. I told him I couldn’t remain friends with him given the circumstances. 

Fast forward a few months and I’m at another party with him and I decide to be civil. I made the mistake of posting a photo with him on my general Snapchat story, without thinking about the fact I have her on there.

She proceeds to not talk to me, stops eating (sent me photos of her jeans not fitting - extremely underweight). I told her I was worried about her and I asked if there was anything I could do to help. When she finally did reply to my messages she said she’s “cut deep and really upset” and “if the situation was reversed she would never do that to me.”

I’m conflicted as to whether I should:

a) tell her I don’t think it is fair to accuse him of sexual assault given they were both really drunk and neither remember the night and risk losing her as a friend.

b) apologise despite the fact I don’t feel like I am in the wrong.",11May2019,2

341,"  I've been falling over a female friend of mine and I don't know how to express my feelings to her.

  

  I'm probably a lower than average guy, short with a bit of a feminine body and a belly, I can't seem to get rid off no matter how skinny I otherwise am. I'm very insecure about other aspects of my body, too - just guess, and basically have had no experience with the ladies whatsoever.

  What usually happens is, I will befriend someone, often without me initiating contact first, and may end up falling for them only after a period of hanging out, interacting. I'm just not the one-night-stand-bro type.

&amp;#x200B;

  I've interacted with her the most, we've gone out to parties together etc. and often will get drunk or stoned and in this moment of bliss and I just want to go foreward and kiss her, but I'm afraid of being so bold, because... She has a boyfriend, to boot.

  They've been together for half a year now, she's happy, he can offer her a lot more - he's made a kind of a name for himself, has a well-paying job with lots of opportunities and has many connections. I bet my bottom dollar he has a bigger dick than me, too. *Making light of myself.*

  She's never hinted at me of a future together or anything sexual at all. We once had to share a bed and she told me she felt uncomfortable, so I left. :( 

  However, other people can see a chemistry between us, nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

  We're in a group of friends, all female, I'm the only guy around and I fear it will burn all bridges if I try to pull something off. When we go out together, I usually end up not drinking and chaperoning them. I sense, that the other ladies feel I have a special desire for her and at times they've scorned at such an idea. I've not expressed anything infront of them and I've tried my best to show that I'm not some *gay boy toy*(sorry, don't mean to offend) that they just string around, inspite of my appearance.

&amp;#x200B;

  I just don't know what to do here. I've had two depressive episodes in part due to this heartbreak. I **know** she won't go for me, but still, what should I do?

* Should I wait for a moment of privacy between us on a night out, when we're a bit tipsy and just go for a kiss?(I swear to God, no unconsented rape shit here.)
* Should I use the exact moment to just express feelings?
* Or should I just ask her for coffee and tell her my feelings, no drink in sight?",11May2019,1
342,"I share a room with one girl, and the other has her own bedroom. But the one with the bedroom to herself has a room of the same size, yet pays $150 less for it (against my permission, but the roommate I share with okayed it without my consent). Since February, her girlfriend has basically been living with us. She's over here at least six nights a week. She's here when my roommate isn't. She cooks here, showers here, yet does not clean or contribute in any way.

I know that my roommate has been paying a little extra on the electricity every month because her friends are over a lot as well and do their laundry here, but I do not know how much it is because she never shows us the bill total. The last time I confronted her about an issue, she basically told me that it was not her problem (leaving the kitchen disgusting always, and that if it bothers me so much that I should clean up after her). 

I have brought up the idea with my bedroommate, but she claims it wouldn't be fair to ask the girlfriend to contribute, I think because my bedroommate had her boyfriend over often before I moved in and he never contributed. 

My lease ends August 1st. I plan to move out mid-June with a new roommate and my own bedroom and just pay both month's rents or sublet. Is it even worth the trouble for two month's rent?

343,"Apologies in advance for any mistakes as English is not my first language. I tried posting in r/needadvice before this, but didn't have enough comment karma. It's something that's been bothering me for some time and I'm at my wit's end.

So I've been having quite some trouble with an online friend. And for a bit of context, a former online friend of mine made me and my friend(who I'll refer to as F) meet when I was in middle school, first grade. At the time I already was in a stage of being bullied, etc, but she stuck by my side and was like my main reason to be somewhat happy and like being alive(this is also about the time where I got into a depression). But as years had gone by, especially the past year, she's started to treat me like I wasn't worth anything to her, and like I was just some inhumane person. F and I have a very very big tendency to argue over little things, that normally shouldn't be even worth arguing over, although she seemingly likes making me feel guilty over things, like bringing up certain things and blaming me for how she acts, just because she says 'she's owning up to what I've called her' in the past, during arguments(due to a habit of mine, where I judge current behaviour and tell them what they're acting like. A stupid habit since it has only ever backlashed on me, but a thing I can't help), but also constantly calling me dramatic for thinking that I'm being used for entertainment, and someone to complain to, but while I'm in reality just a very sensitive person, with autism so that brings up the point that she often acts as if I'm dumb for not getting obvious things like sarcasm or what a thing would 'sound like', which is already way harder through text. Whenever I confront her about these things, beside the fact that she just treats me as if she's superior to me, she either ignores all of my messages about it(like today), or just says she has no comments for it and continues on like normal, with the snarky remarks of me being 'dramatic', (example of this is her, without any reason, saying 'I'm going to proceed with my day without drama or anything' as if she were expecting me to start either a drama or an argument, simultaneously calling me the culprit of all drama and arguments that appear while she often provokes them herself by triggering these things with me while she's well aware of my mental disorders[ADD, autism and that I've had depression, even though it sure feels like I've fallen back down into one]). 

She just doesn't seem to care anymore, in the past when I would be down in the slightest, she'd be worried about me falling down even more, crying or other things like self harm[Don't support it, best to stay away from it, plus a thing I've been clean from for like 4-5 months now]. But now, I can tell her that I'm feeling down or having suicidal thoughts even, she just says okay and moves on while she did everything she could to help me back on my feet in the past. (Note: I know I should get help from others with this but knowing that suicide isn't a thing to joke around with, and a thing that causes great harm to people around, it's never ever ever a thing that should be considered, I know this, and by that, do not support it in any kind of way, but that is just one example to show how little my friend seems to care) 

I've been called so many things by now. A bitch, manipulative, toxic, guilt tripping, an asshole, a witch. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to lose her, but at the same time I don't want to be treated the way she treats me now. And each time that I try and discuss it with her, she ignores it, changes the subject or proceeds to call me over dramatic(has happened even when I was just talking about how I felt), or with saying that I was exaggerating.

Please, how do I solve this? What do I do in this situation?",11May2019,1
344,"My SD (8/f) started therapy this week with her mother and father (my husband). She has a been acting out at both households a lot lately. Being violent towards your mother and being very mischievous and difficult at our home. I have known her since she was 2. Her parents do NOT get along. I’ve been married to her father for three years, together for almost eight. Her mother actually told the therapist that she would like for me to be included in some sessions so everyone in each household can be included in her therapy. I am not comfortable with her mother. Her mother has NEVER been a coparent and has told us what we will do, when we will do it. She has told my husband for years what a loser father he is, has harassed us, called us names, told us we aren’t real parents, etc etc. 
Because of this, I reached out to the therapist myself, initially to see if she accepted our insurance and then followed up once I heard back from her, introducing myself and asking her if we could chat for a brief moment via telephone or email when she had a moment. Apparently, she immediately picked up the phone and called my stepdaughter’s mother, asking her why I was contacting her and what I wanted and if it was okay for her to talk to me. (I didn’t think about it until later but I understand that due to HEPA Laws, she will need parent permission from the biological parent to speak to me.) Regardless, the mother immediately texted my husband, completely flipping out that I had reached out to the therapist, wanting to know why and saying that I completely stepped out of line and was “bombarding” the therapist and that I was NOT supposed to reach out to her. My husband told her I simply wanted to introduce myself and discuss therapy in the future for a moment. She was livid and said EVERYTHING relating to the therapist needed to be done through her or in front if the therapist. The therapist and I had scheduled a time to talk so when I spoke to her later that day, I apologized for reaching out and I explained how upset my stepdaughter’s mother was. The therapist didn’t say anything about it. It was very awkward. This therapist sounds very young on the phone. I then further explained how uncomfortable I am with my stepdaughter’s mother, as she is a major trigger of my anxiety, that she has been threatening to us in the past and that anything we have shared with her in the past generally gets weaponized.  I explained how she is a blatant bully to us. I explained to her that I am definitely on board with my stepdaughter’s therapy but I would kindly request to meet with just my stepdaughter, her her father (my husband) and I. The therapist immediately piped up and told me that it was “her job” to run the sessions and that no one would be bullied in a session and things are not be weaponized. I explained that the weaponization usually comes later down the road and that I really am not comfortable with having a session with her mother. The therapist continued to say, “you are absolutely welcome to join sessions, the more information and support the better, as long as her mother and father are comfortable with you being there.” And continued on to talk about my stepdaughters therapy and why we are all doing this in the first place, as it should be! When we ended the conversation, less than 10 minutes later, I felt worse than I did before. I really feel like the therapist did not hear me, and did not care about what I shared about my SDs mother and her bullying and the trigger she is for me. I feel like the therapist acted very unprofessionally. Why would she have not replied to me upon my initial interaction with her told me she could not share anything about my stepdaughter’s appointments because of HEPA and that a biological parent we need to introduce me and give permission first? She started a LOT of drama by immediately calling my SDs mother and “telling” on me. She has my husbands information too, why not call him? Am I am the one that was completely out of line with all of this? Should I have just shut up and not said anything until the time comes? This sucks.",11May2019,1

346,"My uncle was recently diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer and stage 4 colon cancer out of nowhere and my family has been taking it really hard. My dad's family has already lost so many siblings and my dad is making every effort to spend time with his brother. However, some of my dad's customers recently told him about this supplement (IP-6 Isolitol) that cured all their relatives of end-stage cancer. There's evidence that it's good for *preventing* cancer, but my dad is fully convinced that this supplement is a secret in the pharmaceutical industry because cancer is a big money maker. The news of stage 4 cancer didn't seem to affect him much because he's so convinced.

 I tried telling him not to get his hopes up *too* high, since pancreatic cancer is basically a death sentence and I don't want him to be blindsided if it gets worse. But he keeps sending me studies with the supplement and telling me all these doctor testimonials. I want to tell him that if this product is a miracle cancer cure (among other things), then other countries with socialized healthcare wouldn't even have cancer because Big Pharma doesn't exist there. 

This whole situation is super messy and my dad has taken the deaths of his 3 other siblings really, REALLY hard and I'm afraid he's going to be completely unable to grapple with this when the supplements don't work. What can I do here? Can I do anything?",11May2019,3

354,"This year, I'm going in 12th grade and I haven't chose a course to go with when I graduate Senior High. I'm running out of time and I'm basically losing my mind and I don't want to make huge mistake when I'm in college in the near future. Maybe with your great analytical skills, I may be able to make a correct choice.

Here's a little bit of my background:

I am a STEM Student. I am particularly fond of Environmental Science and a bit of Biology. Can tolerate math but cannot live by it. I kind of like Research. I have been able to get perfect grades for the subject.

 Somehow average in communication skills although my teachers and peers told me otherwise, but I beg to differ.

My passion for things has been clearly diminished over time. There are times when I wanted to be a businesswoman and sometimes I wanted to be a soldier and etc. Clearly, as I got older, I kind of  lose interest and now I'm stuck with this stupid dillema of choosing a course. It always stuck to me as ""what-I-can-do-and-what-I-want"" type of situation. I am always exposed to people who graduated as this and later on ended up as something else, and sooner become dissapointed because of major issues and that's so messed up that someone worked their way through college to get what they want and in the end got nowhere near their goal.  I know we can't always get what we want but that's so unfair when you've so hard on something and resulted into something far beyond your ambition and slowly crumble your world. So, that influences me to think negatively.

I have gave in a lot of thought of what I wanted to be or what I can do and it doesn't seem to make me able to choose properly. I keep thinking about the pros and cons of some particular courses that I may be interested in but the cons outweigh the pros. I hate this kind of mindset.

There are some careers that I may be interested but I want you to choose guys which one Im willing to take risk into.

Soldier
Psychologist
Choreographer/Dancer (idk if there are existing courses for that here but that would be cool tho)
Nursing/Doctor 
Agricultural Engineer
Mass Communications (Like a news anchor or smth)

Most of you here are clearly experienced adults and I would like to consult you for wisdom and enlightenment.

My BF (35) has been friends with this guy Norman since they were teenagers and Norman has been in a relationship with Sarah for around 10 years (so we’ve all been friends as a group for around 10years) 

My BF, Norman and some other guys went on a night out and it turns out that Norman met a girl on this night out and has been texting her behind Sarah’s back. The guys all had another night arranged for a couple of weeks later and Norman asks one of the guys (Sam) to get him another ticker for the night. At the time Sam didn’t think anything of it but then Norman starts boasting in a group chat that he’s meeting up with this girl at the rave and it turns out the extra ticket was for her! No one could really believe it; him and Sarah have been together a while and they have a child together. But he was serious! He went to the rave and as soon as he got there he disappeared all night with this girl. 

I don’t understand why he had to involve everyone the way he did as now we’re all being almost forced to lie for him (Again) and he just expects us all to act like it’s nothing because he doesn’t think it is. Although I asked him what he’d do if Sarah did the same and he said “Kill her!!” So it’s massively double standards. I know it would absolutely destroy Sarah! She’s put up with so much shit from him over the years and mainly regarding his drug abuse (which again, he frequently gets his ‘friends’ to cover for him so Sarah doesn’t know how much money or how often he’s doing drugs.) 

I haven’t seen or spoken to Sarah for a while because I just not sure how to be around her. The whole thing has made me feel so uncomfortable and I feel awful for her that not only has Norman done that but a lot of people close to her know about it. I know I can’t keep avoiding her though as she text the other day wanting to meet up. I just hate him for how he treats her! And how he just expects us to compromise our morals for him because ‘we’re friends’ .. I can’t bare to be around him and my hearts broken for her. By BF is still talking to Norman on and off but has taken a step back from him.",11May2019,1

363,"We are both autistic. This woman never said she likes me as a boyfriend and explicitly said she only likes me as a friend and ever will, after I had told her that I like her as a girlfriend. However, her brother and our therapist told me she likes me as a boyfriend and was wary of dating anyone only because her previous ex inappropriately touched her. Our therapist also told me her mom told her she likes me as a boyfriend, and she and my mom told me that we are going on dates and she will later want to be my girlfriend if I am friends with her and do not call them dates now. Going forward, I never mentioned that I intend to be her boyfriend. She dropped obvious hints like initiating to hug and hold my hand, asking “Are you nervous?” on a date, a vibe, saying “after we are just friends” she can drive me around and asked what if we are an actual dating couple in the future.

After 2 months and before our 10th date, my mom called her my girlfriend, so I asked her to kiss me because I wanted to get my first kiss, and she said yes and kissed me with tongue. I asked her in person so she would not change her mind or get advice, and a break-up would be worth my first kiss. My therapist suggested I tell the group against my gut instinct and that we are official, and put me on the spot, so I did, but her brother said he will not tell. This should not distract judgment (not arguing, but it is insignificant context in the broad scheme). 2 days later, worried, I asked her if she is upset. She sent me a text saying “We are still friends and we will see each other tomorrow. It is not like we are boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. I just have a different agenda than yours.”. I asked her what I did that made her think I thought we were more than friends, and she said she was sorry she said that, but the damage had been done and was unable to take it back. I repeated the question and asked if we can still be friends ”like we were before we kissed”, digging myself deeper in the hole of agony and despair, and I told her that I will give her some time to decide if she truly wants to be friends with me. I showed my mom the convo, who advised me to apologize and say that I value the friendship and I did and then she apologized too. Ok, fair enough. I later realized that as often when not told something, people think of the worst case scenario, and it was not because I told the group, because she read the text and was already ignoring me before her brother could have told her.

The next day, she rested her head on my shoulder and said the kiss felt good, but gradually withdrew more distant in the next 7 weeks. She did not hug nor sit by me in the car because she feared it will lead me on. My mom talked to her mom who said she only wants to be friends. I ended the friendship because I did not want a friend who was uncomfortable around me, and at our therapists’ office I confronted her in the hall about our text conversation.

TL;DR: While I respect that she said we were just friends, **she made it very clear to me that she *KNEW* that I wanted more, but failed to tell me what I said or did that implied it, and I could have accused her of the same - yet continued to initiate affection and got surprised when I continued. When she said “sorry” it seemed to take it back and I had trouble distinguishing between “friends” when we made out and “friends” when she was distant.**",11May2019,1
364,"My sister married my ex.
Heres some backstory.  When I was 17 I dated a guy . Let's call him James. James was handsome,  kind, caring and funny. In my eyes he was and still is perfection. My sister sabotaged the relationship, intentionally. We were both invited to his 21st party but she lied and told our mother I wasnt. So of course my mother watched me like a hawk to ensure I didnt attend. The next day I see photos of her close to him, trying to sit on his lap and trying to hug him, while he is showing discomfort.  Long story short, 7 months later they announced they were dating and I was shut out. 2 years later they married. 8 years later he a guest at a friends birthday celebration hosted in my home. When I saw him it hurt. Bad. To me he is still perfection. Cleaning up at the end of the party, I was alone and I was thinking and accepted the fact that i still love James. I dont know how to deal with this. I obviously cant earn him back but 10 years later he is still perfection to me.  If I haven't gotten over him in 10 years, is there still a way to move on?

367,"Where do I begin? 

Me and my now ex-girlfriend, let’s call her Amy, broke up 1 week ago, and now I’m coming here for advice on how to proceed.

We met a year and a half ago in College, and it was like love at first sight. We became better friends than people we’ve known since grade school. We spent every night at each other’s house (we lived only a couple hundred meters apart,) and it was amazing.

However, college ended and we decided to try long distance. Knowing how difficult it would be, we still decided to give it a try because this felt different from all our other past relationships. It felt more solid, more pure.

And for the last 6 months, it worked. It was hard, because I had a job that required 12 hour days, starting at 6 am, and she went home to where she would be 2 hours ahead of me, but we found the time to call every night, and took some flights to spend a weekend together every couple of weeks. 

However, long distance started to take its toll, and then last week, I got the text.

I don’t feel comfortable sharing snippets from it, but “need some time to focus on my career”, “Time to get my life together”, and “you deserve a girl better than me.” However, she said that if, in the future, we decided that we need each other, we’ll give it another chance.

I trust this girl, and we agreed to stay best fiends, because we are still really close, but I can’t shake these feelings that I know I’ll never be able to shake.

374,"Tldr at bottom. 

So, I am currently with my girlfriend of 7 months and I have enjoyed it but I don’t think I have developed the same feelings for her as she has me. 

I believe this is relevant information:
In February I did something that I since regret and shouldn’t have (met a girl at a party, and sent her one text), my gf and I talked it over and she forgave me. 

I also talked about an open relationship 

She has been advised by the people she’s talked to to break up with me because of this but she refuses and wants to stay with me. 

I think this shows how committed she is to me. 

I am worried that I can’t form the same commitment with her or other people (I have felt this way in past relationships). I don’t know if it’s because the way I was raised (I had/have an emotionally abusive and occasionally physically stepmother), blurring the lines between love and anger. 

I am worried that I may never develop feelings for anyone like people have had in the past, is it a maturity thing? What can I do to better myself?

Tldr; my gf has way more feelings but I don’t reciprocate, has happened in past and I am worried if I can never reciprocate feelings.

They're offering me a decent amount to work front desk again for one of the eye care clinics.

388,"Me and my cousin, who's 2 years younger than me, were kind of a best friends. We grew up together and we liked the same stuff, had almost identical opinions about almost everything. We were inseparable and in contact every single day, until she stopped texting me and I was the one who had to initiate any kind of conversation, with almost no reply except for one or two words and emoji. I kinda felt betrayed, because that meant to me that she doesn't really care about what I want to share with her.

 About a month ago my second cousin (her older sister) had a birthday party so our family went there and I went to find my cousin coz I wanted to speak with her about usual stuff and also school-leaving exams that I had few days prior. She just stood there, without saying a word, nodding her head and just fidgeting,not wanting to look me in the eye. It was like she didn't want to hear what I have to say at all. That's when another guests came, one of them being a girl, same age as my cousin, who goes to school with her. She immediately went to her, without saying a single word to me and then they went to other room with my cousins son (6yo) and closed themselves there. 
I was really just bamboozled at this point and wondering wtf is wrong with her, because I knew that she doesn't really like the other girl since she told me that. So I was alone there like an idiot and I didn't go over there since it was clear that they don't want me there, and about an hour later I went home. 

That was a month ago and I haven't heard anything about my cousin. When aunt is visiting she doesn't even bring her up when we're talking and when my mother was at their place, my cousin didn't even show up to say hi.

 Now I'm wondering if it would be completely fine if I'd ignore her, either forever or up until the moment she apologizes and explains why she was behaving this way or if I should text her and ask her about it. I'm thinking about the first option though, because I'm the kind of person that stays offended and doesn't initiate anything until the second person apologizes.",11May2019,1

I’ll have to wait to get my first FULL paycheck until the 15th of June. Needless to say I’m a bit frustrated.

I heard the upperclassmen art students barely get any sleep and that its very intense and that the a level exams for it are very hard. My grades aren’t the best but they’re passing so going to art is a big risk and i don’t know if i should take it. Im scared that my creativity and my skill won’t be enough for this.

And i don’t have a “realistic” type of art style and i’m afraid my art teacher will be a fan of it and it will lead me to having a bad score. Another risk is that the pressure and stress will cause me to hate art completely.

Another thing is that if i’m going to take art classes, i’ll have to give up sociology classes which i love and have a very good score in.

I still don’t know what to major in university but I definitely want something creative and art classes will definitely help me in the future but is this worth the risk of failing high school completely?

397,"Hi Reddit,

I’d love to hear your thoughts on the situation I’m in. I’ve had a shitty week, and I found out this week that my ex boyfriend of 7 years has found himself a new girlfriend. I found this out when I was out running one day, she was just there with him. No text from him or anything after this, so I texted him to say sorry I didn’t say hello properly.  After this, a few days later, my dad was hospitalised with a blood condition he has developed in recent years. I texted my ex to tell him about this, because he was he person to know everything when my dad was originally hospitalised a few years ago.  He replied instantaneously, and just said he hopes my dad gets better , bearing in mind he didn’t reply to my first message.

We broke up a year and a half ago, but he was my first love and vice versa, and I always thought we’d owe it to each other to tell each other when we had both properly moved on, with significant others. Especially, as where I was running was close to his house so I know he has brought her home to his family. I have to say, my heart shattered into a million pieces, and I cried the majority of this week. 

I’m not blameless at all in the breakup - I cheated on him, we were having huge issues toward the end of our relationship. The day I cheated , I told him about it the next day , and we had a huge talk about everything. He wanted to try to fix it, but tbh I just felt like the shittiest person in the entire world, he had been the best friend I ever had , and so in cheating I lost everything I had - my best friend, my future , my whole world.

I just would love to hear from people who have been in similar situations - does the hurt and guilt ever fade? I thought I had gotten over this but seeing him with someone else , really has left me in a very very bad mental state. I don’t want to be bitter about it anymore , but me and my ex had a big conversation about a month and a half ago, and he was saying that he was so happy on own , he wants to travel the world ,  and not to feel tied down anywhere. So to then see him with someone else just seemed so contradictory, since he also said on the phone that he missed me and wanted to see me over the summer, and that he thought some day we would get back together.",11May2019,1

I got accepted to NYU from the waitlist. However, they can only fit me for spring 2020, which means I will be starting one semester after the rest of my graduating class, and catching up through the summer. I'm a bit worried about falling behind socially, I know I have to put in effort to make friends, but I do also suffer from mild anxiety and depression which may worsen homesickness/make me want to stay in more and not socialize. I also have a tight deadline to decide about my offer otherwise I lose it.

I know studying at NYU will be a great opportunity because it's in a great city with lots of art and culture and people, but I'm a bit anxious about leaving home to a different country. I always have said that I want to go out, start a new chapter of my life in a place where no one knows me, in addition to being at a great school with great networking opportunities and resources.

NYC and NYU are both also incredibly costly, I'm also pretty sure my financial aid got denied (I checked and it said something about ""inquiry denied"" so I have to call the offices when they open). My parents have said they will financially support me completely, but I also am convinced that my mom is only really pushing for it because she wants bragging rights (that her kid got into a US school and is ""living life in NYC"").

I'm also not sure about the program/school I applied for (I asked around and most say I can change majors or transfer if I really want to); I originally applied because I wanted to work in clinical psychology or do social work, but now I'm looking more towards teaching or environmental business.

I've been accepted to some programs and unis locally, and they're also amazing. I've been pretty set on going into environmental business. I definitely won't regret going to my local unis, but I worry that I'll regret not giving NY a chance.

I have $60 in my wallet and behind on bills. I borough money from my friend to pay my rent this month.

I am thinking of going to a homeless center in Toronto because I know if I am in Toronto I have more chances to find a job in my field. (I am a lash technician/beautician). Where I live people don't use this services as it's a poor area.

My question is can I go to a homeless center in Toronto if I live outside of Hamilton?  And do I need to wait here until my rent expires and I can't pay anymore or I can just go now? I don't know how I will survive for another 3 weeks here alone with my baby and without knowing what will happen after. I feel like I'm entering in depression but I can't allow this because my daughter only has me. I am so stressed out that I'm getting rashes on my skin and my hair is falling.

428,"So I found out the day before mothers day that my mom committed suicide, and left a note. My older sister who has mental illnesses was trusted to keep this a secret (after my uncle disclosed all of this to her while drunk) but keeps going through anxiety attacks, and being really depressed. She tells me almost a year after she found out that my uncle ripped up the note(s) and blames my older sister and I for my mom's death. He also said he wanted to put a gun in my mouth and watch the bullet come out the other side. I would assume the reason he would want to do that is because my mom probably wrote down my name and reasoning in this note(s) because of our terrible relationship after my parents divorce. More or less I want advice to figure out how to get him to tell me the truth about all this, because I was told she drowned, and not that she took a ton of medicine and alcohol then died in a pool. All I want is for him to tell me the truth about what happened and what he knows.",11May2019,2
430,"I just turned 21 and i'm terrified that I don't know who I am. I know i'm insecure. These last three years, moving to London, the people i've met and the (sometimes fucked up) situations i've found myself in, have taught me that my confidence is fragile and probably dwindling.

I don't know if it's an age thing. Everybody talks about feeling lost in their twenties but I don't think that's what this is. I'm still an extrovert but i'm not sure i'm proud to be. I remember when I was younger, just this unshakeable belief that whatever I was doing or saying- whatever decision I had made was the correct one. Consequently, I made a lot of bad decisions but I was never as anxious as I am now.

It's like, i've suddenly become hyper-aware of that most of the things I do and say are performative, for the attention of others. I hate it, yet it carries on. Every time I adjust my accent to match the people i'm with, when I fake laugh at a joke, when I moan during sex. As an African woman who grew up in Yorkshire (in a very small very white city) i've become very good at making myself palatable for others, at shapeshifting sometimes at the expense of my own comfort. It's like I don't know how to turn it off.

I feel painfully inauthentic and hollow sometimes. Does everyone experience this? Is this what it feels like to grow up?

Granted, its gotten me quite far. I'm proud of what i've made of my time at uni and the life i'm starting craft for myself. I like my job (really like it, for the first time) and i'm friends with some phenomenal people. I guess i'm afraid that i'm not a phenomenal person, or don't deserve the great things in my life. I don't think i'm a bad person but i'm not sure i'm a good person either. No act is truly selfless, so when I help people, give change to the homeless, directions to tourists etc. The gratification is usually followed by guilt.

Despite coming from a multi-faith household, I don't believe in religious morality but I value earnestness and life and I think it's important to show gratitude for life in being kind to other life. But then I eat meat, and am sometimes very judgemental, superficial and spiteful (both outwardly and inwardly). I guess what I want to know is, is this the human condition, ,or do I need to try harder to be myself and if so who is 'myself'? how and where do I find her?",11May2019,1

433,"I grew up in a tight knit family. My cousin (the abuser) and I had birthdays 5 days apart (she is 2 years older then me), so naturally our parents decided on shared birthday parties for a majority of my birthdays from 5-9 years old. We spent a lot of time together aside from those parties, she spent the night at my house I spent the night at her house etc. Her mother is my fathers sisters and they had a great sibling relationship too. I can remember lots of instances where she would take me into her bedroom, tell me to lay on floor and she would take my underwear off and touch me. She would insert things into my vagina, one instance I can remember crying while she was trying to insert a Barbie into me. She would do other abusive behavior that I really don’t care to elaborate on. She did this for years, I honestly don’t remember the point in which the abusing stopped. I’ve mostly tried to block those memories out of my mind. 

I never told anyone. My cousin used to tell me that everyone would say I was lying and I would get in trouble and as a child, I believed her. 

Over the years, I buried those times deep inside of me....but my dad died recently and now that he’s gone, I feel really vulnerable, I’m thinking of things I haven’t thought of in years, I feel like I don’t care about keeping the peace anymore. I would like to tell my family what this person did to me, she has been a child of her own now and I sometimes wonder if she is also abusing her daughter the same way she abused me.

438," 

I do not usually post to reddit and in fact, I am new here. It just seemed like a way to try to get myself, out of the hole I have been in. To put things in to context I am a university student and am the oldest of my siblings.

For the last 10 years, I have felt increasingly lonely and isolated from everyone, something which is getting worse every year. It has got to the stage where I really do not know what friends are anymore and if I even have any. I am not a person that one would consider lonely. I am outspoken and a active guy. In fact stressed i feel the more outspoken I become. I do sports and lots of hobbies, and I am not a person who stays couped up all the time. I am always told that am a helpful and nice person, and I cannot really think of everyone who dislikes, bar one guy. I can be a little seroius, but although I appear as a happy person.

But I don't think I have any friends that I can turn to, and when I try to hang out with people. I am always the last one involved, no invites me to anything. All my 'friends' resently had parties. Only one, of them invited me. And part for me, everyone else was in their own click, so i felt like a black sheep. I know I don't drink, and that is probably apart of it, But i feel that i cannot relate to anyone. This feeling has got worst recenty sently. As I have tried to start dating, as I have never had a relationship. So I wanted to try to be in one, hoping that, as it had my friends, helped them. This has failed, miseraly. It's not like am ugly or anything. It's not as if am shriek. In fact I am quite toned. I have had, what ?14 dates this year, all if which have not gone anywhere. It has ruined my confidence. I do not want to tell my parents as they have enough issues on their plate, and as the oldest I need to be strong for my siblings.

I have tried to focus on my work, but now, it has gotten in the way. Getting me into bad habits.  

These feelings usually go away after around 2 months. But this era year, I have felt terrible. 

I really have no idea, what to do. Is this normal? Or is something wrong with me?

439,"So, when I was around 21-22 or so, I got my first apartment, however it was just a few blocks from my parents house in a small town.  
I lived there for about 10 years or so, and leading up to moving into the place i am currently in, the building went up for sale and was bought. The new owners decided to kick everyone out, remodel, and then jack up the prices +300$. So being that I was on a fixed income, I couldn't afford it and had to move.   
In the approx 2 years leading up to moving to current locations, I had tried to express to my parents that I should move as soon as I can to no avail, and we then had to scramble to find a place.

&amp;#x200B;

The first apartment in this building I am in now was a total dump,  had a well or reserve water thing in an unfinished room, just a bare floor and wall. The neighbor's bar 1 are or were batshit crazy as well, the guy beside me tried to get me drunk (can't handle his alcohol) and wanted to have sex with me. another is a raging drunk, but sometimes we get along, another is an older lady who is batshit crazy and gets food from her helpers, that she will go and take a pie or steak to trade for 3 cigarettes, another had 30 cats and kept all of his clothes in bags. The list goes on and on.

So, after 2 years staying in the first apartment here,  the guy with the cats moved away to the hospital, something had happened to him, and he eventually died there, They did some renovations since this unit at the time was rat nasty, tile floors and new walls. There's still a window that needs to be trimmed and an unhooked up gas heater that needs to be removed, but the landlord won't work on them.

At first, I was able to walk into town, but now there is a neighbor 2 doors down, living in a garage, smoking meth or crack with his buddies,  and he has 2 large aggressive dogs,  which bar my only path into town. I have a phobia of large aggressive dogs like this,  so I always take the transit into town and back.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally had enough when one of the crazies decided to put a lock on the hallway leading to his apartment door, which in the hallway is the electrical  panels (the electric is fucked here,  and can't use certain sockets while the guy beside is using them.) and i had to get in one day because the power went off and he started flipping his shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past 6 months or so, I have been looking at apartments, and the ones that fall in my range have either been really far away, way too expensive, or way out of town (don't have a car).

I've finally located a spot that is right downtown in a fairly large city with a good transit system. The price is good, but the main issues are that it is probably small (haven't seen inside yet, doing work on walls/floors, claim 500sq ft) 2 hours drive from parents, and it's above a store, well, more specifically an adult store.

I'd also need to work out what I'd do to get all my stuff there, but I imagine if I gave my current neighbors some cash, and rented the U-Haul van, that I could probably get it all there in one piece.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told my parents this, and how I could save around 100$ a month in bills, they wanted me to look at gear to income housing in this area, or that they would subsidize  100$ a month for me to stay local. My mother lost her appetite a bit and was crying a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: I'm thinking about moving to a larger city into a smaller apartment, but my parents want me to stay local.I just sort of want to get on with my life and away from this terrible apartment unit. I am going to set up a viewing for it next week or the week after to at least check it out to make sure the taps work etc.",11May2019,2

He just isn’t “right”. He’s dating a fifty-something year old and I think he’s just in it for the wrong reasons. My mom mentions it a lot and it makes me really uncomfortable. Ya see, my mom is kinda weird. She talks about things she shouldn’t be saying at all in front of her children. But that’s not the point of this. My two older sisters were called by him drunk about a week or two ago, saying how much he “missed us” and how much he “is sorry” and all that shit. I think he called me too, but I blocked him months ago so I’m not sure. I just want to know if I should be mad at him, or if I should give him pity for what could happen to him in the future. I’m mad at him, but then again, I miss him. He used to be a good brother. He sang to me when I was younger. I watched the movie Jersey Boys with my mom and when Frankie Valley sang “Your Just Too Good To Be True” to his daughter, I started crying. That’s the song my brother used to sing to me.

I started working again last March. 

The company that I’m working for is an outsourcing company and the clients are US based, so there are two shifts for it (morning and night). When I started, I was at the morning shift – most of the people that I was with were fine, I got along with most of them and even made a friend. 

After a month, they moved me to the night shift, so I was with a different group of people again. It’s been almost two months that I’m working the night shift and I can’t wait to gtfo of it, because I can’t stand working with some of my teammates anymore. 

Two of my teammates keeps on making fun of me. They like to make fun of me because I’m Chinese. 

At first, it was tolerable, calling me Chinese and all that.. But last night, I really wanted to tick already. It was the first time in a long time that I wanted to cry cause I was so pissed already. But I held it together…

So, someone from the office came back from vacation and bought some Chinese delicacies. Obviously, two of my teammates thought it was okay to make fun of me AGAIN. 

\--

Below is the actual event that happened.

O1 – Officemate 1 

O2 – Officemate 2

M – Me 

\--

O1: What’s this?

M: Oh, I know that! That’s plum candy, you should try it out. It’s good. 

O1: Well, obviously you know. You’re Chinese

O2: Yeah, she is right. You Chekwa. Chekwa, Chekwa, Chekwa (she repeated it 3x)

M: Lol, okay. 

\--

I don’t understand why they have to do that? Is it wrong to be Chinese? And tbh, I’m not even full Chinese. My Dad is, but he didn’t even grow up there. My Mum is not Chinese. I’m “half-Chinese.”

It’s probably my fault why they make fun of me because I don’t fight back, but I don’t want to stoop down to their level or waste my energy fighting with people who aren’t even worth it. 

I might consider reporting them to the HR team since I have a lot of witnesses who heard/saw this incident. Also, I’ve talked to my friend from a different team about this issue. She said that my teammates are really like that and I should just get used to it, but she won’t be surprised if someone resigned because of how they are. 

That is all. Hoping to get advice on this.. How do I deal with them further?

I’m 17, mom and dad are 61 and my mom’s aunt is 81.

So, the thing is my mom’s aunt used to live with my grandmother, my mom’s mother, but last year she passed away in a tragic way, so this really affected my mom, and since her aunt isn’t capable of living by herself, she brought her to our house. My mom spent some time going to a psychologist but eventually got tired of it and stopped. She got tired of it because she’s never liked psychologists and she thinks they’re all weird so it wasn’t helping that much, but at least she talked to somebody about how she felt, because she doesn’t talk about that to me or my father. Now, we didn’t really mind living with her aunt, since my mom has two sisters who agreed on taking care of her monthly and we thought it would be okay. We didn’t consider the fact that since my mom feels guilty about my grandmother’s death, she would keep her aunt in this house for a whole year. 

It’s been terrible. We never had a great communication, but now we don’t even talk like we used to, it’s just arguments the whole day. When we’re all together, my mom just talks to her aunt, but since she’s deaf, she has to yell so she can understand what she’s saying, so no one else can talk while they are talking. 

Her aunt is probably mentally challenged, so my mom can’t really take care of her. Her aunt doesn’t eat if someone doesn’t give her food, she’s afraid of microwaves, stoves, light switches, bugs, and a bunch of other things, so she needs someone constantly with her, but she’s alone during the day because both of my parents work and I have to go to school. We have three dogs, and they all have to be in a dog kennel that’s big, but it’s just made for the size of one dog, because my mom’s aunt is afraid of them but refuses staying just inside of the house.

We are so fucking tired. My mom doesn’t act like a normal person anymore. Her mental health is deteriorating quickly, and mainly because she can’t take care of an 81 year old mentally challenged woman, but she won’t admit it, and she just throws her anger at us. 

I just want to know how can I make her understand that what she’s doing is not okay. Her aunt is not getting proper care and my dad and I are so fucking done with this. I spend very single weekend morning crying because I’m just so fucking tired and I just want a normal life with my family, and I hate to hear arguments the whole day because of this situation.

(I live in India so that’s when schools generally open for a new academic year). I try to spend at least half an hour to one hour on each subject per day and throughout April I think I was doing fairly well. I was sticking to everything, I tried my best. 

But as May rolled around, my motivation and confidence has completely plummeted into the ground. I still manage to muster up some inspiration and try to work for as long as I can.

What I’ve noticed throughout this entire thing, is that my weight has become lower, my diet has been irregular and I’ve been feeling more robotic and empty. My family and friends have told me countless times to take a break from all the studies and work, since it is the holidays for me afterall. I try to, but whenever I do, an immense wave of guilt washes over me and I feel like I’m drowning in it. I feel horrible when I play videogames or watch a few episodes of a show on Netflix. 

I’m having problems managing my time and I’m very stressed because of my family’s financial problem.

If I had made my choice to switch schools last year, my family wouldn’t have taken a huge hit money-wise. My mom is always reminding me of it, and she’s right. I feel horrible and disgusting because of it. What makes the feeling even worse is that I try my best to cut down on costs, but my brother and mom don’t seem to do the same. 

Over the past two months, I have become obsessively frugal, emotionless and I have no idea what to do. 

I struggle so much with managing my time wisely, even when I study I feel like I have to keep going on and on otherwise I’ll fail school and college. I’ve been losing track of time. I haven’t been eating correctly and I haven’t been doing things I enjoy, like playing the bass guitar or reading books, because I fear that I’ll never catch up on studies.

451,"*\*Throwaway account for privacy\** I was recently visiting a friend, and he casually mentioned that he got into some credit card debt of $15,000 a little while back.  He didn't bring it up on his own, it was almost mentioned in passing as something related to the topic we were discussing, not because he felt he had to get something off of his chest.  While he has since stopped using the cards altogether and claims that he is getting it under control, his spending habits seem to not have changed much (financing unnecessary purchases \[most likely not for 0% interest\], etc.) and I'm not sure he realizes that getting out of credit card debt (which pretty much all carry very high interest rates) is an uphill climb that requires being strict with budgeting.  When I tried to politely pry for more information, he just dismissed it saying ""No worries, it's getting better.  I stopped using the cards and just make the minimum payment each month.""  I pointed out that the minimum payment is simply covering any new interest and avoiding incurring a late fee, while barely or not even touching the principle balance (if still directly to the credit card company and not through some consolidation loan setup).  He didn't seem offended but also didn't seem to grasp the implications of carrying this debt and taking more time than necessary to pay it off.

455,"Hello

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've had this problem for as long as I can remember. I've always been a dreamer. I always had high hopes for myself and when I see something I really want to do, I get butterflies and I start to work towards it. But suddenly, whether it be out of laziness, depression, anything... I will hit a wall and just cant pick myself back up. There is also times where I will want to do so many things at once and I cant make a decision, so I just try to do a bit of everything and I eventually fall off of that, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Im a petite girl with a small butt and small thighs. A couple summers ago, I went through a bad breakup and was cheated on with countless girls who were thick and curvy. I've always wanted a nice butt, so I decided I'd do a favor to myself and start working out. I started a booty program created by an influencer. I have never been so dedicated to something in my entire life. However, a couple months went by and I didn't see any results. I hadn't been eating enough protein and calories to bulk up. Suddenly, I completely stopped. I was really depressed. Every couple of months, I'll try to pick it back up again and I will workout. But once again, I'll get depressed and then out of laziness, I will just give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are all the things I've started to do, and am still interested in doing, but have given up on at least once:

\- Singing (big one)

\- Working out

\- Streaming (I love games)

\- Playing guitar 

\- Art (drawing, painting)

\- Writing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Others:

\- I dream of having my own Etsy shop to sell things like BDSM related collars and decos, as well as another to sell my own art.

\- I also dreamed about having my own youtube channel to sing and play music on just for fun. I've wanted to sing since I was a little girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's also probably relevant to mention that I have Body Dysmorphia (BD) so I struggle with depression and self esteem. I HAVE been to therapy. It didn't work for me, but I was only in for a couple months because I couldn't afford it. 

&amp;#x200B;

ANY and ALL advice/criticism is appreciated. I am so over this bad habit that I've had for years. I just want to commit to things I want to do. Thank you",11May2019,3
456,"I just got a new job as a cake decorator. Before, I was a cake decorator at a locally owned grocery store. Everyone loved my cakes and my originality; all the positive feedback made me want to explore what artistic abilities I have to offer. 

I started applying at big, notable bakeries throughout my city and long story short I nailed an interview for THE most notable bakery in the city. Got the job. 

Now that I’m here, I don’t feel like what they do is what I’m passionate about. I love expressing myself through cake decorating (my ex-coworkers said they could tell my mood by the roses on the cakes) and everything they do here is by the book. Color by numbers. 

Everyone here has degrees in cake decorating/baking. They went to school specifically so they could make a rose out of buttercream. I found my passion alone. My style is very different from theirs but I’m willing to learn.

I feel horrible. Not because the criticism is offensive, I strive with criticism. I feel horrible because I feel like I’m holding everyone back. My writing is not up to par, I have to scrape cakes, and I can tell everyone is turning their noses up at my cakes when they see them. 

Should I give up now and go back to what I was doing? I was more comfortable at my old job but I really do want to see what talents I have and I can’t exercise that need at the old job. I also don’t want to hold back the people at my new job because what they do is great. Maybe I just can’t keep up?",11May2019,1
457,"In short, I need to get somewhere and get back from somewhere. Let's call the somewhere Atlantis. I arranged the getting back from Atlantis but could not arrange the getting to Atlantis. Person in question, let's call him Jared, then said he could get us to Atlantis with all our stuff (it's a lot of stuff, not going to get into detail what it is but let's call it archaeological tools). 

\*Few months go by\*

It's now the current day.(literally a few moments ago) Jared says: ""welp I can't bring you guys, I can only bring myself. Could you still bring me back though, from Atlantis?"" I say f\*ck you to him and end the conversation by saying: ""of course I am not going to bring you""

So now I am left to sit on a giant fucking turd, while I have an extreme amount of work and the deadline to getting to Atlantis is FAST approaching.

Guys what do I need to do: I have other people stressing out like me because they also relied on this Jared, they are frantically searching for a solution but for the life of me I don't know what to do.

I really need advice on solving this situation and whether I should allow Jared to come back with us.....

459,"Hi. I'm (36f) from scandinavia. This is gonna be hard to formulate properly. But I'm gonna try to keep it short. I am 2 years single now and actually quite happy with that. I'm a semi geeky introvert with 2 cats and 2 friends. I'm self reliant on pretty much everything. But I feel I am missing a connection.. I guess an emotional connection or something along those lines. But the trouble is.... I am not interested in dating/sex like ppl are doing these days. I tried tinder. And it made me annoyed. Everyone is in a fucking hurry. I could barely have a chat with a guy without it turning to sex. And if it wasn't sex then it was about setting labels after a few hours of chatting. 
For contexts sake. I am not a pretty woman or slender fit girl, or anything like that. I can pass for cute(ish) and I know I am really easy to talk to and I have a good sense of humor. 
But the thing is. I go to work 3 days a week. The rest of the time i spend at home in my ""bubble"". Gaming and binging tv shows and such. 
So here is the rest of the issue. I grew up being mercilessly bullied from the age of 3 and to I was 16. I could never finish my education because I literally crashed when I met the working adult world. And I went from relationship to relationship. Trying to love and be loved. But that didn't pay off. 5 years ago I met the man who broke me for good when it comes to men. Gaslightling, substance abuse(his), psycological abuse of me, forcing sex and me to be his handmaiden in lack of a better word. It was a 3 year hell. It has made me weary of men and their intensions. I know I am a person that needs time when it comes to trusting someone and building what might become a relationship. 
So here it is. I want to make a friend. Have an emotional connection of sorts. Someone with common interests and standpoints. Yes I got my issues. But I got a good handle on them and I know what is ok and not ok for me. 
The question is. How/where is there a forum for me to meet someone. ""Going out"" on the town does not work for me. And I just dont wanna be exposed to more skeevy men who just want sex or to use me. Just wanna meet a nice, honest, childfree, drug free guy my age. Sorry if I come off as commanding and complicated. But idk where to turn about this.",11May2019,1

I work in metal production. My work is rather repetitive, and i dont have to constantly speak to people.  I would love to listen to some sort of music, or even better: podcasts and audiobooks.

How do i listen, so i can actually hear (its really loud, i have to wear ear-muffs or i get headaches) and not be instantly noticed?   
Currently im wearing ear muffs that cover ears, and try to get the cable under my shirt, but it can be noticed a little. I also wear cap to protect hair from sparks if that helps.

468,"Hello

Ahm... This is hard but I need rly advice, idk if this is the right place to post this but yeah

So I have a few questions and I hope someone here can help me.

There's a bunch of things in my head and idk what it is, idk if all of this happens because I'm just crazy or do I have any desorder.

To start off one of my main problems is that I think I have an OCD, a religious one. If I don't ""pray"" something every X minutes I start to get crazy and feel like a demon is coming or something.. Ik it's weird af but it's rly scary and this srsly destroys my life because I have to do certain things in certain periods of time or I start to get crazy. Once again idk if this is an OCD that's why I'm here.

Not only this but I feel like I have a problem in mood, one day I'm extremely happy with my life and everything is fine, and suddenly I get rly sad and depressed. I also try to change my life rly frequently. What I mean with this is that for example:I decide to be better, I start to watch motivational youtube videos and do exercise and everything. One week later something goes wrong and I immediately change and think ""from now on I'm just gonna isolate myself and be with my own things and not talk to anyone"" and 2 days later I change to something like ""oh I'm going to try to fit in and be popular""... And these kind of thoughts are rly frequent you know, I keep drastically try to change my life because I have no idea what to do, one day I decide to act as nerd, on the other I try to be more social, on the other day I start to follow religion, then I start to question it and stop going to churche ... I'm just lost

Another problem that is sometimes something gets in my head, most of the times it's an image, sometimes it's a thought, and it just doesn't disappear I wanna think about something else and it just doesn't leave me and idk what to do. 

I also have conversations with my thoughts sometimes, like I don't know my opinion about something so it's like my head has two sides discussing it but it's rly aggressive idk how to explain. I try to convince myself on thinking something and having a certain  opinion (for example about a movie) but at the same time I think the opposite, it's rly fucked up cause it occupies my mind 24/7 and I just can't convince myself to like/dislike something but I can't do the opposite. It's like I have two voices in my head contradicting each other but one of them is my main and is the one I want to agree with but then there's another feeling trying to oppose... 

So yeah... Idk what are these, I'm 16 and idk if this is normal, idk if I'm overreacting, idk if it's a depression, I know nothing... If anyone could help me I would be rly thankful",11May2019,1

I am 19 years old (M)  and in college. I have had only one girlfriend in my life, and that was about 5 years ago. That ended really bad. She called me names, I called her names, parents got involved. Fucked me up mentally too. I have been scared that if my parents found me talking to another girl, it would be the same thing. I know it won't be, since I've matured, but that fear is with me. My emotions are now out of control because there is a girl I've known since I was a kid (14). She is two and a half years younger than me, and our families are real good friends. Our parents hang out almost every week. She has a brother which is my age, but we don't hang out as much as we did before. He went off with other friends that vape and blast rap music in their expensive, pimped out cars. I also work with his dad (he got me a job) and he is really chill.

My gf comes from a very traditional family. They firmly believe in gender roles, and didn’t want my gf to go to school because she needed to serve her husband. She went to school anyways and she’s studying for her BS in Neuroscience rn. Her brother has been really protective over her and makes her tell him everything she is doing. If he finds out she’s out with friends he’ll FT her randomly and ask her to see who she’s with, where they’re going, and reprimand her for her grades or smth like that. She was used to do this, and she didn’t mind it that much, but it was once he found out about me (her bf) that he went crazy. 

He made her come home every single weekend, he’d constantly give her shit about me and say I wasn’t good enough for her, say I was the reason she wasn’t doing good in school (which she was, it’s her freshman year in pre-med and she’s only gotten one C, everything else are A’s and B’s), and then that it was wrong for her to marry outside of her race. This was his biggest point. He didn’t like the fact that I was Hispanic and he thought that I was going to ruin their family. He’s threatened to tell their dad and eldest brother about us and they’re way more traditional than he is. This terrifies her b/c she has no idea how they’ll react, she even thinks they might disown her or stop helping her pay for college as a punishment. 

The only semblance of hope is that her mom really likes me. I’ve met her a few times and she always says I’m a nice respectable guy, but I’m not sure how much she’ll be able to do, and if she even wants to get into this.

Well Hello Redditers! First of all this post is not related to any major thing, but its a bit major for me. where do i start. Lets say in this post ill give a summary of the things i do . I am 19 years old and I am from India. I grew up in the Middle east. used to visit my country once in a while (lets say visited 7 times, more or less). Now I'm in Canada pursuing an Advanced Diploma Degree in Seneca College. After finishing the diploma, planned on doing Honours from Seneca or Mcmaster University. I came to Canada 5 months ago. Just finished my 1 semester in the program CTY (GPA 4.0, sorry bragging lol). In mid sem 1, i put out a transfer req to CPA and got accepted. This is what I am, summary of it where Im from and what im doing currently.

Now to the problem I am having. I consider my self half Introverted and half extraverted. when I meet new people, i usually dont talk to them unless they knock me first. But when they do, I dont stop. I am the type of guy that thinks a lot about almost anything. doesnt matter big issue or small. if any one wants help from me, i do the best I can. My worst fear is losing friends and not being trust worthy. Ill go straight to my problems here -

1. I am ready to help anyone on any matters. Break up? Im there, Fighting? Im there. literally any thing. but lets say when there is a fighting between 3 friends including me. I'll try to stop them but when they ask whos right or wrong, if i pick sides, the other frind will stop talking to me and what not. what do i do in that situation? i dont wanna lose friends. Another example can be the lets say a gaming clan my by me and my frineds. everything goinig good and suddenly a drama happens. the clan gets divided into 2. lets name them A and B. A is the one with every old founders, and B is the one who got into drama with the founders and got seperated. Now i sticked with A, but my frineds on B started to neglect me. I dont wnat to lose frineds, so what do i do?
2. I want some with ideas about flowcharts answer this ( or some one can understand this situation). Well during my class today we were learning how flowcharts can help solving big problems by dividing them up into a visionary way. As i mentioed above, i overthink a lot. the prof gave us a question, the question is -  
Q) A girl wants to jump over a box. The carer told ' you can jump unitl you are tired but, you cant jump more than 20 jumps'.  
we were divided into groups, all of my group drew like this (cant draw here just writing serially (flow charts)) - START --- IS SHE TIRED? IF YES END, IF NO PROCEED -------- IS THE JUMP &gt; 20? IF YES END, IF NO THEN JUMP and GO BACK TO IS THE JUMP &gt;20.  
But what i did was write likes, i wrote everything they wrote but i had like extra options, like does the girl want to jump? if yes procced, if no end. --------- did the carer give permisioon? if yes then jump, if no end.  
I had this extras. did i overthink this small problem? if so how do i manage my self from not to overthink?  
there are more of similar type of examples in my life, as i told above about the clans thingy, its real, not made up. I put every effot i can give towards the clan. like making or building something inside. i usually flood them with more information then what we need just to make sure evertthing works perfectly. but most of the time, many gets unseened. As my prof said, to solve problems in programming we need to brainstorm and get every details as possible. am i doing it right for my flow charts thingy? if not, how do i do the right way. I have huge dreams on becoming a software developer and work for a giant corporation like IBM or Microsoft. will thinking more effect my dreams on becoming a software devoloper?

Im very sorry for this big ass message, i was just typing what came to my mind. and sorry for shitty english.

im extremely worried and i have attacks and i cry all the time. i miss him and i hope he feels slightly better. what to do? thank you so so much.

I didn’t have crazy religious parents that told me being gay was wrong or anything; I was raised normally with accepting parents. Again, up until this point I have been totally straight, but now I’ve been losing sleep and i think I’m starting to become gay. I still like girls, but they’re turning a bit less attractive to me.

490,"Hello, I am using an anonymous account because I think my brother knows my main account. My brother and my parents have been having  a lot of problems lately. They've been arguing almost everyday, and almost every conversation ends with them screaming at each other. This frequency of arguments has started to increase as of last year, but they've always argued before. When my brother was younger (roughly 5th grade, currently he's in 9th grade) , they would argue and my brother would always end up crying. I was talking to him a few days ago after another argument he had with my parents, and he said that he used to cry a lot before and he doesn't cry anymore because he's ""used to it."" My brother is the type of person who doesn't back down from anything. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but he never stops arguing. I acknowledge that my parents are also difficult people. My mother yells at him a lot and my father is not a good disciplinarian. He doesn't yell at him, but he is not a good listener and will often make fun of him of laugh. I find this behavior disgusting, but I can't talk to him because he refuses to listen. Yesterday, they (my father and brother) we're having an argument about phone usage. After the argument, I went to check on my brother. He usually pretty standoffish and never asks for help. Over the past few years, he would hardly talk to me about anything. Only, recently have I gained his trust. When I finally got him to open up, he said some things that truly worried me. He said that he's worried he'll eventually ""explode"" and that he won't bottle it up anymore. And I noticed a small, but significant sign of self harm. I'm not sure if I'm exaggerating it or not but he says that sometimes, after an argument, he feels so angry that he pulls at his fingers. Afterwards, I went to talk to my mother because I was worried. I told her everything, and I suggested that everyone should go to counseling. My mother said she should go talk to him. I told her not to, but she said she wouldn't say anything that I told her. I went in a few minutes later to ask a question about something else when my brother said, ""thanks for helping, I'm never going to tell you anything anymore."" I was initially furious that my mother told him this even though I specifically told her not to. She could sense I was frustrated and told me that my brother had overheard us talking. I'm really stressed out because I've broken my brother's trust and I'm the only one he talks to. Please help",11May2019,1

so this is going to be a pretty long story. Good luck reading!

Me and my dad, we used to have a lot of arguments. (That is bc he's a total dickhead.)
He used to mentally and physically abuse me above my other siblings, until I went to live with my mother (they divorced). I now minimise my contact with him. Now, this is where it gets interesting. This is from about 2 years ago.

D: dad M: me (yeah it's that simple guys!)

I'm playing with my brother, and then my father starts asking weird questions.
D: Are you comfortable with speaking to people, and having a conversation?
M: uhh, yeah? What are you doing on that laptop? 
D: nothing. Are you good at depicting sarcasm?
M: I guess. I'm twelve, dad.
D: Do you have a sense of humour? Oh, wait, I can answer that for myself (nervous laugh)
M: what are you doing? Can I see?
D: No, it's fine, you stay right there.
M: umm, okay?
Dad starts asking more and more questions and then, I can't handle it anymore.
I run towards the laptop, to catch a glimpse of the website. I just remembered the link. 


Flash forward to my mum's house; I was living with both parents back then.
So I type in the website anxiously, and it turned out to be a self-test for autism. I was so angry, jeez. My dad used to always tell my mother and me we had some mental disorder, but I didn't know he'd get this far.


Well, flash forward again. 2019. 
In 2018 I started living with my mum, and because of the fact that my dad earns more than triple my mum's salary, he should pay child support. He now doesn't want to do that anymore (he's also about 4 months behind). So he's going to hire a lawyer to defend him in court, and my mum- I don't know if we'll have the money for one.

So I recently discovered that I could be autistic. I am really bad at depicting sarcasm, and a lot of things I say don't come over the way I'd want it to. If I'd let myself be diagnosed, my dad would know, and that would give him a huge advantage in court, because autism is genetic (he has even more fights with my mum)

492,"My son just came out as gay to me via a letter. It shocked me. It crushed me. I always had an inkling he was gay, but I was in denial.

I was hard on him growing up because he was never very masculine. I was tough on him because I wanted to make a man out of him. I did not think it was right for a boy to not be a guy's guy and I did not want him to grow up to be an unmasculine man. I wanted him to be more like his brother. I was afraid that he was gay, so I tried to be tough on him to prevent that.

He's been living on his own now for a few years. He came out to me a few days ago. I'm heartbroken. My fears have come true. I can never look at him the same. I can't wrap my head around him being sexually attracted to men. It disgusts me.

I don't know what to do. He's my youngest son. I don't know how I can look past him being gay.

Before I begin, I would like to apologize for any grammatical errors as English is not my first language, and for the formatting of this – I’m not good at writing stories. Lol.

I started working again last March. 

The company that I’m working for is an outsourcing company and the clients are US based, so there are two shifts for it (morning and night). When I started, I was at the morning shift – most of the people that I was with were fine, I got along with most of them and even made a friend. 

After a month, they moved me to the night shift, so I was with a different group of people again. It’s been almost two months that I’m working the night shift and I can’t wait to gtfo of it, because I can’t stand working with some of my teammates anymore. 

Two of my teammates keeps on making fun of me. They like to make fun of me because I’m Chinese. 

At first, it was tolerable, calling me Chinese and all that.. But last night, I really wanted to tick already. It was the first time in a long time that I wanted to cry cause I was so pissed already. But I held it together…

So, someone from the office came back from vacation and bought some Chinese delicacies. Obviously, two of my teammates thought it was okay to make fun of me AGAIN. 

\--

Below is the actual event that happened.

O1 – Officemate 1 

O2 – Officemate 2

M – Me 

\--

O1: What’s this?

M: Oh, I know that! That’s plum candy, you should try it out. It’s good. 

O1: Well, obviously you know. You’re Chinese

O2: Yeah, she is right. You Chinese.. (then she proceeded to use racist terms against me)

M: Lol, okay. 

\--

I don’t understand why they have to do that? Is it wrong to be Chinese? And tbh, I’m not even full Chinese. My Dad is, but he didn’t even grow up there. My Mum is not Chinese. I’m “half-Chinese.”

It’s probably my fault why they make fun of me because I don’t fight back, but I don’t want to stoop down to their level or waste my energy fighting with people who aren’t even worth it. 

I might consider reporting them to the HR team since I have a lot of witnesses who heard/saw this incident. Also, I’ve talked to my friend from a different team about this issue. She said that my teammates are really like that and I should just get used to it, but she won’t be surprised if someone resigned because of how they are. 

That is all. Hoping to get advice on this.. How do I deal with them further?

so my story i guess: i live with my mother and we have two lovely little cats, and she refuses to get anymore pets. my father (whom lives in a place with only one bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen and living room) agreed to let me get a pet tarantula, Toothpaste.  I went over today to feed little toothpaste and change its water and my dad took toothpastes webs out and made it run around. my father was a lot of the cause of my anxiety as a child so speaking up to him is absolutely not something i do (although i desperately wish i could) and at one point toothpaste fell into the sink. i tried grabbing toothpaste but it was panicking and running and just being a scared tarantula, so i covered the drain as to not let toothpaste accidentally go down and let it calm down a bit before putting it back in its cage. my dad, however, decided to wash his hands (its a two sink thing with one tap that moves) in the sink that toothpaste isnt in and then flicked (a LOT) of water on the poor tarantula. my dad then kept picking it up and just generally bugging it and then went out to smoke so i grabbed toothpaste and put him back and then left. I can’t let this keep happening to Toothpaste. I love it (its too small to know its gender now, my apologies) dearly and i dont want it living in such an anxiety inducing place. i figured my dad had changed about pets since getting his own kitty but i was sadly mistaken. my mother is very against getting more pets so bringing toothpaste to my home is a very slim possibility. i need advice.",11May2019,2

She makes it seem like I don’t love her because I won’t gossip with her about him. I hid it from my boyfriend for a while because how do I even bring that up?? “Hey my mom likes you as my boyfriend but she constantly guilt trips me because I won’t gossip about you and our relationship” he finally caught on and of course looks at my nmom differently.

She’ll text me “omg MIL is driving me crazy!” I told her to not do that bc my bf will see and get upset. So she’ll Snapchat me “MIL won’t stop texting me she’s driving me crazy.” She doesn’t even like calling me if my boyfriend is around because she “feels guilty talking bad about his mom with him around” like wtf.

I'll try to be brief but I suck at it.  We've been together for a year, always together love each very much etc.  She is very beautiful and I'm still extremely attracted to her.  I have a very stressful job, and not proudly we both drink fairly regularly and sometimes heavily.  Its a problem, also we eat out too much many times unhealthy meals (burgers, pizza, hot dogs, pasta, etc).  Over the past year, she has gained a lot of weight.  I know she is not happy about it because I'm taking her on a trip and she recently came home crying when she had to go out and buy new clothes and a bathing suit that would fit.  When she was crying about buying larger sized clothes, I was comforting her and told me that she appreciates how I always make her feel beautiful.  She's always been very skinny/fit, and even now she's not obese, but I know she is not happy about the weight she's gained, and I fear it is headed in that direction.  She has depression issues as well which is one contributing factor.  I deal with self-esteem issues, I'm in pretty good shape, but still not happy with my appearance.  Running and working out helps me feel more confident and relieves stress from work.  Having been single for quite a while while building a career, when we started dating, I decided I needed to start exercising more regularly to get into better shape for myself and so she'd be happy.  I have repeatedly tried to get her to go running with me a few times per week, play sports, or any other activity.  It took some convincing but for a few weeks during the fall, she did start doing those things.  Then it quickly turned into her not wanting too, ""I'm too tired"", ""I just washed my hair"" and other excuses.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm not sure what to do.  I do not want to come off as an asshole, and I want her to feel better about herself as well, but also I'd like the same concern of trying to look good for me (hopefully I'm not being selfish by saying that).  I've tried to read online about how to approach this subject, and most blogs recommend approaching it as a health issue, that I'm concerned about her long term health and self-esteem.  That's probably the way to go, but I'm afraid to bring up this subject for fear of hurting her self esteem even more or causing bigger problems.  I want to help her lose weight while also making sure she knows I still think she's beautiful now.  Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!",11May2019,1

522,"I am moving out of my parents’ house in August and taking my indoor cat with me. I will live in a studio apartment on the 5th floor. My cat has always lived in a big house with a fenced in backyard so if she got out she would just stay close to the house. I know that there will inevitably be some time where she walks out the door of the apartment and wanders off. I think it’d be a great idea to give her a collar- however, the last time we put a collar on her, she got sort of depressed and all she did was scratch at the collar, resulting in a gaping wound that we had to go to the vet to fix. Is there any way that I can gradually help her get used to a collar or do cats not work like that?",11May2019,1

524,"Long story short, I got out of a horribly toxic relationship that left me emotionally null. After a bit of time on my own, redesigning my integrity and identity, I found myself in a new relationship. 

I purposely watched for *any* red flags, almost to the point of hypervigilance. 

Lately, hes been very pushy about sexual things. I dont like it at all, and even when I say no like 4000 times he keeps asking. 

Hes respectful in that he wont cross any boundaries without my consent, and I think hes super sweet whenever were together but sometimes it just feels like he doesnt care at all for my discomfort or my boundaries. 

I was consistently told I was too sensitive in my prior relationship, and I may be even more sensitive now after knowing people can and will try nd use you. 

I dont know. Its emotionally draining. I dont like it.

I took the job and when my current boss found out about it the headchef even offered me a promotion if i stayed.

I have so much free time, oh my god. I haven't enjoyed any of it though??? Things that others enjoyed, and I did before like play video games and make music...I dont enjoy.

534,"Throughout teenage years, mom has always made me insecure about relationships. Firstly, she believes that it's not OK to have sex before you're at least 6 months into the relationship, which is absolutely absurd after a certain age (at 15 it's fine, but at 22 it's unrealistic). She used to be a stay-at-home mom until I was 14 so she is still used to knowing every single detail of my life (What time do I leave the house, how long will I stay, who is coming) and I am pretty sure she will go into some very personal details of my relationship.

Secondly, I hate how she treats me when I have a problem regarding love. I had a pretty long period in my life when I suffered for being ignored by the opposite sex (unrequited love, ex bf ghosted me for no obvious reason) yet all she did was to ask me to stop complaining because I am making her more depressed. She gave me the overused lines ""Others have worse than you"" or ""You're not old enough to have problems"" which really hurt me - if not even my mom listens to my feelings, then who will? She made me feel the worst when a few months ago she just said ""Then go sleep around if you're bored of being single"". And that's what I did, but she has no idea about it. I lost my trust in her. If she didn't care about my moments of sadness, why would she care about me being fulfilled in love?

Another problem is that I met my BF on a dating app and she is totally against this. She believes that only creeps and pedophiles use dating apps. I thought of keeping my relationship a secret, but I am attending some wedding receptions in a few months and my bf is really excited to join me. 

Summary: My Mom has lost my trust and I feel awkward discussing my relationship with her, but I can't keep it secret. I'm worried about her prejudices and lectures about relationships. She has also done a very bad job at listening to me when I expressed my feelings regarding failed relationships, so I don't feel she needs to know about my happy moments in relationships.",11May2019,1
535,"Here's some backstory:

My parent's marriage has had its ups and downs. They often have periods when they fight about everything and blame every problem they can think of on each other. These periods usually last a couple of weeks after which things sort of turn back to normal for some months. They still argue from time to time, but in these rough periods every disagreement turns into shouting and crying for both sides. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of these hard times our family is usually pretty happy. I \[19\] have two younger sisters \[17 and 14\]  and a younger foster brother \[5\] and two months ago we welcomed a newborn baby girl as a second foster child into our family. It's still crazy sometimes, but things seemed to be looking pretty good overall.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is my mom has this really close friend (not a crime, I know, but bear with me) . He used to just a friend but in the last few years he and my mom started working together and basically hanging out more and more. That's all perfectly fine and I'm glad that my mom has close friends, but the thing is that they really started hanging out a lot during one of these bad periods between her and my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

During this bad period, two years ago, she would often go to his place after a fight. I assumed she just needed support from a friend and I understand, but my dad got really nervous about it and this led to even more fights. After one fight she came to me to talk and hear my thoughts on the situation between her and my father. At one point in this conversation I carefully mentioned that I thought that she did spend a lot of time with this other guy. She understood that I thought that way but she assured me that she really just goes to him for comfort when there's only fighting at home. 

I trust my mom so I let it drop and never asked about it again.

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward two years to today. Everything seems to be going fine and it's been quite a long time since my parents have had a real fight. Meanwhile this friend has become even closer, not only to my mom, but also to my sisters. He's become so close to the family that we even unoficially made him the godfather of our foster brother. I had no problem with any of it and even my dad seems to like him nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so here's my reason for thinking thinking these bad things about him and my mom...

I was just having a conversation with my mom about planning a trip. At one point she took out her phone to look something up and I saw a message from this guy saying ""Want you"". She was quick to close her messages and didn't say anything about it and we went on planning the trip.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I only saw one message and I may be flipping out, but I really don't know any other way to interpret such a message. I didn't dare to ask her about it because I'm scared of the answer. I also really don't want to hurt her by accusing her of something based on one message. 

Any advice on how I should handle this?",11May2019,2

545,"Honestly I don't know what to do about this anymore. I have a passion for art; drawing, painting, etc. and I've decided recently to put it to use and try to sell some of my creations. Problem is, my family expect me to give them art for free. Now normally I wouldn't have any issues, and at first I didn't. I drew a couple things for my little sister like any good big brother would, gave my mom a couple pieces as a present, etc.. I figured this would be enough to happily satisfy them since I don't HAVE to give them anything, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Except, now my family expect me to just create stuff for them (specifically my sister) whenever they ask. The thing is, this takes up time and resources (expensive art supplies) and forces me to essentially keep giving away stuff that I COULD be using to sell. I don't owe them infinite exploitation of a skill that I worked hard to hone just because they're related to me. I mean, it's my creations and my time and MY skill, *I* should be able to choose what to do with it?? So this has all built up into my sister throwing tantrums over me not making her MORE AND MORE stuff, and my parents saying that *I* am the one being selfish by not complying.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so frustrating because its not like they politely asked and then I declined and it stayed at that. They're harassing me about it, saying that I have to, blah blah blah... punishing me (I'm 16 so they can still do that to me) for ""not being nice"" by not just giving in, and trying to guilt trip me by saying ""is it really that hard?"". I mean, that kind of devalues all of the time and work I put into developing my abilities, it's not like I just learned this overnight. And... it's not like I PROMISED anyone anything either, so it's not like I'm being a dick by not doing something I said I would. I CLEARLY stated that I was not going to do any more after the last one.

546,"I'm 21 (M) and I can't seem to find any motivation to work. The problem being, I'm set to move out of my mother's home this summer, with my girlfriend (21) and I haven't got enough money yet. The clock is ticking. I need to build up enough for the deposit and a safety cushion before we commit to a place.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as a freelance video editor. I have been working on this since I was 18 as I realised after a bunch of crappy jobs that I didn't like the 9-5 work day that ""normal"" people do. I have built myself up to a point where I have enough clients to keep me busy and earn a good sum of money. Enough to live on comfortably, but of course, this relies on me actually doing my work. I get up in the mornings and just watch YouTube or any other form of procrastinating for that matter and I hate myself for it.

&amp;#x200B;

We're looking at places that will cost \~£450-£600p/m to rent. Plus other bills of course. But at this rate, I'm just about making enough to cover rent doing the bare minimum work that I need to. If I worked even 5 hours a day, 5 days a week, I could easily be making £2500+ which is more than enough to move out on for us given we're going 50/50 on bills. Nothing motivates me to start working each day, I love video editing so it's not that I don't like my job. If anything, it's the best job I could ask for and I'm proud that I got to where I am having struggled for years. But the idea of a larger number in my bank account, I couldn't care less. The immediate danger of not paying rent and being kicked out doesn't apply to me (yet) so that fear won't force me to work. In school, I was 100% the guy that stays up the night before a test, cramming all the info in, or leaving my homework until the morning of the due date. So it's not too surprising that I've found myself here in adulthood. I've thought about seeing a therapist but of course, that requires money which I don't have at this rate.

549,"Backstory: I just broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years, about 4 months ago. Since then I started dating someone who I knew immediately was everything I've ever wanted in a partner, the kind of guy you dream about when you're young and then give up on finding. We're perfect for each other, and he feels the same way I do. 
I'm currently living at my mom's house because I can't break my lease and I can't live in that apartment. I've been trying to find an apartment for after my lease is up, but being in a college town all the studio and single bedrooms are expensive. I'm starting to think I might not be able to afford to live on my own, even with two jobs. I don't really have any friends who I could or would room with.
My current partner has expressed that he's totally on board with us living together, as he says it's going to happen eventually anyway. I am hesitant not just because we've been together for such a short period of time, but because I moved in with my last boyfriend right away and ended up stuck in that relationship way longer than I should have been. I don't want to repeat that mistake. But I also know that my current partner isn't going to treat me the way the last one did. I'm also worried that deciding to move in together because of money isn't a good reason. It wouldn't be the only reason but it would be a major reason.

550,"I love my mom to death and I would do anything for her, but there are some things she really needs to here that I don’t know how to tell her.

First and foremost she’s gaining weight. She’s probably put on 20-30 pounds in the past year. She’s about 60 years old and has developed horrible eating habits. She has candy and high calorie food all over the house that she snacks on constantly. She likes to cook healthy meals but will eat very small portions and then eat her candy and cheese and whatnot all day long. She does about 30 minutes of very light exercise a day and complains that she can’t lose weight. 

Second she’s become very lazy. My mom likes to tell me what a hard worker she is and how she sees that in me. The thing is, she isn’t. She hasn’t worked a job for about 20 years. (I am 20 my older brother almost 22). She cooks and cleans dishes and that’s it. She doesn’t take care of the house, hires maids to clean and do most of the work around the house. She basically hoards things and complains about the mess in the house. Whenever I am home I try to get her to throw things away but her answer is always the same, “Everytime I get rid of anything I just end up needing it in a few months”. She is involved in a few groups that make her think she’s working hard but they don’t take up much time and don’t do anything productive. I’ve suggested she get a part time job at Barnes and Nobles but she doesn’t want to do that because she would have to “be on her feet”. My Dad recently retired from working, he’s worked more than full time for the last 25 years. My parents are ok financially but they want a small stream of income for the next few years just Incase. My mom has decided the only job she is willing to get is as a paid speaker... or a business networker. As I said she hasn’t worked a job in over 20 years and the jobs she worked before that give her nothing to put on a resume or suggest she would be good at either of these things.

Lastly my mother doesn’t have a lot of friends. I feel so bad for her because she’s really sweet and is obviously lonely but I know exactly why people don’t want to be friends with her. She can be very controlling in social situations and likes everything done her way. She can be very rude and incredibly dismissive of people’s opinions. My family just went on vacation and we were at a big dinner and she was talking to this couple about Aruba and they said how much they like it and my mom just completely shit on the place and totally dismissed their opinion. It’s obvious she doesn’t know she’s doing it and they couple didn’t seem very interested in talking to her after that and she seemed upset by that.

Ive tried slowing pushing her in the right direction on several of these things but she doesn’t see what she’s doing wrong. I know this may come off as me being shitty towards my mom but I want to help her. This is likely the last time I’ll live at home and I want her to be happy. What I want more than anything is for her to find some friends but the way she treats people makes it hard for anyone to want to be friends with her. Any advice on how I should handle this would be great.",11May2019,1
551,"For most 17 year olds this is like our time to find a bit of freedom. Legal age to drive and all that, hell most 17 year olds I know get away with going to the clubs and drinking and all that. 

While it’s understandable for parents to care, others have told me my mum is very overbearing and strict. For example, I’ll still be given a curfew to be home by. And this is never later than 9-9:30 as my parents go to bed early and don’t want to wait up worrying about me. Again I would understand if I was staying out til very late or going out round the town but whenever I go out it’s to a friends or my boyfriends. She knows that I’ll be there and my boyfriend walks me back every time so it’s not as if I won’t be safe getting back. Also if I’m even 5 minutes late, I’ll get back to them sitting there looking disappointed in me and then begins a lecture of how much I have worried them about being literally 5 minutes later walking back? If I’m ever more than this time I will let them know before hand so they don’t need to worry. Yet they still get angry with me for not being back on time. I’d understand the concern if I didn’t do this but I do let them know, everytime, without fault. so there is no reason to worry.

What’s really pushed me over the edge happened today. I was spending time revising at my grandparents (since homes a little noisy) for a big exam coming up, and she starts ringing telling me to be back for 8 since she wants to go to bed. What? Me and my nan looked at each other in confusion but agreed that I’d come back. She said that she was having pain in her side and wouldn’t sleep til she knew I was back.

554,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I've no idea how to put this down in words so it's probably going to be a bit of a mind dump. I don't know how else to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been dating a year. Everything's been amazing. She's my best friend and no doubt my future wife. I love her to bits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Close to two months ago her best friend since childhood (she's 28 now) died in a skydiving accident. He was a skydiving instructor. He was her best friend for years, apparently inseparable. He had no family except for a sister he never got along with and would spend Christmas and all the holidays at her place with her family. She thought of him as a brother. They went through everything together. They travelled together and lived together. They were apparently the best friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

He raped her while they were travelling. She was passed out drunk and was raped by this dude that she trusted for so long. That friendship ended and she got some counselling. She hasn't spoken to him since and they also live halfway across the planet (she came home, he stayed travelling and working). I met her 6 months after this and everything was fine from my point of view considering I knew nothing about this but then she told me about it and we carried on as we were. Might be weird but thats the way it is, we're both very open about everything which is why I love her and love talking to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he dies a couple of months ago and she goes into that weird state of shock where it doesn't effect her. And then the next stage where it does. And then she seems to pass out of the grief and life carries on. I'm trying my absolute best to support her in every way. I literally do everything around the apartment and try to make everything perfect for when she comes home (I work 9-5 and she's in school 9-4 and work 5-11 most days -- she's a hard worker). Everything seems back to normal until she mentions that she's really good at faking being happy in passing. We're not having sex any more because of this and she has told me she really wants to be like we used to and it makes her sad we can't but I honestly couldn't give a fuck about that as long as she gets better and happier. I've told her that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past week she's been very sad and extremely destructive. She's been out 3 nights of the week getting drunk with friends who don't know whats happening, doing cocaine each of the nights and coming home at like 6am... one night she came home at 5pm the next day. She admitted to being very destructive in these situations and it's always what she's done her whole life when she's in a situation like this.

&amp;#x200B;

One day she came home she was texting me in the cab and was sounding extremely suicidal -- ""whats the point of life"", ""why should I care about anything"", ""nothing means anything"", "" I don't want to live"" etc etc.. It really really worried me and I was basically watching out the window for her until her cab turned up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her she should go back to counselling and she agreed to set up some dates the next day. I asked her how it went and she said she'd do it the following day. She hasn't set anything up a week later. I don't want to keep pushing. I don't want to mother her but I think she really needs it. I want to talk to her about it so bad but any time we talk about it she gets angry and frustrated which makes me feel like I'm not the right person for her to talk to. I really want her to be happy again. I really want everything to be better but I can't do anything right now and it's killing me. I want to talk to her and I cant. I want her to go to counselling but I can't push her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I'm asking. I just wanted to get that off my chest and maybe someone can decipher it and offer advice. Thanks guys. I love her so much and miss her stupid happy smile and personality. I would do anything for her.",11May2019,3

558,"Hi guys, so recently my dad passed away and I've been struggling with sticking to my work. I have mitigating circumstances for all of my work due in this term. The uni has not given me any new deadlines. I also have the option of taking a break from the course and retaking the second semester next January. 

I lived with my Dad and step mum were breaking up and selling the house and had planned to both move to the city I study in. The house is still up for sale as my stepmum can't afford the bills on her own. At this point I will be homeless with many places I can stay until I figure out a plan and get some stability. I'm stuck at this point.

 Because, if I finish the course now/soon as possible and the house is sold in a month or so I know I'll struggle once again with my studies and it'll feel like I've been uprooted. Today we had a house viewing and it threw me off balance completely. However if I take a break and work through till next Jan I'll be paying full household bills on my own whilst trying to save enough for me to cover living costs whilst doing my masters next year. Also, I am currently have an interest free  overdraft&amp; a substantial credit card debt which is also pretty much interest free. Both of these should stop being interest free really soon. So I'm really in a sticky wicket if I take the second option and can't save enough to pay bills when the second semester starts again.

559,"So back in the end of March, I commissioned a guy I met on Facebook to build me a wooden case for a modular synthesizer.

Throughout April, his estimated date of completion was pushed further and further back, and his communication became less and less frequent. Friday of last week, I told him I needed the case finished by Sunday 5/5, or I would ask for my $300 in parts back. He ""promised"" that he would be done, and I haven't heard from him since. He's not answering FB messages, and his phone is turned off.

568,"The background: When my husband and I got married, his parents (who are currently in their 80s) told him they were updating their will so he would receive more of their estate once they eventually pass. Since then, for every birthday, holiday, and anniversary, we would receive a gift and some spending cash ($50-100) so we could enjoy the occasion. Now we have a daughter (their only grandchild) and they have stopped giving us cash for these occasions. It’s a little confusing, and felt strange to me since we need extra cash more than ever.

They are fairly well-off for being retired, have lots of antiques and art, own their home, have three cars, etc. As far as we know, they haven’t set up a college fund or savings or anything financially for our daughter, so what changed?

569,"He was living in our family house with us (including my sister and other family members) and one morning I found his phone hidden, recording me having a shower. (We have 1 shower, so we had a schedule in the mornings and he knew when it would be my turn).

I did not report this to the police because my mother suggested that going through those procedures would affect 'exams and my education'. She also didn't want to 'air the family's dirty laundry'. Of course as a young teen I felt inclined to agree with my mother so I just left it and he was kicked out of the house.

In hind sight, I should have reported it and I deeply regret being so agreeable to what my mother ‘suggested'. However being a young girl, it seemed too big a battle to fight on my own without full support.

After this happened, I tried time and time again to sensitively approach my sister and discuss the situation as it was obviously traumatic for the both of us for different reasons. She aggressively pushed me away every single time. I understand that it must be extremely difficult as it was someone she loved, but I didn't cause this. I now no longer try to approach the subject and since the day it happened, she has never uttered a word to me about the situation. It's almost like it never happened.

What hurts most is that I know she talked/talks to my other sister about it and they supported eachother through it. There's nothing wrong with that at all, but what's so wrong with talking to me? Even a little bit..

She holds a lot of resentment towards me from the situation. I don't know how to resolve it if she refuses to talk to me about it. I've asked my mother for help but she chooses to turn a blind eye and so do my other siblings.

In addition, I am aware that she has never stopped seeing him since the incident. They have remained in contact and continue to secretly date behind mine and the family's back. She lies constantly about going to meet friends or going to work when actually she's been with him. (I have hard evidence and this isn't just a suspicion)

She deserves a love life and I don't take the stance that she shouldn't enjoy her private life, she's a grown woman. But I don't know how to feel about the way it's all playing out..

She has shown moments of wanting to be friendly (although rare), but they're always interupted by long periods of unexplained, bitter passive aggressiveness, in contrast to the normal loving behaviour she shows towards our other siblings. She has a big personality so this is especially painful when we are all together and I'm being ostrisized.

I feel like I'm paying for what happened and have become her emotional punching bag. Despite all of this, I still want a relationship with my sister. I don't see what happened as her fault and whilst she hasn't dealt with it in the best way (not that there is a 'best way'), she's still my big sister.

The school I was at before was a small, top-15 school in the US and I made some fantastic friends while there. However, I couldn't find a major that I thought was a valuable use of my time and money that would also lead to a job I wouldn't hate, so I decided to transfer to a larger state school that specialized in what I was interested in. However, I'm becoming increasingly disillusioned with the American university system and if it is worth it, and am wondering if I should stay enrolled.

No matter what school I'm at, I have to spend time (and thus, money) taking classes that are only tangentially related to my major just because some group of reputation-minded administrators decided to make it that way.  Plus, I'm not interested in starting my own business, doing research, or getting papers published which is what colleges are (mostly) interested in.  I want to work outdoors and with my hands, preferably in the fields of conservation or restoration.  Even though my new school will give me opportunities in my field of choice, I feel like I'm spending too much time on things that aren't constructive or particularly helpful.

I avoided leading her on, I never said ""I love you"" or kissed or any sort of thing... I also said that she doesn't seem ready to date (she recently divorced and seemed still in emotional shock).

&amp;#x200B;

She said ""ok, we are just friends"" and I thought I was ok with that, but she keeps inviting me and to me it looks very clearly that she's trying to spark a relationship. When I confront her about this she says ""but we are just friends"". That's how she escapes from ""the talk"".

&amp;#x200B;

She is funny and a good girl all around, but I am not interested in keep seeing her because she makes me uncomfortable due to her clear attempts to spark something.

How do avoid going out with her without looking like a bad person?",11May2019,1
587,"This is my first post, so apologies if I do any of this wrong. So to begin, I am a 17 y/o male, in the united states, and almost done with my junior year of high school. I know it may seem soon, as I still have plenty of time to try and choose my path, but I do not wish to follow the conventional road of college/university. I love to learn, but mostly only things I find interest in, and I do not believe I could learn those things there. I would love to travel and learn about other cultures, and am seeking spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile also desiring to learn who I am, and what I am called to do. To get to the point, I am trying to decide if I should finish out high school(my senior year), and then make a decision, or try and make one sooner. Also, where would be a good place to begin my journey? How can I best prepare myself for this?",11May2019,3

589,"   Alright so basically I used to be a very quiet kid up to fifth grade. However ever since I've become a class clown (my memory sucks so I don't know when or how i just made that change to my personality. I have been overall fine with it I don't care or I didn't use to. However I'm in eight grade I like these people but it's starting to hit me halfway through the year no one takes me seriously. Except this guy i hated who he and a couple others are now good friends with me. 
   Though the rest of the class sees me as a doofus  even when I'm serious. I don't know what to do. Side story: (This went so far where in English/spelling class I had to write so something on the board. It had the word argument and I spelled it right but one kid said I did not, I was about to respond when our spelling teacher said I was right. Mind you 7 or 8 people jumped in and said yea. I played it off and laughed. This is just an example.) So what do I do, no one except a few kids take me seriously and my good friends don't most of them and I got one month before we all go to highschool's. Is it too late should I just stick with it. Also this really bugs me because I'm liked but since no one takes me seriously I have cultivated only two friendships that might last even though others I wish I could befriend for long. Also should I just be satisfied with the friends few they are, but those that take me seriously even though some of the others I really wished I could befriend.

Tldr:
I'm a class clown no one takes me seriously and I wish they did. A month left before we go to highschool. Is it too late.

591,"First off, I'd like to get a few things straight. 

\- we've only been talking for a month now

\- we never really talk in person

\- the only way we talk is through text

I know it's hard to tell just through text but I can't tell whether my crush is shy or if she's just a terrible texter. Whenever we talk, I'm always the one who initiates the conversation. She never asks questions about me or even tries to keep the conversation going. Not to mention that whenever I initiate a conversation, she sometimes takes a few hours to reply or ""forgets"" to reply. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. I know you maybe thinking that she's trying to ignore me but I asked her that and she confirmed that she wasn't. I feel like I should tell her how I feel about the way she texts but that can come off as rude or clingy.

What should I do?",11May2019,1
592,"  

My boyfriends parents inherited a large fortune. My mom is a clerk with an average salary, while my dad left us when I was young.

I genuinely love my boyfriend and he loves me too. We are dating since 4 months but we know each other since a few years. We were casual friends before. I had a boyfriend in the past, while he was single all the time.

Im extremely happy with him. But his parents are absolutely convinced that I am a gold digger. Let me be clear: I do want a career on my own.

Maybe they believe me to be a gold digger because I look very good. I am attracted to my boyfriend but many people would rather say that he looks averagely. Also Im very extraverted, while he is rather introverted and a bit shy.

What should I do?

594,"Trying to get in shape and have hobbies outside of school, I recently joined my school's rugby team. I have not played in many contact sports because I had hip problems when I was younger. I thought that since I'm relatively tall and weigh a lot that I would feel at place in rugby.

Although my conditioning needs to improve, I feel like the main thing holding me back from being a good rugby player is my mental toughness. I try to make plays but I usually end up feeling like a ""pussy"" because I'm afraid to commit in low tackles and dont like some of the aggressive plays when I hold the ball.

I really like the sport and the team I've joined, but i want to be better for my last season. How can i change my mentality so that I'm never afraid on the field? Or how can I make it so that I dont think too much and just commit? Thank you for any help.",11May2019,1
595,"Me and my friends are very close and have formed a rather tight knit clique over the past couple of years, all of the friends in this group I have known for the better part of my life and we basically did everything together. (Context: there are about 5 of us in this inner circle and we are in our late teens.) We would hang out on a day to day basis but in the past couple of weeks I’ve seen what I could only describe as a poor attempt of distancing themselves from me. They are trying to cover it up but they’re not doing to well. We all have respective sports we play and the school is very strict, long, and difficult practices ranging from 2-4 hours after school because of this I usually wrap up everything when I get home around 9:00 after doing homework. I don’t know if I have done something wrong but I have given no space and room to hang out because I cant afford that in my schedule even averaging 6ish ours of sleep every night. My friends sports have a lighter schedule and can make room to hang out that I can’t, do they hang out with each other without me. (This is not what bothers me, I’m fine with them hanging out without me.) problem is in recent, as in the past couple of weeks as sports are wrapping up for the summer I’ve noticed even when I’m free and offer to do something in the group chat (Side note this group chat has been inactive a scary amount compared to earlier this year.) If I ask them to join the discord I see they’ve read it and know they’re available but don’t seem to want to get in. Today I was bringing my dog back from the vet and saw something to confirm my suspicions, My friends cars were all on the grass outside my friends house(This friend is like the leader of our group)  I wanted to confirm my suspicions so I went on a run after dropping my dog off at my home. I could confirm these were their cars after getting a better look, so I thought maybe I just missed the text or message asking people to come over. So logically I called my friends asking if any of them were free or could hang out. First didn’t pick up, second(leader) said he was taking his grandparents out to dinner third said he was just busy, and forth had actual religious obligations which I understand(his car was not there.) But after I continued another lap of my run I saw them leaving the house, I made sure they saw that I was “too focused” to see them if they did see me.


I need advice, to my knowledge they understand my schedule, I don’t know if they feel I’m neglecting them or trying to hangout with someone else, if I’m doing something wrong, should I tell them about how I feel? Should I let things play out and try to correct themselves? Should I try to get back in touch and act like nothing has happened like I’ve been trying? Is this my fault, if so what can I do to help repair my friendship. These are just about my only friends and have been I don’t know if I can socially adapt to new people.

The comment wasn’t really offensive but it could be read as snarky, someone had commented that they had an issue with certain people and my comment said, “can’t you just report them?”. 

However, someone else had managed to quote the comment before I deleted it and they didn’t like what I had written so they decided to go through my post history and took a few posts I had made asking for advice out of context and used them to shame me and call me out. They also called me names and it really hurt me. 

I started arguing with them and I made a comment about their post history as well. This descended into an even bigger argument and they called me name after name after name. They also tried to suggest I was playing some kind of game or trolling or something.

600,"(sorry for the long post, the main thing isn't really about dating. If you just want the asking for advice part look for ""-"" but I would highly appreciate you read it all)

Hey I could really use your help,

So the thing is I (20M) met this girl(19F) at college. We briefly talked a few times during the year but recently (like in the past 2 weeks) we started messaging a lot.
She started it off to be honest and I don't mind getting to know her and all that. I just hadn't really payed attention to her but I am now.

The thing is she has shown interest in starting a relationship and we have now decided to go on a date togheter.
All this is scaring me a lot, this is all a first for me as I never really had a relationship. I never know what to say or talk about with her, yet she still tries to keep the conversation going by maybe saying some stuff that's quite obvious or asking about mundane things(which I admire). But it's hard for me to keep it going because a lot of her messages are ""ah okay"" or ""yes"".
We don't have that much in common which is a shame but that also makes the conversations harder.

Also I am absolutely horrified about going on that date. I don't know what to say at all !

One of the last messages she sent was: ""I kinda miss you"". (This is just to add to a later point)
Or she sent a picture of herself before going out.
But what really threw me off was when she asked me if I missed her. I honestly didn't really because I was busy all the time and I've only really *known* her for 2! Weeks.

I think this is the root of my problem:
-i don't know if I like her but would like to get to know her. How do I know I love her? I've never really felt something for anyone. 
-what do I talk about?! It seems we only talk about the most random mundane things. Which she clearly doesn't mind because she keeps coming back and try to keep the conversation ""alive"".
-how can I be be honest about my feelings to myself? I honestly don't know what I want or what exactly that's bothering me.

I know I want *a* girlfriend that I like and she me. But one way or another I find an excuse or back out without really knowing why I don't feel comfortable.(that's what happened last times.)
 This and the fact that I don't know what I want and not being able to verbally express what I want/feel is making me hate myself.
This is the best explanation I've given ) and am still not really satisfied with it, it seems I'm only scratching the surface.(yes I talked about this with a friend but I just physically cringe when I need to talk about my feelings be wise I don't know what to say or what I'm feeling!!!

Please don't think of me as some boring unsociable dude that's creepy.
Okay I might be a little shy in the beginning and have some trouble with a large group of people but once I get to know them I really like hanging out with them and I think them with me. My friends and me have lots of fun and lengthy conversations, although about niche things at times. 

Please send me a chat request or something I hope I'm able to find out about myself honestly. I hope I can with internet strangers.",11May2019,2

604,"Hey all,

I'm a guy currently studying abroad as part of a smallish group. On my course I have two many friends, one a guy and the other a girl. Straight up, I have the biggest crush ever on her, but she has a boyfriend. So, my crush on her is an innocent personal one. I sincerely wouldn't push anything even if it was hitting me in the face. I met her bf, nice guy, seemed similar to me actually. So she's off limits even if she liked me. But what I do have to say is I still want her to like me. I have a lot of hang ups about my ability to connect with others. And here I have a girl I do like but really I want to friendzone myself. Although part of me thinks I am lying to myself. But I just notice with the other guy she's more pally with, she'll do more things alone with him and seem more at ease. When were in each others company she seems to like me, I'd say a lot, so much that I did think she liked me at one time. Hence, what pushed my feelings for her. But no matter what I do, no matter how warm I am, no matter how many times she laughs or smiles at me, she never really seems that comfortable around me to just hit up and ask to hang  out. I don't know why it bothers me. I think jealousy too. But let me say, I don't think she picks up on that. I'd even go as far as to say she's awkward around me but she definitely has a liking for me(remembers random info, moments, sayings)

So I am asking for advice. Do I take the view that she probably did like me maybe more than a friend and then realised she had to pull back? Maybe the other guy doesn't carry the same guilt since he has met her bf a good few more times than I have.

Btw, it really sucks liking someone that even if they did like you, it could never happen. Dunno why I developed feelings. 8 months now.",11May2019,3

For several months I have been struggling to realize when I am still sleeping or if I am awake. My dreams always tend to be based in reality and my current enviorment that I can no longer tell when I am awake or what events have or have not happen.
It is to the point that I am struggling to even wake up from sleep because I always assume I have but I have been dreaming the whole time. I work at home and do not go to school because it has gotten so bad I cannot keep up with schedules and time commitments because alarms or sounds will not wake me up and I already assume I have been awake and getting ready for the day. My mother has to come in my room and physically shake me and tap hard on me to wake up. It is always so jarrin and terrifying because one second I am at my desk or playing video games but then in a split second I wake up in my bed and everything I thought happen has not. My social media posts and messages have never happen. The youtube videos I watched never happen. The work and studying I have done never happened but it feels so real and normal I thought it has.
I wake up and realize I have been sleeping for over 16 hours and any ""progress"" in the day I thought I made was gone.

She moved to her hometown which is basically part of the city of Chicago. Every week she says something different about how she is doing Either she is super happy to be there or she is depressed because ""every one is crazy here"" and all her kids moved far away (brother is in school in Iowa and sister works in Alabama). Quite honestly, it depends if she has a boyfriend that week if she is happy or not in my opinion. Today on the phone she is having one of her I'm depressed states and she said once her lease is up in 6 months she is going to move in with me as my new place has 2 bedrooms... She was saying it would be financially a good choice as a reason in addition to wanting to be near one of her children.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her straight up I did not want that. I never pictured my mom living with me at 26 and this is not something I was ok with. I just got out of a long term relationship, want to date and create a life for myself. She got pretty upset, a phrase that sticks out was ""I did everything for you but now that I need you you aren't going to be there for me"".

&amp;#x200B;

So this is where this post kind of turns into ""am I the asshole"" moment. My mom has no savings, no real good paying job prospects (she works for instacart delivering groceries right now), and in the back of her mind is essentially banking on 1 of 2 things to get her through the rest of her life - me and my brother (if he stays the course) being able to support her through retirement or marrying someone who can take care of her financially. She will NOT, and I repeat WILL NOT be happy in the area I am moving, it is not sociology-economically developed and very republican... she is a die hard liberal and very vocal about it - if people are not liberal, in her mind they are morons 99% of the time.

 I love my mom, she is a good person and tries to always thinks the best of people. Honestly if the world was filled with more people of her ideals it would be a better place.  But the phrase ""I did everything for you but now that I need you you aren't going to be there for me"" really rubs me wrong. My mom should get credit where credits due, she is a good mom and made sure we valued education which is partly why I am where I am today. She raised me, I get it, but its not like she paid for my education (I'm 522k in student loan debt) nor did she put in the work I did to get where I am today (she spent 4 years in college never graduated ((partied)) while i scarified my 20s studying my fucking ass off). I seriously don't think that a parent (unless medically compromised) should depend on their children as a financial crutch but I have accepted that I will most likely have to help her for a greater part of the rest of her adult life. That all being said, I DO NOT WANT HER MOVING IN WITH ME. I want to be independent. I want to be an adult. I want the life I worked the past 8 years of college for. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how can I explain it to my mom that I don't want her living with me but I still love her. Yes I tried to convey these points on the phone with her today but she was not having it. Additionally am I ""the asshole"" here""? I may be I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Have a good mom. She wants to move in with me. I do not want that.",11May2019,2
620,"Last night I went to a club with a friend from work. We'd been messaging each other about how he started going more recently and liked dancing, and I told him I was interested in going but I didn't really have anyone to go with. He asked, ""maybe you could go with me,"" and since I was both excited to try it and because I kind of have a huge crush on him, I accepted. (For reference, it was a Dubstep DJ, so it was pretty high-energy.)

Beforehand we walked around downtown and just talked for hours, about lots of things, but mostly our pasts and our personalities and views. It was very friendly, so I didn't really think much of it since I don't want to search for feelings that aren't there.

Once we got to the club, though, and started actually dancing, he eventually just got really close in front of me and pulled me in. It wasn't grinding, if my information being that it's usually (?) from behind is correct. He kept his hand on my lower back the whole time we'd dance together, (like, right up next to each other basically, with a little room to actually move) and we would just stare at each other. Looking directly in the eyes and everything.

Now, I know dancing can just be like that (not from experience but from common sense) and he even told me he can be a little intense and touchy sometimes. When he was walking me to my car he actually apologized for it, but I told him if I hadn't liked it I would've pushed him away. I even stupidly said ""I was like, yay,"" in a light-hearted, joking manner, to which he responded with, ""what's that supposed to mean?"" It was very friendly and light and we were laughing for it so I don't think I made him uncomfortable (I hope not, anyway.) I realized my mistake though and hesitated before just saying it was ""nice to be close to someone."" Which was true, just a little unspecific. If it was anyone else touching me like that I definitely would tell them to fuck off.

I don't want to make an ass out of myself and assume anything, but at the same time part of me hopes maybe he's at least somewhat interested in me. For context, we work together since I just started a new job about two-ish months ago, but we got somewhat close pretty fast. But one major thing is that he's like, 27 or 28, and I'm 20. So, kind of a gap there lol.

Anyways, in your guys' opinions, does him dancing with me like this just mean he loves dancing and isn't attracted to me or interested in me?

TL;DR: Friend from work invited me to dance at a club with him, sometimes he danced very closely with me and held me, but I'm unsure if it means anything or if he was just getting into dancing.",11May2019,0
621,"I'm a male, 18 years old.

We study in same university, same class, pretty much classmates, just so you know.

Moreover, he has a toxic female friend who is also our acquaintance, she loves constantly mocking me and my friends, i also do that to her now, being more blunt, to be honest, i really don't care about her, the problem is she along with him started to discuss ""Where you gonna find a girlfriend and are you gonna pay the check for her as well or not"" in front of a completely unknown to me person which i know is pure mocking because they called me greedy the other day because i never buy them anything (even though i buy sweets and stuff for other girls in our class, whom i'm kinda friends with), because i see that they're quite toxic.

Honestly, if they started to do that without that guy and around our friends, i surely would not say anything, but for fuck sake, assuming that eczema is contagious around the person that i met for the first time in my life was the point of no return.""Actually, i assume that eczema is contagious"", what in the fuck?He knows me, he sees that i'm shaking hands with friends, with other guys in our group, if i had a contagious disease on my hands i would not even dare to do anything like that.

Oh and that guy is always silent when he is alone, around me, even around his friends (except for the toxic friend of his, he gets ""wings"" of some sort with her) who are also my friends, he never says a thing even when i try to talk about things that interest him, he never discusses anything with us but when it comes to mocking or garbage saying he is number 1 at this around his toxic friend.

I just want to tell my friends about that ""accident"" showing my resentment regarding the way this dude acts, i was always trying to be friendly, kind with him, but seeing how he cannot do anything socially when he is alone except mocking me when he is around his toxic friend really says a lot about him as a person.

Maybe my anger and resentment is due to my pride, but certainly these were not jokes, why would they do such thing around a person who i don't even know?To shame me, nothing else comes to my mind.

My friends were not around when it happened.Eczema is **NOT** contagious.",11May2019,1
622,"Recently, I was assigned another team to support at work. The manager of that team is a nice but cocky meathead-lite type of guy. We sat down when the announcement was made and he was a little distant but by the end of the conversation, he seemed much more at ease and actually pushed off a meeting so we could finish our conversation. He got a little flirty but nothing concerning so I just brushed it off. He wasn't wearing a wedding ring so it seemed pretty on brand for that type of guy.

Over the past couple weeks, he's been getting more and more... familiar with me. He teases me, constantly asks about me and my personal life, told me he's told his friends about me because apparently I remind him of his first girlfriend, there have been a few times where he's almost flexed (leaning back in his chair with his hands behind his head with his elbows up and arms flexed, he's constantly in my space to the point where I'll either jokingly tell him to give me space or actively move, makes intense, eyes-wide, unbroken eye contact with me and just generally gives off the vibe that he's flirting.

Last week, I ended up trying to stalk him on social media - he had shown me the first girlfriend on fb so I knew he must have that, at least. But I can't find anything. What I do find is that he's married.

The next time I sat down with him, he brought something up about how many members of his team have the same name as him and I told him ""my \[same name\]"" says that too. I left out that he's my roommate. His IMMEDIATE response is ""my wife would find that hilarious"" and as he's saying it looks at my left hand and then almost doubles down on the behavior.

He hasn't done anything overt enough where I can even address it with him directly and, at this point, don't think it would be worth the risk but it does make me uncomfortable. I can't tell if I'm overthinking because I've had a coworker kiss me before (I left the company shortly thereafter) but I really don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated!",11May2019,3
623,"Hi redditers. So for so long my crazy nutty family has been such a big part of my identity and there came a time when I decided enough was enough and ran away from home in my senior year of high school because I just couldn’t live like that anymore and somehow finished high school in a new city by myself. That was about 4 years ago. I’m 22 now,married and going to college,everything is on the right track and I’m happy most of the time. No one in my family taught me anything at all about life, everything I have learned is from my husband. Applying to college,opening a bank account, how to talk to people normally,the list goes on.  The only person I speak to in my family is my mom and she even comes to visit occasionally and brings all kind of chaos with her. My upbringing has left me with crippling anxiety where I can hardly work and have almost no social skills. So what would you all suggest in my situation? Should I cut off my family that raised me even if they’ve damaged me the way they have?",11May2019,4
625,"Two of my friends have a very dusfunctional relationship and a ten(ish) months old baby 

The husband assaulted the wife and has conditional contact. 

His mother (the grandmother ) called family and children services for bogus reasons so they have a casefile and social worker. She hates the mother and doesn't think her son is a good father. She wants custody. But she's the source of the sons issues and all of her children were abused while in her custody 

And the worst (to me ) is that the mother is malnourishong the baby .

 She's raising him vegan. Which was fine at first. But the doctor is now seeing signs of malnutrition and has ordered some animal products into his diet 

The mother refuses. The father feels trapped because his contact can be recinded on her whim. And the grand other wants custody but has an abusive track record. 

Is there anything I can do ? 

The mother is very short tempered and not good with the baby. The father is usually much note gentle. But he did assault the nother at one point.... 

It's all such a mess.

Ex-wife is not allowing me to spend significant time with my kids - I haven’t spent more than a few hours a week with them since this all began. Friends are busy living their own lives.  Today I spent an hour in the gym, my apartment is spotless, and went on enough walks to make my knees hurt.  I also had the joy of spending a few hours with my kids (watched Avengers this afternoon).

629,"I've never had anyone love me. Or like me for that matter. I'm not that good looking, I've lost any self-confidence so i've lost any sort of personality. I've been isolated so much, I can easily go days without talking to anyone. I'm far to weird to ever be loved by anyone real. At this point interacting with real people is to scary.

I just want someone to love me, listen to me, and not judge me. I can't even remember the last time I got a hug. I don't think I've ""vented"" in a long long time. I want someone who I can just cry and let it all out with. I've never had someone like that.

Sure if its imaginary it's not the real thing, but i'm pretty damn good at imagination, i've been living in it for the past 5 years or so. It's much more fun than reality.

I'm so lonely it's really getting to me. It's hard not just cry myself to sleep every night. But i haven't actually cried in ages, I forced myself to stop. I get too self-conscious about it.

Idk. If I can't get anyone real to love me, then I think this is my only option.",11May2019,2
630,"TL DR: I believe my little brother is missing and my father who is the only person that supposedly had heard from him is not being helpful about trying to find him.

I don't even know if this is the right place to put this but I'm desperate right now and I need advice about what I can do to find my brother.

So I'm trying to find my brother who I believe is schizophrenic or possibly on drugs. I say I believe  he's schizophrenic because before all of this he refused to go get diagnosed or to take medication so I do not know if his behavior is due to a mental illness or because of drug use.

Anyways, this all started a few months ago when my little brother got fired from his job. He acted erratic before that but to keep things as short as possible I will just go back a few months. So my little brother had been working for a family friend who works with ex-cons. The the business that the man runs was setting up a halfway house in a new location. He allowed my little brother to live there for a few months until they got everything up and running. My little brother wound up getting fired because destroyed the house. He took off the front door and basically anyone could walk in at any time, he painted all of the mirrors in the house black, he climbed on top of the roof and fell to the top into the Attic, etc. Once all of this happened my dad begged the guy not press charges which he didn't he simply fired my little brother he specifically told us that he wanted to make sure that my little brother was able to collect unemployment for a few months so that he could get his self together. This is when almost all communication stopped between me and my brother. He use to always call me no matter what every couple of days and even if he was being erratic he would always call me but suddenly he stopped calling me or texting me and all of my information for him was coming through my dad. 

My dad told me my little brother started collecting unemployment and was on some kind of public assistance and that he rented a room from somewhere. Whenever I ask my dad for the address he always had forgotten it or didn't have the paper with the address on it in front of him at the moment. Eventually my little brothers phone got cut off and what I asked my dad about it he said he didn't know anything about it he just received a message from my brother giving him the number to a text app that he was using. I asked for the information and it wasn't a phone number it was just an email address and I keep messaging the email address and I have yet to have any replies from it but my dad says when he send him a message my little brother always replys. I have asked my dad to send me screenshots of these supposed messages and he refused.

This all carried on until about a month ago where my dad told me my little brother got kicked out of the room he was renting. I told my dad I wanted to file a missing persons report because no one's really heard from him in reply my dad just sent a thumbs up emoji. 

I'm at a point where I'm very worried and I think at the least my father is being deceptive about when he last heard from her brother. I live 600 miles away and I can't easily get to the area they are in and I just need to know if there's something I can do to help find him and get him the help he needs.",11May2019,2
