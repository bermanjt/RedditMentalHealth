0,"My professor has been phenomenal, I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her. She's patient and kind, genuinely invested in the progress of her students, and has been an overall delight to learn from. I take two math courses with her (pre-algebra and algebra at the same time) and my grades in both are great despite the mountain of work they produce, which is absolutely wild considering my previous experiences with math (the highest level I've reached before this semester was rudimentary math because I couldn't cut it in pre algebra in high school). Shes had a long career, and every reference of her from word of mouth to ratemyprofessor is overwhelmingly positive; this woman builds confidence and changes lives.

I recently found out that she's retiring and this is her last semester. I've considered finding a way to throw her a little party at the end of the semester but I wouldn't even know who to go to in the administration to organize one. I guessed that she was retiring and she confirmed it, but told me that she's keeping it to herself because she doesn't want her students to get upset. I don't know who to ask for help with organizing without revealing her secret before she's ready, because I can't tell who knows that she's leaving.

What is an appropriate but meaningful gift I can get her that shows how deeply I appreciate all of her help and hard work, but without crossing a professional line? Any suggestion or guidance is welcome, I could really use some help on this one guys.",07Nov2019,2
1,"Hi everyone! So I have a crush, and I guess you can say I’ve like him for a long time. But I would stop liking him for a month or so, but of course, the crush would come back. That’s happened to me a couple times now. He would often look at me during school, and he stopped for a while, but I’ve been meeting eye contact with him more lately. And not to mention we share the same birthday and our lockers are next to each other.
But you see, there’s these three girls at my school and I’m friends with them. Actually, more like half-friends. And there friendgroup and my crush’s have, I guess you could say, collided. And one of the girls in that group has started liking my crush (I know this because one of my best friends is a good friend of hers). And because they have been hanging out more lately, I’m worried that he is going to start liking her.
But the good thing is that I can’t see them together. They really don’t have much in common, and they just aren’t compatible. And you know how you sometimes look at two people and you’re like ‘they’ll look good together’. Well it’s the complete opposite with those too.
Any advice????",07Nov2019,1
2,"Hello! I’m a senior in high school an I’m currently trying to survive what may be my most stressful year of my life. College Apps, important tests, and extra curricular activities seem to be working together to make my life as difficult as possible.

A couple of days ago, I received a text from a friend that I haven’t talked to since 8th grade. At first, she seemed to be the exact same as I remembered her: Bright, funny, and just an amazing person in general. We quickly started to catch up, and it seemed like it was just like old times. 

However, there was soon a sudden shift. Seemingly out of nowhere, she started to talk about how “a lot of bad things are happening”, how she feels no motivation to complete her studies or go to college, how she no longer trusts anyone and has no friends, and how she blames everything on herself. 

I tried to consoled her in any way I could think of. I said things like “If you ever need someone to talk to, I am here for you”, “It is okay to make mistakes”, and “I understand and really want to help in any way I can”—but it feels like none of it is getting through. Although there is some immediate effect, she quickly relapses back into her previous state.

This has been going on now for nearly a week. So I decided to come to here for help. Am I just saying the wrong things to her? Should I just not give advice and listen instead? Is there a correct way to go about this? How can I help her? Any advice would be extremely appreciated. I just do not know what do anymore. At this point in time, I’m set to meet her face to face for the first time since 8th grade in three days from now. Thanks for reading.",07Nov2019,1
3,"7 months ago my girlfriend broke up with me. She was the first girl that I could truly say I loved. She started a dating a close friend of mind about 2 months after the break up. We communicated for the next 3 months or so. 

About 2 months ago we totally stopped talking. I was trying my best to meet new people and was pretty successful and then I finally found that I was being myself again. I wasn’t sad, I was feeling confident and happy. Then 3 days after starting to feel this way she randomly texts me and all the emotions came back. It was almost like she knew I was finally over her. Now for the past 3 weeks I’ve been sulking again. It feels so terrible because I was trying so hard not to let her texting me eat me up and it did. Right when I felt like myself again it all went downhill. I’m wondering will I ever acatually get over this woman. What do you guys/gals think?",07Nov2019,2

5,So my professor is allowing students to take a retest for an exam that we recently had. I thought that I did very poorly as so did the rest of the entire class. It turns out that I got a B on it (weights 20%) and still land at a high A in the class. Should I bother still taking the retest and see if I get a better grade? I feel like I won't and am not sure how the retest will go? Thoughts? Thanks!,07Nov2019,2
6,"Just a heads up here I apologize if my spelling and punctuation is awful I got disgraphia so I humbly apologize if it is anyways to the context of the title

So back in middle school 6th grade ikr those 3 wonderful years of your life that you want to smash and destroy every bit of them well yeah those 3 years were absolutely the worst years ever I know everyone says that but basically what happened was I was in 6th grade and it was a new school so I knew nobody I didn't know who was cool or who was nice so needless to say I ended up in the worst group ever these guys/girls would do drugs they'd likely lose there virginity at age 14 and I just wasn't like them at all yet I felt like I had to hangout with them because I knew nobody so I tried to fit in as best as possible and no I did not do drugs or have sex or anything like that because I dont believe in doing drugs or losing my virginity as a teenage boy lol anyways I met a girl who I really liked I thought about her a lot she made me happy she smiled at the awful jokes I made and overall she seemed pleasant and during around the end of 6th grade and starting into 7th I asked her out and she said yes at the beginning everything was great she was happy I was happy and life was just good y'know unfortunately it didn't last... we got into fights we broke up then constantly got back together and overall I'd just say it was a verbally abusive relationship on both parts which I'm not proud of at all then this one time we got back together and she sent me photos of her and instead of just moving on and not doing anything with them I downloaded them and it was the worst decision I ever made of course we broke up again no surprise and I was so angry and my self-esteem was at an all time low and I just felt like crap so I sent them to her friends for ""advice"" which I just feel terrible for I might've even ruined her life for all I know and I hate myself everyday for doing so and 7th grade and 8th grade were just the years of my life that I just gave up on everything I stopped playing video games that I loved I stopped drawing which I used to love to do I stopped everything I did because I felt like I didn't deserve it or deserve to be happy so I was constantly filled with anxiety and depression and I got a therapist in 8th grade because I just felt like there was gonna come a point where I'd probably kill myself or just not do anything at all like existing instead of living which now brings me into 9th grade being 15 years old currently on zoloft medication and vitamin D I feel much happier I have an awesome group of friends there kind way better than my other group but I just dont have the feeling to love anybody... I dont feel like I have the compassion to give anybody love which I really want to I wanna have someone in my life that cares for me and makes me smile but I also want to make that special person happy as well I just dont understand the way I am feeling right now and when I dont understand it I dont know how to correct it I dont have crushes on girls nor guys not anyone which isn't my main concern my main concern is that I just dont have any feeling of love for anybody like I dont look at my mom and be like y'know I really love my mom she puts food on the table for me she makes me happy and she loves me regardless if I dont love her which I wish I thought that way but I just dont it's the same with relationships like normally oh y'know she makes me happy she seems interested in me I kinda like her theres just nothing there it's like a blackhole that is just endless so that's the whole context 

basically I wanted to get advice onto what is next what should I do is what I'm saying because me and my ex have been broken up for a year now and I just wanna move on and love someone else but my brain is just being super overly protective of me which I dont blame him to be honest with the crap I've gone through I'd be defensive as well but anyways thank you to anyone who replys and reads this far I do really appreciate it and any advice you have to give would be very grateful thank you!",07Nov2019,1
7,"I'm a seventeen year old male living in Ontario Canada. My father is an addict and over the years it had started to effect my mental health poorly. My father and I have been evicted from 3 apartments over the last 20 months, my father has frequently had women over whom he has fought with to the extent of going to the hospital or the police showing up. Last night he got drunk and lost count of his alcohol, and blamed me for taking some, he then lost his temper and like in the past has made remarks like ""You ungrateful POS, I'm not doing anything for you ever again"", and considering we have already received a warning of eviction, I feel like I need to get out before this starts to effect my life more than it has.

8,"Recently I (28F) got a text from a business associate who we'll call Dwight, telling me that he had been in love with me after we had a signed contract on an investment fund project together.

Dwight and I have been friends for a few years and share a friend group. If our project managed to launch with full funding, we could all expect to see a decent amount of revenue come in. I almost offered to do it for free but was persuaded to instate a contract by my peers because this would keep things from getting messy and after some back and forth Dwight and I settled on a percentage with minimal friction. He was always very supportive/generally a good dude and we texted semi-frequently prior to this just because we follow the same shows.

But Dwight's family is rich and he's kind of been pampered by everyone. I saw this slowly manifest in him more heavily as time went by - at first he'd get my coffee but it eventually grew into him offering to literally bring me to Paris. He's also really insecure and tries to do everything possible to put on airs. Hence, the texts got more aggressive and flirty to which I would always try to veer the conversation in a different direction. Anyway, if you can't tell already, he holds the power in this contract as I am mostly a consultant/designer and get most of the info from him, though I have been in contact with other people on the project that would also be able to function as a middleman between me and our investors.

Despite Dwight's quirks though, he was a successful figure in the industry and I had previously asked him for professional advice in the past. I found it odd that he wouldn't really ever give negative feedback. However, after the texting just got really out of hand (asking to go out on the weekly, guilting me into responding/going out if I didn't respond to something in a few days - usually a meme or unrelated news, etc), I just went radio silent after he ""playfully"" accused me of never wanting to see him because I wouldn't go to lunch with him. He'd also insist on walking me back and grabbing my hand towards the peak of the aggressive behavior. He freaked out and it took me 2hrs to calm him down. That's when he told me he loved me. At that point, I was just angry since it felt like my entire skillset was invalid.

I haven't responded to any of Dwight's texts - he's tried to apologize but only after trying to tell our friends his side first and told them I said things like ""let's ~~not~~ go to a ~~club~~ romantic place"" and ""let's go ~~somewhere not crowded~~ be alone together""- this would be super out of character for me as I'd rather chug turpentine than watch The Notebook. It's been a few months now and things are progressing but I'm still pissed and don't really know how to respond without lashing out, which I feel like makes me look really unprofessional. Btw there is no HR in this situation - I work for a startup and a most of the higher ups are good with Dwight's family so they'd have his back immediately. 

I'm trying to figure out how to word a response that makes it absolutely clear that what happened was absolutely ***not*** ok by any means and that I am 0% interested. Part of me also wants to rip him a new asshole because he dragged unrelated parties into this and tried to win them over by practically spreading false info that made me look like a lying hypocrite and how digusted I am by all the advice he gave me probably being false because he had ulterior motives the whole time. In general I just feel really dirty but want to nip it asap so it can no longer bother me. 

TLDR - Business associate starts trying to aggressively pursue a romantic relationship with me after many months of constant guilt tripping and subtle propositioning. I feel gross because he involved our mutual friends and feel like I may have just been hired/told I was qualified just because he had ulterior motives our whole friendship. He drops the I love you bomb and I haven't responded since bc anger and disgust. Trying to figure out a proper response to make sure he knows I'm not interested and that he was out of line but still feeling really irritated.",07Nov2019,1

I'm a sophomore at my high school and I'm in drama club and my school newspaper, but I'm bad at talking and I come across as weird and out-of-place. I was homeschooled from my 6th grade year till my eight grade year and I came back to school because I had no friends and I was always bored. People don't have the same interests as me (I'm heavy into indie music) and I want to be socially active, but I fear about everything I do. Everything I do seems off to people and they never seem interested in me. I try to be friendly but I push the border and run out of things to say. I have pretty low self-esteem and people just look at me weird when I say or do things that I would usually do. I really want help but I don't know where to look.

25,"So she bought a new car... a few days later a key (or something similar) scratch showed up on her door. This was her first new car ever. She's almost 40. She was so proud of it, yet when it got the scratch she was devastated. Soo, since it wasn't too deep, I did some research and ordered a scratch removal kit. I consider myself pretty confident with 'handy man' things and the instructions seemed pretty straightforward.

Lo and behold, it screwed it up. Now it's a blurry blob. Of course, I felt like absolute dog shit...

So, I said I'd pay for it, get it fixed by a professional, etc etc. She was having none of it. She told me how useless I was, how much she didn't trust me to do anything, never touch her car or even look at it, etc... 

As I tried to at least apologize saying how shitty I felt, her response was 'Now you're making this about you?' So literally nothing I say is right... She wont let me pay for it since she says it was her mistake for even trusting me to touch her things.  She says my apology isn't sincere. She says that if it were my car I wouldn't have done that.

28,"I have a friend who’s always constantly talking about money.

Him and I used to have a thing, but we were never officially boyfriend and girlfriend because he was afraid of commitment. When my ex and I broke up, he let me come stay with him for a few months. I thought that it was a courtesy, until one day he randomly asked me how much money I had in my bank account. I told him that it’s a personal question, and asked why would he ask that. He then said that he can’t afford to pay rent for “the both of us”, and that he was financially strapped. I had just lost my job that paid minimum wage due to severe depression (which he knew). His landlord didn’t know that I was staying there, so he was paying the same amount in rent even if I didn’t live there. All of his utilities are covered by his landlord except for electricity, which I started paying half of the bill the instant he told me that it went up when I moved in. He said he went from paying $50 a month in electricity, to it suddenly being $150. It was a small 443 square foot studio, and I never left the lights on. I don’t understand how the bill surged that much, but I didn’t ask to see the bill. To this day, I still feel like he sort of scammed me. He said he didn’t understand how the bill went up either, just that it did. I told him that he should call the light company to see if there’s an error, to which he evaded in doing so every time. 

He paid $1500 every month including parking. I moved in early February and by late April, he randomly requested $1,400 from me in rent. He was extremely controlling when we lived together. I wasn’t allowed to have dairy in the fridge because he’s allergic. He developed feelings for me when I moved in, so I wasn’t allowed to go out and see a guy I had a thing with before I moved in with him. I wasn’t allowed to go on dates, and he even stalked me to one. I wasn’t allowed to use his cutlery or kitchenware if I was eating something that contained dairy. He even went as far as to calling me a bitch because I had forgotten his rules, and accidentally used butter on his pan on something I was cooking for myself. I didn’t have any of my belongings there, because my ex kept all of my belongings hostage at his apartment that I used to live in. All in all, I was basically just staying there with a suitcase of clothes that I managed to get from my ex. I didn’t take up any of his closet space, I didn’t use any of his stuff, and I didn’t think that it was reasonable for him to charge me $1,400 in rent for less than 3 months, when I didn’t even have the freedom/space that I would have if I were to live on my own or with a roommate. 

He makes $26/hr at his job, and his mom helps him out whenever he needs money. We both moved out of his apartment in June when the lease ended. He went to a new apartment, and I went back to live with my parents. He called me the same day that he got his new apartment. He said he hated it, and wanted me to come over. Somehow, we got back into the same routine that we did when we lived in his old apartment. I stayed at his new place 99% of the time, and was barely at my parent’s place. 

In July, his co workers and I took a quick day trip down to Portland. We all agreed to split the gas costs 4 ways. He drove us from Portland and back to Washington. I had asked if he was tired and needed me to drive, to which he declined. On the way back to Washington, he got pulled over and was issued a $550 speeding ticket. It made the rest of the trip silent and awkward. We stopped for gas, and the total fill up was $50. He charged his co workers and I $25/each, because he felt entitled to more for driving all of us there and back. We all said whatever and just paid him. He had spent $300 at Nike that day, to when we got home he told me that he he was going to return everything because he couldn’t afford the speeding ticket on top of the merchandise. That he doesn’t know if he can afford rent this month, and that he basically has nothing left in his bank account. It made me feel as if he was trying to guilt me into giving him money. 

We were at Costco once, and he wanted to combine our purchases because it was easier to do so. When I paid him back, he said that I short changed him. I broke it down for him, and he noticed that I didn’t pay him the $1 in tax. He requested that I do so, to which I did. I couldn’t believe that somebody could be so stingy. I owed him a quarter once, and he even asked for that back. I didn’t have change on me, and you can’t Apple Pay someone less than $1. He said that I might as well just pay him $1 then. 

He drove me home once, and made a big about how he can’t afford to pay for gas every time. How he doesn’t have any money, so I sent him $5 and told him to just leave me alone. I came over to his apartment because he wanted me to, then he makes me feel bad about having to drive me back home. He said that he wasn’t asking that I send him money, yet of course he kept it anyway instead of giving it back. 

He went to the doctors, and they sent him a bill of $800 after his insurance covered half of the $1,600 total. He made a huge deal about the bill, told me that he was stressed about money, and that he can’t afford to pay the $800. I have no job, I’m in debt after some poor investment choices, but I was going to pay $250 of the bill for him. I was going to do it as a surprise, until we got into a huge argument about something else to which I said forget it. 

He recently told me that he was going to stop using his Citi bank card, because he had a $3,000 balance on it. 

Last night, he was bragging about his stocks in Apple. He showed me his $15,000 in stocks, how his credit card utilization is 1%, and he even showed me his Citi app which showed a statement balance/credit card balance of $300. I asked about the $3,000 he told me that he owed, to which he said that he had paid it off already. He also has $700 in Citi cash back sitting on his card, and I don’t even know how much he has in his checking/savings.

He’s also going to buy a brand new Mazda 3 in a couple of months, after he figures out how to sell his current car. 

This whole entire time, I was led to believe that he was financially struggling. That he was barely making it month to month, that he had nothing in his bank account. He has a job that pays $26/hr, he has a car, he lives in a $1,550/month apartment. Meanwhile I have no job and I’m in debt. Yet he’s always talking about his finances and how he has no money. I’m always constantly worried about him, and trying to help even though I can’t even scrape by myself. After seeing his stocks and Citi cash back, it made me feel manipulated. I don’t even know how much he has in checking/savings on top of the stocks and cash back. I don’t know if I want to continue being associated with someone who keeps talking about how they don’t have any money when they have stocks, financial help from parents when needed, a job, etc. I feel so stressed and sick to my stomach right now. How can someone who clearly isn’t well off, but isn’t financially struggling either, constantly make me feel as if I’m Jeff Bezos and that I should feel bad for his finances. Someone who constantly keeps a watchful eye on if I owe them something as small as $3. What should I do? What should I say? Should I say anything at all? Should I just end the friendship?

TLDR; Friend makes himself out to be financially struggling. I recently found out that he has a job that pays $26/hr, has $15,000 in stocks, has $700 sitting in a cash back credit card, and has a mom who sends him money whenever needed.  Yet makes me feel as if I should feel bad for him, and help them when I have no job and am in debt. Reading the post will have everything make a bit more sense. Thanks for taking time out of your day to give advice! I really need it!",07Nov2019,1
29,"Hi, want some advice with a situation I'm having. 

Short summary of how things work in a comic book store: Basically, you order your comics 2 months in advance and new comic books then come out on Wednesdays of each week and you pick uo your reservations.

I'm a regular customer at a local shop which I like (spend about 50 bucks a week, sometimes more). At one point however, they would forget some of my orders and as I don't check all the time what exactly is coming out when, I would only notice 1-2 weeks later, I'd listen to a podcast and be like, hey I ordered this and never got it. So I got tired of it and gave them a call, I was not rude, not aggressive, nothing, just asked them to be a bit more careful with my orders because I would often miss stuff and then you can't order comic books again if they're gone. Guy on the phone who I actually like was ok and apologetic.

Next time I go to the shop, the said employee tells me that another customer has a similar name to mine and some of my stuff was going to him and that's what was going on. I say fine cool and since then, there haven't been any more mixups. But the same day, another employee comes round and says: ""is this the guy who called to complain?"" Right there, I'm finding this a bit direct, but comic shop employees aren't always known for their social skills. As I'm leaving, same employee asks me: ""anything missing? You got everything? You sure? We forget anything?"" but with a little sarcastic tone. Which I don't appreciate and tell him I don't know man as I don't check in advance, I'm trusting you to get it right.

Since then, I've been back each week, and that employee never fails to make his little comments, of course he doesn't when it's just me and my girlfriend, cause he knows I wouldn't stand for it, but if the ""old regulars"" are there, he'll say it loud and clear with a little smirk. 

I liked this shop and the former owner (who sold recently) was always nice and so are other employees (although they'll sometimes join in when the other makes his shitty jokes), but now I'm considering buying elsewhere. I've held back the urge to tell the guy to shut up as I'm sure he'll turn it into the ""hey it's just a joke man, in a bad mood?"" shit and talking to another employee seems like he'll just report it to this jerk and just make my visits awkward. Should I just switch shops? Am I being susceptible? What do you guys think?",07Nov2019,1
30,"So a few weeks ago I went to the usual coffee/bar shop to do homework (in college) where I usually run into friends. I ran into my best friend who was very drunk and insisting she drive home (it was a Tuesday). I obviously took her keys away from her and drove her home where her girlfriend then came to watch her. 

After this I am re-thinking who my friends are and who I want in my life. I have done alot of personal growth over the past few months and I don't think my friends are very good influences at the moment. The personal growth being getting on anti-depressants that work, working out regularly, not smoking, not drinking very much, doing well in school for once etc. I am not saying I am better then my friend she is an amazing person who has been there for me in the past, but I feel like she is still some-what self destructive.

Another element of this is I do not go out as much as I used too and I am now dating someone so my social needs are ""met"", but I know I cannot place that one one person so I am trying to seek out new people and activities, but am somewhat terrified literally having no friends.

Any advice?.",07Nov2019,1
31,"My dad passed away in 2013. I hadn't seen him/spoken to him since maybe 2002? I never really knew much bout my dad (there was a restraining order), but my mom made it no secret that he had a criminal record and was always on the run from the law for various things (domestic violence, DUI, etc.). Now that I'm an adult I am ""discovering"" more things about my dad such as gang activity, white supremacy tattoos and idealizations. I have been thinking about doing a background check to see criminal history or whatever it will show me. I just want facts. I'm not sure if him being deceased changes anything or even where to start.

37,"I don’t really know how to start this so I’ll just start from the beginning. When I entered middle school I was placed in AP classes. My parents and I were both happy. Then in seventh grade I was put in AP again, however this time I was racked with fear. I don’t know what happened but I was sure I was going to lose everything. I feel like everything I worked for would disappear in seconds and I would amount to nothing. I should have been happy like last year. 

As the years continued I managed to get into AP classes again and now I’m in my junior year. I  will be graduating this year and I can’t bring myself to feel happy about it. Every single year that went by I started to worry more and more. I’m terrified that I’ll do bad on my exams, I know my grandparents would be extremely disappointed. 

I’m not explaining it well but the stress and fear is consuming me every day. My hair has been falling out and a few years ago, to deal with the stress, I developed an eating disorder. Due to that I can’t focus on anything anymore much less school. I think I’ll fail my final exams and I won’t get into a good college. Is there any way to avoid this? I want to get a good job and live comfortably. I want my grandparents to be proud of me.

After trying to getting in and out of my depression. I had a art commission and I got up to 400 dollars. I worked for that money, and I actually felt so happy when I bought a switch. I felt as if i earned something because i worked for it. But my mother is threatening to take it from me, but I told her that I worked for it. I bought it with my hard work. And at the same time her and my step father used my commission money to pay bills, though they did pay me back, i feel un respectable. It’s my money. Is it wrong to tell her it’s my money? 


Also I’m happy for once for buying something I worked for. But this is making my anxiety go a bit weird. If its my money, i can buy what i worked hard for, but i feel as if I don’t deserve it. My mother is slowly blaming games for my depression and anxiety, but it’s stress. I don’t want parents to blame games for mental issues.

43,"So I started a new job mid Sept. It is with the biggest employer where I live. They have great benefits. It is supposedly a really great place to work and room to advance. I have wanted to work at this company for the past 4 or 5 years. I have applied to a bunch jobs and never got a call. A few months ago, a friend from a previous job reached out to me and said I have to apply for this job, the manager is great and I think you'll love it. At first, I was like no I really don't want to go on the interview, that isn't really what I want to do. But he conviced me it would be a great way to get my foot in the door. So I agreed to go and the 2 interviews went well. I got the job. So I left a dead end job with a bunch of people that I loved working with and I had a great boss. Fast forward to now, this new job has been nothing but a nightmare. I am always getting ""constructive crictism"" from my boss for things that were never issues in my previous jobs. I even talked to my old boss about all the problems I was having at my new job. She said it doesn't sound like me and everything I was getting in trouble for were not things she ever had an issue with me. At my last two jobs, lets just say I was a favorite and I never got in trouble. I was always the right hand man for my last two bosses. They trusted me with everything.  So I went to this new job, wanting to learn and be helpful. I sat at the same desk for 3 weeks doing the exact same thing. The other girls in the office wouldn't show me how to do anything. They would just say you have to be trained by a trainer.  They wouldn't even show me where the mail box was or how to forward phones. They would just do it. When I said something about wanting to learn more to my boss, it became a big deal. The girls were passive aggressive to me after that. You can just tell they want to be the favorite to the boss and they don't want me stealing any of their sunshine. So at this job, after 6 months I can transferred departments which is great. However, my boss and other people keep saying how great this office is and how other offices are horrible. My old job would take me back in a heart beat. They haven't filled my position yet. Do I stick it out for 6 months or go back to my old job? I really just want to be successful and if I leave the current job I will feel like a failure. But I know in my heart, it isn't a good fit for me.",07Nov2019,1

I feel strange accepting the money because it’s such a large amount and  an out of the blue thing for him to do (he’s always been quite tight and hesitant to give us money).

Ive been at my current college for only one semester at this point, but I really want to transfer for next semester. I never really liked my current school and only came here because it was the most ""prestigious"" one I got into and I figured I was obligated to go to the ""best"" place possible. So far I have really not been enjoying my time here and am constantly dreading being here any longer. 

I have already applied &amp; been accepted to a school for the Spring. I have loved this school for a while (2nd choice, not as ""prestigious"") and realize that it is really where I would love to be able to be the next 4 years. 

My parents were supportive of me going thru with this until this week, when suddenly they think I am making a huge mistake leaving this early. Now suddenly I am panicking and wondering if they are right? Deep down I know how I feel and want to make this change for my mental health, but what if I am not thinking straight? They want me to finish the next semester here as well but the thought of that makes me sick to my stomach.

47,"Lets start out by saying I love my roommate and she started as a really good friend. I allowed her and her two cats to move in with me after she went through a rough breakup. Fast forward 10 months, she's still with the guy that dumped her (he's awful), she never cleans the litter box or sweeps up the excessive amount of cat hair and litter bits, rarely bathes them, never brushes them, allows them all over the kitchen and counters, etc. They've scratched my couch and leather ottoman, the sealing on our patio door, and paint off of most of the doors. On a regular basis I remind her of little things like nicely asking her to wipe the cat hair off the stove, or if she needs help brushing them, etc. The bathroom smells so bad of ammonia and I'm not sure if she can even tell. I put three different air fresheners in there but they haven't really worked at all. I don't want to just bring it upon myself to clean the litter box but I'm wondering if that'll make her realize how bad it is for me. I treat these cats as if they were my own pets, always giving them love and taking care of them when my roommate isn't around, which I think is making this more frustrating.

Roughly a week ago, my mum came over and saw the cat on the kitchen counter and absolutely freaked. She said how dirty and unsanitary that is for an area where food gets prepared, even if I don't cook that much. I know cats can be cleaner than dogs, but that can't be the case when the cats are using a filthy litter box. I casually mentioned my mum's reaction later on to my roommate and she basically rolled her eyes and was like eh.. whatever. So tonight, she gets home from work and I mentioned that I had read an article on cats on counters and it really did seem very unsanitary cause of the litter box paws. She got defensive and said she didn't used to allow him on the counter. I didn't have a response but really wanted to say ""...so you gave up when you moved in here?"". it's just made things tense and awkward. 

Any help, or advice on approaching the situation to a sensitive/easily defensive girl would be really helpful.

51,"Hey Folks,

My mom is a wonderful kind, strong woman but some of her “jokes” are questionable. 

Calling our Muslim neighbor a terrorist 
Giving the nickname Srunchie-bin laden to our dog
Using the phrase “Run like Kenyans” 
Using the word “chink” in reference to Asian people 
Complaining how people are identifying as non-binary and using they/them
“All lives matter”
And several instances of questioning/taking jabs at my partner’s masculinity because I don’t ask of him to shoehorn himself into the stereotypical model of what a “man” should be. 

Every time I confront her about these things, she says “she’s joking” but nothing about what she’s saying is funny. The tipping point was last night when my partner and I were looking for apartments. My mom was giving my partner advice about how living with me meant that “I will make him feel like he’s the most insensitive, racist person” because I have tried to communicate to my mother that her comments/jokes could be perceived as hurtful. Regardless if she was joking, I don’t know her intent. What’s to stop people who do want to cause harm from using the same excuse? Why even risk the chance of hurting someone’s feelings? Why continue saying these things after I explained that those jokes make me uncomfortable? 

With any luck, I’ll be out of the house by the new year but I’m really struggling over here. I don’t even know what more I can do. I guess I just need confirmation that my feelings are justified. 

If anything, I need advice on self preservation right now. 

Thanks folks!",07Nov2019,1

63,"Hi! I have no idea where to post this and this seemed like a good place. I have no idea how the business world or companies or investments work, so maybe you guys could tell me if this seems legit. 

Long story short, a friend (F, 21) of mine, we will call her Ashley, went to LA on vacation a few weeks ago and met a guy at a hostel that she was staying at. We will call him Bill. She’s a very social, outgoing, free spirited person and it sometimes gets her into dangerous situations. She met this man who she got to talking with and apparently he’s a rich investor who owns a hotel in LA and is just staying at the hostel to get away for the weekend, even though he owns a home (first red flag). 

He approached her and her older friend that she went with (35, F), we will call her Megan, and only wanted to talk to Ashley, not Megan. Ashley is beautiful, tall, blonde, and young, so this is expected however the man in question is Megan’s age so it was odd that he went straight for the young woman instead of the woman his age (red flag #2). 

Anyways, Ashley told BJ about her dream of opening a unique bar-club in LA one day and he was very engaged and loved her idea. The weekend went by, Ashley and Megan came home, and we thought that was that. However, not even a week later, Bill called Ashley and told her he would fly her back to LA to discuss the business model of her vision. 

She hopped on a plane and hasn’t been back since. All of a sudden she’s going to meetings everyday with investors, signing contracts, viewing potential buildings for her club, and was signed as the president of her new found business. She even now has the keys to her new building that will soon turn into her night club. She says that BJ has put her up in a hotel every night, hires drivers to drive her to and from her meetings all day, and puts money in her bank account every week. 

She also says that she’s been having sex with him and spending a ton of time with him. Again, she is 21 and he is 39. She says he is the smartest person she’s ever met and has convinced her the Holocaust is a scam and never happened. 

This sounds extremely sketchy and dangerous to me. First off, she mentioned an idea and a week later she’s in LA signing papers to be the president of a company and being handed over the keys to a brand new building. She says she’s gotten $200,000 off an investor already. This man that she just met has already convinced her that the Holocaust is not real and is constantly having sex with her. 

I don’t understand how anyone could think this was legit; but she showed us paper work and apparently that’s proof enough. Could a business offer happen this quickly? Why would anyone want to take a 21 year old college student’s idea and turn it into this huge thing where she is heavily involved, instead of just stealing her idea without a second thought?

It sounds way too good to be true, but again I am not sure how business works. Please tell me if any of this sounds legit or if it sounds like a scam, or worse... a sex trafficking ring.",07Nov2019,1

70,"This is my first time ever posting and I'm really unsure if it will help, mostly because of the advice I've heard from friends and coworkers.

I've been working for a municipality for quite some time, and finally we had enough people that quit or retired so we had more people hired on. 
One of these new hired people is the one who assaulted me.

I was given a work order to gather the materials for a large artificial Christmas tree. The materials are stored in a once abandoned elementary school that the city I work for had bought from the county years ago. Many different departments store their goods and activity materials there. 

I found myself in a room that our ""special events"" department stores their glowing mohawks, glowing rings, thunder tubes, etc. In this room there was the item I was nearly blinded with. Said item being a confetti popper, but not just any popper. The kind they pop off during Mardi Gras. From the side of a float, far away from anyone's eyes. 

I was in this room alone with my back to the door looking for plywood to complete the tunnel that follows through the base of the artificial tree. I heard a voice come from behind me that said, ""Fuck this shit!"". I turned around to whay seemed to be a powerful punch straight to the bridge of my nose. I doubled over and instantly my eyes were burning and I heard laughter. It was the new hire I never had worked with. He shot a giant popper in my face. This popper tube is four foot long, and three inches in diameter. 

I immediately went to wash my eyes with a small bottle of eye wash after I found that the water in the plumbing of the shutdown elementary school was dark grey. So dark grey that even my blurred vision could see it. I had used the urinal earlier that day and saw the water and ran the sinks in hope that it would just be settled debris in the pipes. All to no avail. It was a thirty minute ride back to our shop too. I tried to ration the drops, but I couldn't help running out. 

I hate that this post is running so long, but the guy that assaulted me got fired. The person that drove me back to the shop told my director about the incident. How it happened, how I looked, how I reacted. I had to wash my eyes out with rushing tap water for fifteen minutes for protocol. Still didn't help. I had to see the city doctor. By then I had used five bottles of eye wash, but what helped was the bottle of soothing eye drops that my coworker gave me. 

They sent me home. Had to catch a ride from the guy who drove me from the jobsite. When I left the guy who shot me came back. Telling the bosses that I was shooting them with him and he accidentally shot me in the eyes. 

I've known these people for years, and now it seems like they think I'm a liar. I pride myself on my ability of delivering the truth in a tactful way. And honestly I'm hurt that these people I truly care about are so quick to dismiss me as a liar. 

I guess I just don't know what to do.",07Nov2019,2

84,"FYI: USA based.  I'm facing a dilemma where my wife is under a new employer and in open enrollment for health benefits, with coverage starting January 2020.  I have insurance through my current employer with dependent coverage for our daughter, but our open enrollment isn't until June 2020.  My wife had independent coverage paid for her previous employer, hence the separate plans.  

We wish to go under a family plan under her new employer during the current open enrollment, however my employer refuses to let me drop coverage in January 2020 and said I have to wait until our open enrollment period.  However, my wife's new employer does not allow additions to benefits before open enrollment (so I cannot stay with my current plan until June 2020 and then switch to hers).  The plans' open enrollment will never align.  

I could (but won't) enroll in both plans and have double coverage January to June 2020 and pay both premiums but only use her company's plan.  But with the amazing US medical transaction market, both insurance companies would deny any claims stating there is other primary coverage found, placing me in a double-premium-paying no-coverage-having threatening-to-hunt-down-someone mobius strip mind fuck.  

With planning for a second child and the astronomical medical costs involved, her new plan would save us thousands of dollars which would offset a double premium for six months.  But in my mind, a $300 divorce fee and a $90 marriage license fee to get remarried just to trigger a ""life changing event"" so I can cancel my insurance in January just seems logical.  Thoughts?

Context:

I  work in a factory that has merged with another company in the same  building. This happened at the beginning of the year. We were told we  would get pay raises in the summer and slowly try to equal our pay with  the employees of the parent company. This never happened. When any  inquiries were made about the topic leadership simply said “ I don’t  remember saying that.” Even though a number of employees are obviously  upset about it. We’ve been working side by side with the other employees  and this is how everyone knows they make more, btw for less tedious  work and those employees are super lazy. Majority of us have to pick up  their slack and when we complain nothing is done. December is our annual  reviews and when we get our usual pay raise. I have worked at the  company for 2 1/2 years and am moved around a lot as I can run any  machine. But I still make around $3 less than the other employees of the  parent company who also do factory work but take 6 of their people to  do a 2 person job.

If  I’m not given the pay raise I believe I deserve for my hard work I have  considered putting the company on blast. YouTube, local newspapers etc.  Not just the pay issue, but there are other issues as well. I am and  have been looking for other jobs but haven’t got anything back so far.

If you were in my position, what would you do?

Also, we were told by leadership we were not allowed to discuss our pay with coworkers which I know is illegal.",07Nov2019,2

I have no idea what to do in this situation, because she’s clingy, and holds onto friendships just because she’s been in them for a long time.

I’m hoping one day a major airline such as Delta or United calls but there is no guarantee as it is highly competitive.

I’ve been talking to some guard units that want me to come and visit with the potential of getting hired. I would fly anything in the military... this is for the excitement, and career advancement.

He pinch the bottom of my breast softly enough for me to think it was maybe an accident or maybe I didn't feel exactly what I thought I had. So I asked him not to do that and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about (he is an old guy 80+) so I proceed again. He then did the same thing but a lot harder . I immediately got my equipment and left the room. I let the nurse know and she got the police involved. When I was explaining to the sheriff what happened, he was justifying his actions by saying he had dementia and he was old so I got the ""oh poor old man"" vibe and it bothered me especially because he was coherent and responding normally so I feel like he knew what he was doing. I wasn't going to press charges initially, it's just something I felt had to be noted so more women aren't exposed to that. I then spoke to my other coworkers about it and one of them told me that she too had been in that situation with that man and that she didn't say anything because she wasn't sure if it was his intention (like I felt when he did it the first time) . So I feel like I have to be the one to put a stop to it because I think he constantly gets away with things like this. He plays the "" incoherent , I don't understand what is happening"" role when the police steps in but he was acting like a normal person when me and my other co-worker were in there. So I'm not sure what goes into pressing charges or if it's even worth it. My mom is a CNA and she tells me all these crazy stories about these things happening all the time.

110,"So a couple days ago, I (F 19) made an emergency psychiatrist appointment. I had been on Effexor (to treat my panic disorder) for about 4 days (at 37.5mg—lowest dose) and had extreme symptoms from it. Every medication I have tried to treat my depression and anxiety has failed miserably. I have gotten serotonin syndrome twice now, and finally told my psychiatrist that I was done experimenting with these meds as I am currently in nursing school and cannot function with the severity of the symptoms they give me. She came to the conclusion that I am “treatment resistant” and should look into other options, some of them being TMS therapy and ketamine infusions. Has anyone ever been deemed “treatment resistant” and has anyone found TMS/Ketamine infusions helpful? Have you tried any natural remedies that have seemed to help you? I really need some form of hope at this point that something out there can help lessen the affects chronic depression and panic disorder have on my life. Anything helps.",07Nov2019,1
111,"There's this girl who rides the bus to work everyday and I also ride the same bus to get home from class (college). In high school, I didn't have that many girlfriends but it was a lot easier to get to know someone that I was interested in because of the classroom environment. The relationships that I did have were with girls I was already good friends with and knew pretty well.

However, since graduating I found that I'm terrible at approaching people I've never met and starting a conversation. When the tables are turned and someone approaches me, I handle it well and come off as friendly and sincere.

With this girl, I ran through several scenarios in my head (I'm a bit of an over-thinker) on how to get my foot in the door, but every time I attempt to execute my plan, one little thing goes a little unexpected and I decide to abort the mission. I know that once I break the ice, I can carry a conversation well enough to be charismatic and funny.

She's really cute and I just want to have a conversation to see if there's anything else about her that interests me. It's gotten to the point where I'm a bit obsessive and thinking about her all the time. Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy; like I could be on the verge of becoming stalker-ish (which scares me).

I was a very shy kid, but I've generally improved on my social skills. Nevertheless, I find myself panicking inside when I'm near her and even think about talking her. My heart starts pounding and I freeze up.

Any advice is welcome.

115,"Context, I met a girl about 2.5 months ago, who’s good friends with a couple of my good friends and we started talking. I asked her to homecoming, which went good, where we both said we liked each other, then we hung out 2 more times since then, and recently she told me that even though she likes me, she’s going through some stressful stuff, and can’t be in a relationship right now. I obviously have no ill will towards her whatsoever, if that’s how it is, that’s how it is, all I want is for her to be happy with whatever situation she finds herself in, but I can’t shake this feeling of sadness. I made big compromises with myself and my beliefs, because of how much I liked her. When I found out she vaped, I wanted to cut it off, but thought she was worth it, so I looked past it, and same thing with alcohol, but looked past it, just because of how awesome she is. I even was willing to lose my virginity to this girl if the time came, and I’m a Christian, and before her, I wasn’t willing to give an inch of ground on that, no matter the circumstances. We were really, really close, and she got me through some really difficult times a month ago, probably the most difficult situation I’ve had in my life up to that point, (some really messed up stuff happened to say the least),without even knowing it. Whenever something like this happens with other girls, I just move on, because usually I start talking to someone else to get my mind off it, but this time I don’t WANT to talk to anyone else, because every time I look at a girl, all I see is her. I know I have to move on, and I am, I uninstalled apps like Snapchat for a couple days, because I know that seeing her face is just gonna make it hurt worse. It’s just not easy, especially because we really share a lot of the same friends.

Anyway we got into an argument a few weeks ago and I ended up breaking things off. He didn't get over it and he would keep texting me, really pissy things like ""are you with anyone,"" ""who else is fucking you,"" etc. I mostly didn't respond. Just last week though I ended up talking to him again and invited him over and we hooked up again. I realized this was a mistake and I texted him the next day that I didn't want to see him any more. This got him really mad and he started constantly texting, calling, etc.

A few days later he caught me outside my work and he was really irate. He was saying things like I was being a little bitch, I was playing him etc. I ended up saying something like, piss off, dude, what if your wife found out. This made him enraged and he ended up grabbing my neck and pushing me against the wall. I don't think he meant to but he scratched my eye a bit and grabbed me by my face. He left after that but I'm still shaken and unsure what to do. I really don't want to get involved with police or anything but I don't want this guy to come around anymore.

To his credit, he has been filing out applications for the past several months. I do feel as if he could be doing more though. There's no way he has filled out all the apps he could and I seriously doubt there are no jobs whatsoever that will hire him. It's also been a very touchy subject lately, so I'm anxious to talk to him at length about all this.

 I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to be with him, but I see no future with him. He has told me that depression had been the main reason he hasn't done anything with his life. I think there's certainty some truth to that, but I think there's more to it. I have suffered from severe depression, as well as several other psychiatric disorders, throughout my entire life. But I still worked and now I am in college. I think much of the problem lies in his inability to push himself hard enough to get out of this rut.

 I'm starting to question whether or not there is any future with him. I have considered taking a break from him with the hopes that in the meantime, he will be motivated to push himself harder. Is that a good idea? Does anyone have a better idea?

Since I’ve lived here I can’t help but notice the amount of traffic in my neighbors driveway. There’s a big window right next to my couch so I can see both of our driveways which are not connected. Cars always pull into their driveway, turn off, someone walks inside and leaves within 2 minutes to 15 minutes of arriving. I’m obviously not in front of the window 24/7 but on days I’m off I’ve seen as many as 15 different cars in one day.

I'm in a bit of situation as of late and there's no one in my life I can seek advice from. My mother passed away when I was 2 and my relationship with my father is not great and we've talked probably twice since I left for school. I'm a student athlete, specifically I play basketball. This is not a boast at all but I think I am very good I am very confident in my abilities. I was recruited to play for a relatively small division 1 school I will not name for anonymity reasons. It's been my dream since I can remember to be in the NBA and I believe I have some sort of a chance to enter the draft next year and luckily land in the NBA as a 2nd round pick. I do believe this however is my only chance. My numbers aren't great but they aren't bad either, I did not shine as much I hoped I would. I fear if I stay in school my minutes will be significantly reduced to make room for the freshmen on the rotation (the coaching staff has a history of doing this). Even if I'm not drafted I could possibly get my shot via the development league. Here's my conundrum, when I was in High School I developed a fascination with physics and I started learning about astrophysics and I became addicted with learning all I can about it in my free time. I have faith that I could possibly make it in the NBA and can make my dream come true but relative to my dream of being an Astrophysicist it is much more unlikely. So I'm here for advice.

137,"I am a grad student at a reputed university, and I work part time at a Cafe on campus, to get a few extra bucks to take care of my rent. When I joined a year back, I enjoyed the work, my coworkers were nice and trained me well, but after a while, a new manager stepped in, and things have changed a lot since then.

I work really hard. I go out of my way to help customers, and I don't even get tips. This being said, I always felt that this new manager did not have a good feeling about working with me. New students who joined after me were made to rotate responsibilities around the kitchen (cooking, prep, washing) but I was always made to do one task only. I requested him that I wanted to learn the other tasks but he kept giving some excuses to not let me in. When he talks to me it feels like he vents out his frustration directly at me. I have not seen him talk that way to the new recruits.

Now, I have kept quiet through all this, and it has severely distracted me from my studies at times. And there have been multiple occasions I have wanted to yell at him but my nature of keeping quiet always came in the way. If I did something wrong he never came up to me saying I needed to improve; I have heard him bitch about coworkers and I'm pretty sure he has probably done similarly for me. That being said, I've also noticed he consistently kept non-Indian students in the kitchen, which makes me feel further attacked - is this a racist thing? Thing is, his actions are all passive-aggressive and I don't have solid evidence to show that this is how I have been treated. And this behavior has affected my mental well-being. I need the money to lighten my burden, but I cannot work with this person. To reduce my interactions with him, I reduced the number of shifts I work there. Today I took a leave and he sends me a message saying, 'are you ready to retire? You have been of great service but I think it is time we part ways'. I feel like he has been planning to phase me out ever since he joined. Should I report his behavior and these events to HR, and if so, what should be my approach to do so? Just so you know, another hardworking coworker of mine was similarly phased out under the pretext of being 'fired'. He didn't allow her to 'resign' with dignity. 

I am asking this because I have been raised with the notion that men have to be strong, not cry, and things like these shouldn't affect us, and we should be more 'manly' and alert to avoid such events from happening. I just haven't been taught how. And in a new country, among unknown people, this is something bothering me a lot, making my head feel like it's bursting apart.

142,"This is not going to be an easy post. 

When I was younger, at age 14, I found myself in a terrible situation. After stripping on webcam for what I believed to be another teenage female, I became a victim of a sextortion scheme. While I was able to follow certain...advice I found on the internet, I was able to thwart this issue before it got way worse than it actually was and is for many not so lucky people. However, the person that had attempted to extort me sent me a few links...my a video of myself was found on at least one website that I could open...perhaps more. The thing is, this website wasn't some account holding these videos. It was clearly something much deeper than that. It was an entire website dedicated to the sextortion of people, mainly underage people at that, and mainly females at that. The scariest part was how accessible this video was on common search engines. I was able to put this issue in the back of the head...or at least learn to deal with it despite the 7 years of anxiety and mentally-altering state it has more than likely put me in.

Then this year, TechCrunch commissioned internet safety company AntiToxin to analyze how easy it is to find child sexual exploitation material on the internet. This request was based on a tip, although there were definitely more than one. I will not confirm or deny that I was the sender of this tip, but I need to articulate how frustrated I am that even common search engines regularly display and even suggest this material.

The problem is...the problem is so much bigger than anyone realizes that removing the videos and images of teenagers (most of whom are unidentifiable an unable to be accurately assessed to be underage) is simply not the biggest priority for the FBI, the DOJ, and NCMEC. (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) I cannot stress this enough.

I have been waiting for four years. Four years of researching this issue in tremendous depth. This includes combing through thousands and thousands of arrest records of people arrested for Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI) crimes. This also includes academic papers about detection methods and challenges faced by the previously mentioned organizations. This includes outlines of strategies undertaken by these organizations and the severe limitations they are faced with. I have been waiting ***four years*** for someone to do something about it.

Then, a NYT article came out in late August of this year, finally bringing this issue to much larger reach than ever before. [The Internet is Overrun with Images of Child Sexual Abuse. What Went Wrong?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html) finally shined light on this issue. Here are some stats from either the article or other research materials that will likely surprise you and leave you in a state of utter dismay:

* 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are victims of sexual assault in the United States
* In 2014, NCMEC recieved 1 million reports of CSA or CSAI. In 2018, that number rose to 18.4 million. That includes 45 million images of CSAI. 
* Some orgs estimate that up to 1/12 males in the US have accessed CSAI in recent times. There is simply no way to catch them all.
* Going off of the previous stat, NCMEC, the FBI, and the US DOJ prioritize by age. 
* The vast vast majority of images they encounter are young children, and toddlers, being subjected to violent sexual assault or torture. 

And this is only the tip of the iceberg folks, believe me. But here's the problem: While reports to NCMEC have skyrocketed, arrests have risen very slightly and federal funding has remained essentially flat over a 12 year period. 

I have been waiting. For. Four. Years. For someone to finally bring this issue to a global scale so it gets the attention it needs. I was hoping the #MeToo movement or something would finally do this, but it did only very slightly. NCMEC and the ICAC (Internet Crimes Against Children) Task Forces need more money and they need it now. ***""Twenty years ago, the online images were a problem; 10 years ago, an epidemic. Now, the crisis is at a breaking point.""***

So I realized something. I believe there exists a moral obligation for someone to do something about this. I also understand that I have the capability to do something about this. Therefore, because I recognize I have the ability to do something about this and because I believe it needs to be done, I *must* do something about this. And yes, I genuinely do have a plan to address this, from speaking at highly-recognized event on my university's campus and eventually to the US Senate. This is not bullshit. It is the result of four years of pain, confusion, and diligent research that has brought me here. 

But I would seriously appreciate some advice before my life becomes what I expect it to become after I initiate the first phase of this plan. 

Thank you.",07Nov2019,4
143," I have a math teacher in my school, and since to protect his privacy despite his weird behavior we’re going to call him Walter. 

 Walter is 40 and has been teaching at our school for a few years now. When I first started I didn’t notice anything weird, but a couple small things he did are making me suspicious.

 The first incident was Halloween. I had a veil on for my costume and he walked over to me during class and reached his hand to fix a couple hairs on my head. Not my face, but on top of my head. Walter made a comment on my veil and walked off. I could be overreacting on this incident, but the next one is the reason why I came here. 

  Just today, my friend, who we will call Daisy was in his tutoring session and was wearing a skirt that day. He walked over to hear and her legs were crossed, and Walter made a comment on that”When your a female and you’re wearing a skirt you shouldn’t cross your legs.” and walked off. 

  Daisy texted me right after feeling disgusted and violated sand we are thinking about bringing this to the schools attention. But I need your advice. Are we overreacting? Did Walter not mean anything bad? I’m having a lot of conflicting thoughts on this but I need your input. What do you think Reddit?",07Nov2019,5

Posting from a throwaway account because I don't want my sister to see.

So, I made a post three months ago on another subreddit, which got mostly ignored (thank you for the one person who replied though). Maybe it's because I tend to ramble and write novels, but I hope maybe this time some people will actually help, please.

I wrote the last post after I was extremely down (we had just been evicted from my childhood home, and had only a day to collect our things - many of which I couldn't find, so now quilts my mum made me when I was a toddler are on a landfill somewhere, along with photographs and other precious things)

Anyway, another thing has happened, so here I am with a new post (after gathering my courage because talking to people even through typing only is terrifying).

&amp;#x200B;

ACTUAL POST BEGINS HERE, IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BEGINNING

So, as you may have figured from the title, I am a woman, with a beard. I'm not talking about a few hairs here and there. I can grow a perfectly full and bushy beard some men would be jealous of. I have very light skin, but my beard is a dark auburn, which means it's extremely noticable.  
I turn 30 this year, and I've had a beard for more than half my life now. As you can imagine, school wasn't the greatest. I got bullied not only by my fellow students, but by teachers as well. (I used to grow my hair super long and pretty much hid my face behind it, which prompted one of my teachers to loudly call me mentally disorded in front of the class, for example.)  
Additionally, my mum is someone who likes to brag, and since she can't brag about me, she's telling everbody about my condition. All her friends? They know. Our neighbours? They know (reason why I don't even like going outside in our garden). My teachers? They knew (One of them even came to me in the middle of a lesson to loudly talk with me about it...)  
I've lived these past ten or more years basically as a shut-in. Shaving my face more than maybe three times a week hurts too much. One, because I have sensitive skin and two, because I go over the same part over, and over again, because I'm paranoid.  
I don't have a job, and live with my dad (who is the most amazing person, who never complains and who supports me with everything, along with my sister...and wow do I feel guilty)  
(Before you ask, laser removal has never worked on me. I've tried for years)  
When I was 18, it was suggested that I have my blood checked, and yes, I have too many male hormones in my blood. They wanted to give me hormones and do more bloodwork, but the thing is, I'm deathly afraid of needles. And then they told be I'd have to have my blood drawn three more times in that week, so they could check how I was reacting to the hormones.  
I ran out of the hospital in a panic and well...it's 12 years later now and I never went back.  
That is until last month. My father made an appoinment for me without telling me (I'm not mad at him, it has to be done) and in the week leading up to the appointment, I couldn't sleep, I was crying all the time, I had panic attacks.  
And on the day of the appointment, in the fancy private clinic...the doctor didn't show up.

And now here I am, not knowing what I should do. I thought something would finally change, I'd finally get rid of the beard and maybe live a normal life. My motivation is nowhere to be seen and I'm back to my daily negative thoughts.

What should I do? It's not like there are a ton of doctors who treat hirsutism. At least not ones I know of. But even if I should find one, what if the hormones do exactly nothing? And even if I get rid of the beard, how does one even human? I haven't had friends since highschool, I've never been in a relationship, I'm literally scared of other people.

So the advice I'm looking for is just...what should I do from here?   
(And I know this is a lot to ask, since this is the internet, but please at least pretend to be nice?)",07Nov2019,1
145,"This isn’t going to be a dramatic story. I’ve told my mom, sister and boyfriend what has happened and they all seemed to have the same reactions, but I don’t know if it’s because they’re just biased.

I currently work for a company that has 3 tiers of management. Shift lead, Supervisor, and AM. I am currently a shift lead, but with the short amount of management I’ve been given supervisor work. 

There are three other leads, and none of them get the work load I get. There is also another supervisor, but it seems that I’m the one that’s teaching her things. They tend to turn to me when delegating tasks/work and I don’t mind, I’m able to learn things on my own and quickly. They’ve done a terrible job training and the company was undergoing new management. 

I’ve expressed to my store manager that I’m not interested in moving up any further than a shift lead. But, since everything always falls on me, a raise wouldn’t hurt. She had told her boss, our Area Manager, how much work I truly do for this company, but I’m not willing to be a supervisor. Now, if they weren’t willing to give me a raise AND strictly let me do what my job description is, I don’t care. But they have be doing beyond work and ended up luring me to become a supervisor.

I don’t want to be a supervisor because this company requires so much attention and overall just so much of my time. I’m constantly working OT, coming in to close and open. Opening on my days off, etc. I’m not willing to be 100% devoted. I have school, family, and I like my social life.  He offered that I only work 4 days a week whatever days I wanted as supervisor. I thought that was fine, it’ll work for me. 

But, in order to receive my raise I needed to take 2 test. 1 of the test I’ve already taken back in August. After I had passed that test, I submitted a request in September to take the 2nd test. No answer. October I’ve submitted it twice. Today, I found out he had denied all three request. He is pointing fingers at the women who is in charge of these test, saying they’re waiting on them and vice versa. But it made me so upset because he had denied my first request. 

For context, every month our store gets evaluated. During the month of August, I had failed (evaluation was conducted during my shift). After that, he has sent out an email saying all promotions will be on hold to the stores who fail consecutively, key word consecutively. I spoke with my store manager and asked if that affected me, because this was my first time failing. She assured me it won’t, he runs multiple stores and half of us had failed. 

My store manager texted him asking why the first request was denied, he said he was waiting for the store to pass evaluation. And I did. I passed September as it was conducted during my shift. But, he has stated that policy wasn’t gonna affect me. 

They’re now unwilling to give me backpay for the work I’ve done for the last 3 months. And he has been holding up my paperwork and it just feels like he doesn’t want me to receive this raise at all. Should I go to HR? Is there anything I can do or say? I honestly didn’t think it was a big deal, yes I got upset but I didn’t feel like there’s anything I can do about it. I just want to know my options. 

Sorry if this post is scrambled, I tried to explain it the best I could.",07Nov2019,1

148,"So I'm turning over a new leaf. 

I'm going to be 39 next week. This is the first time ...damn near ever... that instead of crying and/or drowning myself in alcohol I feel like making changes for the better. I want to know from someone on the outside looking in, what I might be missing in my journey to have a decent ending to a shitty beginning. 

**Major Quests/Quest Rewards**

* Graduate from college (next June)
* Get a job as a web designer or go freelance
* Buy first home
* Travel money
* Get body type I want
* Savings for retirement

**Stats**

*39

* Fat af

* No degree

* Live with parents

* Just quit a terrible job that paid well but I couldn't stand anymore due to workplace bullying from my manager's lackey and ZERO help from my manager or HR. Took a $19k paycut. 

* Out of savings

So I realize I'm in a terrible position, and it's going to be a long hard grind to get those quests done. I'm also very *very* **very** alone and I'm having problems coming to terms with my spinsterhood. I need to deal with the fact that I'm going to be alone and I cant figure out how.

I am in my second year of college (I graduated a year early), and I have all A’s, I’m just undecided. I saved up $11,000 of my own money to pay off my OWN new car. I pay my own phone bill already, pay for my own gas, and pay for anything else that I want to have or go do. Really the only thing I depend on my mom for is my car insurance, food, and shelter. My curfew on weekdays is 10:00 pm and on weekends it’s 1:00 am.

I also have a boyfriend of two and a half years, and she complains every time I go over to see him. And don’t get me started on how she reacts if I ask to stay the night with. It’s always a “no,” accompanied by yelling and telling me I would look like a “slut” or “whore” for doing that. She knows that I’m sexually active. 

She hovers over me a lot. She tracks my location, texts/calls me regularly when I’m out. I’m not allowed to stay in my room, even for homework - I HAVE to be in the living room with everyone or I get snapped at. She tells me I’m not allowed to leave the house if I’ve already gone out for two or three days in a row. I feel suffocated. 

Lately I’ve been talking to her about me moving out, however she yells and tells me I’ll never be able to make it on my own. She has told me that if I leave she’ll get rid of my car insurance and call the cops that I’m driving without insurance every time I get in my car. She tells me I’m not thinking rationally, and that I’m making stupid decisions by wanting to move out. She makes it sound like I am being ungrateful for what I have in her house, and that I should just comply to her rules. She wants me to stay until May after I graduate from the community college I attend, which I think isn’t that unreasonable of a request, but I am becoming increasingly impatient.

I am really appreciative of everything she does for me, and like I said I love her dearly. There’s so many more reasons and examples of her being an overprotective mom, and I could probably give many examples of me making stupid teenager decisions. I just feel like this isn’t one.

Should I stay home, avoid the financial burdens I would face, and just comply with her rules while in school? Or should I go out on my own? Any help would be appreciated.",07Nov2019,1

To set everything in place, I'm a 16 year old male, sophomore in high school. My girlfriend is also 16 but several months older and is a junior. She's turning 17 soon. We've been dating for only 8 days. Yeah only 8 FRICCING DAYS and I'm already on this emotional rollercoaster. Here we go:

 

To set everything in place, I'm a 16 year old male, sophomore in high school. My girlfriend is also 16 but several months older and is a junior. She's turning 17 soon. We've been dating for only 8 days. Yeah only 8 FRICCING DAYS and I'm already on this emotional rollercoaster. Here we go:

So there's this girl I have been friends with for a year. We met on a groupchat we were both invited to on Snapchat and we were in the same ELA class. Since then, we've been good friends. I've always liked her. It kind of hurt when my friend's friend asked her out. They dated for a month and I tried to put those feelings for her aside. I did a good job of doing so. And then on the 26th, she dumped him.

I asked her why. I asked if it was because he literally read her DMs, restricted her from ditching, smoking, etc. and she said she just ""lost feelings"" for him and nothing else bothered her. 2 Days later, I found out she liked me. I already know her as a person and she has dated/crushed on lots and lots and lots of guys. She also has sex with a good portion of them. I knew this full well but I still asked her out anyway.

This is where I just fucking hate myself. I just acted on the fact that we both like each other. And on the fact that I could finally get my annoying cousins to shut the fuck up about me getting a girlfriend. Though I told her from the start that this was my first ever relationship and it might be hard to get used to holding hands, kissing, hugging, etc. She was fine with that and told me it was no pressure.

I may have liked her as a friend and I think she was kinda hot but I planned to just date, tell everyone, stop being called a fag, get used to being somewhat romantic, and have her dump me with the rest of the many many guys she's been with. I honestly didn't expect to actually gain feelings for her. This may sound like some sort of sociopath thing - dating just to make them happy and get everyone else to shut the fuck up.

Though as we got to talking more and more like a couple, I actually started feeling stuff for her. I at first sent hearts just to pretend to be affectionate and keep her with me but when I saw that she actually genuinely meant what she's sent, I started blushing inside. I got a warm feeling which I believe is called love. I actually WANTED to hold hands with her, kiss her, hug her, etc. We started hugging right before and after each class. I didn't expect those hugs to be so amazing that I would never want them to end.

I never imagined holding hands to be a magical thing. And I never actually thought I would get legitimately deep in love. I didn't think I was gonna have this happen.This may sound great like some cliche Hollywood love story ""kid dates her for rep but then actually falls in love"" but what follows is my reasoning behind this post.

Remember when I said she's dated or had a crush on many guys? I started to wonder why she just breaks up and likes someone else days later. And then one day, she was absent. It was no big deal. One of her many ex's is my friend Allan. Me, Allan, and two other friends were there. Allan kind of shed light on the fact that I could very very easily be one of those guys who just dates her for like a month and just gets dumped.

I made me remember why she broke up with her ex in the first place - a simple loss of feelings. What if she just ""loses feelings"" for me? As I fell in love with her, this became such a big worry in my mind. She wrote me a love letter a day or two later saying that I'm one of the best she has had and she actually really likes me more than pretty much everyone she's dated. I'll just put what she said:

*""I really do like you a lot. I've been in so many relationships that haven't worked out, but I have a great feeling about ours. Now, in the future we may have our ups and downs, but we can work it out""*

It sounds genuine. I really hope it is but the fact of the matter is she's probably said that about every guy she's dated. I feel like I'm supposed to believe and trust the letter but I just can't knowing she broke up with someone because of ""lost feelings"" and has dated countless guys in the past. But now it's all I think about. I can't stop.

I've tried investing in my hobbies but I can't stop. The thought of her breaking up with me at any moment eats at me. It's making my stomach turn during class. I can't focus on school work and I've been eating a lot less. Now here's something you might find weird; she's affectionate to everyone. She will lay her head on other guys, get piggyback rides from other guys, and hug other guys. This is just who she is and I let her do this because it didn't concern me at first.

Now each movement of physical contact between her and another male is making me gag inside. I probably sound clingy as hell right now but I don't think that's it. I don't see it that way. Each time she lays her head on, hugs, or touches another male, I get reminded that she could just lose feelings for me and she could just have feelings for another guy at any moment. Because this parallels her last relationship.

Her and her last boyfriend looked like they were getting serious. They were already kissing and shit days after dating. I haven't even kissed her yet (she says there's no pressure to but you get the point). And then she started having some feelings for me, and then broke up with him. I actually love her and would take a bullet for her and she means the absolute world to me. But I'm just wondering if she even feels the same way.

I'm wondering if she's just using me to climb up the social poll of popularity to dating. I'll just be sitting in class and I'll feel my stomach turn. I'll feel dread in my mind polluting my brain with the irrational fear that she'll break up with me. I keep asking myself ""Why does it matter? Why are you literally FEARING being broken up with? It's not that big of a deal"" but my brain won't listen to logic.

People say I've been a lot more optimistic since her and I hooked up but on the inside, I'm feeling all this excessive nervousness, I haven't been able to eat, I've been thinking about what Allan said. Allan may have put fear into my head but the way I see it, he was only warning me. And I'm kind of glad. Because if she breaks up with me when returning from her 5 day trip, I'll at least half expect it. He was only putting facts in my head and trying to help.

And here we are. I now feel anxious about everything that has to do with her. I can't stop thinking about it. And it's beyond that. I'm getting anxious over my cousin's birthday party on Saturday. I don't like their immediate family. They're fucking snobs. But my stomach is feeling dread from it even though it's not that bad. I'm feeling dread over literally anything.

My stomach is feeling weird and hurting at just thinking of her. I love her and she's beautiful and I don't know what I would do without her. She's friendly, nice, and she's the only girl to actually love me in that way (probably). However, I've actually grown a FEAR of breaking up even though I knew full well her relationships are like that.

Fuck me. I shouldn't have been so fucking stupid. I should have actually thought about what would happen. I didn't think I would give myself anxiety over this. I caused this upon myself. It's all my fault. I should've paid attention to the facts but I wanted to stop being bullied by everyone including my own fucking family about not having a girlfriend. One of the worst things is the amount of sleep I'm losing over this. I'm getting few hours of sleep. I've been falling asleep at like 1 or 2 AM and waking up at like 5 PM.

What the fuck am I supposed to do? You guys are probably gonna comment ""Welcome to love!"" and if love is like this, I should've stayed single.",07Nov2019,1

164,"I'm a Kenyan in Kenya, East Africa. My former classmate AS, also a Kenyan, is in the US. Works for Boeing. I reached out to him, and asked if he could assist facilitate a step-down transformer getting to me. He sounded eager to assist. There were a few messages and a voice call. Somewhere in the conversation were overtures of how successful (rich) he was. He also stated he was the son to the immediate former MD of our national carrier Kenya Airways, Dr TN. That is a big deal, because such high power figures, in my country, amass wealth and are more often than not, dollar billionaires.

So we bought a step down transformer ($74.24) on June 10 (my birthday) and sent it to him. He received it on June 18th. He lives in Kent, Washington.

Immediately he did, he went quiet. Messages no longer answered, call no longer picked. I even reached out to other mutual friends in the US, to try ask him what the problem was and what he planned on doing. After 3 months of this, I looked for his wife on Facebook, in the hope that she would assist. She was rude to me, and immediately blocked me.

Same day I reached out to the wife, he messaged me and told me he decided to send the transformer to anyone in the US. He wasn't willing to send it to me in Kenya anymore. I was livid, but something is better than nothing, no? So I gave him a Miami address.

We never received the item! It's been 2 months+. The Post office can't trace it. The Post Office says insurance wasn't paid on transporting the item, so if they don't find it by end of November, case closed. AS has done nothing to assist settling this matter. Messages unanswered, calls not picked.

Questions

1. Can the Post Office lose items and fail to compensate? What is to prevent them from doing this to other innocent people and getting away with it?
2. What course of action do I have against AS, for wasting my time and losing my much needed item? This, considering I'm in Kenya, and my friend in Miami is an old lady, with health complications. I'm even willing to let his employer and that of his wife, know what kind of monsters they have working for them.

165,"I (16F) saw my favorite singer, Clairo, on Monday. I had been looking forward to it since the tickets dropped in August, and i had an amazing time!! I even waited outside for her to come out after the show and i got to talk to one of her friends (another one of my favorite singers)!! So now that’s it’s all over, I just feel really empty. That sounds melodramatic, but it’s true. It was the one thing i was looking forward to for such an extended period of time, and all of a sudden it’s over and gone. I listen to her music, wear the sweatshirt i bought, see pictures from the show, and i just get so hollow and sad. I don’t know what to do with this feeling. It’s overwhelming, and I’m slightly concerned - it was a CONCERT for goodness sake. I shouldn’t be acting like this, especially so severely. Everything just seems so mediocre now. I feel like i have nothing to look forward to, to give me motivation to keep going. I feel sluggish and indifferent to everything, and i keep having this on edge feeling, like I’m waiting for something. I feel like I’m in mourning - not the most sensitive comparison, but i really do. It’s this loss that’s left a big hole. Am i overreacting? I definitely am, but that doesn’t help the feeling.

167,"When I was a kid, my parents adopted this chocolate lab puppy named Bear. Now it’s 14 years later and I’m 24 and live away, but am still extremely attached to this dog. 
My mom just told me he’s been having trouble and the vet did an X-ray and thinks he has bone cancer. They’ve given him some pain medicine and are taking him in for a follow up after thanksgiving, but the vet seemed to try to exhaust all other options before reaching that conclusion (she also showed my mom the X-rays).
I’ve lost dogs before and it’s been horrifically painful, but I’ve always had a special attachment to Bear. He’s the family dog but he’s also MY dog if that makes sense. He was there through the hardest parts of my life and I feel almost a spiritual connection to him.

you get the idea.

anyways it’s highly anticipated and it’s one of the best rallies out there.

i’m a pretty shy person and i feel like people don’t think of me as much except for being “”smart””

but there’s this kpop one representing and they’ll be playing songs and dancing. it’s a group thing and practices are about 2 hours twice a day every week for 2 months. i really like kpop and i know some people in my school who like it.

i got the sudden spark to suddenly join. but i didn’t bc fear and judgement held me back. i really wanna make high school memories and have something to look back on. it’ll get me out of my comfort zone and i feel like it’ll be super fun but i’m SCARED. 

scared for what? i don’t even know. some people will be like “ew kpop” and hate it or just not get it. i’m scared to mess up or not be in sync. it’s just scary, especially in front of the school.

We had our moments but our “moments” aren’t exactly common or rather they don’t occur often. I’m in high school and I had asked her if she would go to homecoming with me and surprisingly she had said yes. We go to homecoming and we have a conversation there and due to my complexity I had to phrase what I had said strangely. I had said that “i needed something to hold onto” and Vicky ended in interpreting it as if I meant sexual acts. The dance had ended and we said goodbye. We eventually made up and we both decided that maybe we should just be friends for a while. Now we have been texting recently and both me and Vicky have had that flirtation in our texts but I’m scared to try anything again because I fear that I may hurt her again.

One day one of my friends invited me and her to go sledding and we went. That same day she told me that it's possible that she feels the same way that I do and we held hands on several occasions. A few weeks later she very obviously starting liking a guy I was good friends with who was notorious for playing girls. After a while she got sick of him because he was doing stuff to her as she really didn't like she pretty much dropped him. At that point I figured I had another chance but I quickly realized that wasn't the case. She started liking this guy who sexually harassed her twice. Gradually I started to hate this guy like really really hate this guy. I eventually told one of my friends that I still had feelings for this girl, but she told me some information about her and the guy that I hated that made me pretty upset but I wasn't supposed to know about it. When the girl I like asked me what was wrong I obviously couldn't tell her what but she told me if it's anything about having feelings for her she told me not to worry because she liked me too. From that point on he began to talk a lot more and really started liking each other. Everything was going great, we even kissed each other on several occasions while she already had a thing going with this guy. Eventually though I noticed that she started paying attention to him more than she was to me and she began lying to me a lot. It became clear to me has she started to like the other guy way more than she liked me. She even convinced me to let him into my house. They ended up making out but my front door.

Then after that I have to clean the place due to an inspection. I don't live in a pigsty but if I'm working on something the area around it could look like a mess. My mom knew about it yet continued to berate me about a follow up. I'm currently trying to get it. The reason why I didn't go right away was because I needed to clean everything. She refused to help so more st from that. So for the past few days I've been on my feet, which I shouldn't be, cleaning this and that. I also wanted to be mentality sound.

196,"TL;DR Lent my truck to my stepdad. Became a sort of long-term thing. Truck has a lot of sentimental value to me, but stepdad is beating the shit out of it.
I want my truck back, but trying to *get* it back is a touchy subject, and I don't know how to proceed.

I'm going to start off by saying my pickup truck means a lot to me. It isn't particularly outstanding; it's a 2005 Chevy Colorado extended cab. It's fully loaded (at least for 2005); a couple model years before they started offering V8s, so the best engine for '05 was a really weird 5-cylinder engine and I love it. 

I bought the truck from my grandma, about 18 months ago. She was looking to trade it in for a brand new car; I offered to buy her truck for whatever the dealer was going to give her for it.

The truck only had 50,000 miles on the odometer when I bought it. Grandma bought the truck new; she kept up to date on oil changes, general maintenance, and she even bought a new set of tires three days before I actually got the truck. 

And it's the most money I've ever spent on a single thing, ever. I was not about to let it go to waste.

Fast forward to this past August, I get a call from my stepdad. Both his truck, and my mom's car are broken down, and he needs to borrow my truck. He said ""needs"" like he expected me to give it to him, not like he was asking permission.

Stepdad is currently the only person in his house who drives. My mother can't drive due to medical reasons, and my little brother doesn't have his license. 

Stepdad does shitloads of driving; living out in rural Texas, driving my mom to work and my little brother to school nearly every day would already be plenty of miles to drive if he wasn't also delivering pizzas for Domino's for 50+ hours per week.

Reluctantly, I let him use my truck. I have a second car I've been driving in the meantime. Stepdad's truck, a '98 Silverado 3500, has been on its last legs for many years at this point. The power steering went out that morning, and I guess that was stepdad's tipping point.

Mom's car, a Chevy Tracker purchased in April, has been in and out of the shop like crazy. Their mechanic just kept finding one problem after another, or so my mother tells me.

Anyway, it's been three months since I handed my stepdad the keys. It seemed like every time I spoke with him, something new was breaking on my truck. First, the airbag light. Then the AC stopped blowing. Then the check engine light came on. And so on. Stepdad would always make it seem like it's somehow my fault, as well. Since it's my truck.

In the past, stepdad has made it perfectly clear that he doesn't care about my truck anywhere near as much as he cares about his. He's borrowed my truck to haul scrap metal, because it gets better gas mileage than his. 

I once got it back with the driver's door handle filled with cigarette ash, which he claims was from one of his co-workers. 

I personally witnessed him yank on my cat's tail when she was standing on my truck's hood; cat instinctively dug in her claws, and stepdad's continued pulling left several long scratches in the hood.

The tipping point for me came last week, though. I had an incident at work, and my stepdad picked me up (in my truck) and took me to urgent care. While he was driving me there, he was complaining that my truck ran very rough at idle, to the point that he had to hold the truck at half throttle, with his left foot on the brakes at stoplights, to keep it from stalling.

I noticed the lube shop sticker on the windshield hadn't been updated. The truck was due for an oil change when I handed over the keys; I also gave my stepdad a hundred dollars, specifically to pay for a change at my preferred shop, with enough left over for a tank of gas.

I also saw the odometer, and it read well over 96,000 miles; it was under 70k when I lent it to him. If I wasn't too sick at the time, I would've burst into tears right there in the truck. Just thinking about it now makes me despondent.

***

Now, I need advice as to where to go from here.

Obviously, I want my truck back. But if I take it back now, that leaves my whole family stranded with no transportation. 

Yeah, it might give my stepdad the kick in the pants he needs to finally fix his truck, or sell it for something like a Camry or whatever. But then I'm pretty much disowned. My mother has heard my grievances before on this matter, but she does nothing more than acknowledge the situation's existence.

And once I *do* get my truck back, if ever, what then? 

I'm going to be stuck with all the truck's new issues, and all the repair bills that are associated. I mean, I make fairly decent money, more than my stepdad makes, anyway, but anything more than a couple hundred dollars is something I have to wait a couple of paychecks to comfortably pay for.

200,"Some weird girl keeps girl keeps following me and speaking with me, I didn’t initiate conversation with her at all, and also she didn’t know me through anything and randomly started speaking with me. This is all very confusing and I really couldn’t find her motive.

She asked for my instagram a day ago, and when I responded saying I didn’t have one, she said to create one and she will add me. So I think I know why she did all these weird things. She must be addressing people in order to gain followers on instagram. She seemed like a materialistic type, attactive and forward, in addition to social. Perfect as a instagram star, so It’s my understanding she is aspiring to be one.

Is this a typical scheme in order to gain instagram followers?

I lied and told her the app didn’t work, then she asked for my number. So I lied and said I didn’t have one. She laughed and said she knew I did, becuase she saw me using it. So I had to give my number to her.

She’s trying to grab as much intel on me as possible, I can already tell she’s been analyzing me.

Now she keeps sending me weird texts like “good morning” and “heyyy”. I try my best to ignore them, but I forgot to turn off read receipts so she noticed I was ignoring them a few times, so I had to respond to her interrogation. Why is she trying to improve our chemistry? What is her underground motive. What is she using me for. I’ve thought about it for hours I can’t think of a reason for all of this. 

She asked me where I live, and I have her fake addresses, but for this reason I assume she is trying to docs me. I don’t have much time before she figures out I’m lying. I don’t know what to do. Please help.",07Nov2019,1
201,"My first office job didn’t go very well. My boss told me I was doing a great job and then told me she wasn’t going to renew my contract a couple days after saying that. She would yell and rant at me and didn’t give me any training, and she told me my memory was worse than her eighty year old grandmother’s several times a week(maybe she thought I forgot she told me?). She even hit me on the head with her notepad once. Not hard, but it was very condescending and it was supposed to be in a joking manner but it totally sucked, because at that point I barely knew her. I only lasted a few weeks and now I find office jobs very intimidating and I don’t know what to do.
I know I probably won’t have an experience like that again, but my last office job totally depleted my confidence in being able to work in that environment. It’s also very formal and I’ve never felt like I fit in with the general office crowd, but at the same time I need to make a decent salary. I graduated college a few months ago and have a bachelor’s degree, and I have a good job opportunity right now that would pay me very well based on my experience. Also, it’s a temp to hire position, and I’m scared that they won’t renew my contact because I won’t do well there and I’ll be without a job.

Finally, I’ve only been at Starbucks for a couple of weeks, and I just finished training. People there are really impressed with my work ethic and are happy I’m there because they’ve been low staffed for a long time. I like the people I work with and feel awful for planning to leave behind their backs, but I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I’m also only guaranteed 24 hours a week and at minimum wage that isn’t much. I was thinking that I could take the office job and work at Starbucks on the weekends if they’ll let me, that way they won’t be totally screwed and Ill be able to make good money.

Which desk job, which you could literally describe as boring hard work, gives you the most money? There is a reason why I have this issue, it's because I'm not good at anything. In other words, I have good grades in every subject except sports. Before you ask, that means that I have zero confidence in any subject but I work my ass off for every subject to get grades which happen to be above my peers. I can't even use my peers as a comparison because what's the point in my work, if my grade is just so high because the average of my peers was bad? That has nothing to do with me being good...

I’m in college and have a roommate where the same age but come from different backgrounds I’m first generation college and a minority she isn’t she comes from an upper middle class white family. Things were good at first then she started to do things I didn’t like I realized she lied about some stuff like her way of living. I constantly have to pick up after her and clean her area and remind her to take out the trash and recycle etc. This annoys me I come from an Uber clean and neat household. Furthermore I feel like a maid. She is a slob she claims she forgets to take out the trash even if I tell her 3xs. It seems like she tries to be my friend since she’s invited to dinner, events, and recently we went on a pumpkin carving double date. I found out that that same day a little before the date she called me a hypocrite because I said I didn’t think white people thought of dropping out like I did. She said she didn’t understand why I was obsessed with equality yet gave white people a hard time. There have been other similar instances in which she called me bitchy and said she didn’t like me. I know all of this because she gave me her phone password and I saw the messages. I don’t understand why she tried to hang out with me but then goes and talks about me behind my back. I’d rather she’d just stop. I’m not sure what to do out it sometimes I want to confront her so that she can move out or something but then I’d have to admit to reading her messages. Should I just keep holding it in for the rest of year or should I mention it? Even if I left the snooping part out I think she’d still figure it out hence why I don’t even wanna say anything but today after seeing that she called me a hypocrite it was so hard not to want to confront her. Please help. 

TLDR: My roommate is a slob and is fake tries to be my friend but talks behind my back. I know because I read her messages and she said I was bitchy/ignorant/hypocrite. Can’t move out because it’s expensive. Do I confront her or keep holding it in? It keeps getting harder. Please help.",07Nov2019,1
207,"For the last 4 or 5 years, my mom has bought me and my bf extremely expensive tickets to shows for our birthdays. She has taken us to see Cirque Du Soleil 3 times and while it is a wonderful show, I dont want to see any more.

She always buys 6 tickets. For me, my bf, my brother and his wife, and my mom and her friend. (And she still says it's my birthday gift??)
She spends so much damn money on these tickets, they're usually 80-100$ EACH and then she complains to me that she doesnt have money for food at home anymore (eye roll)

Last year she took us all out (for MY birthday) to Cheech &amp; Chong. I was born in '97, was only a toddler when they were most famous, and I have never even smoked a marijuana. (Well, only once, after it was legalized) ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS WEED IN THAT DAMN SHOW. And rape jokes. Cant forget about the rape jokes. My brother and his wife are big pot heads and are long time cheech and Chong fans so they loved the show but my bf and I only laughed a few times. I dont know why on earth my mother thought we liked them.

And ugh. What a waste of 160$. I'd rather get the gift of an evening alone than awkwardly laughing and pretending I'm having a good time.

The thing about my mom is that she HATES being wrong. Ive told her not to buy me anything for my birthday but it gets brushed off like I'm just being modest. If I tell her I dont like those shows she'll flip. I dont know how to go about letting her down lightly. Shes taking me, my bf and the whole gang out to some comedian I've never heard of later this month and I just. Dont wanna go. Shes already bought the tickets. Help

210,"Throwaway account because of very sensitive info. 

My girlfriend and I started dating and having sex when I was 17 and she was 16. Four months into the relationship I turned 18, and two months after i turned 18 she turned 17. I was pretty desperate for a relationship and I ignored a lot of red flags in her. It’s come to the point where she is being emotionally manipulative. She doesn’t have any friends, She goes to a alternative school, and she’s is not the kind of person I want to marry. 

Either way, it’s come to the point where I will be breaking up with her. She is *very* invested in me. I suspect that it will be a very bad breakup. I don’t think it will come to anything more than just pain for her, but I want to be prepared. 

I’m in Oregon, and I wonder if she will be able to do anything against me from a legal standpoint? Is there anything I can do to potentially protect myself? 

Any advice is really appreciated.",07Nov2019,4
211,"Sorry this is so long.

This is really starting to affect my life and I don't know what to do. My only comfort as a student is the idea of getting to go home, see my pets and family, and relax for a few weeks, but I'm so uncomfortable with the idea of meeting my younger sibling's new partner that I'm considering staying at school instead. None of my friends would be here, it'd be shitty, cold and horribly lonely, but even weeks of that is better than what these situations do to me. To clarify: I'm really happy my family members are getting into relationships and living normal lives, but as soon as it happens I feel an extreme urge to remove myself from their lives' completely. I feel horribly out of place when I'm still there. It's happened with my dad the worst, with some friends (much more mildly), and now even my sibling.


I've had really bad body image and self esteem issues since I was like 7, and I've never been in any kind of relationship, even though I've bettered myself significantly and tried. When I meet somebody/see them, I feel the lowest that I ever do. It's like they've entered another world, and I feel wrong being near it. There's a pervasive sense of unworthiness and shame afterwards. It drives me nuts that I can't even be genuinely supportive of the people I care about most. It's pathetic and I don't have a solid answer why. This guilt is crushing me as much as the actual issue at hand does. It also presents in other strange ways -- I've known for a very long time that if I did ever get to date somebody, I would never, ever introduce them to my family, under any circumstances. I don't know why but it's just unthinkable.


I'm hoping maybe I can just change the way I think about these meetings so I can get through them without having to turn to awful coping mechanisms. If I can't fix this, I have to figure out how to give up on being in their lives as much as I am now. I wouldn't ever be able to go to weddings or visit for Thanksgiving, and I would always feel like an outsider anyway. I can't find anything like this by searching for it, but hopefully somebody's dealt with something similar...",07Nov2019,1

I decided to go SLIGHTLY away for college. My campus is about an hour and a half from where I live but I decided to live on campus. I am now in my fourth year. I wanted to move off campus because it is cheaper but my parents said no because it isn’t as safe. The way I pay for school is all through loans because I don’t qualify for ANY financial aid. Like any. The catch about it is that the private loans I have are in my name specifically. They are co-signed by my stepdad but he plans on putting it all in my name once I am done with school. I am also a first generation student. I wanted to be a nurse but due to how competitive it is here in California, I did not get into the program I wanted. Shit happens but I decided to major in Human Biology and then go to nursing school or some kind of program. (Which means I’ll end up with two bachelors degree) My parents were not thrilled and my mother actually didn’t talk to me for a while because she was so mad at me for “wasting her money” on school. (They do pay for other things like my car and phone and stuff WHICH IM GRATEFUL FOR) but feeling like such a disappointment was super hard. A couple months after all of this, I dealt with a lot of personal issues that my parents didn’t know about since I don’t live at home 24/7 and honestly I don’t want to tell them but I’ve had to retake 2 classes and that put me back by ONE semester.

“Don’t take this the wrong way but I have a crush on him so please don’t say anything and don’t hit on him.” 

I tried to sneakily past the girl the note but once she opened it, my crush glanced over it quickly. Idk if they saw it but I let them resume their conversation while I turned away and started looking as if I was reading my notes.

However, since it's a majority of what I find, I watched a bunch videos from MFX (the company that makes them) prior to this, and I came a bunch prior to this.

&amp;#x200B;

The same girls as all their videos, in the same recycled rooms... In this video, this girl (who seems to be enjoying-ish in future videos) was held down by other girls and forced to drink a mixture of feces, urine, and vomit despite obvious sobs and squirms. Real sobs.

I’ve known her since last year September but we didn’t really talk much, we were in the same class but I wasn’t interested till I transferred homes to the current one I’m in due to some issues with the family. 

I didn’t fall in love hard, but I fell in love softly and it took some time, but I fell in love. I didn’t start feeling attraction towards her till I visited her in her home country over the summer. I met her family, her childhood friends, it was honestly really weird being there but whatever, I started to feel like I knew her better. You see, I know she’s queer (I thought I was straight until I started feeling attracted haha) she dated my friend who was a girl. Anyway, we’re super close and stuff and I needed to get over her so I obviously spoke with my friends back in Korea and got super drunk and decided to make out with a taken mutual friend that was dating one of our close friend. 

It got super stressful but I came out to her, told her I loved her, we eventually solved the drunken night in Korea together and she was with me every step of the way. We fought a lot during this but after these fights we came out even stronger. 

But then we started to kiss, hold hands, hugs, say “I love you”s and have sex. Whenever I have issues I always talk to her about it and she always listens, however she doesn’t like me back.

I don’t know when or where I’d wear it, and it’s not super cheap with shipping. Think I should still buy it?",07Nov2019,0

228,"My wife and I decided to move to a different part of the country after getting laid off. Having only $3500 in our savings combined with my spouse, we thought it was better for us to try our life in a bigger city, save up more money and maybe move to a different country as my country becomes less and less safe to raise a family and economically unstable. There were no job opportunities for me as an architect in our small town. We have a 6 months old and my wife is out of job for maternity care. 

About 2 weeks ago as we were flying to a new city we had a layover in a nearby city. It was a really big airport and I decided to head to the airport's computer lounge. If I am not mistaken that airport had more than one computer lounge and in the lounge I went to there were about 20 computer stations. So I sit in one of the stations and that computer was still logged in from the previous user. The previous user had forgotten to close all tabs and log out of his e-mail. The computers log out automatically after some time of inactivity but for some reason that was session was still opened. Since the lounge was full and I had to print some documents I looked around seen no one waited for about 2 mins and no one showed up. As I started closing the tabs I start seeing all of his bank information like account numbers, wire transfers of very large sums of money. E-mails from and to his relatives with very sensitive stuff. It is then that I realized that this information belonged to a politician from my hometown who embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars and was fleeing the country.

I immediately look around to see if anyone was looking at me and everybody was just going about their business, most passengers were on facebook or printing boarding passes etc. Looked around once again to see if there were cameras and there was not a single one. I immediately print all of this info (bank accounts, wire transfer info, assets purchased, personal documentation, etc) and end the session. I went to the clerk who sits in the other side of the lounge without visual access to the computer station I was nor the printers. I paid for all the printing in cash and casually left. My wife was not with me at the time, she had been in the restroom changing our baby.

After we got to the new city and settling in our temporary place I start evaluating all of this stuff I had printed and there was not only all of the info I already mentioned but also transactions to his accounts in tax havens, assets he had put under relative's names, etc. I then look up this crooked man and found out he is a wanted man. BUT, what shocked me the most is that this is one of the men responsible for drying up the accounts of the firm I worked for (public firm) resulting in hundreds of lay offs of hard working people. 

I thought about giving up all this info to the authorities but after carefully analyzing with my wife, we both agreed that even if the authorities caught up to him and seized his assets and ~~his money~~ public money, it would make no difference and it would actually just end up in the pockets of other similar crooked people due to the heavy common-placed corruption in my town. So the next logical thing to do is to ""ask"" him for a really large sum of money. If we can persuade him to give us the money we could start our life and raise our family in a new country. I want to do it anonymously of course. 

I am seeking advice on how to accomplish that. What should I do to increase the chances of him giving the money?

At this point all I care about is to leave the country and start a new life with my family.

**TL;DR:** Got ahold of sensitive information about the man who is responsible for hundreds of lay offs (including mine) in the firm I worked for. The man is trying to flee the country or already fled by this time with hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars that he embezzled from a public construction company. There's no chance of him knowing who I am. How can I get him to give me a small share of the funds?

229,"I'm 19 and ever since I was 12, I've felt very strongly that I'm lesbian. I first told my parents at 12 as well. When I told them, they got very angry. My parents are Christian. They pulled me out of school, didn't let me see any of my friends, and took everything out of my room except for my clothes and Bible. I eventually gave in believing that maybe I was wrong and I was just fighting temptation. But it didn't go away. Two years later, I again told my parents. They took me out of school again and I wasn't allowed to see anyone my age. At this point I realized my parents were wrong but there was nothing I could do. So I thought of them that I wasn't lesbian just to appease them. Through the next two years I tried exploring myself in whatever ways I could. Sadly, I wasn't allowed to have a phone, or really hangout with friends. So my exploration was limited to reading lesbian stories or watching similar content on YouTube when o was at school. Again at 16, I told my parents. This time they didn't take me out of school but it wasn't any better. During this time I reached out to my aunt. My aunt is also lesbian. So I reached out to her via email when I was at school. My aunt gave me a lot of advice and whatever support however there wasn't much she could do. She ended up telling my grandparents about me which isn't what I wanted. So I felt I couldn't trust her anymore. During my junior year I got back in touch with an old friend. He and I used to be very close. At this time, I was very lonely and confused due to my parents. I decided to date this friend. Our relationship lasted three months and I couldn't get rid of the feeling that I was into girls. After dating my friend, nothing really happened. I would go to school saying I was lesbian, and go home lying toy parents. When I turned 18, my friends encouraged me to tell my parents now that I was an adult. What could they do now that I'm 18? So I did. My parents threatened to  kick me out. They told me that I'd ruin my realtionship with all of my grandparents. I'd also ruin my relationship with my parents and two brothers. They gave me an ultimatum: them or being a lesbian. I gave up. I don't want to lose my parents. And at the time (even now), I don't have enough money to support myself. So I got back with my friend. Which didn't go well, and then not long after with another guy. Again, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I liked girls. Now, to make it abundantly clear I do not need advice on what to do about my family. I'm just giving back story so you understand where I'm coming from. I plan on telling my parents a final time. Telling the rest of my family as well. As soon as I can support myself and am prepared mentally for the outcomes. However, I'm not in a place for that now. 

Now I'll get to what I need advice on 😅. Two weeks ago one of my friends from high school came out to me as bi. She felt she could talk to me about it since I'm lesbian. I have been there for her and am very happy that she came to me. When we were talking she said she wanted to explore it but didn't know how. It came off like she was hinting that she wanted to explore it with me. I didn't know what to say. Keep in mind, I have never actually don't anything with a girl myself. I told her that I watched lesbian movies when I was exploring it since I didn't really know how to respond. She now texts me pretty often. More than before. My first question is does it sound like she's interested in me? I have never thought of her that way but I wouldn't be opposed to the idea. My next question is should I ask her or how should I go about it? And finally how should I go about exploring my sexuality in general? 

For now all exploration I do will be kept secret from my parents until I'm ready to tell them as mentioned above. I would greatly appreciate any and all advice.",07Nov2019,8
230,"This is gonna be my first post ever on Reddit. I don't know if it's silly, but I just need to talk to people outside of my situation right now and get some input. 

For the past few months, I (F21) currently reside in an apartment with my two best friends Sam and Alicia (M20)(F20), my best friend's brother(M24) Todd, and recently, my best friend's step brother(M19) Michael. I have been in a relationship with my best friend's brother Todd for 9 months now. Aside from Todd, we all work part time jobs. I am the only one so far that has gotten a second job, which (thank god!) starts next week. I usually help cover for food whenever I can, but I am also paying off a credit card debt that I acquired during my brief period of unemployment. Sam, Alicia and Todd split the rent three ways and are also currently on the lease. 

We all agreed to try to maintain some form of civility in the house after my roommates experienced a ton of shitty guests in the past two years. This meant no more gossip, being more open and honest about how we feel toward each other, etc. 

However, recently, I tried to have everyone sit down and talk about some issues that popped up between me and my roommates. I started off the conversation, but then Alicia completely took over and got into a heated argument with Todd. 

Todd opened up about how he finds Alicia and Sam unreliable. It's important to note that, at this point, Alicia hadn't paid rent in a few months because she was taking on responsibilities that were objectively impractical for the amount of money she makes each week. He's had issues about feeling lonely because his circle of friends aren't really quite as active anymore, how his job stresses him out and that he might not be getting as much money in as he could be. He's also pissed at the fact that Sam and Alicia don't clean up after themselves, and are inconsiderate about how much food and drink they use. 

Alicia, who does have anger issues and to her credit tries to work on them, instantly jumped on him and stated that she didn't like the fact that he asked her to change her job, how he acts like a father and shouldn't, and how he's someone who takes his anger out on other people. However, she resorted to calling Todd a stupid mofo, and flipped over a tray on the dinner table and completely destroyed everything on top. She stormed out of the house, and Sam followed suit. Todd and I stayed behind to clean up and dissect what happened. 

I suffered a severe anxiety attack thirty minutes after the argument happened and stayed up until 2 AM with my boyfriend, who took care of me. 

I thought that things could start dying down, until yesterday, when Alicia stormed out of the house after Todd simply told them that there was food in the fridge for them. 

To make matters worse, when I came home after work tonight, Alicia and Sam brought Todd's friend up, along with her pseudo boyfriend, into the kitchen. Alicia explicitly stated that she hated her and thought she was a horrible person, and now brought them up to smoke and drink together. Only because Alicia knew that Todd was angry at her, and only had company over just to spite him. 

I don't want to live this way anymore. It's such a toxic environment to be around. Just as I'm typing this, my boyfriend walked into the room, sat down on the bed cries. 

He's tired, and I'm tired. I love my friends, but even if I wasn't in the picture, they're still toxic for each other. And I don't think this is healthy anymore. 

I want to move out with my boyfriend and my boyfriend's step brother. Within the next year hopefully, and save up money to separate ourselves. However, I'm afraid that it will make things worse, and my friends will think I'm betraying them by moving in with my boyfriend instead of rooming with Sam and Alicia. 

What do I do? Should we just stick it out and try to fix things? Or is it too late?",07Nov2019,1
231,"I’ve been struggling with this a lot lately. I’m in college and I have some friends, but I feel like I’m constantly being reminded that everyone in my life has people more important to them than me. I’m friends with people from different friend groups, but I don’t feel like I’m part of any of those groups. I sort of feel like an afterthought a lot of the time. I usually channel frustrations into doing schoolwork or working out, but I’ve been losing motivation to even do those things lately. I’m in my third year and I sort of feel like I’ve missed my chance at making friends—most people seem content with the friends they have, which makes me feel sort of hopeless.

233,"Long story short I’ve been talking to A Girl for about 6 months now. She’s been awesome and we’ve had loads of fun together. She’s about 5ish yrs older than me and she has a kid who’s 4. He’s a super sweet and funny kid and I have a blast hanging out with them! 

I’m 21 and not sure if I’m ready for all of that... I’m trying so hard (mentally) to make it not about her child and just about my connection to her. I feel she deserves that. But do I go through the financial and mental struggles that come with her and her child??

This other girl I’ve met a couple times and we haven’t had clear and concrete communication. We’ve hung out at clubs and we’ve matched on tinder multiple times but I’ve never done anything. Tonight she posted a video of her singing a song she that she heard me singing when she walked past me on the sidewalk one night.. she doesn’t have a child... We’re both the same age. 

I’m in a point in my life where I don’t want to lose anyone or lose connection with anyone else.. getting older and growing out of high school has been tough. Everyone’s gone, I don’t see all the friends I thought I had anymore. I miss them all so much...

234,"Should I say “wanna go on a date with me?” And take her out to a restaurant. 

Or should I just say “wanna go on a date? Come over eat ice cream (Ben and Jerry’s) is her favourite and watch a horror movie? 

The reason I ask is because she’s probably like the Ben and Jerry’s thing a lot more because it’s a lot more thoughtful but it’s more like second date material.

Going to a nice restaurant would be first date material and make her put more work into it but may also be awkward as we’ve been best friends for so long we may treat it as just best friends going on a date. And it may not work or

237,"Okay, this is gonna be long. 

I (F17) graduated four months ago with pretty good results, which was quite unexpected. I've been thinking a lot about what to do after school. I always wanted to spend a year in another country to volunteer, but as I'm still seventeen it's quite difficult to find an organisation so I quit searching. 

I also thought about studying as that was the actual plan for me in my (and my family's) mind. The problem was that I just couldn't decide what to study and what's the right thing for me. 

So now I started an apprenticeship and I'm working eight hours a day plus driving home and to work half an hour each. 
It's bothering me actually. I never wanted to work in an office and that's what I basically do all day now. 
The thing is, I gain money and even if I quit the whole thing I guess I wouldn't know what to do then.  Like I got a direction, but no certain job or plan. 

What would you do in my place? Stay in the place I am now and finish the 2 1/2 years or quit and go to university?

238,"I made an entrance exam to get a vacancy on this thing my country has called SENAI, which is, in a nutshell, a social program (or something?) which provides technical and industrial learning courses to those who are either hired by a company or who study in this school called SESI and get a decent score in their entrace exam. I passed on the course I wanted, which is electro-electronics, or electronics according to google translate. It starts next year, which isn't really far away. Two years course. On one hand this is really great, because I'll get a base for the college I want to go (mechatronic engineering or something similar) and maybe even a job after finishing highschool, since the classes are practical and not just theoric, meaning you already leave somewhat qualified. On the other hand, this means that I'll have to attend school and right after a 4-hour-per-day course, amounting to 9-10 hours studying per day, and this is not including time doing homework and school projects, which would already be more than a 40 hours work week: a 45-60 study week. If I include sleep, I only have 4-6 free hours a day - as a 16 year old.

For those who have attended courses or had similar experiences, how do you handle working for so much time? My school hardly actually sends homework, but the stress from the huge biology projects and my stupid, annoying, arrogant, imbecile history teacher (fuck you Valmir) along with the extremely loud and ~~sometimes~~ usually immature students more than makes up for it, and I've been okay-ish with the stress because the lack of work allowed me to relax and calm down after school. However, next year will be different, with me waking up at 7am and going home at 17pm, probably with just about the same quantity of school projects, but on a more difficult level. How do I handle so much pressure?

Also, I wanted to know about college. I don't care about how many people here are anti-college, because I WANT to attend it. What I want to know is, how tiresome is it to work ( like half period) while on college? I know it definitely is tiresome and stressful, but considering I'll be attending a technical course for two year along with school, I'll probably at the very least get used to long work schedules and being busy. At least I'm already quite used to being stressed. With a technical course I can make like $700/month at the start and probably around $1000 a couple of years in, which isn't really a lot in the USA, but it is quite something here in Brazil where the minimun wage is \~$240 and there is so little qualified workers. So, what I'm trying to say is, is it viable, or worth it, to work while attending college, for what would be approximately three minimun wages?",07Nov2019,1

I haven’t been myself this past year. I’m a music producer. I’ve been producing for almost 7 years and it’s been great but.. when we started dating, I didn’t produce as much music as I should’ve been and my sales started to drop and also, producing was my only means of income. I got a job and I’ve been steadily working for about a year now and she’s told me she doesn’t see the spark I used to have music anymore.. and to be frank, she’s right. When we first met she was really interested in my dreams in life and how determined I was to reach them and now.. idk if I can reach them the way I am. I’ve made some music here and there but nothing ever satisfied me and I thought maybe it’s just a block I’m having, I’ll get inspiration somewhere but NO. I haven’t done anything with music lately and if I did I deleted it because I was unsatisfied with it. Back before her, I was determined to reach my dreams but now.. almost 3 years have gone by and I’ve taken a TON of steps backwards and I don’t have the drive like I used to have. She thinks it’s her and I’ve had thoughts too but I don’t want to lose her but. I’m not as happy anymore.

The job that I have sucks and I’m barely making it by these days with everything ridiculously expensive. I don’t want to lose her.. I need to fix myself but idk how. I’ve lost all my friends. I rarely speak to my family. All the morales that made me as a person has been down the drain. I can’t even tell her how I’m feeling because I’m sacred that if I do.. she’ll leave me and I don’t want her to. Sounds selfish of me I know. It really does sound like I’m losing myself just to be with someone..

250,"So I’m the youngest of 5 siblings and the first 3...they’re interesting to say the least but my second older brother and I are considered “the golden children.” I hate that phrasing but it’s because how I watched my sisters get treated and it scared me. My second older sister was probably the worst of it, since middle school it was a constant battle between my parents and her. She was a bigger child and she tend not to have any extracurricular activities cause she really didn’t have interest and she was not athletic. My mom always made comments about her cause she would wear clothes and they tend to be tighter and my sister was already extremely anxious cause of my oldest sister. My mom would make her change or wear baggy clothes and then when it was high school it just was worst, my older sister did not help with any of this. My middle sister ended up just being rebel, hanging out with criminals or people in the court room (my dad was an elected official), smoked weed, and just was in places my parents disapproved, the typical teenage stuff. My older sister would start rumors about her and I remember my mom getting in physical fights with my sister about wearing thongs or leggings, sweat pants that would make her butt jiggle. 
Fast forward now and my sister is wonderful but I can tell her social life and just her growth is completely stunted, she is pretty high majority of the time and her boyfriend is an absolute shit head. We were on the phone and she confessed she had really bad anxiety and she told me she microdosed some shrooms and cried because the one thing she never heard from my parents were “they’re proud of her”, and she just wanted to feel like parents. 

One day I was on the phone with my mom and we talk about just everything but I never disclose anything drug related with my mom about my sister cause that’s not her concern but my mom and I were talking about her anxiety and she blames my oldest sister when she was a child. My older sister and my middle sister are super close but my older sister at like the age of five use to emotionally abuse my sister to the point where I was moved into that room cause I was more reactive and would physically fight. But I want to talk to her about how she needs to understand her part in my sister’s anxiety and why my sister has resentment against her. My mom is great and I love her but she thinks of herself as this spiritual being and how she’s peace and cleansing but would get angry at me if she felt like I was talking down to her. I try to talk to her once about it and all she did was cry and say how broken she was due to my dad and family and what not and it makes me angry because I’m big on accountability and there is none with her.

I'm not on here to seek attention, and I don't want this to blow up, I've been in a facility for similar issues back in 2017, and I am absolutely terrified of going back, I'm merely looking for help, and ways to deal with this.

At first it seemed to me that she was alright (from what I heard from my friends who still talk to her). But today I found out that she's out of control. She doesn't care about college or her courses anymore. The only thing she does now is go to parties and have sex with absolutely anyone.

So basically she has told me she likes me and has been completely upfront about it. I told her i liked her but I can’t date because my family, parents, family friends would basically disown me if I was with someone of a different religion. She told me about previous relationships where someone just used her. She even told me that one time she bought a guy alcohol then had sex with him right then and there and they never talked again

Today, we studied together for hours and we had a pretty good time. All the while she would reach out and grab my arm there was a good bit of non sexual contact going on and lots of long eye contact

This is the first time a girl has shown interest in me and idk wtf I’m doing... I’m 18. I’ve never kissed a girl. There were some clear flirting going on that later tonight she even said it was only “harmless flirting”

We walk back to our cars and she asks if I want to sit in her car with her for a little and we did. After a short silence and eye contact, I asked “wanna make out?”

Again, in retrospect, I realize how awkward of a thing that is to do... she gets offended tells me she is hurt and she calls it a night.

She is saying that her feeling are hurt because I asked her that after I told her multiple times I won’t be able to date. At the same time, why would she admit to flirting with no intentions in mind? This is honestly the first time I was alone with a girl and I’m genuinely confused what just happened. I feel socially retarded right now. any advice would be greatly appreciated...

264," 

This post may seem outlandish, but my situation is extremely serious and saddening and I am not trolling, provoking reactions or doing anything of the sort.

My brother is 32 (I am 18 and living under his lease for the next 2 weeks) and has been a NIGHTMARE the last month. He is diagnosed bipolar, has neurosis and C-PTSD as well. When my brother isn't having an episode, he is one of the coolest people I've ever known and we have eachothers backs. However, when he goes through manic episodes he's genuinely one of the worst people I've ever known in my entire life. His manic episode started a few days ago when he and his husband got into an argument that started out very little, but resulted in my brother physically assaulting his husband and [SMASHING his door](https://i.imgur.com/0Dqwyxc.png) into bits in a matter of seconds. His behavior progressed, he started smoking weed and drinking alcohol more while talking about how he doesn't care about anything he does, and that he should be a gangster because he's fit for it and doesn't care about life anymore.

Then phase 2 came in, the business ideas, oh god do I hate manic business ideas. Short backstory: I'm a relatively known rapper online and in my city and my brother when he goes through manic phases gets extremely jealous of my success and it is both heartbreaking and scary. He's decided that he's going to be a ghostwriter and a beat maker and not only just shelled out 500+ dollars for a beat machine he does not know how to use at all, but has been locking himself in his bathroom for days at a time getting high while writing hundreds of ""song titles"" on a piece of paper that ALL have to do with vaginas. I am not joking, when I asked why this was he responded with and I am NOT JOKING or exaggerating ""I have a boy p\*ssy that feels the same and it gets f\*cked all the time in the same way so I can relate to these women and sell to many"". His husband is a really stupid man who my brother is pretty much just using for money at this point, he doesn't care about his husbands well being he just wants sex and no conflict and the image of a perfect life. Other things my brother does during these episodes include:

1. Setting extremely arbitrary rules on me and his husband even though we are all adults
2. Physically and emotionally abuses me and uses my drug addiction/dependence on him for money against me to abuse me and keep me from fleeing.
3. Cheats on his husband relentlessly
4. Threatens to beat me or kick me out if I don't agree that his business plans are going to make him millions of dollars, though he likes to attempt to kick me down.
5. Discusses how depressed he is 24/7
6. Starts extremely arbitrary arguments for the sake of starting them

The list goes on and on, my brother is very very ill and he only has yes men that don't even slightly annoy or anger him around him constantly that don't give a shit about his mental well being at all. So I have to ask you, what do I do here? He is insane and unreasonable and I am close to calling a clinic on him. I am worried he is going to commit suicide or do something extremely stupid that he regrets doing. I have to live with him for the next 2 weeks meaning I will be front and center during his manic peak and come down which sounds very scary. This is a man who used to break into houses for fun, he'd get raped and beaten every single day by his past boyfriends, he tried joining the mafia, he genuinely has committed felonies in the past he has not been punished for because it's been over a decade. This is a sick shell of a man and I do not know what to do.",07Nov2019,1
265,"Hello;

Came here looking for an anonymous point of view.

At this moment  i feel sad and stormed in all my thoughts. I don't know what is happening , it just occurs.
During the day i am the happiest person ever then the night comes and i lose myself in sadness.
Every time it happens , i start analyzing the origin of all these feelings and i have to say are these:(at least)

I feel that i am not working enough to accomplish my big goals , like going to Japan and be an incredible student , its hard for me try to change my wrong and bad habits that just  keep me more and more far from reaching my Goal.
That comes with a feeling of jealously to people that is capable of paying international studies of any kind (because i feel that i have all the potential to also be there and give better results).


I think that, i am not enough to deserve accomplish my goals.
I want more friends, people that is in my mind i just can't reach them, is impossible to me.

As i mentioned;
For me is super hard to make new friends as well meet new people, every time I try to approach anyone i just don't know what to say i have no words coming out.
It makes me feel stressed , always i try to do my best but i just don't know what to do or talk.
I want to make a new friend , because i like to look at people and see all the ""energy"" they show, as well the body language every person transmit.
But as i mentioned i just can't approach enough .
Last night when i felt sad again wrote this about the boy i would like to become friends.
I have to say that we were in a short course and i never talked to him(that makes it more difficult) .

"" Let's imagine

(name of the guy), I don't know what the hell.
It intrigates me , with interesting personality , I don't know what it is , posture , gestures. I have the feeling that is an important piece of the puzzle for the future.
I don't know him, I know nothing, i just imagined based on my perceptions, i feel like its important to something i can't describe, it's not love, relationship looking for either,is something very different, i have the feeling it will be for good for both . 
But there is a problem, i don't Know how to speak""(all this written when I thought of making a new friend).

These are the things that at this moment are hitting me , i know that with this short and no deep context is not that helpful.
I would like to read i someone had felt like this in the past and solved it.
And finally sooner or later I'll go with a professional to help me meanwhile i want to feel good.

Thank you all .",07Nov2019,1

269,"Hi all, I'm kind of at a loss on what to do, even though it's not really my place to even care anymore. 

My mom's ex-husband (we'll call him S, he is also my father, my mom will be J) was emotionally, mentally and verbally abusive to my mom while I was growing up. I didn't quite know the extent of it until about a year or so ago when it came forward that S was cheating on J, and the subsequent divorce last December. 

My mom sees a therapist to help with what she's gone through and the problem with the therapist is that she enables and encourages my mom to talk to S. One of my neighbors has told me that they know my mom's therapist; the therapist stalked her ex in the past. I'm no expert, but I know this is exactly the type of person that should not be providing help to someone like J, who most definitely has mental illnesses. J also wants to feel wanted, and S provides that but in turn makes my mom a depressive shell of herself. The times my mom has not talked to S, she was brimming with confidence and happiness. She has recently gone back to talking to her ex and she has since declined mentally again and is reclusive whenever she's not working. 

J doesn't seem to care how it effects the people around her. I'm the middle child of two other siblings and I still live with J, so I see this first hand daily. I've talked to her multiple times in length that she needs to stop doing what she's doing, and every time I feel like she's gotten away from the issue, she goes back to it. 

At this point I'm unsure of what to even do anymore. Do I try to guide her in the right direction, despite it having failed before, or do I just leave it be and focus only on myself? 

Sorry if this post doesn't make a lot of sense too btw, I'm just typing and hoping it does. Feel free to ask questions in the comments section if you need clarification on some things.",07Nov2019,1

272,"I [21F] decided to go back to school after my career of 3 years didn’t pan out. I have pretty severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks, so it’s been difficult for me to make friends as an adult. I met someone [30F] during my time at this school (a professor) who I really connected with and hoped to get to know better. I felt safer and happier when I was around her, and we ended up spending a lot of time together over the year I spent there. Having her in my life helped me learn to be kinder to myself and start opening myself up to the possibility of not being so closed-off with new people. I was always vaguely aware that we had similar interests, which lead to the two of us ending up at the same events pretty regularly. We run in the same circles, so we have a lot of mutual friends (who she has said really value me, i should spend more time with, etc). I have a hard time with social cues sometimes, but she’s told me that she wanted to invite me out with her recently, but didn’t know if she was allowed to given how we met and that, at the time, I was still technically a student at that university. We made plans after that, but she always ends up being busy. She’s a young professional and works 24/7, so it’s understandable, but I’ve been very confused by the whole situation. I’ve made it clear I respect her boundaries, but it’s difficult for me to know whether she genuinely sees me as a friend or if I’d be better off just being polite/cordial and impersonal when she comes along with our mutual friends for drinks or I see her at events. I really do care about her and don’t want to lose her, but I would hate for her to feel like she’s stuck dealing with me because she’s too sweet to tell me that she’s not interested.

282,"I was born into a broken dysfunctional family. My mother and Father were both addicted to drugs. They met in rehab and had me. My Father was a very nice man even though he had his vices. My mother always put drugs before anyone even me and my older brother. When I was growing up I lived primarily with my grandmother and Father. When I was 8 my dad died. It devastated me, he may have been a drug addict but he was always there for me and spent all of his free time with me. He was a very good father. My mother was in prison at the moment so I had to live with my grandparents. My grandmother was my mentor. She guided me in school and life, she pulled 8 year old me out of my depression and helped me open up and make some friends in school. It was discovered that I was gifted with an IQ of 158 while I was in elementary school. My grandmother would always tell me that this was a blessing because I would be able to pull myself out of the life I was born into. After I had gotten out of elementary school and into middle school my grandmother died. I missed nearly a month of school. I turned mean, very mean. Almost every word out of my mouth was an insult even to family. After my mother got out of prison I went to live with her, everyone hoped that she would be able to stay clean this time. But she couldn’t, I remember staying with her in crack houses, she would leave me in the living room to play video games while she would shoot up or have sex in the other room. I stopped caring for school, I didn’t do any homework, I stopped paying attention. I let my test scores carry me to barely passing the classes. I was in my middle schools gifted program. I had to take French classes and do extracurricular science projects to stay in it. My mom probably saw me as convenient, she thought that I would be able to get a good job as a doctor as a lawyer and pull her up with me. I lived like that for two years, until she got sent back to prison. I then moved in with my grandfather. He’s a ‘slow’ man, he doesn’t understand much. He goes to work then comes home and falls asleep. It was around eighth grade while I was sitting in my shitty house, thinking about how shitty everything had been that I decided that I wanted to get a good job. I started to study and put effort into classes. I took AP and honors classes in high school and passed with decent grades. I made friends and practiced my social skills with a mirror for hours so that I could become popular. But now as I junior I feel that everything was pointless. I thought that getting good grades and becoming popular would make me feel some sort of sense of fulfillment and happiness, but all it has made me do is hate people. I don’t know why I hate them, but whenever I talk to them I get angry. This year I have turned in almost no homework and just been barely passing my classes.

284,"I live in Europe and been working at this company for 5 years now.

Two weeks ago I had surgery and stayed one week at home to recover. 

Unfortunately according to the surgeon I will need around 6 weeks to fully recover and for the wound to fully close (it’s in a very sensitive area).

The thing is that they told me to shower twice a day, wash the wound after each time I go to the toilet and then do at least 3 Sitz baths a day.

As you can imagine I cannot go to the office and follow this advice because it’s impossible to do so at work. Meanwhile my boss has been pressuring me to go to work, I went to work this week and now I have more pain than last week, with the addition of the wound being a bit more open than last week.

It’s slowing my healing process and ruining my mental wellbeing because I want to go to work, do my job and then feel guilty for staying at home recovering.

BUT the problem is
I lied about my age job name nationality and pretty much everything
Here's why:
We met on kik I was on there after a friend recommended it for trolling horny dudes.
Most guys (even the decent ones) would stop talking to you within 1 week.

This dude (31) wanted to stay in contact, after a month he started acting distant, and cold he would take 12 hours to text back. My thoughts were pretty much confirmed 'He would lose interest'

 but I was pretty hurt

I confronted him about how his behavior made me feel. And he never did that ever since.

I thought we would stop talking after a while and nothing would get serious, but I was so fucking wrong. 

Time moved on fast and we were still talking. He was filling a large void in my life, I think about him all the time. We opened up about pretty much everything. I never feel like I have to hide aspects of my personality to appeal to him. He's one of a kind I swear. 

He went out of his way to do me gestures and he's doing a bunch of wholesome projects for when 'I'm supposed to come to his country' we talked about kids marriage proposing and everything. He even told his parents about me. We call often. It was a 2 months ago that I realized I made an impact on his life and that he actually loves me. Like actual true love. 

I'm 18 turning 19 in few days. I've been having panic attacks and terrible meltdowns as I dont know how I'm going to tell him I can't see him in few months. He's super serious about this. I don't want to randomly disappear and stop replying to him that would hurt him. I want him to move on and still want to have a family even if its not with me. And even if he has to hate me in order to move on and make peace with himself.

The problem is I really don't want to stop talking to him. I'm sure he would block me (I deserve this I know) but Im so attached that I can't imagine waking up without getting a message from him.

I really don't know what to do. Please help...",07Nov2019,1
286,"Hey Reddit

I've been having a major breakdown the past few days because of a the sudden ghosting/radio silence of a friend I've had correspondence with for a somewhat long time through instagram. She isn't answering text and social media anymore, and her phone rings all the way before going to voicemail, which lead me to believe that she either lost her phone or is in some kind of trouble. 

I'll provide some context;

She's originally from Turkey, but happened to be visiting Montreal. She gave me her phone number and we met up, had a couple beers. We both were enjoying ourselves a lot, as far as I could tell, called each other awesome and awesomer. We soon after parted ways, due to her having to help her aunt with stuff that same evening.

I followed up through text messages, sending her pictures she took using my phone, which she had previously asked me to send her. She took a while to respond, and said something like; ""fuck yeah dude!! sorry i didnt get back last night i been super busy but fuck yea ur super fuckin cool!""

After that message, I haven't been able to reach her in any method. She'd very free-spirited and somewhat reckless, so I'm worried something could've happened to her.

What's been bothering me as well is she liked someone's picture on instagram recently, but didn't respond to my messages- This lead me to believe I might be getting ghosted, but I don't see any reason why she would be ghosting me- But I still can't shake off this ominous feeling I have.

I need advice on how to deal with this situation, ask me anything regarding this and I'll respond.",07Nov2019,1

289,"I'm a fresh graduate, took my first job with big dreams and a lot of hope. Two months in, realized it is a terrible, terrible fit, and colleagues and I don't get along. Part of it is my fault too because I came in and made many fresh grad mistakes, not expecting the clash in workplace culture and job expectations, so there was much friction, but now I'm trying my best to make amends and make it to six months (which would be sometime late Dec) , but my depression has already relapsed for a third time and mentally i'm in a pretty bad state. I don't want to show up to another day, I have thoughts of stabbing myself,  but I also want to hang on all the way to december if not for my resume and because I believe I need to learn what grit is. But the mental torture right now is quite unbearable.

290,"Almost 5 years. Many ups and downs. This last year was so bad. My best friend died, I spiraled, my mental illness got the best of me and I quit my job. Spent the last 365 days trying to get it together but have been so held back by crippling anxiety and depression. Finally got the call that I am approved for a new type of treatment after trying every medication under the sun for the last 13 years. TMS. It’s supposedly very exhausting and you need a lot of mental support and stability. It’s 5 days a week for 6 weeks. I know things have been bad between us because he’s been carrying the burden of everything for so long. He’s become so resentful because of it. I am resentful to him for not understanding how bad it’s been for me. How badly I wish I didn’t feel so horrible all the time. How horrible I feel for not being able to be a good girlfriend. He got off his meds cold turkey a week ago and is even angrier, all the time, more then I thought he could be already in this last year. But he swore, for the past few weeks he’d be by my side throughout this process. He promised he wouldn’t leave me. He promised he’d help me through these next six weeks. That I could trust him, that it wasn’t too much. Two nights ago I sobbed and told him how scared I was to do this. How hard it was gonna be and he held me and told me how much he loved me and how he’d be there through it all, no matter what. 

He just broke up with me tonight. He said it’s because he’s unhappy. He’s not willing to wait the 6 weeks to see if I get better. He’s too unhappy. He broke up with me after almost 5 years. 

I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. I feel like I wish I could go back in time and erase this last year. I feel so, goddamned alone. And being alone is my biggest fear.

This relationship is codependent I’ve know that. But to rip the rug out from underneath me, 5 days before I start this treatment, when I need the most support and stability...I am so hurt. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to handle the level and intensity of emotions I am feeling right now. I don’t know how to make this pain stop. I was already hurting, so badly from this last year, but it felt like this treatment was the light at the end of my tunnel. And he won’t be taking the steps with me out of it anymore.

How do I cope with this? How do I deal with this level of pain?",07Nov2019,1
291,"23. 23 long years of constant fear and crippling anxiety fuckin eating me alive. 23 wasted years where not a day goes by where im just expecting the next inevitable thing to come along and ruin everything and make it worse.

I suffered abuse and a couple suicide attempts up until i left for uni and finally moved out of that shithole my parents call home. Raising me in the damn past, saying women have to act this way and do this and that cause men are superior and that they basically own me till im married. I cant believe they either dont remember, care or just achnoledge how much they fucking hurt and ruined me.
If the depression and anxiety wasnt bad enough, locking me away from the world not letting me be around people left me as a 23yr old with almost no communication and social abilities.
Ive just grown so much resentment and burning hate for these people it kills me.

Every little thing stresses me out, any rise in voice and im fighting off a panic attack. I cant hold a job to save my life.

Now the current situation is ive fucked my knees and need physiotherapy if i want any hope in fixing it. Im in australia and i was supposed to get on support back in feburary. Its now november and im no closer. They keep messing it up, getting details wrong or having system crashes. Im literally couch serfing with my bfs at his uncles and i had someone from the support walk me threw the steps since theyve messed it up thst many fucking times. And they messed it up again. Somehow thought my partner now owns a property. 
They say just start again. Typical. So 9 months of almost no ability to walk now. No way to pay back my bfs uncle for rent and food. Constant fear my parents will show up any day now and drag me back to that damn cult..

I just want the pain to stop..the constant fear and stress. Ive had enough. Its gone on far too long.
I wish my suicide attempt before i met my bf was succesfull so i wouldnt have to put him threw any pain..i just.. i just see it as enivatable now. I dont fear death, just this god damn pain and suffering. Ive had enough.
Im really god damn sorry to my boyfriend, for him putting up with me. We shouldnt have met. U deserve better and i dont want to hurt u. If u wernt here well. I doubt id still be alive in all honesty.. i just. Fuck i dont know what to do anymore. My life is a god dammed joke",07Nov2019,1
292,"My partner and I have a unit in the middle of the complex, with the biggest patch of grass in the entire place. We've been here for a few years now and have never had an issue with kids playing outside. 

Normally they were older and just kept to themselves. However, a new group of children (around 4-7) years old have moved in they're driving me insane. As I mentioned I'm fine with kids playing in my yard, but these children just scream constantly. I'm not exaggerating either. Yesterday, for example, they were pretending to be dinosaurs and just screamed as loud as they could. When one of the girls doesn't get her way she fake cries at a pitch louder then most commercial planes. Additionally they've all been given recorders by their school (a wood wind instrument) and walk up and down the complex using it like a whistle. 

Every now and again their parents will yell out for them to be quite, but they've never listened. It's compounded by me working nights, and being constantly woken up by them. I've tried ear plugs but their yelling still makes it through.

How would you suggest I seek a remedy? Should I talk to their parents? Or should I talk to them directly. Any advice you can offer would be great, cause my girlfriend and I have always been awkward around children and don't know what to do",07Nov2019,1

296,"I am kind of feeling like a jerk for telling my sister in law that I don’t want to go 50/50 with her on a birthday gift for my mother in law. 

My husband and I haven’t always been in the best financial situation, but we have always done our best to make sure our family feels special on holidays. We never show up to a party without a gift even if it means it will hurt our finances to make sure we don’t show up empty handed. 

For the last few years we have given my MIL expensive material gifts (like jewelry), that I have never seen her even wear after the day we gifted them to her. She is fairly wealthy so I feel like maybe the things we have given to her just aren’t up to her standards. 

My husbands bday was in Oct and we invited his family to come to dinner with us. We live about an hour away from his mother and sister, and they refused to commute to the city we live in. So we compromised and met them half way. Everyone came and had a great time but nobody got my husband anything for his birthday, not even a card. And believe me, I am not materialistic in any way shape or form, I was just excited that we were all able to spend his birthday together. However, that being said, I felt like since no gift was given to my husband that it sort of set the trend for the whole family. Meaning, since they didn’t gift him anything why should we have to give them a gift on their birthdays?

Well, This coming weekend it my MILs birthday and my SIL asked me to go 50/50 with her on a gift and they invited us to her birthday party which is an hour away from our house. I brought up the fact that I figured we weren’t doing gifts since nobody got my husband anything for his birthday last month. My SIL was mildly offended by this so now I’m feeling like a big jerk. I would never show up empty handed to a birthday party , I just don’t want to spend a ton of money given the circumstances. I was planning on maybe just giving my MIL something with more meaning to it like a picture collage of all of her grandkids...

But as I looked back on it, I realised that that isn't me and I'm completely normal. But my parents/siblings still thought I had aspergers. I started to hate the word and denied the fact that I had ever happened. Up until today I had basically forgotten about it.

And now it's back up again. Basically my mum was talking to a deputy at my school, and she mentioned me having aspergers. Apparently aspergers wasn't on my student file, so no one knew. Now my deputy knows, so she wants my mum to hand in a file that says I have aspergers. 

I really, really don't want anyone in my school to think that I have aspergers. Especially not my teachers. It's the idea of them treating me differently because of something I don't even have. 

The question now is how do I stop her from handing in my file, and would it even be a bad thing if all my teachers thought I have aspergers?",07Nov2019,1
306,"I'm a junior (19F) at a local university working towards a triple major and one of my professors just keeps staring at me in class and it's really starting to creep me out. Every time I look up, he's staring at me, but quickly looks away as soon as I make eye contact. Any time he asks a question or cracks a joke, I'm always the first one he looks at. This has been happening since the beginning of the semester and I didn't think much of it at first, simply shrugging it off as accidental. 

After this continuing to happen each class period, I started to wonder if I just happened to be sitting where he naturally looks while lecturing, so I tried moving to a totally different part of the room, but nothing changed. I'm really quiet and focused on my academics, so it's not like I'm some troublemaker or I will ask questions in class all the time or anything. I eventually came to the conclusion that maybe I was one of the students he would read for feedback about the lecture (ie, if I was bored, he should move on or if I seemed confused, he should slow down and explain the topic more). I was pretty satisfied with that answer for a few weeks, and would simply avoid looking at him in class at all, just to avoid the awkwardness. 

However, he recently started touching my hand and arm as I turn tests or exams in and staring intently at me. Again, I thought it was an accident at first, but he didn't do it to anybody else (in fact, he would just have them set the papers on his desk, instead of taking them from them). The touching thing has happened about three times now and it's starting to really creep me out...

My university is in a relatively small town (\~50,000), so I naturally ran into him in public the other day (perks of a small town). I was waiting in a line with a friend and I saw him get out of his car across the parking lot. Being super introverted, I turned around to face my back towards him, so he hopefully wouldn't see my face. After waiting a little bit, I assumed he was gone, so I turned back around and saw him just a few yards away walking straight towards me. As soon as we made eye contact, he turned on his heel and walked right back to his car and drove away.

This professor seems like a really nice person and is really soft spoken and seems really nervous. His voice always cracks when we make eye contact. I've got nothing personal against him, but neither have I ever encouraged him. I just don't know how to handle it very well and honestly I'm terrified of confrontation, but it's getting to the point where I don't want to go to class or be in the building his office is in... What should I do? We're only just over half way through the semester, otherwise I would just gut it out.

&amp;#x200B;

We both live in Helsinki, Finland. She's on the metro on her way to my place while I'm already at work. She gives me a call after she's gotten off the metro. Apparently, a man with a weird green tattoo on his face was sitting next to her. She recalls him looking very anxious and fidgeting most of the ride. He then proceeded to talk to her and he asked her if he seemed nervous and told her that today's a big day for him. She also overheard him talking on the phone with two other men that he was supposed to meet in two different places. Now this story made no sense to me, but what he said next gave me the goosebumps.

309,"hey i’m 18 and over this past summer i was on vacation and i think i was raped ? it was much older man in his mid 30s i had met that day and decided to go out clubbing with after conversations and him insisting. he bought me several drinks so i agreed to go with a close friend of mine (i know it’s dumb now, you don’t have to tell me ) i guess you could say i was leading him on that night after he gave me a couple drinks ( tipsy) but i noticed he didn’t drink any himself. he kissed me as we were dancing and i thought it was kinda weird but i was on vacation and in vip so why not? he kept trying to put his hands down there after and i would move it and say no but after some dancing my friend decides we should go 

my friend told me the next day that on the walk there for some reason she had let him know i was a virgin and wasn’t wanting to have sex anytime soon and apparently i made some joke (could have made him think i did want to) during the walk back to my hotel (he insisted to walk us back) and my friend checking if i was sober enough to be left alone with him, my memory goes blank. when i woke up i was completely unaware of what had happened for a while until going to the bathroom and seeing blood all in the toilet. all i remember in that moment is a  flash of us but i can remember how i felt too. we are alone in a staircase and he is chocking me from behind while thrusting inside my limp body. i remember it being extreme pain yet i was numb at the same time.
i had convinced myself i chose to do it that night but over the next few days i thought about  and remembered more

 i know i definitely dissociated in that moment he actually went inside of me. i was thinking no but as he abruptly turned me around i can’t remember what i did. i was all so quick and me being naive wasn’t expecting it. i felt nothing. some of the memories have came back but i still don’t know if i actually resisted or not. i know i consented to kissing in that staircase because the memory has came back but i definitely didn’t want to lose my virginity in a staircase to this man. at the same time, even without verbal consent, he may have thought that’s what i wanted because of my other actions so i don’t know what to think . the memory thing is really weird because i don’t think i was roofied yet it goes blank for the rest of the night. i don’t even remember how i got back to my hotel room but my friend said i was acting perfectly fine when she saw me after and we went to sleep

months later, ive just numbed myself to the whole thing and moved on cause like, how can i call that rape when others have gone through much more traumatic experiences?? i can barely even remember mine and idk if it’s just me but i genuinely feel like it was my fault. 

it became easier to not think about in the months following and i started at college. i got a little happier for the beginning until another “incident” happened recently. there was a night i got very intoxicated with some close friends and a cousin plus some guys they knew. long story short, the night is over and my cousin and this guy we had partied with were supposedly taking care of me because i had clearly drank too much and got a little sick. i don’t remember any of this but he convinced my friend she could leave when something came up where she had to leave and she remembers him closing the door to the room we were in while she was still there talking to some people outside. all i remember is us on my bed and he’s trying to take my pants off and i kind of tried to stop him and said i was on my period. he said he it was fine and he didn’t care and just started going down on me. at that point and i guess i was fine with it at the time but then after that i remember him asking me if i wanted to have sex. i wouldn’t even have done it sober but i remember saying yes hesitantly. he even asked me if i was sure and i must’ve said yes again but it’s all very blurry. he ended up performing anal on me with no asking but i was too intoxicated even by the time i noticed to say anything so he continued very aggressively (was bleeding for days after). 

this has all just fucked me up because i would’ve never said yes to it but in that state i just let it happen. he definitely drank that night but seemed to have definitely sobered up enough to be taking care of me and many of my friends had let me know that he seemed sober when taking care of me yet tells me he was so so drunk. if he was i could accept this but hearing from people that he was sobered up makes me feel sick. if he was in the right state and i clearly wasn’t , was my in the moment yes enough to make it okay? i see him all the time and he has this smug look and will try to say something to my friends just for me to notice and when i do i literally freeze up w anxiety and end up shutting down for the rest of the day (or days ) it’s so baddd
pllease give any input on both situations i just really need some type of answer or clarity. i haven’t had sex with any other men so i feel like these two experiences have truly fucked me up but the answer isn’t even clear enough for me to feel a certain way so that’s just kinda driving me KINDA insane so pls help tyyyy",07Nov2019,1

313,"I seriously don't know what to do about it.

Background here: A year ago we moved across the country, my boyfriend started studying English and I started working. We both have mental health issues and it was hard for us to live an adult life. I sometimes was unable to work for more than a month, but we had some savings to get us through.

In June my boyfriend said that he hates his studies and doesn't want to do that anymore, so he dropped out. He has been working since, I spent a month in a mental health facility and then I started working in the same company as my boyfriend, it was okay for like a month.

Then the academic year was about to start so my boyfriend told his parents that he dropped out. They were not happy to say the least and demanded that we come home and live with them, because there's no point in us being across the country if not for studying. I don't have any contact with my parents nor any member of my family, so I can't get any help from them.

We cried a lot, we discussed a lot and decided that it's going to be the best for us. We're going to work for a year and then both apply for different studies at a uni closer to home.

Fast-forward to now, we're not even here for a week and we absolutely hate it. I lived with them before for 3 months and I don't know if I didn't notice or something's changed now but his mom is absolutely toxic.

314,"I've applied to many establishments, most leading to nothing and a few resulting in a failed interview. I've run out of places to apply to within walking distance, and I'm running low on options that require using public transportation. It doesn't help that most of the places I call ask me to apply online, so I know my resume will either never be seen by anyone or be immediately disregarded.

I'm honestly at a loss of what to do at this point. I was hoping to save up enough money to move out of my shitty apartment (and out of state, by extension), but how can I achieve that if I can't even manage to get something as simple as an entry-level job? I know I don't have any work experience or college education, nor do I have any skills to compensate for my lacking resume; so it makes sense as to why I'm having such rotten luck.

I've tried job training programs and vocational rehabilitation, yet I still managed to fuck it up somehow. Even if I did manage to get a job, the stress of a fast-paced environment or having to stand up for hours on end while tend to merciless customers/coworkers would break me not even a week into being hired. I honestly can't see how people are able to do it, and the fact that I can't get with the problem feels so disheartening.

I thought maybe I could finally get out of NEETdom and not rely soly on disabilitybux, that maybe I could contribute to society as a somewhat functioning human being. Unfortunately, I just stick out like a sore thumb and people just know something is off about me. Nobody would want to hire an unattractive, socially inept thing that can't convince employers that they are a valuable asset to their company.

To make it worse, I do get attention from girls, I am positive I look good, and that just makes me feel that I can get a girl I want but then iam not able to and it's making things worse. I have always been mentally strong but I just can't help but get distracted thinking about approaching some cute girl. When you get stares from them, but can't approach them. I want to know how I can get my mind off this? And focus on my things, Iam still able to function well, but I can do better. This year is crucial for me.",07Nov2019,1
318,"Selling items on Shpock....
So I sold an almost brand new Kindle fire on shpock yesterday. 
Item was less than 2 weeks old and I am 100 sure was working perfectly. Checked it myself before selling and was working fine. Even included a Memory card and case. Buyer asked for my personal phone number on case 'couldn't find your house...' Of course I refused. 
This morning at 7am I receive a stream of messages stating item does not work at all and demanding a full refund. 
I didn't reply as just got up and 10 minutes later start receiving messages on my private FB account (no idea how they found it) Stating same thing. 
I am absolutely sure item works, used it day before no problems and checked it just before selling.
In my opinion for whatever reason they have changed their mind and want money back. Item was sold as seen... don't see why I should refund for no good reason? 
Only thing that worries me is they collected from my home and know my address. 
Where do I stand on this? If item was faulty I would happily refund but not particularly happy about being messed around because they changed their mind. 
Any advice on this? 
Thanks",07Nov2019,1

Then he's all okay again. But if his parents tell him something again, he reacts the same way.
  
Now his parents are afraid if they something that might upset him, he even missed his school and work for something that happened at home, ridiculous!

323,"We've been separated for a while now, after a 3 year, on/off, relationship. She's the only girl I was with sexually, and we were pretty active. We finally really broke it off, and haven't been talking much recently. She's off in the Mavy, and is in a relationship that seems to be doing pretty great. 

Now, my problem: I can't stop thinking about her, sexually. She was part of the whole journey, so pretty much every fantasy I have is with her. I cant get her out of my head, and it's really annoying me, because she's in a different relationship, so far away, and I don't have feelings for her, but after 3 years of her and only her, its impossible for me to imagine anyone else. 

Is there any way to get passed this? I'm currently trying to get with someone else, but no luck so far. 

I really want to stop thinking about her, mostly because it feels obsessive and creepy, like that one dude that won't let go of an Ex, even though I've emotionally moved on.

325,"There are 3 of us. Me, and this couple. All of our names are on the lease, the boy is the primary owner. It's a 3 bedroom duplex. The reason I finally decided to ask for help about this is they beat the ever loving fuck out of their dog, and I can put up with a lot, but I can't put up with that. The other day one of the dogs chewed the wood panel on a window and one of my roommates beat him with a belt. Like, grabbed him by the scruff, towered over the dog, squeezed him in between his legs to keep him still, and beat him repeatedly with his belt. He does this often, and by often I mean any time the dog does something he doesn't like. It's traumatizing enough as is, but I grew up seeing my stepdad beat our dogs until they bled, so it gives me flashbacks. It's horrible. I let the girl know about this past trauma and she felt ""guilty"" for a few minutes then went right back to being abusive and violent. She often brags to me about how the dog's ""daddy"" (her boyfriend) ""gave them a good ass whooping"", and will go into great detail. Acting it out and laughing, going ""bam bam bam!"" while aggressively swatting the air and what not.


I paid my part of the deposit, as well as rent, and they forbid me from eating in my own room because they think it's dirty or unsanitary for some reason. They both steal, especially the girl. She tried stealing a children's book from the community park's Little Free Library, but me and my boyfriend at the time argued with her until she put it back.

I am in absolutely no way financially able to afford my own place right now. There's obviously much more to this situation but this is the gist. I'll give more details if they're needed. 

This is day 7 of a year long lease. I was planning on spending this year just saving up as much as I can and then booking it. I've been homeless and living in squalor for the past 2 and a half years so please understand my desperation and the situation I'm in. They are terrible, narcissistic individuals and are toxic to be around. I've known the girl for about 9 years. She wasn't like this when we were in high school, I don't know what happened, but she's become a monster. She constantly tears me down, is incredibly judgmental and just a very hateful person. A bit racist as well. Unfortunately, physically speaking, this is the most stable my living situation has been in at least 4 or 5 years. But, emotionally I'm already drained.

326,"I moved cross-country to pursue school and see life from a very different perspective from how I grew up. I went from a very rural, redneck area to a very diverse, major city. I love it. It’s not the location that I’m struggling with at all, it’s my roommate. I didn’t really know anyone as I was moving here but we were both planning to go to the same school and in the same program so whatever, it was a place to live. It wasn’t so bad at the beginning but after over two years I’ve seen her true colors. In short, she’s self-centered, demeaning, and has a God complex. She can do no wrong and she is ALWAYS right. I absolutely cannot stand it. Another example is: you do something, she flips out about it, but when she does the same thing, it’s fine because it’s “different.” Stupid and petty shit like that.

Im 25 years old, I just want to live my life but constantly being trapped in my room and feeling sorry for myself because I hate my living situation is literally killing me. I’m seriously considering taking a not as great job offer back home solely for the excuse so I can get away from this and be back and surrounded by people I know aren’t toxic for me. I want to move out so badly even if I stay in the area I’m currently in but with few people that I know and little money (new grad life) I can’t just up and move all of a sudden and say fuck you. I’ve tried to drop hints that I’m not happy but she’s oblivious because of the type of person she is. Every time I bring up moving out it goes back to pretty much how I’ll ruin everything if I move when our lease is up. So essentially I’d be being selfish and HAVE to resign yet another lease with her or else. 

I just don’t know what to do, or how to go about it. I think if we didn’t live together anymore we could be friends but I feel like we are just so opposite it’s frustrating. I’m seriously struggling with anxiety because of her and I’m really trying to stay sane but fuck, it’s hard. I’m just at my breaking point and I don’t know what I should do anymore.

Going into week 8 of the quarter and I've noticed this girl in front of me every single day glancing back at me playing with her hair then looking back and taking my journal accidentally. 

I grew aware that she possibly thought I was attractive through those tendencies of hers during the first couple weeks and today I overheard her talking to the guy who sits to the left of me how there is always an empty seat on the left of him and why he never sits in the empty seat and how she would love to sit in the seat that he's sitting in. I'm the only one out of high school in this economics class hence the teacher asked us and I don't like the idea of me talking to someone still in high school.

She's very attractive and I'm a reserved person who doesn't typically go up to someone I don't know but have kind of been wanting to talk to her and maybe start talking to her. The only thing that holds me back is that my younger sister is a senior and I don't like the idea of talking to someone her age because it just feels weird to me.

We met each other on an online game and eventually got very close. We spend a lot of our time together chatting on video calls. We finally met each other once last year and this led to me falling in love with her even more. Her visit validated my feelings towards her and we’re planning to meet again in the future. My family still doesn’t about this relationship. I’ve made up lies during the time she was here to go out and spend time with her.

I’m afraid to take this step in my life. I don’t ever see myself getting married in my culture’s “appropriate” way. I come from a muslim background and there are usually arranged marriages. I’ve told my mom that I don’t expect myself getting married so she believes that I’ll be living with her for the rest of my life. I don’t want to live this way.

Its humiliating and so degrading to have to shave my moustache every other day and I'm not even able to wear crop tops as I have such a hairy stomach. I dont feel feminate in the slightest.

335,"I honestly don't know what to do, so I'll just start from the beginning to the present, I'm M25.

I always had sleeping issues, it takes me usually 30-120 minutes to fall asleep and at night, if I wake up which frequently happens, I am usually awake for a while. It has been like this since my childhood but I was always fit. Sure, some days I was super tired and didn't want to do anything, but those were exceptions.

Since some time now, maybe a year or longer, I kept getting more and more tired and staying like that over the day, no matter how much I sleep. I usually sleep 8 hours, when I changed it to 5 hours I was dead the next day and just lately I started having multiple days in the week I sleep 11-12 hours. It does help early on, but very quickly I get tired and feel exhausted again.

This has become so extreme that when I have a recap on monday at work what happened last week I can only use my notes to recap, if I try to actually remember it there is just nothing that pops up in my mind, 0. Even things that happened on prior days or earlier on the same day are an actual struggle for me to remember, sometimes it goes as far that I even forget things within the same conversation I'm having with my girlfriend.

Around half a year ago I went to the doctor as I noticed it gets more extreme and told him of my issues, he asked several questions and one was specifically sport activities, rest was computer and nutrition/food intake.

The last at first, I don't focus on balanced eating, but I usually eat all kinds of things and had a feeling this is definitely not the cause. We had a blood test and everything was within 2% of the optimum, so 98%-102%.

Computer is a valid point, I usually am on the computer with nightmode until I prepare myself to go to sleep - this would explain to me why it can take longer to fall asleep, but to be so dead tired? To wake up at night multiple times, not falling back to sleep? Waking up by the slightest sounds/light flashes?

The last one was sport, I told him I don't do sports but I walk everywhere. I average 6000 steps per day and have no car. He said that this is not what people my age need and I need proper sport, that turned into his leading point that I might not be exhausted enough to sleep properly. Looking at how I can barely even follow someone talking to me anymore, I am not really convincend but I am not saying it plays no role, but then again...Most people I know don't do any sport and walk by far less and sleep perfectly fine.

But the main issue is not the sleeping problem in general, but how rapidly and insanely it increased in the last 2 months, I just feel dead all the time, I can barely motivate myself to actually work at work and I have no clue what to do anymore.

I’m a 19, about to be 20 year old college student. Around 3 weeks ago, my class had a presentation. After our presentation, the audience asked the presenter questions. This particular girl that i never took notice of asked me endless questions. After that day she has been trying to engage with me as much as possible. I started to learn more about her, and I guess i started to develop some sort of interest towards her. It’s more of an extremely deep interest, but not so much of a feeling. I’m not usually someone that finds interest in someone this fast, but she was everything i looked for in a girl. Recently i found out she was 27, and i’m sure she found out about my age as well. Despite the age difference, I still find myself extremely attracted to her, and it seems like it was the same for her.

But for some added context my brother is very demanding and ordered me to put food away when I had already said that I was going to sleep because I have an exam tomorrow morning and need to wake up because I take the bus to commute 2 hours to school, so I told him that I wasn’t going to do it and got on the couch to go to bed (I am currently sleeping here because he took my bed when I left home for school for a few months). He began to yell and shout profanities at me while yanking off the blanket from around me. He kept on shouting that if I didn’t get up and do what he had said then he wasn’t going to let me sleep until I did. Eventually, our oldest brother came out from our side patio where he was with some friends because he could hear everything that was going on. He sent my brother to his room and his fiancé, that came with him, tried to comfort me because I began crying. My father also came out after things escalated as well.
I would say that these kind of things happen around once a month with him so even if I miss my family I feel that it might just be best to leave. But I hope to get some advice on this matter because I don’t want to act irrationally over something small because I’m upset.

He’s Norwegian, speaks very good English, and I’m French-American (French being my first language).

347,"So I'm gonna be up front here and say that I have an anxiety disorder. Part of treatment is evaluating your thoughts for realism, and frankly I have no idea how realistic my anxiety about money is. So, my hopefully-for-your-sakes-not-anxiety-disordered friends, please give me your realistic perspectives from outside looking in!

Background:

So I am disabled (fibromyalgia and chronic migraines) and as a result I can't work as many hours during the week. As a result I only make around $1400 a month. My husband and I have separate bank accounts and he'll come in and save me when I get in too deep with $500 here and there (he makes much much more than me) as needed. 

My expenses are pretty high, not because of rent or regular bills, because thank goodness my husband pays those, but because of all my healthcare spending. I think something like half my spending last month was directly on healthcare, and there's more that's indirect and not reflected on bank statements, like getting a heat pad to decrease my pain.

I have $1000 in retirement savings, left over from when I could still work full time. I'm not currently adding to that, though I try.

Questions:

Am I wrong to worry about money? My husband and I have a good relationship, but I know that's not guaranteed in life, nor is his continued earning power, and it really scares me to be so dependent on him financially. Like, crying when we talk about it kind of scared.

I know I'm too anxious - the crying gives that away - but how much anxiety is enough? It's hard for me to imagine that no anxiety is appropriate in this situation. So here are my questions:

How worried would you be feeling in my shoes? 

And...

What steps would you take to correct things? 

Thanks so very much!",07Nov2019,1

Buuuuut my best friend of years had to move away (the other side of the country) a year ago and we always talked on the daily like literally 24/7 FaceTime and text and shit like any time she had a shitty day or was sad I was there right.. and about a month ago we found out her parents were finally letting her move back.. great! So she said she was gonna surprise me and plan something with my sister to come see me.. which like she’s my #1 best friend cause everyone else in my life has always been toxic but her and we are very close.. so this was fucking exciting we missed eachother.. so she gets back I FaceTime her all throughout her airport shenanigans and everything. She never sees me,  I asked to hang once and she said she had plans THEN yesterday I had work (she knew this) and she said she was hanging out with one of my old friends who I don’t like and asked if I wanted them to come pick me up which deadass was like a bullet to the fucking heart to hear my best friend having already made plans with someone she barely knew when she left over me. I think I have hella abandonment issues too lmao cause of childhood.. but this is really sad for me cause I am like (yes I’ll hype myself up) I’m a fucking awesome friend. Every time she has a breakdown or is sad she’ll call me in a dead sleep and my EXHAUSTED ass will stay up Nd calm her down which is avery often occurrence.. I don’t mind it I love my bitch.. but it feels like she only needs me when she’s sad and now that she’s finally home (which is a huge thing for her mental state) she didn’t bother to see me.. which is also confusing cause she talked so much about how much she misses me.. idk man I’m just kinda fucked up over dis.. ALSO she’s starting school at my school tomorrow and I’ve been high key shading her for her lack of effort at hanging out when I tried.. and my school is TINY and when I say tiny I mean ITTY BITTY there’s no missing eachother. I’m pissed. I don’t even wanna go but we’re enrolling my brother so I have to go other wise my step mom won’t bother enrolling him and homeboy needs school he’s gonna be behind on his credits.. Ik I’m sorry this sounds crazy but it’s a whole ass issue I’m having and I have no one to talk to about it cause I HATE expressing myself and I really don’t like people knowing I have feelings which is totally a whole ass problem in itself but god damn am I just sensitive or is this kinda fucked up.. also she’s been back about a week and there was totally opportunity to see each other but she never came to see me I just feel like everyone disappoints me and this one hit hard man

I'm getting really caught up in my head, and remembering optimistic thoughts I've had in the past now feels so foreign. 

I've had a bad break up that's still lingering, I'm living on the other side of the world from my parents and closest friends, and the career change I did earlier this year that I thought would be beneficial has just taken a turn for the worst with change in management, making me feel incapable and useless.

I miss myself. I miss the fun, optimistic, engaged, passionate person that I used to be. I've stopped doing the things I love that are good for me and I'm now just getting through the days fighting back tears. I feel completely broken and alone and now I'm scared that I'm beginning to stop fighting, because I see no meaning anymore.

It got me thinking. If you read the post you'll have a much more clear idea of what I mean messed up. 

But to sum it up, I was too immature and my first friend who was my best friend for a decade  decided to cut ties. I personally believe it's because he thought I was a bad influence. We're both 19 about to be 20. Around one year ago when I realized he cut me off for how I was I thought it was smart in my very drunken state to send a super dumb long message to him on snap. I regret it deeply. Especially my follow up ""Huh, you unfriended me on here? Whatever you shithead"" I'll admit Im a piece of shit for how I acted. But that night and the following days made Me realise how I was and where I was headed. I've changed a lot in the past year. And while I don't think we can be best friends anymore I want to try to rekindle the friendship. Or at least let him know how what he did changed me for the better and thank him. I know he probably wants nothing to do with me now, he's blocked me on all social media. I never stalked him it threatened him. I was just a total asshole and I hate myself for that. Does anyone know if there is anyway to show that I changed? I miss him. A lot. He was my best friend I regret how I acted. I slowed my drinking heavily and started to actually have a direction in my life that I'm proud of. And if he is willing to talk again what do I say? Like idk what to say to him. I want to apologise, thank him, and rekindle the friendship all. But idk if that's possible anymore.",07Nov2019,1

That is coming from a guy that got into a [major fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlRMNQ8AUnY) with the biggest player on his team for that very reason. In that situation, the fight did change the player's psyche:

&gt;He was never the same player again. It took his confidence away. That was when I learned, you have to stand up for yourself. 

[Michael Irvin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoqvyHLhK1k) said he got into a fight with a senior player after he pushed him out of the line for the cafeteria, and that worked as well, the offender was suspended.

363,"Hi, as the title suggests I'm wondering if my best friend expects too much of me or am I just being a shit friend.

(I have also posted this to AITA)

Recently, there have been major life changes for me, some of which I'm still handling. I have a very tight schedule (for reference I am a university student) with balancing my academic life and extra roles with the student community. We used to see each other more often (almost everyday, I would go to her house, we would text more, study together, etc) but recently between classes and being a resource for other students (I am currently an RA) my free time has significantly decreased and now I tend to see her every couple of days for a few hours. Obviously I knew this would strain our friendship but I thought she would understand that due to my new roles, I would not be able to commit to ""hanging out"" with her as much as I would like to. To be clear, I have verbally told her this and she has seen me energy deprived. However, a few weeks ago she tells me that she doesn't think I care about her and that she does more for me. She's mad that I don't text her enough. When I tried reaching out, she would give me the silent treatment. She used the word ""bitch"" and ""liar"" and accused other friends of noticing when she was upset, claiming that I knew she was upset but didn't bother to ask/acknowledge her. In my eyes, when I had asked if something was bothering her, she replied that she didn't not ""give a fuck"" about the problem. Naturally I am not a mind reader and kind of accepted this response. I also believe that as adults, we cannot expect others to play therapist and assume responsibility for our feelings. Yet she feels as if I have not cared enough. It became worse when she texted me while I was intoxicated. She essentially started a fight with me which lead to me having a bawling session at the party I was at because I was not expecting her to lash out me like that when she knew I was incoherent. She felt bad after and claims she wishes she could take it back. I don't know if I'm tired of her emotional immaturity. I feel like she is draining my already scarce energy load. I don't want to be around her anymore but she started crying today and said she failed her midterm because she couldn't stop thinking about this. Not sure where I'm going with this but am I an asshole for not being as invested in our friendship as I was a few months ago? Life is changing and I'm starting to rethink our 13 years of friendship.

I haven't made any new friends since finishing high school even though lots of people at uni were successful. I've remember I used to go up to people and initiate conversations with them and then I'd walk to them and greet them the next time we are in the same area but they always seem awkward/uncomfortable by it. Like they don't want to interact but don't want to be blatant about it. I'm not being paranoid or misinterpreting their body language on this.

Then upon pondering and reflecting a few months ago about my interaction with my high school friends I realised they were just using me to help them with their assignments, transport, or to fill up numbers.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and why people don't want to be around me. I can't ask a friend either lol. Any insight as to what I should be doing to help me analyse what I'm doing wrong? Because clearly if it's something that happens with one or two people or groups of people then it could be a fault with them. But if it's a reoccuring issue in different situations then it must be me since I'm the common factor.

369,"Hey Guys

So I have six months left in my last year of high school. I'm aleary two years behind because I couldn't go to school for about 2 years as I was sick. Now after I got discharged from the hospital, I changed schools and promised myself I would graduate because I want to go to Uni. 

When I was 17 a teacher (so in my second year of high school at the new school) groped me on my butt and genital area. He did it at a school ball where everyone including him was very drunk. A lot of students saw it. I was very confused and reported it to my headmaster. Nothing happened except that I lost a lot of frienda in my class because they said that I wanted it, it wasn't that bad, I just need attention etc. 

The entire next year that teacher just wouldn't leave me alone, manipulating me, convincing me that it was my fault and I had to be nice to him to not ""make it awkard"" in class. 

Fast forward to now, I'm drained. Depressed. I cry everytime I come home from school because I'm so uncomfortable there. My boyfriend and my parents have advised me to drop out now, work part time for three months and then start evening school in february . I could graduate there in a few months. I'm really conflicted as I just want to finish school and its just 6 months left and then I can go to university but I also don't want to ruin my mental health.

370,"This may sound quite odd but I don't have any friends I'm comfortable to talk about something so personal to me... 

Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman. 

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends and extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving (not a 1950s handmaids tale mind you). A guy I talked to online a while ago had once told me that: ""I have a mindset of a female"" (when I inquired why guy friends don't do platonic cuddling and I argued they should) and a good (straight) male friend to tell me that ""I make him warm and cozy"". Seeing it as a complement personally, it warms my heart and maybe it makes sense.

Strangely, I don't have any active desires to do makeup, crossdress or go out of my way to physically look like a woman as far as by undergoing an MtF transition but I like to being referred to as the woman especially when it comes to any preferred pronouns as ""she"" etc. (I don't mind with male pronouns).  I've also started to give myself a name for my female persona... wanting to be called Cassie or Cassandra).

It may seem I'm purely romanticizing the woman experience by having guys fawn over females, but with my feminine traits, I'd want to use it to melt a man's heart, to make him more emotionally vulnerable and having that reciprocated when it comes to sharing personal things, whether it'd be just platonic or romantic. Right now, I feel wasteful in that I'm not making good use of my feminine traits, and not completely allowing myself to be easily comfortable around guys because I'm hiding a part of myself and when I do reveal it, guys tend to steer clear like I have a plague. I've never associated myself with the culture of bromance for obvious reasons and because of that, any underlying intimacy is light. It didn't feel fulfilling to me, I want something to transcend beyond just bromance and at the core of it, I desire guys whom I can completely trust without hesitation and be nurturing to them, to make them feel all gooey on the inside. In return, I want to be safe, feeling protected and the feeling that I matter to a guy.  

To give a sense of the level of intimacy, I'm very open-minded and comfortable with... putting my head on a guy's chest... playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands (which the same straight male friend asked me once and I didn't think anything of it)

371,"My current bf is kind, bright, happy and caring. He has always wants to hang out and see me do well. He cooks for me, helps me with my homework, lets me nap in his bed, and wants to pay for my meals (but I never let him). He likes me more than I like myself. This is why I think that I don’t deserve him. Prior to us dating, I told him that I didn’t like myself and that I wasn’t sure if I was ready for a relationship. He said that he would wait until I am ready --which could have been potentially years and years. 

Even though we are dating now, I still feel insecure and doubtful about myself. We both live in City1 and he wants to move to City2 (he and his sisters have a new house in City2); I feel like I am holding him back. He graduated university this year and is now looking for his first real job. There will be so many smart, kind and beautiful girls that he will encounter in City2 and I don’t want him to miss any opportunities by staying with me. I want him to be happy. Him dating a girl that lives in City2 would definitely make his life easier. 

So now I am wondering if I should break up with him. This is a thought that I’ve had for a while now, but now isn’t a good time to do it. I want to make sure that he has a job, and that he has adjusted to living in City2. This could be as soon as January 2020. I’ve also wondered if he is the right one for me, and that if I would be screwing up everything by doing this. Perhaps I am scared that he will get bored and cheat on me or vice versa. Maybe I am just running away because I lack self-confidence too. I am still trying to figure out who I am and I wonder if I am able to make him happy in the future.

373,"Hey guys, this is the first advice I've ever asked for on this sub. My problem may not sound like such a big deal at first but trust me, with every day it gets worse for me and I really need some advice on how to stop this.

As the title says, I'm developing a slow, terrible fear. More precisely, the fear of randomly having my eyes cut open with paper. I know, it's a terrible image, and that's exactly why it's a huge struggle for me. 24/7 I'm fearing that some sharp piece of paper will cut my eye in the way you cut your finger with it. Like by turning a page, handing over a sheet to someone, being near someone handling paper. I can almost feel the edge of the paper on my eyeball and I vividly imagine what it would be like. If you get an uncomfortable feeling while reading this, imagine living with it non stop and not being able to shrug it off. That's how my life has been for the last days.

It gets worse when I pass by a tree and i hit a small branch with my head and it barely misses my eyes. I get chills in my whole body and my imagination goes wild again.

It also affects how I act because I start to shrug and cover my eyes compulsively most of the times I imagine this gory scenario. I bet it's weird for others to see my like this. But I get these feelings in random places where there's not a piece of paper: on the subway, in the shower, even when sitting in bed with my eyes closed.

It's driving me insane. I'm litterally dense and fearful all the time and I've never gone through this. I'm generally empathic towards physical pain when I see it but it's never been so powerful in my mind. What could I do to stop imagining all these random shit scenarios? Sometimes I feel the need to simply gauge my eyes out so at least there's nothing in danger to be cut.

My degrees don't technically cover the more business aspects of the job requirements but as it's for a non-profit organization it does cover their area of interest. I honestly didn't think I would get this far, but I do know I'm capable of doing the job on paper. Particularly if they're willing to work with and train me in some aspects. Which if I've gotten this far surely they are? 

The problem is right now I'm freaking myself out. I have to give a 10-minute presentation multiple times over the course of a few hours to various groups of ppl including the board and the finance committee and then be available for regular interview things after some brief Q&amp;A related to the presentation.

""You have 10 minutes to convince a major donor to donate to the Potential Employer. with what you know about Potential employer make this presentation to the Committee.""

My point of contact has said that I can ask for advice or assistance from them, my question is. What should I ask them for? What advice does anyone have about giving these sorts of presentations?

I think I should include more information than the general things one could find from their online presence and pamphlets. 


I was thinking about asking them for 

1. Who is the donor? are they a first-time donor or a donor who regularly gives.?
2. Can I have any images of the foundation in action to include on the powerpoint?
3. Are they able to give me any statistics from the last year to 5 years? 

Is there anything else I can ask for? Is there any general advice anyone can give on doing this sort of thing?

 I think the foundation is really great so I would love to work with them. I'm pretty good ar presentations usually but I have hit a dead-end here before I even started thanks to anxiety.

Like I he could marry me at the point keen and I had liked him for almost as long as he liked me (about 2 or 3 years) but I wouldn't date him during that time for this exact reason.

To say my mother is abusive would be an understatement. Since I told her about our relationship she has taken it as far as telling the family doctor that he's grooming me, telling me that he doesn't love me, grounded me because I would talk to him, manipulating things that he said and take them out of context to get my dad on board, taking jokes of my brother saying he's a drug dealer and beating me up cause of it.

After all of this happening my boyfriend took on a lot of work at once meaning he was stressed out quite a lot and wasn't able to talk to me as much as he use to. It didn't help what was going on with my family and after a couple of days I had done a full 180 on my feelings on him. I still liked him and would like always check to see if he had messaged me in class but I sorta felt nothing towards him and it sucked.

I do have mental issues as well and during this time I was going through a major depressive episode which I didn't tell him or really anyone about and I still don't know if I've fully recovered from it. I also haven't really been feeling like myself since this all went down. 

I still catch myself smiling for no reason when I talk to to him and text him and he does make me happy but I can't tell whether or not it's as a friend thing or if I really do still love him and I'm just still a bitter fucked in the head from the cyclone that is my mother.

380,"About a year and a half ago my sister was diagnosed with celiacs disease and has to avoid gluten or else she gets severe stomach pain. 

However, over the past few months Ive been really concerned about her because of what she has been telling me when I ask her about her health. 

First off, she told me that she will once in a while eat gluten because she feels that sometimes she doesn't react to it. Hearing that was weird because I'm pretty sure she was officially diagnosed with celiacs, but if that's the case where it may be something else, I would want to get on that asap. Although she could also be craving things with gluten in them, which I would understand. However, I've heard of cases where some people who have gluten allergies like to have gluten once in a while to makes themselves sick, so that they loose wight. And she has lost a lot of weight due to her stomach pains. 

That leads me to my second concern, her weight lose. It's healthy to loose some weight, but she has lost a lot. And the most concerning part is my parents, who just see it as my sister is ""getting healthier"" because she's been ""eating healthier"". Hearing that just made me BOIL inside. Last time we hung out as a family, almost immediately after eating a meal, my sister brought up wanting to go outside for a long walk. And she at least brought it up twice. The meal could have been kinda big (it was a while ago when this happened) but it wasn't huge. And I've started to notice a lot of instances where she will willingly do something that was a job for both of us like, mow the lawn, shovel outside, however I don't think she's exercising daily. 

She doesn't tell me everything about her heart, but she has mentioned that sometimes she will get very severe stomach pain, to the point of nearly passing out. Which is terrifying. 

I've tried suggesting to her about opening up to the idea that she could be allergic to something else along with celiacs, but its hard because I know she already has to be so careful with food, and adding another thing to the list of things she can't eat can't be something she wants to think about.

So I've been searching around, literally all I need is a mugshot really (I know they have a criminal history with the last arrest being in 2015) I've got a good fairly close look at his face. I need to know where to go where I dont have to pay to look up a mugshot of them. I know their full name, aliases, all that. I just need a simple picture.

383,"Many months ago the girl I love had to go in this clinic for deal with colorectal cancer, from 4 months (more or less) I haven't had any notice from her, i don't have any contact with her parents and friends, and I couldn't be with her because she actually was living in another country, had to travel fast to another city where the clinic was located and where internet wasn't available in that clinic etc, and everything has been so fast in that period. 3 days ago after many attempts to get info and many research, I found the clinic. I contacted em via email, and they asked me her name. Today has arrived their mail. Only on that moment I've realized that reading the message would have had consequences. I'm terribly scared to read the worst notice... and I couldn't handle that...
Only thinking of it, makes me cry. But I'm hoping so much that she's following the normal procedure, and can't get out and contact me. I want she knows I'm with her, travel there and send her gifts, but I'm so so scared to read that mail... I need yours opinion, because I'm not able to decide. I need to hear of u...

it is normal that I haven't been contacted in any way in those months probably because she is staying 24/24 at the clinic?

Once they closed the gates at 33 and then I went to the office but they took 2-4 minutes opening the doors. So they basically made us late.

I would fuck her though? How do I let her know if we hookup I don’t want it to be public because I can’t have people who know her and me, to find out and assume what I’m into?

Anyway, growing up my mom was really hard to please and was very angry. I don’t remember much before like 12 and I think it’s because middle school was hard for me so it stuck with me the most. My mom was really mean to me during this period of my life and often called me names that hurt my confidence and my self worth (bitch, worthless, r-word, dumbass, whore... you get the idea). Even though my mom has realized her destructive ways and has made a complete change of character (we are very close now) I still believe those words she used to call me. 

I’m in my twenties now and I’m currently enrolled in college. Now that I’m out on my own, I’ve noticed some self destructive tendencies. For example, I always think the work I turn in is never enough so after doubting myself so much I’ve started to turn in worse and worse quality of work. Another example is, whenever I try and do something good for myself I talk myself out of it because I don’t feel like I deserve it. 

I’m very upset with myself because I understand I shouldn’t be doing this to myself because I used to be so productive in high school and I used to be so active and I was happy with how I at least looked before and now I can’t stand to look at myself in the mirror. I don’t want to be trapped in my own self hatred and I don’t want to keep hurting myself this way. 

So, Reddit, what can I do to take myself out of this hole I dug myself in? What steps should I take to push myself to do better for myself?",07Nov2019,1

397,"My roommate [22M] is also my [25F] now ex-boyfriend. When I started dating him, I knew he smoked pot and drank, and so did I. He had also done shrooms, acid, and ecstasy in the past (which I have not done).

We broke up in late September because he became distant and depressed (and honestly, so did I). There’s more to it than that, but that’s the gist. I continued to allow him to live with me. We have separate bedrooms and rent is so cheap with two people. 

In October he quit working at and training at our gym. I knew it wasn’t due to not wanting to see me; we live together and I go to a separate gym location than he does. 

I could tell he was depressed, at least. I tried to keep distant eye on him in case he was self-harming. There were red flags (shut in his room a lot, wearing long sleeves, evasive, odd sleep patterns) but I wasn’t thinking of drug use. He continued to go to classes at university, even if he was high or drunk. I didn’t know if it was my place (since I’m his ex) to check up on him and talk to him. I wanted to honor any boundaries. 

Earlier this week he went back to the gym and asked for his old job back. He told the owner (and another instructor and me) that he had been doing drugs and wanted to get sober. 

As it turns out, in October he had been smoking and drinking. Then he started taking Adderall, Xanax, and ecstasy. From there he started eating powdered meth in addition to everything else. Last Friday, while high in ecstasy, he flushed all of his drugs (except the weed) and decided to get sober. He smoked weed Monday but realized it just made him want to get higher again and is planning on going completely sober. 

Now that he’s no longer wearing long sleeves, I can see a few meth sores but no track marks. So I gather he’s telling the truth and there weren’t other additional drugs (like heroin).

He seems to be doing a lot better. I’m no longer keeping alcohol in the house. We spent time yesterday chatting. We trained at the gym together. We watched some TV and ate some pizza. It all feels pretty normal again. 

But he keeps referring to himself as a drug addict. I assume it’s helping him face reality and keep him walking the straight and narrow. But just how strong is that pull going to be for him, if he really was only doing it for a month? How can I tell if he’s staying sober? What are the best ways I can help him? What boundaries, as both his ex and his roommate, do I need to set?

400,"I really need to talk to somebody or just have my thoughts be heard. I'm going to go insane and I have nobody to confide in. 

Just a little background. I just graduated university with a bachelor's in computer science. College was awesome. For 4 years, I was working on myself and on my skills. I wanted to write at first, so I joined a writers' club. Then I wanted to focus on my future profession, so I joined tech clubs. I liked it, so I became the head of 5 tech clubs through college.

It was great. People knew my name. I published my own app that over 4k people at my school have used. I would walk around and people knew who I was, some hated me, some admired me, some younger CS kids told me they loved my work and how I was getting our department on everybody's mouths. One person told me she was inspired by me, and that she wouldn't work for where she is if it weren't for me. 

It was straight out of a dream. But maybe that's just hindsight.

Fast forward to my current state, 4 months after graduating. I knew this would happen. I got a job at a small, local tech company that paid shit and the work was uninspiring. I wanted to do something. Or go somewhere that would lead me anywhere in the future. I applied at a Forbes 500, and got the job a little over a month ago. 

It's tearing me apart now. My team all works remotely, so I barely ever see any of them, and only a couple times met my manager because he travels a lot. My project manager is based in the States, and everyone I work with is scattered around Europe. I work the night shift to align with U.S work hours. The office I'm in is full of people from another team. I come in when everybody's gearing up to head home. I don't know anybody. Some probably pity me and say hi from time to time. The rest, I don't know. 

I'm all alone everyday. I go home and my family's asleep. I watch a movie or listen to YouTube podcasts while making my sob dinner. I'm tired so I wake up at noon, just in time to catch the bus to work. And I repeat the cycle. I yearn for the little social interaction I get, like the weekly call with the entire team. It lasts an hour but there are people's voices speaking through my headset. I actually look forward to the courteous smile I get from the one guy who bothers to say ""see you tomorrow"" on his way out of the office, when I come in. My relationship with my sister has been horrible but last night she was venting to me about her new job and I just broke out and started telling her about my entire month, when she didn't even ask for it. It felt like weeks of repressed conversation dying to get out.

I know it's only been 4 weeks and I shouldn't be complaining about being among the top 1% of my peers who went on to work for top tech firms. But I'm wondering if I even want it now. It's been my dream for 3 years, and now it's driving me insane. 

I lost my best friend because he's a dipshit and I got tired of his lies and constant bullshitting. He stayed in touch until our graduation ceremony because he needed extra tickets. Ever since then he has never called. I didn't even go to my own graduation ceremony because I wanted to be at work instead. It was my own choice. But it's depressing to think about.

I stare at the brochure they gave out at work for therapy options. It is apparently paid for and covered in full by the company. But do I really want my manager to see my name on the list of people whose therapy the company is paying for, when I've only been here a month?

I'm exploring therapy options on my own. For now I'm just going crazy and I'm on the verge of breaking down in tears writing this at my desk. I know I'll get nobody to talk to all day long. I just felt like I need somebody to listen.",07Nov2019,1
401,"I’ve been thinking about starting therapy for a while(therapy/counselling is there a difference?). But I don’t know where to go. I see a lot of therapists advertise that they specialize in either Abuse, addiction, depression, grief, family issues, or whatever they happen to specialize in. But I don’t want a specialist.

402,"I will hopefully graduate next November from university, I'm really excited to be in my final year and knowing the end is in sight.

I can barely stand going to lectures due to feeling this way, sometimes it causes me to feel so sick. My graduation is next November and I'm already starting to panic, the thought of being in a large hall, between lots and lots of people and not being able to leave whenever I want is scaring me. I have thought about just not going but I don't want to disappoint my family. Can anyone give me advice on how they got through their graduation?

403,"I'm a 24F no license, car, ability to get to a job to make money. My mom is narcissist in denial oh, they constantly smokes pot to rewrite her narcissist episodes in to happy memories. No one in my family seems to notice or think how she acts is a big problem. My mental health is constantly ignored or pushed off by her, I was drugged via pot and raped and tortured while drugged when I was 17. I bring up the fact that smelling pot causes me to have flashbacks and panic attacks, she and my brother don't care the entire house constantly smells like pot. No one else is my family would be any help, I have no friends that could help due to me essentially isolating myself due to PTSD from my rape. 

I don't know what to do and the only reason I am alive is because I am living for my 6 year old son and his father. My son's father is in a difficult home situation since his father passed and is trying to support his mother and our son and can't afford to support me either due to financial strain. I want to feel human again, does anyone have any advice that can help me?",07Nov2019,1
404,"The past few months have been horrible for me, and I've been dealing with a lot. Every week has been getting worse and worse since everything is just piling up. I'm dealing with suicidal thoughts on the daily and I really do just want to end it. It's gotten to the point where my friendships are being affected by it too. I've noticed that my friends generally don't want to be around me as much anymore. I couldn't tell whether I was being overly paranoid and if it was in my head or if people were genuinely sick of me. Until today I guess. Something happened which triggered an intervention of sorts between me and my friends. I was reminded that friends are not unconditional and that if I keep acting the way that I've been acting that they have no problem cutting me off. I've compiled a list of what they've told me (idk if that's weird lmao):

1. I act like I'm the only one with problems
2. I'm almost always in a bad mood (either anxious or upset)
3. I'm selfish
4. I can be too negative and insensitive
5. Basically I'm a negative nancy

Basically, I do want to be a better person I just literally have no clue how. It seems so easy and seamless for them to be normal and it used to be like that for me too. I'm just struggling getting out of the mindset that I'm in and I don't want to let other people around me suffer for it. Even my mom's sick of my attitude. So I guess I just need some outside advice on how to better my attitude and be more positive without feeling absolutely drained :)

Ps - Before anyone I've tried to get help but my father believes that the concept of therapy is fake and whatnot so that's not an option for me",07Nov2019,1

409,"I am a 19 year old college girl whom has learning disabilities and I been starting on my journey to get the right diagnoses    for them after years of being taken to the wrong types of doctors for my conditions. Yesterday, I took many tests in one appointment in order to prove that I still have these conditions. Before going, my mom told me to ""dumb it down"" so that it shows I do have disabilities, even though the doctor I had a consult with told me to basically act like myself and do my best. I did my best, and I think I did ""too good"" on some sections of it. I had so much pressure put on me before this test to act dumber by my mom, that I didn't. Why lie on something that I was doing alone with the testing person, and with my mom not controlling me.

Ever since I was a young, my mom puts pressure on me to do anything, especially school. So much so, I been dying to move out and into a college dorm to even get away from her. However, my mom does not believe I am ""ready"" for it, even though I proved that I been mostly independent for months now (I cannot drive due to my anxiety, but other than that I can wash my own clothes, I can do simple cooking, I been learning how to iron my clothes). I been mentioning to her that yes, I want to live on my own, and I think I can do it. 

Even when I mention how she is effecting me, she doesn't seem to care. I understand that it is in her best interest to put some pressure on me, but it has come to the point where I avoid her most days, unless I have too. Even when I told my family members how much distress she causes me, they never see how she treats me from day to day. I feel like I have to ask my mom to even do anything with my friends, even though I am 19. 

Am I a terrible person for ""messing"" with the testing? Should I get other family members, like my older brother, to help me deal with her? How should I even talk to my mom about how she's making me feel for years, even if she does not believe me?

I am at my wits end, I been depressed for years, anxious since 4th grade, and feeling useless to the world. I need the help, and my therapist has not been able to help me either.

411,"I’ll try not to make this long.
My best friend has been dating this guy for three years and I have always known they will not work long term. Anytime she messages me about him, it’s something bad. Either he’s ignoring her or he’s hiding his messages from her or accusing her of cheating, it’s always something. I told her once that I care about her too much to continuously hear about how awful her boyfriend is all the time so to stop talking to me about it. We ended up not talking for over half a year.
When we started taking again everything was fine and we were back to normal. They were still dating but she didn’t talk about him. We decided to split a ticket for me to fly up to visit her and while I was there her dog attacked her mom and bit off 1/3 of her thumb. I was staying for a week so I had no where to go and I just had to try to give my friend as much space as possible. They had to surrender the dog to the shelter they got him from and we just tried to relax the rest of the time. I ended up with ptsd from the incident and being around big dogs causing me a great amount of anxiety. Her mom has severe ptsd and takes medication when she is in public. Her boyfriend had started to build resentment towards my friend and is distancing himself from her more everyday.
My friend and I had a serious conversation not to long ago about the possibility of them breaking up and help her be prepared in case it happened. We talked about how she was going to still go to school, work, and take care of her cats, where she was going to live, the works. She ended up confessing to me that she basically wants to stay with him because he provides for her financially while she’s in school. After that I realized she’s never going to take my advice and thinks she will be ok.
Fast forward to two days ago, she told me her boyfriend almost broke up with her because he “loves her but doesn’t want to be with her if it means she’s not thriving in the relationship” which I believe the last part is total bullshit and that he’s just not being honest to spare her feelings. He also said that surrendering their dog has been extremely hard and he began resenting her and being angry at her since it happened. She keeps telling him he needs to get bloodwork done to see if he is depressed and to go to a therapist. She told her mom what he said and her mom says the same thing about him getting help and seeing a therapist. Her mom then starting talking about how everyone in the room during that attack was affected and how bad her ptsd was. My friend told me she was talking to her annoyed from her mom because her complaining about her ptsd wasn’t helping my friends situation. 
Eventually I couldn’t take it anymore and told her I believe that there is something else going on that’s he’s not telling her or not comfortable talking about with her. I then said her mom was right that everyone in that room was affected, even me. I told her how I would start crying if someone tried scaring me, how I could look at my car yawn because of his teeth, how I can’t be around my friends dogs, I can’t go to peoples houses that have big dogs. I never told her before because i wanted to give her time to heal and cope.
It has been two days now and she has not replied to my message, she has not tried messaging me, and she is tagging her boyfriend is husband memes on Facebook.
I came on here because I was honest advice. I don’t know if I should just end the friendship or let her tantrum subside. We have been friends for 8 years, we use to always be able to be honest with each other, and now it just seems she wants to talk to me for me to coddle her like her other friends do instead of being realistic.

Below is my original post

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""So an old friend from high school recently got in touch with me on Facebook. We weren't really close friends and haven't spoken since high school. We chat for a minute on fb messenger. He tells me that he is in in LA now, retired (pretty impressive if its true cause we're only 30) and is going on to focus on his music and art. He claims that a couple of entrepreneurs mentored him and his wife on how to become successful and create a passive income so they didn't have to work a typical job anymore. Now he wants to pay it forward and help artists and musicians become successful. He asked me if my husband and I would be interested in an opportunity. He never told me any specifics... It was kind of vague... Anyways... I said that of course my husband and I would consider any opportunity that comes our way to make our life better. So we set up a time to video chat. It was him and his wife and my husband and I. They claimed they wanted to get to know us better first and make sure we had the right ""mindset"" to move forward with this opportunity. (Part of me wonders if they were just seeing how gullible we were) They are sending me a book to read about networking or something, I forget the name. And they want to chat again in a week to go into further details about the ""opportunity"". I'm like 95% sure this is some form of an MLM scam, but I've never heard of anything like it. So what kind of scam is this? Anybody had a similar experience? ""

For those of you that wanted an update,   I have not yet spoken again with my ""friends""  but they sent me a book to read by Robert T Kiyosaki.   ""Rich Dad Poor Dad""   I went on Google to see what MLMs Mr Kiyosaki was connected to and lo and behold,  there was a reddit post from 3 years ago that was exactly like mine.   He titled it ""Am I being Scammed""  just like I did and went  on to describe a very similar experience.  If there was any doubt in my mind about this being a pyramid scheme, reading this reddit user's post certainly cleared  it up.  The interview and the phrases that the guy's interviewers used are almost identical to what my ""friends"" were using.

427,"I am an 18 year old boy. To make it short lets say I'm highly depressed. This a very crucial age in my life and career. But I have this one problem. Can I trust my decisions? As I said I'm 18 and I'm not really stable. How do I know if my decisions are right and not based on my hormones and stuff?
I've done somethings that I really regret and this got me thinking maybe I shouldn't make solid decisions in this period of my life.
Sorry for my bad English.",07Nov2019,1
428,"I'm a 23-year-old woman from Ohio who was raised below the U.S. federal poverty level. My dad (65) owns a record/CD store, and, of course, in the early 2000s when I was quite young, sales dropped immensely due to the digitization of music. He's owned the store for 40 years now, but for the last 15 or so,  he's barely kept his head above water. My mom (60) was a stay-at-home mom and a musician.  I have two older siblings (a 25-year-old sister and a 32-year-old brother). All three of us dropped out of high school. Our parents are great people, but my dad was a hippie and my mom was a punk, and they internalized many of those values for the rest of their lives. Our feelings came before our futures. None of us were made to go to school when we felt depressed, and we all had very trying mental health problems, so that was most of the time. When I was 17, we lost our house. My sister and brother had already moved out, but my parents and I were displaced. I had to start paying to be on my own very suddenly. 

In the meantime,  I got my GED, took the ACT,  and was the only one in the family to go to college. When I went to college, I overcompensated for my shame in dropping out as a freshman in high school. I *threw* myself into my education, whatever it took. I secured scholarships to study abroad multiple times, I became the president of multiple organizations, I was invited to special conferences, I earned honors in my department, I was inducted into several different honors societies, and I was a straight-A student who graduated Summa Cum Laude. I thought I was on top of the world. I was wrong.

I didn't understand what I was doing when I started the financial aid process at the beginning of college. I didn't have anyone in my family who'd been through the student loan process . I thought I knew what I was doing, but I didn't. I took out SO much money. I grew up around a bunch of rich kids, and my logic at the time was the same as what their parents had told me. ""It's an investment in your future. Take out whatever you need to get your education."" Never mind the fact that their parents paid for most, if not all, of their education while my family was unable to contribute. I thought they were right. Their parents looked down on my parents, and they thought that I would be the one to break the cycle of what they perceived as failure in my family. They thought I'd be able to pay it all back once I got a ""real job"".

During college, as I was taking classes full-time and working 2-3 part-time jobs, I took out a private Sallie Mae loan for some extra assistance. I got two credit cards to help with day-to-day expenses. I needed a car to get to work, so I leased a new car. At the time, my credit history was new, but really good. I thought I was doing things *right.* I'm sure y'all can see where this is going. Soon, I couldn't keep up. I started to get desperate, and after a while I was taking out payday loans in emergencies, my credit score was deteriorating, and in the midst of this, I was only just starting to understand how all of this shit worked. As my credit score got too bad to take out more loans to pay for my OTHER loans, I turned to r/borrow. Now I'm in an endless cycle of taking out loans to pay loans.

I graduated in August 2018. I optimistically used every penny I had to move to Canada on a work permit to pursue my dreams of becoming a Permanent Resident and, eventually, a Canadian citizen. I worked as a server until  I got a full-time position working as the Sponsorship Coordinator for a huge film festival in Toronto. It was a contract position from February 2019-July 2018. I worked hard, working 12-14 hour days 6 or 7 days a week throughout the two months leading up to the festival. They paid me minimum wage, and my overtime wasn't time and a half, it was my regular hourly. I took what I could get because I eventually want to work as a programmer for a major film festival. My work permit expired in July, and the laws changed around renewing work permits, so I had to go back to the US after a good year in Toronto where I felt like things were really looking up. 

Back in Ohio, I went back to serving and started teaching English as a second language online (through iTutorGroup) while I searched for something else. I was just offered another full-time contract position for another big film festival to work as their Community Outreach Coordinator from January 2020-May2020. This requires me to move over an hour away, so I started looking for a seasonal position in the area so I could move before the snow hits. It all worked out! A few weeks ago, I landed a seasonal job at a Botanical Garden in Guest Services. The job posting said the position was 40 hours a week, October 25th-January 3rd. They confirmed these details in my interview. It seemed perfect. I found roommates, I found a wonderful place, and I moved this weekend. 

Yesterday, after I finished my training, my manager at the Botanical Gardens told me I won't have another shift until November 23rd, over 2 weeks from now, and that I'll be working about 24 hours a week. She failed to explain this change to me beyond ""we probably won't need you"", but I know they hired too many seasonals and screwed us all over. I didn't misinterpret anything, because I talked to another seasonal who was misled in the same exact way. Now I don't know how I'm going to catch up on my current debts or pay next month's rent. This happens to me every time I think things are getting better. I think I'm finally on my feet, then a financial wrench is thrown my way, whether that be a sudden emergency expense, a you-need-to-leave-Canada emergency, or a job-related blow. No matter what I do, I can't get caught up, let alone ahead. My car is falling apart and the tires are bald, I can't pay to get a crown for my tooth that might fracture any day, I owe money left and right, I can't afford winter boots, a hat, or gloves... I can't do any of it. More and more every day I'm just terrified. 

The news about my job yesterday hit me really hard, and I'm in a very dark place. I feel like giving up. I'm looking at my future, seeing how I have about $50k in personal debts, most of which are delinquent, and about $40k in student debt which I am continuously deferring on. I have no hope. I'm never going to make enough money to get out of this hole. I can't go back to school to earn a degree in a higher-paying field because I can't afford to go back. I don't have anyone to help me. I spend every day I have off work trying to make an extra $10 - $60 dollars through some gig so I can either eat or get my bank account out of the negatives. I can't live like a normal 23-year-old because my life is ruled by debt. I haven't dated in 5 years, I afford to join my friends out for drinks or dinner, I can't buy cute new clothes for any events, I can't go out to support my friends' bands or art shows because of admissions prices, and I can't even go to the movies anymore, which is my passion in this life. 

On top of it, I developed fibromyalgia this year, and it's getting harder and harder to do physical side gigs that might earn me some good money, including being a server, which is where I have the most experience. I've been in the emergency room 8 times since July, I have to go to physical therapy twice a week, and I have appointments all the time (thanks to Medicaid). My physical health is deteriorating at a time when I need to be doing labor more than ever. I can't afford to be sick.

I was so stupid and clueless from the ages of 18-22 that I have robbed myself of a future. I'm a passionate person with hopes and dreams, who wants to be in a good enough place that I can help others (including my parents). I want to buy my parents a house to live in again, help them retire (because that's never going to happen at this rate),  provide financial support for homeless youth, make movies, get a master's and maybe even a Ph.D., travel, have a romantic relationship again, adopt older children who would otherwise be stuck in the foster system, take my friends out for dinner on me, host events, get birthday and holiday gifts for loved ones (especially my 2 and 3-year-old nieces) and so much more. I'm realizing none of these things are possible anymore. My life is always going to be ruled by debt, ruled by my awful credit, ruled by making the rent on time, and I don't want to live that way. The only thing keeping me around is not wanting to hurt my family. I just want to stop the constant struggle, the constant gut-wrenching cycle of believing things are getting better, then being slapped in the face with some awful news that confirms that things are, in fact, worse than ever. I've tried to be a good person and I've tried to overcome obstacles, but it seems like every attempt at upward mobility sets me 3,000 steps back. My dreams were too big and my resources were too small.

I guess I don't know what advice I'm looking for. I just hope there's someone out there who felt like things would never be okay and made it through. I don't know anyone else my age who's this screwed. Maybe someone can give me some hope back in this life.

TL;DR: I don't have one. It's just a long-ass post.",07Nov2019,1
430,"I've applied to many establishments, most leading to nothing and a few resulting in a failed interview. I've run out of places to apply to within walking distance, and I'm running low on options that require using public transportation. It doesn't help that most of the places I call ask me to apply online, so I know my resume will either never be seen by anyone or be immediately disregarded.

I'm honestly at a loss of what to do at this point. I was hoping to save up enough money to move out of my shitty apartment (and out of state, by extension), but how can I achieve that if I can't even manage to get something as simple as an entry-level job? I know I don't have any work experience or college education, nor do I have any skills to compensate for my lacking resume; so it makes sense as to why I'm having such rotten luck.

I've tried job training programs and vocational rehabilitation, yet I still managed to fuck it up somehow. Even if I did manage to get a job, the stress of a fast-paced environment or having to stand up for hours on end while tend to merciless customers/coworkers would break me not even a week into being hired. I honestly can't see how people are able to do it, and the fact that I can't get with the problem feels so disheartening.

I thought maybe I could finally get out of NEETdom and not rely soly on disabilitybux, that maybe I could contribute to society as a somewhat functioning human being. Unfortunately, I just stick out like a sore thumb and people just know something is off about me. Nobody would want to hire an unattractive, socially inept thing that can't convince employers that they are a valuable asset to their company.

434,"**my context**

Next year I'll be finishing my comp sci bsc, i'll be 25 by then and still live at home. Other than that, I have a job in IT and a good internship in the data engineering field lined up. Also I am based in europe.

**my problem**

I don't really see my endgame in this line of work, as I am kind of passionless about it. That doesn't mean I work hard,  I really do, but when I am done with a task or project I ask myself about the ""difference"" I made doing my work and cannot find any. 

While exploring options for my future I asked myself what kind of work I would like to see myself doing when I am 50. I came to the conclusion, coming from a family with members in the medical field, that I can see myself becoming a doctor. Having average grades I'd need to take a test to be admissed for medical school, so I planned to finish my studies, do my internship and after this take a couple months off to prepare for the test.

After telling my parents about this plan I got some serious objections, I thought they would be more supportive so I was kind of disappointed. They think I should built on my comp sci degree and pursue a career in my current field.

Their arguments as to why I shouldn't pursue this plan were the following:

* IT has good working conditions and the medical field has not (""long hours, very hierarchical"")
* I never showed aptitude towards becoming a doctor (""you never seemed like it is your calling! You'll only make it if it is !"")
* I'd earn the same afterwards or even less concerning the opportunity cost of not working in my current field for the time of studying.
* I won't have as a good career in the field because the young people just starting out (18 yo etc.) would mean very tough competition.
* I may have to take out a load to finance all of that, though I thought I could work as a software developer on the side to earn money

Am I being unrealistic with my plan? Should I just stick to what I already learned ?

449," Hello Folks,

I am a male (31 Year old), have been suffering from IBS from last 2 years. I visited many docs, most of them failed to find out exact causefor IBS and weight loss. I have studied my symptoms and realised that all these could be the reason of malabsorption.

Here are my body symptoms.

1. Huge weight loss - I just weigh 127 lbs and with height of 5.9 feet.
2. Muscle and bone growth has been very low.
3. Constipation
4. IBS

Now, which test I should go through to confirm malabsorption? Please share your thoughts . Thanks folks",07Nov2019,1
450,"Obligatory on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues. Also a tldr will be at the bottom.

So, I have been with a company for a few years now. I quickly was promoted a few times to now finally being an acting store manager in a location that does not have a manager.

For the past year I befriended someone from the corporate (let’s call him Frank, not real name of course) side of things, relying on him for advice and just venting to him like a few other people I had befriended in the company. We became quite close but I still considered him nothing but a friend.

Recently I was offered a store manager position by my boss’s boss (Mariah), which is 2 hours away from my current home and family. I’ve been with my partner for over half a decade and was excited for this new opportunity for myself and also for us since we planned on buying a house.

On the day after I was offered the position, Frank had told me that he was in love with me, that we should run away together, and that I was so beautiful and deserved the world. Also around this time he had begun pressuring me for nude pictures but in a not direct way through our messages (example: “send me some OTHER pictures oh and of your face too” etc etc) the picture thing I had tried to dismiss as well as I can (I can admit I should have been more direct but all I could do was go numb and shut down) 

He is married with children. Needless to say I was shocked and told him we were both in relationships. He kept trying asking if I was mad and that we needed to talk. I agreed to talk but then when it came time to it I told him to leave me alone.

I went back and forth on whether I should say something or not but eventually decided to speak up. I reached out to my boss (Kit) and he came in to see me, after discussing the situation I sent the messages of Frank confessing his love to me to Mariah.

Since coming forward, he is placed on admin leave and the head of his department reached out to me. We met up and she proceeded to read through our messages on my phone for forty five minutes, analyzing every interaction between us. I was beyond embarrassed and just left the meeting feeling.. violated. What I considered platonic messages between a friend were now being questioned on everything. It was horrific after losing a trusted friend and then feeling as if I was being further subjected mental torture.

And now I’m being told I need to screenshot Frank and I’s conversation and send all messages to a couple of the higher ups in the company. There is no pending lawsuit at this time and Frank is still with the company, the company is unsure whether to fire him or not. I’m not sure if I even want to take my promotion at this point since I feel like my company is only looking out for themselves.

This has been such an eye opening experience and I have never felt so judged and criticized and disgusted by so many different people. The shame I feel is immense and am questioning on if I should have even came forward.

Basically I’m unsure if I’m justified in this situation for not wanting to send our messages to a bunch of the higher ups while also being promoted at the same time. I can’t shake the feeling that they will forever judge me for this incident. And say he doesn’t get fired, what then? I moved my life for what?

There is some details that were left out based on the fact that I’m exhausted but need to pour this out to someone, so I’m not as detailed as I can be but feel free to ask questions and I’ll answer whatever I can and edit/update when needed!

If any of you have any advice or insight into what I should would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.

TLDR: Corporate guy confesses love to me and pressured me for nudes at the same time I get a job promotion that involves me relocating. Company has not fired him even after reading all the messages and having some on file and is unsure if they will fire him. Now they are pressuring me to sell my small amount of dignity left to them by sending them all of me and corporate guy’s messages",07Nov2019,1

I was lucky to land a temporary job as an assistant for the editing team of a TV show pilot, and had lots of fun doing that, and also landed two other runner jobs on separate projects.

I've been looking for freelance editing jobs as well as runner positions to try and get started but there's not much happening where I live (Northern Ireland) and I'm beginning to give up. I'm in no position to even move across to England to look because it'd be too expensive, plus I feel like it'd be stupid to move over to an expensive country for an entry-level position.

On top of this my dad tells me to keep looking and although he means well, it just adds more stress on to me and makes me less interested in actually trying to land a job. In fact it makes me want to stop looking altogether, because I feel like I'd only be doing it because he's telling me to.

454,"I haven't been taking care of myself lately.

 School has been killing me and I commute and I don't have any days off between school and work. Today is my 11 hour day, where I wake up at 6:30, travel to the next state over to my school, then have consecutive classes until 5pm, then commute back home in a panic because parking is extremely limited where I live and fills up at around 6pm. I haven't been eating properly and I don't sleep much and I rarely do anything for myself. Last night I was particularly dreading today, as I usually do, but my roommate made a really nice soup dinner and mostly everyone was drinking some sort of alcoholic beverage. I had two strong screwdrivers and two glasses of wine. I got extremely drunk very quickly, because all I had in me was that fucking soup. And when I get drunk, I just want to feel more drunker. This is a horrible habit I have when I drink, where I try to sneak in more shots however I can. I know I always do this whenever I'm at a party or have accessible alcohol in my home. I remember when I was getting water downstairs and all my roommates went upstairs to bed, I snuck in roughly a shot and a half into me from a bottle of rum sitting on our kitchen table. It's a really bad habit I get into whenever I get drunk and I want to stop doing that. 

Anyways, my main issue is when I went upstairs into my room. I live with my boyfriend and three other roommates. Last night I remember being extremely frisky with my boyfriend who was also really drunk. But I woke up at 4am naked in our bed and I was so confused. My boyfriend had to tell me we had sex and I got really worried because I didn't remember it at all. All I remember is I know I initiated it. I can remember small chunks of what we did, but I don't remember him finishing or me passing out afterwards. I'm feeling really weird about the whole situation. He feels really bad about it but he was drunk too, and I don't blame him at all. 

Why am I so anxious if the sex we had was consensual? I feel so confused and I want to talk about it with my boyfriend, but don't really know what to say. I want to say sorry, because I know I freaked him out when I woke up at 4am.",07Nov2019,1

The only ones i was like Meh these are ok (other then the ones she vetoed cause ""they are not names"") are Jaxson and Luca. I want one of them because then at least the whole inital set will stay the same (she did concur to having the middle name the same). The other is her initial.

Who was in the same kinds of classes in school, who my high school friend was friends with in college. Though I had that one good friend in each of the groups that introduced me, in a couple instances I either just didn’t have anything in common with those people, I grew out of those friendships, or they honestly felt more like acquaintances. There are instances where our friend circle was made of bullies or just not the right fit, so we moved on. They’re friendships that my friend has left as well. 

The last couple of years I had a job where a lot of great people worked that I had a lot in common with. We spent a lot of time together and grew close because of that. But I ended up leaving that job. Since then, I’ve tried to reach out but they’ve moved on to other jobs too and most of them work 2-3 jobs, meaning we both have little availability in common. When we do make plans, someone usually gets called into work or cancels last minute. I’ve tried to reach out by offering to bring someone out to coffee when they’re feeling down or trying to be engaging in conversation, but it kind of feels like it’s fizzling out. 

I love meeting my best friend’s friends and some of them are really cool people, but I’m not at a stage where I know any of them more than the occasional run in.

I’m finding it hard to make friends as an adult, but I also think maybe I’ve always been crappy at making friends.

464,"My story is a long one and a complicated one. After I graduated from college, I could not find a job and had to move back home and was unemployed for 10 months (despite the fact I had excellent internships and graduated first in my major). I was really sad during this time. I finally landed a job based on pure networking and luck that allowed me to move from a small town in the rust belt (where I was from) to Houston, Texas. It was my dream to live in a big city and I finally got it. The job was supposed to be an incredible sales opportunity, but our program and business quickly fell apart. Despite the job sucking, I made a lot of great friends and had the time of my life living downtown in the city. I started to look for a new job after about a year and a half and had no success, until I was able to actually be promoted within the company and had the chance to move to San Francisco (my dream city to live in and where I already had friends) I was so excited and was planning on it until they could not pay me the full amount because of an HR rule. I couldn't afford to live out there on what they were going to pay me. I had a mental break down and was so afraid of what would happen since I was already leaving my apartment and I had no money (we didn't make what we were told we would) or car (company provided my car and I was going to lose it since I could not stay in Houston). Because I froze, I almost got in trouble with the company (it did ruin my reputation a bit), but because of a connection I had within, they gave me the option to instead go to small beach town in Florida with the same pay (so much better once you adjust the COL), and I took it right away without thinking about it.

Now I am completely miserable because I shortly figured out the opportunities were not equal and I hate living in Florida. Not to sound spoiled, but I gave up somewhere I wanted to live for a ""better job"" and I realized it cost me everything. Friends, a social life, living in a big city, and most importantly my mental health. To make matters worse my parents are on the verge of cutting me off because they really wanted me to take the position in Florida and I am extremely depressed being here. I already am stuck in a lease and if I leave before a year I have to pay back relocation, and I have almost no money. I'm super depressed and miserable. I can barely function at work. I've hit rock bottom. I don't know how to get out both from an actual moving out and getting a new job perspective to a mental health perspective. All I can think about is how I should have stayed in Texas or pursued my dream on the west coast. But instead I feel like I threw it all away because all I am reminded of is my failure and knowing the I made the wrong decision.",07Nov2019,1

1.  I can roll with 4 while there are 5 bridesmaids. This option probably isn't ideal but it'll happen if I don't do anything.

It's unfortunate because I know he was upset I didn't ask him, but when you only ask 5 people, someone will unfortunately be left out. I'd have to word it nicely, and a good friend of his is a bridesmaid so it would work out, but I feel it could be awkward. 

3. I can ask my high school friend. He doesn't know that any of this has gone down so I could probably ask, and he wouldn't know he was second option, but he might figure it out.

I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it’s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always states at me and I assume it because I’m ugly. and girls who stare me down because I’m tall and slim it happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho. it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I wake up with suicidal thoughts crying. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years I worked in a bar and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",07Nov2019,1
480,"Douse anybody know?

I was wondering a few things the first few were about my speaker system I have a DENON AVR-1708 surround receiver and a different Bluetooth speaker, it has its own volume control, runs of its own power supply and has the speaker cable jacks to connect it to a second speaker. Would there be a way to connect it to my surround system so I could Bluetooth my phone and maybe use the speaker still.

Also is there a way to connect loads of systems as 1 like they do in one of the step-up moves, so I can have an insane system with a bunch of random speakers I have. As well as the possibility of extending it I also would love to have a few base speakers. Anything helps.

481,"Hi all ,

I am not sure how to start this but I will give a shot .. so long history short : I am 28 , having wasted the last 6 years in the process of trying to go to college which i am finishing next year .  I am extremely confused regarding my future as regards what to do: I feel i have not found something that i am really passionate about it professionally speaking over the last years despite having spent so much time in introspection.. 

I realize I have a certain lifestyle in mind that has a expensive price-tag however the idea of following a career just for an instrumental value does not seem right to me..   How should i proceed? I am extremely confused..  ;(  In one hand I am aware of how much money i need to make in order to have this quality of life  however i just cant picture myself living a fragmentary life just for a paycheck.

Any thoughts? Thanks so much",07Nov2019,1
483,"Okay Reddit, I really need some advice on this one. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. He was in a 6 year relationship and I was single for 6 years, so we both come from different dating backgrounds. 

SO the other night, we are watching a game on TV, my head was near his lap, I started to rub on his crotch and I could feel his dick getting hard. I started to undo his pants and then proceeded to pull out his dick from his briefs. I'm thinking things are gonna get pretty steamy so In the midst of doing that, his dick practically jumps out at me once I get it through the brief hole ( sorry I don't know what else to call the hole where guys pull their junk out to pee while wearing briefs ) I laughed because I thought it was funny, it almost hit me in the face. 

IMMEDIATELY he gets turned off and doesn't want to have sex anymore. He then said something along the lines ""this isn't the first time you've done this"" Hes referring to times I called him ""little"" in comparison to his body, hes like 5'3 and like 140lbs,  I'm a bigger girl than him like 5'3 but around 180, I mean my boyfriend is small, hes petite but his junk is not whatsoever. I tried explaining it to him about why I was laughing but, he wasnt having it. 

I leave because we had planned on spending the night at my house and right off the back hes cold, distant, doesn't kiss me, hug me, or anything like normal at my house. He wakes up at 5am and leaves for work. He doesnt text me at all until I reached out to him and his response is like 3 words when I asked how his day was. He just ignored me the rest of the day and night. So this morning I text him ""yo! You mad at me or something or was Tuesday night and yesterday something I made up?"" 

His response:
""Things changed  when you laughed at me and I havnt felt the same since tuesday ""
 My response:
""WHY WONT YOU ACCEPT I WASNT LAUGHING AT YOU?!""
""What doesnt feel the same? Ask yourself is it your insecurity or is it really me? ""
""I fucking love you. I love everything about you.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!""

His response:
""Idk what it is dude. I think about all the dudes you've been with and how I dont match up. And I think about if you're even attracted to me. Idk man it just feels very weird.""

I then proceeded to write what felt like a novel, trying to rectify the situation.

WHAT DO I DO?! hes been ignoring me now. 

Edit: I laughed at my boyfriends penis because it jumped out at my face while taking it out of his briefs and almost hit me in the face, he took it as me laughing at him and now he says he doesnt feel the same. What do I do?",07Nov2019,1
484,"Hi, I'm just a kid who wants to help his dad.

My dad derives great satisfaction from his job and is a capable worker, receiving commendations for the quality of his work. However, recently there has been a new team lead who joined the company. This guy is transferring in his people from his previous company and in doing so is transferring out current team members to useless jobs with no opportunities. Now my dad is one of these people whose job is being threatened here. 

According to dad, management is not making clear if new guy is my Dad's boss boss, so Dad's boss cannot do anything for now.

Usually, my dad is a pretty happy guy, but because of this issue, he is extremely worried and exhibiting signs of depression :(  If anyone could give any advice that would be great. I really want my dad to go back to his normal happy self. Thanks Reddit.

488,"Not sure this is the best place for this question but I’m desperate. 

I had a friend move to another country last week and I was asked to take care of their dog. It was sudden so a lot of the details got pushed aside. It was my understanding that at some point they would be back for the dog. They paid a lot of money for her, she’s a purebred. 

But it’s been a little over a week since he’s moved and I haven’t heard from him. I’ve tried to contact them a few times for general questions about the dog and to also send pictures of the various hikes we’ve been on. 

Needless to say the lack of communication has me worried. It’s easy to chalk it all up to the fact that it was a cross country move, but it was very sudden. Talking in a matter of a month or two. I understand that it’s doable but it seems like a lot more planning would be put into moving to another non-English speaking country. 

This brings me back to the dog. It’s not trained at all! Almost a year old and not house broken. Shows signs of pretty intense abandonment issues. I can’t even take a shit without it in the room with me. 

I was given all of the dogs paper work. My dog and this new addition do not get along very well so keeping it long term probably isn’t the best idea. I’ve been working on training it, I’m not horrible. I know I’m rambling but the more I think about this entire situation the more it makes no sense. 

Why drop off a $4,000 animal and then just seemingly disappear. My question for you guys is should I be worried about my friend not contacting me? And if so what is the appropriate window of time before I can find this dog a carrying home that is better equip to handle its needs?",07Nov2019,1
489,"Hey guys, sorry if this is petty, I'm just overthinking a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a VERY basic technique I use in a lot of my screenplays and films, which is a blackout screen with a swell or introduction of voiceover audio. It's a personal favorite of mine and I utilize it pretty frequently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in a film crew of about 3 people (it's undergrad, so very informal). For our last project, my teammate saw my use of the blackout screen in my edit, and they really liked it. They said they'd never thought to use it, and asked if they could use the technique in their edit. I said it was fine **(since it's a basic technique, so I can't really claim it)**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in this new project, I planned to use the blackout for a promo: a deep-voice over would sound over a blackout screen, and BAM: promo starts. Rock music, sweeping pans, and then cut to the testimonials. The whole nine. Except...

&amp;#x200B;

My teammate asked me to look at their edit two days ago, and they did that exact thing. Like *exactly* what I wanted to do. Which is fair enough, since it's the best way to start the promo, and it's a basic and really effective technique. It perfectly utilized my favorite technique to capture the viewer's attention and generate high engagement. They finished the edit of the opening sequence first, and then showed me. I had only spliced the audio bits together, so there was no semblance of what I wanted to do there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so disappointed. I feel like I have to do something different, as I'm afraid I'll be accused of copying, since he showed me his finished edit before I'd even started mine. I've been brainstorming other openings, but I sort of have that overwhelming disappointment that makes you feel like nothing you could come up with now could top what's been done.    I guess I'd just like advice on what my options are: doing the original promo idea I had, even if it's nearly exactly the same as my teammate, some suggestions for other openings, or just general advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any help. Thanks a bunch.",07Nov2019,1
490,"For a while, I've been friendly with a boy in a grade lower than mine, as he is frequently bullied by his classmates. (For reference, I'm a high school sophomore and he is a freshman)

He is the ""little"" brother (little in quotations, as he is extremely tall) of one of my 'close' friends who tends to lie a lot. The whole family is a bit . . . off.

That's not the point.

I absolutely despise bullying. I can't handle it. So I became friends with him.

I'm scared he thinks my friendliness is something more than it really is. At first, I was open to his behavior since I'm a very compassionate and open person, but it got really weird, really fast.

Here's the thing. I have anxiety and paranoia. I don't like men violating my personal space, especially really tall men or men who don't know boundaries.

The boy is both of those.

This morning, I was on one of the Macs in my Photography class, scrolling through Pinterest. He was behind me, and when I turned around to get up and grab a camera for the day's project, he was so close that our legs touched.

Not brushed together. Not knee-to-knee. The full length of his thigh was pressed against the full length of my thigh.

Of course, I'm an awkward teenage girl, so I just kind of . . . stared at our legs with disgusted surprise. Keep in mind, I wasn't disgusted that it was him, just that he had been so uncomfortably close without considering how I'd feel.

I asked him to move, and he moved his leg about three inches. 

Later on, we were in the wrestling room to take some slow shutter shots (which require a lot of darkness) and the room is relatively large, with lots of room for a scrawny teenage boy and a group of two teenage girls.

Yet the boy decided to stand behind me.

Not a ways behind me, mind you. About a half-foot behind me. Sometimes my elbow would brush against his back.

The thing is, this kid doesn't have many friends, and I don't want to hurt him by getting uncomfortable.

What do I do?",07Nov2019,1

Heres some things you need to know

My father likes to go to the casino alot, he thinks its fun but in that way we lose a lot of money, like literally in debt, or barely paying bills, it came to the time that my mom took away my saved up money (From allowances and christmas gifts etc) cause we ran out of money, BUT my dad is a well paid man, hes a Ship Captain, we shouldn't be having these kinds of debts, I always talked to my mom about it on how we could stop his addiction in gambling, and all she told me I should just let him be, cause thats where he is happy, we get to sleep and eat and thats enough, but I see my mom falling into hard times even when my dad is overseas, she even works alot herself just so we could pay our bills, when in reality we dont have to suffer this much, and I just feel lost, like why are we accepting this? When you mention his gambling to him he gets so angry, my mom even ranted to me once, about how shes so angry about him always going to the casino, how we lose so much money, it's like I saw her true side that day, but even after she ranted to me, she told me not to tell my father and just let it be..  I have also confronted my father about this but we end up fighting and him screaming... 

&amp;#x200B;

My siblings also agree with me, they're very angry but they get the same treatment my mom does to me, but they are already adults now and can live for themselves so they dont mind it anymore 

Now my dad told me if I have a laptop he could borrow for his work (he is a maritime teacher when hes not overseas) for the next week (we dont have a laptop but he knows I have a lot of friends I could source from)  so I was able to get a laptop for him... but when I said I was able to get a laptop I told him... ""Okay I'll let you borrow it.. but don't go to the casino anymore please..."" then he looked at me in awe, like a ""What the fuck im so angry at youface"" for like 5 seconds then all my mom said to him, ""Don't mind him anymore"" and here I am crying in my room not knowing what to do... Do we always have to be like this? my father was able to find success in his life as a ship captain but he's just putting it all down with his gambling, he has no savings no properties no nothing else but his job, .... It just makes me so sad... like this situation, where we SHOULD be able to afford our own laptop for him to use but we have to borrow... can someone please help me? I don't know what to do... this has been bothering me so much everyday of my life, but it all stays the same and im always in the wrong for talking to him about it.. 

Please reddit, I know I am young and naive, but please help me learn..

492,"Hello reddit, 

I have moved countries and I am finding it difficult in this new country because of the language barrier, some of the kids who are being pricks and not having proper housing for a few months however this girl made my life here so much bearable unlike everyone, she has my sense of humour (offensive and dark) and we hang out at lunchtimes with a couple other mates but I just recently found out that she may look happy in school but something tells me that when she gets home that’s a different story.

I noticed that she had marks on her arm from self arm the other week and had also noticed that everyday on her story she post random numbers which turns out that it’s a countdown, she told me today that she is gonna end herself peacefully within 50 days (as the countdown says) and honestly I don’t fucking get it, it annoys me how chilled out she is about it and how she acts like nothing is happening.

It turns out that her parents are very strict and keeps having arguments with her and are forcing her to become a doctor even though she wants to be an artist but her parents thinks she is stupid for wanting to do art and keeps pressuring her for good grades.

I have no idea what to do and I feel that if she dies I’m gonna regret not doing anything, I tell her that she hasn’t experienced life as it is yet (we are 16) and how that she has a whole life ahead to live for and how that we do not know what will happen in the afterlife therefore we should enjoy life as it is now. But she doesn’t listen and still sticks to her countdown even though she has a brother and a boyfriend in a different country rn.

What can I do?

Thanks

494,"I'm M/21 and there's this very good friend of mine F/21. We haven't been friends for a long time maybe like 8 months but we got really close to the point where our friends thought we were dating like we would go together for movies, lunch and pretty much every other outdoor activities.
So eventually after sometime she started liking me, like romantically. She did tell me about how she felt. I liked her too but I was not really sure about my feelings. A little background about me, I'm really afraid of being in a relationship and have never been in one and always been trying to avoid relationships whenever possible, even with this situation, I was not trying to get into a relationship with her. So anyway even though I knew she liked me and I kinda liked her too I ignored her hints and did not say or do anything because I knew how I am with relationships and did not wanted to risk my friendship with her incase things go wrong.
After this we gratuated and got into different colleges, same city though and we still used to talk just like before the only difference being instead of meeting every day we started meeting like 3 times a week. So sometime passed and then I don't know what happened but she suddenly stopped replying to me or stopped meeting. Not completely but like maybe once in two weeks we used to meet. This was the time I realized that I really do like her and cannot go about normally if I don't talk to her or spend time with her and that I was just being stupid all this time and maybe I even love her. I realized I missed her very much and crave her company and just  talking to her like anytime something used to happen in my life no matter good or bad my first thought would be that I need to tell her this and imagine how she would react because there was a time we knew everything about what happened in our day right from the time we woke up to what we ate and when we got home all that stuff. I realized that I never felt this way about anyone else before and I thought that maybe I can make a relationship work with her.
So I decided that I should at least give it a shot and ask her out now. This was around 2 months after she told me how she felt about me. So I met her few days back and told her let's go for lunch. I did not ask her out then I wanted to do this at lunch so I got us a reservation for this saturday at this restaurant where we wanted to go for a long time but was kinda expensive for us as we we're not working full time and still studying and I decided that I would ask her then. I worked overtime the last week to gather some extra cash for it. 
But at our last meeting she told me that she's been going out with a guy for around a month maybe and it's not really serious yet but she seemed happy with the way things were going, I could tell by the way she was talking. I thought of asking why she did not tell me earlier but I kinda knew why so I did not. This is when I understood why our talking and meeting decreased over the past month and I'm not really mad about it or anything I can totally understand this behavior. I mean she's not wrong at all if she's giving time to someone who wants the same things as her and I can't expect her to wait for me until I come to my senses. We're still going to lunch this Saturday but I won't tell her about how I feel for her. I really want to tell her about my feelings but I won't tell her now that I know about this because I don't want to complicate her life and she seemed happy and I genuinely want her to be happy. I just... Like I feel extremely stupid for not realizing it before and I'm kinda pissed at myself now because I feel like I lost something which could have completely changed my life. I feel like I'm gonna regret this way too much and like I don't know how to describe how I feel exactly. I'm really happy for her but at the same time I feel weird about this situation. I would really appreciate any advice that could help me past this situation.",07Nov2019,1
495,"tldr: Didn't think I had any more thoughts about my ex, but now I am having dreams about my ex-boyfriend that is getting married soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I (24f) was with someone for about 3 years until we broke up about 2 years ago. It wasn't really a great relationship as we started off as FWB until we realized we should just be together. I had a crush on him for probably a year before we started officially dating, but knew the boundaries. Once we started dating I really fell for him. 

Unfortunately, we were both in pretty bad times of our lives and didn't treat each other like we should have. I was young and naive and believed people could change. Things wouldn't change though. After 3 years of living a life I didn't feel like I belonged in (drugs, lots of alcohol, bad choices, etc), my parents finally encouraged me to leave. 

This is where my regret has always been in the back of my mind. I didn't give him any warning. I took an opportunity and went with it. He left for the weekend and I started packing my things. By the time he came back I had gotten most of my things out of our apartment and went to live with my parents.

I still had feelings for him, but I knew it would be better for both of us if I left. 

Now two years later my best friend sent me a message with a screenshot of her Facebook (I don't have FB) showing a post of him announcing his engagement to this new woman. I am actually very happy for him! I'm glad that we both changed for the better after the breakup. 

Now for the last 3 days, I have been having these heart-wrenching dreams about our relationship. I was totally fine before I saw this picture, but now it's like all my memories have came flooding back. I wake up every morning feeling so bad. But there isn't anything I can do to change it. 

I really need advice on how to come to terms with these feelings. It's making it really difficult to focus on school. I'd really appreciate hearing people who have been in similar situations or tips on how to get over it.

496,"I’ll [19] try to explain the story as unbiased as possible. I want to ask if I should forgive my dad and my sister?

When I was younger like 12-13 my parents divorced and it was like a world war. I became depressed and didn’t communicate with people in my house at all. I couldn’t do things I would normally do, because of it. It sucked a lot and my dad wasn’t having any of it. He told me I’m just lazy. Well one day it escalated. I completely ignored everything what my dad said and got annoyed from them asking me things so I just said get lost. 
It caused me to become homeless for a short while. I was 15 at this point. I’ve lived for 6 months with my uncle. After 6 months I returned. Everything was set aside and my dad couldn’t remember kicking me out of the house. In his head I walked away. 

I wanted to have a good relationship with both of my parents so one week I was at my dad’s place and the other at my mom’s place. Good idea I thought, but both parties hate each other and talk crap about each other. I’m still a kid and very influenceable. I started to dislike my mom when I was with my dad and vise versa with when I was with my mom. My mom stopped doing this, since she wanted a new life and she became much more positive. I always have had a stronger bond with my mom (because my mom did everything for the children while my dad was gone) so and her being such a positive figure made me more leaning towards my mom, however my depression was still not gone. 

One day I was at my dad’s home in the bathroom. I take my sweet time and I always ask if someone needs it. Everyone said yeah sure use it. 5.5 minutes into the bathroom my sister started to bang on the door telling me to hurry up. I know this is exactly 5.5 minutes, because I was shaving and I always put a video on the background, which was 5.5 minutes in. I got annoyed so I told her to fuck off. She became mad and my dad said that I shouldn’t have said that. I found this unfair and called him a sperm donor and that I was planning to change my last name, because in my opinion, I should have the name of the person who brought me up. 

3 months later my dad got a letter stating that I did in fact change my name. He texted me with “how could you do this to me” and my sister started cursing me out like how shady I am that she didn’t know I would do it. She called up everyone in my family telling how bad of a person my mother is (I changed my name, but they blame my mom for it)

Well we are 3 months down the line again. I was thinking about just forgiving them. I know my dad and sister want to talk to me, but I made myself to be completely untraceable. 

Should I just text them here’s my number, want to talk it out so we can let everything behind? I want a normal life with normal parents. I want a normal dad and a normal sister. I don’t want tensions or drama. I just want to go on vacations with my parents like normal people. 
Also this goes a bit against my morals, but I’m independent now and life is kinda hard. I need financial help to life a comfortable life and my dad has it pretty good. I want to study, since I don’t want to waste my degree. 

Should I forgive them? And should I work on getting a stronger bond? Should I let them in my life or should I keep distance?",07Nov2019,1

A dog is a huge commitment pretty much like having another kid. I've gotten to be known to our friends as the fun dog uncle. Comes visits, rough houses with the dog, plays etc... then gets to go home. I'm kinda OK with that, all the fun none of the commitment. Since we are all gone during the day i would worry about the dog feeling left alone and maybe acting out. I already know that I'll get attached and i don't want to go through what i did with the rabbit. My youngest really is insistent on the dog, so much that when i had said that i was at least open to the idea and not just saying no she started crying saying I'm just happy that it's not a no now. So i don't know i mean on one hand i think a dog would be cool i would love him/her, would have a good life with us but on the other man it's a commitment that we just didn't have to think about before.",07Nov2019,1
501,"I’m really not sure how to word this or where to start so I apologize if this comes out a rambling mess. I have severe anxiety and insecurity, especially when it comes to my relationship. My boyfriend and I have moved quickly since the beginning of our relationship, saying I love you within two months, and though we’ve only been together for about six months, we were planning to move in together around Christmas. 

I’ve been pushing for us to move in together for a couple months now as we live about 45 minutes apart and I hate that we only get to see each other a couple times a week. When I first mentioned the idea, he has all on board and we started house hunting. About a month ago, we decided that he would move in to my place. It’s a little small but the rent is very cheap and it’s a nice place. 

Fast forward to about two weeks ago and I had a little freak out about whether we were moving too fast and our long term compatibility re: kids and political beliefs. However, we talked it through and decided we can live with the different political beliefs and decide the kids issue later in our lives (we’re both on the fence and have about 5-10 years before we have to decide). I felt much better after our talk but I guess this really freaked him out.

Due to my insecurity, I’ve been constantly asking him for the past month if he’s absolutely sure he wants to move in with me. It was getting to the point that I felt like I was going to push him away with my anxiety but something just didn’t feel right. He didn’t tell any of his friends or family until last week (I told my friends and family 3 months ago) and I was always the one to bring it up or plan stuff. 

Then last night. He tells me he doesn’t want to move in together right now, it’s not a good time. I felt like I was punched in the chest. He just started a new job (his first real one after being in school for 8 years) and he’s trying to figure out a new routine and balance work, exercise, his hobbies, seeing his friends, and me. He thinks moving would be too difficult/too big of a change right now while he’s getting settled and he doesn’t want to add a 45 minute each way commute. 

I just feel devastated. I feel like it’s my fault, I pushed too hard too fast, I scared him with my freak out a couple weeks ago. But I’m also really upset with the way he handled it. I always asked him if he was sure over text and he would say yes because he wanted to tell me in person but it just “wasn’t ever a good time”. I felt like a crazy person because no matter how much he would reassure me that yes, he did want to move in with me, I just felt like he didn’t, like he felt like I was forcing him.

I think the shittiest thing is that, when he told me, I said “I knew it”, and he said “ya, you’re a smart girl.” It just...I don’t know...felt flippant but also like he was confirming all my anxieties? Like every terrible thought my insecurities have conjured up the last few months about how he doesn’t actually love me or I’m not good enough is right. I felt like he lied to me, like he led me on, and now I won’t be able to trust what he says. 

If you made it to the end, thank you for taking the time to read that. I guess I’m looking for advice about moving on and putting this behind me? We have plans this weekend and I don’t want to disappoint him by not going or being sad most of the time. I’d also love advice on quieting my insecurities. They’ve flared up pretty bad since last night. I guess just hearing someone else tell me that just because he’s not ready to move in right now doesn’t mean he won’t be later and advice on how to trust him/believe him when he gives me reassurances going forward.",07Nov2019,1
502,"First time on Reddit, 18M. Recently I just dropped out of college because of crippling anxiety to the point where I couldn’t make my classes and I just wanted to lay in bed. Never had anxiety issues until first day of college. Whilst at college I was prescribed Zoloft and Effexor both of which didn’t really do much for me. Now I am living at my dads and taking Prozac and Lorazepam. Been noticing some adverse side effects and I dont really want to continue taking them however I know I have no choice. don’t know if at this point I have a permanent anxiety issue or if this is a short term rebound from college.

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.

505,"Heyy, I don’t know what to choose and would be grateful for any advice. (Haha I hope you can understand it, it’s quite complicated)

So I have 1.5 years left of school. Next year I’ll have the Matura (final exams in Switzerland, which I have to pass to get to university). 
Now I have to choose two major subjects, where I’ll have a big exam next year. The other ones I’ll finish this school year and the grade of this year will count.
I can choose one between physics (I’ll definitely won’t choose that), biology(is a loooot to learning and more or less interesting) and chemistry (my best subject) and one between history(which is really interesting and important) and geography (also very interesting).  
Furthermore we can choose one additional subject (but there we don’t have a big final exam).

I actually wanted to choose chemistry and history, but right now I have a really good grade in chemistry (5.7, 1 is the worst and 6 the best and I probably could get a 6). And if I finish chemistry this school year I would have a good grade for sure.

1)So Im thinking of choosing biology and history as my main subject and chemistry as the additional subject. Those subjects would be a really good preparation for studying medicine at university.I don’t know if I want to study medicine but I kinda want to keep the option open.

2)But I also think of choosing biology and geography as my main subject and history as the additional one. I even find this option a little bit more interesting than the first one.

3) As an additional subject I could also choose art, which I really like and would probably be the easiest option. However, it probably won’t help that much in future. 

So I really can’t decide between those options. I’d really be very thankful for any input and advice:))",07Nov2019,1

I'm super busy at work, I take classes twice a week and I have tons of work for that, my room is an absolute mess and I think that's one of the biggest stressors for me right now, but I just can't find the time to do it all. I enjoy reading and relaxing and playing video games and I can't remember the last time I was able to do that without feeling like I should be doing something else or just falling asleep. Half the time I come home from work or class I just fall asleep. Even when I clean off my desk and try to do work at my desk I end up falling asleep. I know it should be as easy as ""just don't fall asleep"" but I feel like I can't help it, in those moments I feel myself falling asleep literally nothing feels more important than just letting myself sleep. I haven't cooked myself a real meal in probably a month, I don't usually have the energy. Sometimes I throw some stuff in the crockpot but usually I just eat toast or ramen or I just don't eat dinner. I've also realized that I procrastinate on things I am anxious about. Although I can't tell if I'm anxious or if I'm just lazy.

I don't really know what my real question is, but how do I motivate myself to get it all done? When you find yourself faced with what seems like enormous tasks, how do you break it down and get stuff done?

509,"I have been living in a nightmare since Monday morning. Ok maybe that's a bit dramatic. If anyone has ever dealt with cockroaches, any advice, or just support so I don't feel like I'm spiraling all alone in this creepy crawly horror movie, would be much appreciated! Here's the story:

Monday morning I was writing out a check for my daughter's daycare before my husband and I went off to work. I noticed there were only a few checks left in the book and I couldn't remember if we had more or if I needed to order some. I set off on the journey of digging through the junk drawer in our kitchen where I toss extra check books. I wasn't seeing any, but I kept digging to the back of the drawer anyways. Oooh something just scurried away. I yanked my hand out and said ""I think that was a cockroach"" My husband said ""Whaat?"" and we kept digging together. It cornered itself in the drawer, but my husband was already running late and needed to scoot. He left for work and I declared war on this little hellion. I scooped it up in a sandwich baggy and held it in front of me while I scoured Google. Yep, it's a cockroach. Then I smashed it with a hammer. And then I took a deep dive into what to do if you have cockroaches, and my skin has been crawling ever since. I was hoping with all my might that there was only the one, and that it came in on a pile of mail that got tossed in that drawer-I sometimes toss coupon ads and other stuff in there. That day I emptied all of our drawers and cabinets and scrubbed them clean. I bought bait traps and set them all over the kitchen. That night my husband had another creepy crawly encounter when he lifted a bowl off of the counter and one scurried out. We smushed it. THEN, this is the good one, after a restless night and endless nightmares about being covered in cockroaches, I was sleepily preparing a cup of coffee in our Keurig machine when one dropped out of the machine. Nope nope nope no thank you. We live in a townhouse, and are the middle unit in a building of 3. I got in touch with our landlord and she arranged to send over an exterminator. Since we didn't take pictures of the turd nugget bugs or keep any of them, I got the sense that nobody believed me when I said they were cockroaches. It had been a full 24 hours since we saw a bug and the exterminator poked around our kitchen yesterday and said he couldn't see any signs of an infestation. I was so relieved I finally felt comfortable in our kitchen again! Fast forward to 7 PM last night. I was standing in the kitchen, all the lights on, had just finished washing the dinner dishes and one crawled up from between the oven and counter top. No! I grabbed a jar and trapped the demon and there he has stayed (and is still alive!) until this morning. I sent a picture to the exterminator and he called saying ""soo...that looks like a cockroach."" Yep, uh huh, that's what I was saying. See, I'm NOT crazy! He seems really unsure of what to do and I'm worried. He said he'll stop by later today but he's reluctant to use chemicals in our home. I'm all on board with that but also my number one priority is making sure we aren't swimming in cockroaches. Also we don't own this building and I'm pretty sure the landlord wants the bugs out, stat. We also had glue traps and roach motels out all night and didn't catch a thing. What are the chances that there really aren't a ton? Or is the infestation so bad and that's why we're all of a sudden seeing them out and about? My approach would be take a flame thrower to the kitchen but our landlord might not appreciate that.

510,"Throwaway account here. 

This entire thing might be weird, but please bear with me. If it helps to know, I'm Indian and in my community, people are big into astrology. 

When I was about 18, my uncle found out about this astrologer whose predictions (?) came out to be 100 percent correct. It's not like predictions but more interpretations - apparently, each person's fate is printed onto these leaflets and the shrine/place he went to had thousands of these. What you do is that you submit a thumb impression, the astrologers there match it to the leaflet and they tell you your fate - rather they advice you on your fate. My mom wanted to know more and she made several trips to get information on all of our 'fates. ' 

Between the years 18-22/23 were a terrible, awful time for me and that made them visit the guy more often for advice and prediction. I absolutely refused to resort to those means because I felt that our choices defined us and this would be taking it away from us - like why would I want to break up with someone I loved if this man predicted that it won't turn out well (I was forced out of it, so that's a story for another day). What I mean is that it was pure hell with him telling me things as they should be and me wanting to rebel and live and the agony of things not turning out the way I wanted to anyway. I was very near suicidal because of this.

I guess over the years, out of resignation, I decided to just follow what he says anyway. He said good things are in store for me - the worst is over - so I thought ok, things will look up. It's been a few years and although I'm alive and healthy, I feel dead inside. Because nothing's been happening. I don't have a job (despite him saying I would) no matter how hard I try for one, I can't live on my own (he said it won't turn out well), and I can't even go on a date (it would be an arranged marriage). My mom has now started looking for one, and each time she talks about some match, I die a little inside. 

I don't know who or what is right and I don't know what to make of this. I want to get rid of  this and yet I can't.",07Nov2019,1
511,"So, Iam a third year college student. I haven't dated a girl in college and I had a gf before I came here. Now, I was never desperate for anyone, until now. I don't have a friend's circle with girls in it, and I find it extremely difficult to approach any girl (Because being straightforward isn't quite so normal here unfortunately). To make it worse, I do get attention from girls, I am positive I look good, and that just makes me feel that I can get a girl I want but then iam not able to and it's making things worse. I have always been mentally strong but I just can't help but get distracted thinking about having a gf, as going and seeing other couples makes it sting . When you get stares from girls, but can't approach them, adds salt to the wound. I want to know how I can get my mind off this? And focus on my things, Iam still able to function well, but I can do better. This year is crucial for me. TIA",07Nov2019,1
512,"Like the title said. They got pregnant six months into their relationship because she wanted a kid so bad. He already has a daughter he doesn’t talk to in another state and throughout her pregnancy he had very little involvement. Now 2 years later he doesn’t go to any family functions or watch the baby alone or just to do any small family events like dinner, or going to the park. Whenever the relationship goes south and they fight he always does this thing where he cries and says he can’t live without them. She ends up talking him back. 
       Recently he cheated on her and we all thought this was it, she finally gonna get rid of this waste of space (oh, and he doesn’t ever have a stable paycheck coming in so living with her in her own house is the only place for him to go). So she tells him to move out within 30 days. A few days go by and we realize we haven’t seen any snaps or pictures from her until we see on her Snapchat story that she’s playing with her son and father outside. Then they are giving their son his first haircut. We realized that she’s doing all this stuff with him and not even telling us. 
       So my questions is, he obviously is manipulating to her, and she’s dumb enough to not see it. She wants that perfect family and doesn’t see what’s going on. We don’t want to push her away from us but how do we go about this? Are there any good links or books into this type of relationship that we can learn about? Thanks!

514,"I don’t want to call my cat bad but he’s definitely a asshole. My boyfriend seems fed up with his behavior like smacking things off the counter, getting into the trash, eating food (we had raw chicken on the counter in a pack that was going to be cooked. My boyfriend left the house after I told him to put it in the fridge. My cat bust open the bag and ate majority of one chicken wing), and also not listening to my boyfriends discipline anymore. 

Now I think it’s usual cat behavior especially in rambunctious cats but my boyfriend doesn’t think so. He gets upset about me not hitting the cat which I hate that he does because he thinks it’ll help train him and know right from wrong but it doesn’t help. He’s also never grown up with cats and keeps comparing cats to dog like saying “dogs understand so can he!” Or “that’s how you train a dog!” But I yell back and try to tell him you can’t do that he’s not a fucking dog. 

His other excuse is because we live together now the cat definitely won’t listen and behaves badly because the cat knows he can get away with anything. I just spray my cat with cold water that he doesn’t like and talk to him sternly but I REFUSE to hit my cat HARD. It does nothing.  My cat is kinda afraid of my boyfriend by the way because he always hits him and not me. He runs to me because I’ll stop it. My boyfriend has threatened to kick my cat out the house. 

I’m not sure what to do I’ve tried everything you could think of besides paying a person to fix my cats behavior. I really think my cat is being a cat and a asshole kinda like he taunts my boyfriend to piss him off. He also hates that a give my cat little pieces of meat off my plate and says I enable him to be a jerk because I refuse to be mean. 

My ways of fixing things are:

Making sure the trash is securely put away and out the way..which my boyfriend responds that he shouldn’t have to do that in his own house

Make sure my cat can’t swipe anything off the counters which my boyfriend also says I shouldn’t do because the cat should automatically know not to do it

Spray with spray bottle and stern voice 

Put cat in timeout in separate room for 30 mins

Play with cat to release some built up energy which usually tires him out

I can afford about half of what it would cost to buy a similar ring. She is willing to give me her ring to put in a setting of my choice. I was initially completely against it. I didn't want to look at a ring that I didn't get her and none of my family or friends would believe that I actually broke down and got her something so big and expensive. Then I was thinking that I would save THOUSANDS of dollars and who really cares what my family and friends perceive. I've been going back and forth in my mind for weeks. What would you do men?

519,"        Hi, Reddit. I know this is the kind of thing that I need to figure out myself rather than ask strangers on the internet to validate my decision, but I have absolutely no one irl that I can talk to. 

       So, a bit of background info: I’m 20 years old. I’m in my second year of a 3 year program (I won’t say what it is, but it’s what most people would consider “easy”). I have dealt with a fuckload of mental health issues for my entire life that, among other things, has led to me being hospitalized twice. I mostly managed this on my own. I’ve been on way too many medications to count and i’ve talked to way too many mental health professionals and it’s gotten me nowhere. 
        I wasn’t planning on ever living long enough to become an adult but i’m here now so i’m trying to make something out of it. Basically I feel completely hopeless. I have way too much shit going on to fit into a single post, so i’ll keep it limited to school, but I think I regret every single decision i’ve ever made. 
       I was recently diagnosed with ADD as an adult by my new psychiatrist who thinks I should get accommodations from school and try a different med and do yoga and meditate etc etc but I can’t fucking do anything. I haven’t left my house for almost two weeks now except to go to work so I can pay rent and not starve. Im out of options. I’ve seeked counselling. I’ve willfully swallowed whatever pills i’ve been prescribed. I’ve done all the things a person is supposed to do to manage their mental illness but not a single thing has worked. I know I know I know, nobody can help me but *me*, I need to be the one to put in the work, but trust me, I have and I still can’t get out of bed or do anything. I’ve felt extremely suicidal again lately, but when i’ve expressed this to people that care about me, no one is concerned at all. I’m not even concerned. I don’t care if I live or die, im just too depressed right now to even come up with a solid suicide plan that will actually work this time. All I can do is cry and sleep. 
       What i’m trying to say is that I don’t think there’s anything I can do to salvage this. I hate my program. It’s probably really easy and fun for most people but i’m never really good enough at anything. I have no friends. Not a single one. I feel fucking disgusting and worthless constantly, and I don’t have an outlet. I just rot in bed because I cant seem to do anything else. Also I moved to a new city for school on my own and now if I drop out it’s like what the fuck was the point of all of that? I can’t even afford to live here in the first place, now I have student load debt that got me nowhere, and i’m more suicidal than I was at 16. The funny part is i’m too depressed to even figure out how to drop out. I don’t even know who to talk to or where to go. I just haven’t gone to classes. Anyway, I don’t know what i’m asking for. Helpful advice could be nice. Thanks for listening.",07Nov2019,1

he said was in the hospital for about 5 days and then he told me he was at home. he said a nurse was going to come to his house everyday to give him injections of medication into his arm. 

but then yesterday he told me that there was a 90% chance of him dying and i asked why he wasn’t at the hospital, he said they let him go home because there was nothing else they could do for him. he then texted a mutual friend saying he felt suicidal and said goodbye to me. that friend convinced him to go to the hospital. he also mentioned that he was going back to the hospital on a big group chat, which is odd because he could have just privately messaged these people. 

because i have some medical knowledge, i don’t believe that any of this adds up and what he’s saying isn’t true... but i might just be in denial. i feel like a bad person for doubting him and i really should wish him the best. 

i don’t know what to do, does this sound like a legit story to anyone? i’m not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask on so if it isn’t right i would appreciate it if you could tell me. 

if anyone has any questions or wants to know more details i would happily tell.

He saw this guy and his girlfriend on Instagram go to a carnival together and his girlfriends friend went along with them. He asks me why we never do that? I’m like do what? He’s like go somewhere with your friends, why don’t you have any other friend to do this with except *my current bestfriend*. He even told me we weren’t bffs because we don’t do each others hair and nails and have sleepovers? Like wtf. Me and my friend have been friends for almost 7 years. We’re so tight. 

It’s normal for men to be attracted to other woman but he goes way over board, if we see an attractive girl when we’re out he pays attention to her all night long and even compares me to them sometimes and asks me why I’m wearing the outfit I am or some shit.

I recently quit my job and I am close to getting a new one, and was meant to be paid tomorrow. I was meant to earn just over a grand but instead I’m only getting 280 which is a massive underpayment. When I asked about it I was told I needed a supervisor to approve me clocking in and out (I lost my card to do this so used a number instead) however I was never told this so obviously it didn’t happen. 

I’m now going to be 900 into my overdraft and won’t get my money until the 6th December.

Hi, M here, I just want to preface this by saying I'm absolutely terrified the people involved will find this post so I'll probably delete it sometime after posting.

As the title says I'm having a bit of an issue with a friend's girlfriend acting inappropriately towards me.

Essentially I met this couple at the same time earlier this year, between the two of them the girl is the one I speak to the most, and the 3 of us hang out pretty regularly as part of a group of friends.

As time has gone on, I've started to notice the girl touches me quite a lot. Some examples of physical contact include taking my hand, holding onto my arm, grabbing my waist from behind, and holding onto my waist as we walk or linking arms, can't forget hugging either. This mostly happens under the influence of alcohol and she admitted to being a fairly affectionate drunk, I've been soothed by this for the most part because I have seen her act in a similar way to a few other guys. But lately it has been increasing, even more so when her boyfriend isn't around, and some things she has said are giving me pause too.

She remarks on how when we're out she hopes people don't think we're a couple, she's pointed it out in pictures of us too where she's not so much all over me, but rather a bit closer than friends usually would be. She'll say things like 'why do we look like a couple,' and it just strikes me as an odd thing to say. The way she keeps bringing this up makes me think the lady doth protest too much, and it might be a projection. All of this sounds very egotistical but I'm just laying it out as best I can.

She has said that she finds me attractive also, which I ordinarily wouldn't think anything of since friends give compliments to one-another.

But here is the kicker, and what gives me the greatest concern. She and he have been together for quite a long time, since they were quite young, and recently she told me that he had expressed an interest in sleeping with another girl. I don't understand his need to do that personally, but as you can imagine it's had an effect on their relationship and she isn't too happy about it. She hasn't come to a decision on that part, and has expressed her adamant loyalty to the guy, but I can't help but feel that maybe she's using me as something of an outlet, after all if he can sleep with another girl, she has free reign too. That's the ego talking, and I do really hope I'm wrong because I have no interest in getting involved with their relationship, they're my friends and I like it that way. But at the same time, I'm ashamed to say I enjoy it. It's been a long time since I've had any kind of affection from anyone, so whenever she touches me I get that tingle, it's a nice feeling. I can categorically state however, that even if she confessed an attraction to me I would not capitalise on it, I cannot and will not ever be 'the other man' to anyone.

In terms of my options I feel like the only thing I can do is speak to her about it and set boundaries, but I'm worried that she'll take offence or I'll have completely misinterpreted the situation.

Any advice is welcome, they're good people and I like things as they are, I just can't get this problem out of my head. I'm hoping it's just nothing.",07Nov2019,1

539,"I have a co-worker that likes to come up with half-baked requests and then sends them to me.  I fulfill the request then send it back.  She then decides it needs changes, I fix and send back.  She wants more changes, I fix and send back.  She wants more changes, I fix and send back.

This can go up to 7-8 rounds of revisions, no exaggeration here.  The changes are tiny so it's hard for me to tell her that this is a pain, but it can be for multiple reasons.  The first is that I can't shift my focus very easily and when I get started on a big project, having to make her little changes can throw a wrench into the focus I had.  There's also that these little changes stacked up can eat away at my own time when it would have taken her seconds to just think the whole thing through.  There's also that having multiple drafts can be confusing because the nature of my job doesn't allow me a lot of time for organization.

Keep in mind, these are changes that she could easily have thought about first.  

So how do I politely and non confrontationally tell her that she needs to start thinking through these requests instead of just firing them off?",07Nov2019,1
540,"So, I have a coworker that has, for the past 2 years, been taking my parking spot at work. We dont have assigned parking spaces or anything, but everyone just kind of parks where they want.i picked the spot I picked because it's in the shaded side of the building and it gets hot. Anyway, I've been parking in the same spot for the last 2 years and I missed a day of work a while back. I came in one day a few months ago, and noticed her car parked where I park, so I just parked in a different spot. The next day, same thing. Shes an older lady maybe in her 50's, is pretty sassy and takes like 3 to 5 smoke breaks everyday.

Instead of confronting her, I would just arrive earlier to park where I normally park and that was fine until a few months ago when she began coming in early and parking in the spot I park. Another coworker noticed that she does park where i normally park and even notices that she takes my 2nd parking spot choice when the 1st isnt available. Like... come on dude. I'm super butthurt internally, but externally I'm completely silent and polite.

I mean, there are no assigned parking spots. If I confront hern that's exactly what I'm gonna be told. Am I overthinking this? Should I try to come in even earlier and park 1st where I normally park? Am overthinking this?

TLDR: Coworker started taking my parking spot after I was out sick and I'm butthurt. Takes my back up parking spot sometimes too. No assigned parking. Should I care?",07Nov2019,1

543,"TL;DR at bottom. 

Sometimes I miss school because of my health not being great (both mental and physical). In most of my classes when I am off I just text people in my class to get notes and caught up. Most people have no problem with this at all and are more than willing to help.

However in one class the other students ignore me and any time I have asked them (Politely) they just ignore me and pretend I didn't ask. 
My teacher has asked the class multiple times to send me work when I am sick but they just say nothing and don't help. Of course they don't NEED to do this and I don't want to pressure them, but I find it a bit rude and I feel very excluded, especially considering this class involves a lot of talking (they ignore me then too). They even have a class text chat for sending work etc and I am the only one not in it (genuinely dont know why, I dont have this problem in other classes)

My teacher seems to think it is me who isn't putting in the effort to get caught up on work but I do try, i just can't because no one will send me the notes.

My teacher loves everyone in this class and so I feel very awkward, but I need to somehow tell her that they aren't willing to send me the work or talk to me at all, and its causing me to struggle. I am failing this class (and only this class) because of it.

I don't want to villainise my classmates or get them in trouble, but I need to somehow tell her I have no way of accessing the work and maybe figuring out an alternative.

TL;DR : my classmates wont send me the work I've missed when I've been sick despite me asking nicely. They are also rude to me. But my teacher likes them so I'm not sure how to approach the problem.",07Nov2019,1

547,"I was never overly popular or confident but I had a group of friends until HS. Played sports, went out, was goofy. I didn't have depression or social anxiety.
I moved to a new state in 10th grade. From middle America to the east coast.

It was pretty awful. I didn't meet any friends and I was made fun off a lot. I ate lunch alone in the nurses' office. I was called all kinds of names. I remember on graduation day no one even said bye to me or anything lol.
My mom didn't understand and met my depression/anxiety and my laying in bed all day with hostility so I didn't have a great home life either. 

Okay so it's now. I've left that state after graduating. I'm on my own. I'm doing ""okay"" I have a cool job. But I never felt back to my original self if that makes any sense. I still suffer. I take an antidepressant. I work out sometimes. Or hike with my dogs.

But now I mostly stay alone. I can't seem to make connections. In fact I hate being around people in general because in my mind 99% of the time it's not worth it. 
I've never had a bf or anything. 
Guys called me ugly or made fun of me in hs so I never got to date..
Now men do approach me sometimes and I get compliments now (so maybe I grew out of the ugliness ?) but it's usually only on a sexual bases. Which I'm not only looking for. 

After my day is done sometimes I just cry in my bed from loneliness almost isolation then do it all again the next day.

My point now is, I thought I did meet someone a few months ago. I decided to actually let him in. But then suddenly it went real sour and he told me he met someone else and went on about how perfect they were. Practically rubbing it in my face. Calling me just a 'fling' but insisted we still stay friends. 
 
I lost it a little and it felt like the world was ending. It brought up a bunch of old feelings again..
Looking back he wasn't worth the time of day. But it still hurt. Just on principle. Even now a little.

I broke down to my friend and told her everything about this past relationship and also my experience in hs. She told me that maybe I'm not really over what happened even though it was years ago. 

I kept telling myself that i'm strong now and high school bullying should effect me anymore. But her saying that made me realize it still is.

I'm trying to stay positive and strong but I don't know what else to do. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I don't want to feel anger and resentment and loneliness anymore.",07Nov2019,1

556,"

Let's start with some backstory to this. 
I (21M) never had a real relationship. 

From 15 to 19ish I had a couple dates here and there with some girls I was interested in, but it never '' clicked''. Sometimes I didn't feel it sometimes it  the girls didn't. 


My only sexual experiences are friendship pluses with girls I never had feelings for, neither had they for me.

Everytime I fall in love I get rejected and feel extremely devastated for months afterwards.
(I don't eat, I don't go out and my mental health just drops in a dangerous place)

The last two1/2 years I managed to not have feelings for anybody. Not even  the usual ''wow she is cute''. They were 2 of the happiest years in my life. Nothing to worry about, not feeling sad, sorry or jealous about anybody. 

But this changed a couple weeks ago. 
There is a wonderful, funny and cute girl at work where we work real close with each other. I think she is flirting with me but I'm not sure... (which is also not really important) it's already at a point where I catch myself thinking way to much about her. 

Even if there was somehow a chance we would end up as a couple and I wouldn't make a fool out of myself by asking her out, I wouldn't want to get into a relationship with someone I work with.

Was anyone in a similar situation? How did you manage to control your feelings for someone you see at least 30 hours a week?

So I've been friends with this guy (I'm 18, he's 16) for about 2,5 years, but the past year hasn't exactly been a good year for our friendship. He did a lot of hypocritical things and is just really toxic and I can't stand him anymore. I made a list of things he did that bother me and I'm planning to tell him very soon but it's just a huge step for me to take. Especially since he doesn't handle criticism well, he always makes you feel like it's all your fault.
I'm really done with him but whenever I get into an argument I find it difficult to have all the facts etc. ready and to stay focused. Could anyone give me some advice on how to handle the conversation? It'll probably escalate into an argument so if you have advice for that, it's welcome too.

He visited a few times and we talked on the phone for hours every night, we were so in love that he transferred his job and moved here to be with me. I moved into his apt right away about 3 months ago. I would be very happy w him, we get along great, live by the ocean, and he acts like he really loves me. Except that I learned from a comment on Facebook, right before he moved here, that he had 2kids he'd never mentioned. When I asked him about it he said he had told me abt them before, I must've misheard him. No talk of how that would affect our plans for the future or his move, and it apparently hasn't. He still never talks about them and I have no idea the situation between them or even where they live or their names. I try not to bring it up and just give him the benefit of the doubt because he says it hurts him and he doesn't like to talk about it, but it drives me crazy that he won't open up about something so important. If I do bring it up, tell him it hurts ME and makes me feel we aren't close, he changes the subject or won't say anything.

563,"I've dealt with toxic exes that refused to leave me alone before but I'm kinda desperate at this point. I'm a girl in high school and I was dating this Senior girl. We were together for a little while and in that span I was never given any free time, was harassed to ask my strict parents if she could stay over or for money, overall would gossip about anyone she could, and didn't care about if I didn't take care of myself, etc.
I asked if we could be friends so I could focus on school and she snapped at me. She apologized after a while and I was kinda done with her negativity and moved on.
I'm now in a very healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. Even though my ex is denying that she's not over everything, she's been acting strange and doing petty things to make me mad or jealous. When I told her I couldn't carry around the stuff I left at her house and I didn't have a car to leave it in, she threw a fit and passed it around my friends likey causing me to loose my favorite necklace.
She's causing some people I met through her to now despise me because of how frequently she trash talks me even when she trash talks all of them behind their back. At one point she would text me every other day, ignoring me when I said I didn't want to get back together, and would talk about how much she wants me back.
I already get bullied in school and trash talked on a daily basis, I've tried to drop it but she's even talking about me when I'm right there and she thinks I can't hear. I don't know how to get this to stop. I tried so many things but nothing seems to show a result. Reddit please help me.",07Nov2019,1
564,"My sister, who is one of the most important people in my life, has been struggling a lot with depression, anxiety, and though she didn't tell me, an eating disorder. I found out about three months ago, and I don't know how to help her, and I hate not knowing how to help her, because she means the world to me, but I'm worried if I confess to knowing, it'll make matters even worse. But I'm also lying to her, acting like I DON'T know, and what if I could help by letting her know it doesn't affect how much I love her and want her to get better?  


My family went through some turmoil when my sister was growing up- the typical separation and divorce, but with the stifling nature of being religious tied in. So, it was toxic. When my dad remarried, she was going through middle and high school, and their relationship deteriorated significantly. She never did drugs, never hung out with the wrong people, but she constantly struggled in school, and my dad's solution was to ground her from anything and everything until the grades were up. This could go on for months at a time, where she couldn't have a door, couldn't pick her clothes, couldn't have a phone, watch TV, hang out with friends, draw, ANYTHING except go to school, come home, do homework, sleep.  


She stopped living with my dad and eventually moved to my mom's and they (her and my father) haven't talked in over a year now, but I know it eats away at her because SHE still sees herself as the 'bad daughter' (and I love my dad, I know he was doing what he thought was best to give her the biggest chance in her future, but FUCK HIM for putting her in this situation).  


There's a lot of other things too- her friends moving away to college, her trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, how the religious side of her family really limits who she feels she has the right to see in a relationship.  


I'm worried because it's one step forward, and two steps back, and she means the world to me but won't accept help financially to seek help. I know she's living in this constant cycle of shame, especially because she thinks I don't know, or can't hear when she quietly leaves to use the restroom, or how it's affecting her health, or her beautiful voice. She's never attempted suicide before, but she's gotten depressed enough to the point where me and my mother worry about it. I don't know how to help her, and part of me just needs to know if confessing that I DO know is helpful or counterproductive. Or is it better to just try and be happy around her, provide a bit of 'normalcy' that isn't affected by what she's struggling with?  


I hope this made sense, sorry, it's a bit of a frantic ramble...

565,"Hi. Sorry for throwaway, don't feel like sharing this from the main account.


Me and my wife are together for 9 years.
She quit her journalist job a year ago and started learning graphics / UI design full time. She was learning it before for a couple years, but only occasionally.

We live in a country with an average salary of 300 bucks, so there was no point for her to keep the job, since it was taking 12h a day.


For this whole year, she wasn't able to find a job in design, apart from some $200 / mo options. She's basically living off what I make, and I don't mind it, we all have tough times. It's not like she's bad or something, the market just has very little demand and lots of people. She's also not that kind of girl who'd tell she's cool even when she actually is. 


This whole thing drives her nuts. She has radical mood swings from day to day, I have to keep telling her everything's gonna be ok all the time. She won't believe me, cuz ""I'd say it just because I'm her husband"". 


We're moving to a much better country in 2-3 months, now I'm preparing the emigration stuff while she finishes her studies. 
She's a smart one, but school failed at her miserably: she doesn't speak English that well. Enough to tell directions, but not enough to work for a company in another country, so she will probably have to spend another year just learning a language.


So, I don't know how to help her survive these couple months while we're still stuck in our home country, and then another year of unemployment in an unknown place.
Same goes for me, I'm devastated when she is.


P. S.
If you think it ain't that bad from what you've read, please imagine something worse, cuz I really suck at expressing feelings.",07Nov2019,1

567,"Quick Information: Me and James are 25 years old. Mom is 42 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to start. Me and my little sisters have no idea what happened to mom. It started last year in August after dad had died in a bus accident while visiting our relatives in Lebanon. His passing left us helpless, sad, and tired. The one who was most tormented by the news was mom, she lost the desire to live, she really suffered. Mom cried day in and day out. She did not leave the house the first three months.

&amp;#x200B;

We received many prayers from the people of Lebanon, they paid tribute to dad. Dad was known there because mom won a beauty contest in 96 the same year she and dad were newlyweds. Dad left behind a family that loved him immensely. My sisters and I had the hardest time the first month, but it became easier after that, but not for mom. It felt like she had lost the other half of her heart. My childhood friend James was always there and supported us during this difficult period.

&amp;#x200B;

A short time after dad's death, sometime at the beginning of this year, my mother changed completely. She was no longer the same person, her personality had changed. She was constantly angry, stressed, violent and aggressive. Examples of events she was involved in. In February this year, when mom and my sisters were out shopping, I was told by my sisters that mom had quarreled with two women in the vegetable market. My sisters said the women were picking vegetables and that it took time, so mom lost patience and quarreled with them, screamed at them and insulted them.

&amp;#x200B;

In May we had a barbecue party, I invited James and his sister Nathalie home to us. In the middle of the barbecue party mom slapped Nathalie in the face just because she accidentaly spilled something. James got angry and wanted to confront mom, I took him aside and said that mom is having a hard time because of dad's passing. He understood that and meant he just wanted to talk to her. After all, I assumed that mom behaved this way because of dad. She was stressed and easily became angry.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later in June, when mom and I were out in the garden mowing the plants, she suddenly started arguing with the neighbor's daughter. The neighbor's daughter stared at us while we were working in the garden and mom lost it completely and started screaming at her and calling her terrible things. I brought mom into the house and asked her to calm down, I said it was embarrassing for her to do so to a fifteen year old girl. I asked her why she has changed and behaves as she does, she stood up, pushed me away and called me names. Mom's aggressive and problematic behavior continued.

&amp;#x200B;

Between September and October, can't really remember, I called Nathalie to come over and help my sister with an essay. Mom got into a dispute with Nathalie once again. I remember that mom asked Nathalie to do something, but she refused and it made mom spit Nathalie in the face and they got into a fist fight. I came in between and put an end to it. I apologized to Nathalie and drove her home. James saw what had happened and said that if mom doesn't calm down then he'll help us with something. I had no idea but said she needed time to get over dad.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks ago when we ate at home on the dining table. My youngest sister started whining about that she wanted to go home to her friend, mom said no and that made my sister to keep whining. Mom lost her composure and threw her plate on my sister's head, I immediately drove her to the emergency room and they sewed the wound she had on her forehead. I told the doctor that she had fallen to avoid the cops.

&amp;#x200B;

I came home but said nothing to mom. James found out what had happened, my other sister told him, he came over and we talked. He said he had booked a hotel here nearby for him and mom, he said he would help her forget dad and start over. I looked at him thoughtfully, James explained that he can help, but she needs to go with him to this hotel and that I needed to allow it first. James is a good friend of mine, he knows my family and I his. I said okay and wondered how long they would be gone, he said a week and then they are back. It was hard to convince mom, it took two days but then she agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

James had specifically asked me not to call him or my mom, because it would confuse things, I agreed with it because the hotel was still close by, I had no address but I knew the area, about two hours with car. I did not visit them. I took care of my sisters that week, with a little help from Nathalie. Mom and James came back last Friday. I tell you, my mom just looked completely different, I greeted and took her bag. James was in the car, I went out and asked how it went, he said mom would not be a problem anymore, that he helped her. He gave me no more explanation than that. And indeed, mom was different, I knew it in my guts. Mom hugged my sisters a lot, she talked to them for the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday it was the same, mom woke up and was positive, she looked motivated again, like before when dad was alive. How much my sisters whined and talked, mom was still calm and answered all their questions. The next day on Sunday, my mother took my sisters to their friends. I am really surprised how she has been since she returned last Friday. I asked her what happened over there in the hotel, she said it was nothing, that she just changed environment. She said she needed to go on such trips with James more often because it helped her. She did not explain more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder what happened to my mother? What did James do to make her change completely and become normal again? I trust my friend but it's something that still didn't feel right since I saw my mom after she came back. What should I do to get mom or James to talk, how should I and mom treat each other from now on? Should I force James to talk or should I leave it? What happened?",07Nov2019,1

571,"*Note: I’m not diagnosed with depression, anxiety or any other mental disorder/illness*

Lately (as in for the last 3-4 months), whenever I have nothing to do my negative thoughts take over and I end up crying and having a breakdown essentially. To cope with this I overloaded myself with extra-schoolwork so that I never have nothing to do. If I’m not doing schoolwork I’m watching something so that I don’t have space to think about those thoughts. 

A few days ago I got in trouble at school for owning a school-related meme account. I came clean about it and apologized where necessary. I have an “in-school suspension” this next Monday. My parents are not mad at me. They didn’t scold me too much, just asked me to learn from the situation. 

My teachers are chill about it for the most part. But the questioning was aggressive. At one point one of the school heads  told me to “get out of her face” because I was disgusting. My self image is already horrible so this didn’t really help and so that was my breaking point.  

I got home grabbed a knife and just cut myself as deep as I could. Not much blood. The marks  are barely visible so I didn’t hav to try at all to cover it up. Then I did it again so that it would hurt more. Then I did it today again. I know it’s wrong, but it feels great to take it out on myself like this. I deserve it. I need to stop, but I can’t.  

I haven’t told anyone anything about this and I don’t really feel that safe saying this to anyone at school. We have a counselor, but you have to make appointments and my parents would know. They’re already dealing with so much at work and with my siblings. I don’t wanna add to that with my poor self esteem. I’m not sure what to do really.",07Nov2019,1

574,"Back story:

I'm in a position where I'm in a college major (computer science) that I've lost severe interest in. I've realized that, at best, I would treat computer programming more as a fun additional thing to learn on my free time than something to be constantly dealt with on a deadline basis. I'm also concerned about the job market relating to it, since even if I did get hired, it'd probably be a bitch to work with. The industry seems extremely stressful and very location limited (to me, at least). On top of all that, I just don't see myself sitting in front of a computer all day and night. Plus, math has always kicked my ass, and since a lot of programming deals with crazy and weird concepts of math, I'll probably bomb my chosen career.

Looking into the trades, however, have offered some interesting possibilities. I've always had an interest in cars since I started driving, so a mechanics job seems to interest me the most. A job as a machinist had also caught my eye. I'm still looking into other trades, since they still offer decent pay (not planning on a $200k salary for my life, anyway), all while still being interesting than a typical day in front of a computer.

In a way, I'm not too too worried. I'm still very early in my college career that makes leaving the major a lot less devastating. I'm also in a relatively cheap community college right now, so financially? I'd also be doing OK.

Still, I'm not entirely sure where to go from there. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you personally do? How would you go about this?

My plan is to figure out a more general and less-specific major (like a business major) and use that as a back-up ""shit hits the fan"" major, all while training for a trades job (either in the same college or at a trade school). Would this work? 

I know life is more complicated than the plans you had in High School, but I still feel overwhelmed a little.",07Nov2019,1

It's just a preference and I think it's very rude when people make remarks about them looking like little girls if it's just because some are short and have more of a sexy, slender build with slim hips.

In any case, I am lucky as so far that the uni I go to now has quite a few Chinese students, so there's pretty Chinese girls too. However the foreign students mostly keep to themselves so that's bad. The good news is that I'm jacked which is good because women of all nationalities love muscular men (however it's currently winter so at most times a jacket hides my jackedness which is bad), also bad news is that I'm not good at talking with women.

I know they like white guys but I don't see it as that big of a benefit since most people here are white but it probably would be one if I was in a Asian majority area.

I learn Chinese now but so far I can only say a few sentences like

583,"So I've been feeling stuck. I have always had a job since I was 17 and in my professional life, I only made decisions based on my career. (I.E.) Delaying gratification, work before partying, even work before my relationships. I don't want to go on too long but this hasn't really worked out for me.

In 2016, after some time off from school  while starting my own business, I graduated from college with a degree in Corporate Communication. I realized from small business ownership, I loved everything within that field. I enjoyed Advertising, Public Relations, Marketing but I had absolutely no idea where to begin, so I remained at my restaurant management job for a total of 6 years! I was making ok money for a student/bachelor and had hoped to move into a corporate role with the company but was denied more than 3 times over the years so I got serious about looking elsewhere.

I managed to find a position with another food service company that was technically sales. I wasn't super excited about it, but it gave me the opportunity to work a pursue other career goals. I left my restaurant job and a month later started with the new company. After only a week training with them, I was informed the position was no longer needed. I had some money put away and decided to take this time to seek out a job that I would be happy to work with for my entire career.

Its been about a month and a half of surfing the web, updating my resume weekly and sending it out to every avenue. Craigslist, Indeed, Glassdoor, and about 4 agencies in my city. I've gone on about 5 interviews that all turned out to be Multi Level Marketing, door-to-door flyers and the like but other than that, I'm not getting many (if any) calls back or interviews.  

\*TLDR\*

Im here asking what route should I take career wise with the degree and interests that I have? I dont think college prepared me for this post student life and I have done the best I can on my own but its not enough. I want to continue to learn and grow. I have a Bachelors degree and 6 years management experience but nobody seems to be hiring, even with those skills. I have also always had the idea that i needed a mentor but sadly, no one I felt would fit my needs appeared in my life, I wouldn't even know how to ask someone to be my mentor.  At this point im willing to accept an internship or a job in my field for moderately low pay just to get the guidance I needed. If anyone in the HOUSTON area is in need, i'd be willing to work for free!

So I just put my baby blanket that I’ve had since I was born to wash and I’m staring at the washing machine and it’s full of water and whatnot and doing the wash thing but it looks super rough to me and I’m scared that I’m doing something wrong which will hurt my blanket. I’m super attached to it and its lasted around a decade and a half now but I’m scared that it won’t go much longer. 

I’d like to know if there’s anything I should know about in terms of keeping it intact and soft. Possibly making it a little softer because ever since my mom washed it by hand when we were in Russia my blanket’s been on the rougher side, but a wash in the washing machine fixed that until it got dirty again. 
Honestly I don’t care if there’s not way to make it softer as long as my boi survives into adulthood with me because seriously. I want to be buried with this thing. 

I googled some stuff but I wanna know if there’s anything else I should know because hey, people may know a little more than google...

I’d like to do something with language, like translation or localization and thought it might be the perfect opportunity to really jump in to a local language and learn it (Probably Spanish since we’ll be in Latin America for a year or so).

Long story, short, is it a terrible idea to forgo comfort and stability for living our dreams of travel? Are we being irresponsible to consider this? I’m gonna be 33 next year and she’ll be 38. Maybe we’re too old to do something like this and should start thinking about our long-term future. Thanks for reading.",07Nov2019,1
589,"My elder sister got married last year, so she moved to her husband's house. They have a kid (6 months) and their relationships before were good, as I think. The problem is she argues with her husband's mother. Their relationships are getting worse from day to day and as a sibling I don't know how to help them. I don't really want them to get divorced and also interfere in their relationships. But there is no choice, obviously.
Last time she had an argument with his mother, she (mother) told her to move out of the household. I don't know how to explain their relationship in details. Definetly, that was my sister's fault. We grew up in a fatherless home, so she probably have problems with trusting to her husband. She can't back home because it will be also hard for me (I am studying at college).

592,"It doesn't seem to matter how careful I tried to be. I still got a bunch of paint on my paint tubes, my brush handles and I went into full blown panic mode when I got some on my bare hands, constantly washing my hands with the only thing I had on hand, dish soap followed by handsoap. I can't afford anything else. 

Also, it's winter, and I live in a small apartment. I can't ventilate for shit right now and the only painting I've managed to finish still isn't dry. I can't store it anywhere where  it would dry faster. I've thought of using a heat lamp on it, but then I'd run the risk of the oils spontaneously combusting.

 I can't clean my brushes safely and quickly at the same time. Don't want to use paint thinner, cause it gives you cancer if you fucking look at it wrong apparently. But oil painting is the only version I've seen that allows for a wet on wet technique, which is the only method that a stupid ass noob like me can do.

598,"Recently I’ve got myself my first job after graduating. So far I’m enjoying it, however the commute to and from work is roughly an hour each way, accounting for traffic, which means I am considering moving out of my parents house and moving closer. However, the kicker is that currently I’m on a 6 month contract, which I don’t know if I will be made permanent or let at the end of that time.

I’ve broke it down into reasons I should move:
- Cutting ~90 minutes of commuting time out of my day
- Moving closer to a city which is cooler/has more going on
- Independence 
- Saving a lot of money on petrol/gas (expensive here in UK)

And then reasons it shouldn’t:
- Rent and bills will eat up about 1/2 of my paycheck
- Parents charging me super cheap rent (dad keeps insisting I should start saving for a future mortgage/buying a property

599,"My boyfriend and I (female, we’re both in our mid twenties) have broken up and gotten back together multiple times. We got back wanting to make this the last time in the summer. One problem we had in the past is I wouldn’t share what was bothering me in fear of creating conflict (super unhealthy I know) and when we got back together I promised I wouldn’t do that anymore. (We both laid everything out and told each other what would change and how we would make it work). It started out great but now when I share something I need he seems exhausted by the conversation or topic. I’m not asking for a lot, I just ask for verbal reassurance mostly (he is way more of a touch-as-your-love-language kind of person). He also has a lot of female friends which I’m not used to so that also makes me feel that I need more verbal reassurance sometimes. 
I don’t like feeling like I’m “too much” and I tell him about how his micro expressions and huge sighs make me feel. In return he says he feels like what he gives me is never enough. I tried to reassure him that it is, we’re both learning and will continue to learn and the only reason why I keep bringing these things up is because I said that is what I would do. I’ve already decided to relax a bit in this and try to be more self-sufficient (but I am a fairly confident person anyway, that’s why feeling this insecurity in my relationship is driving me nuts).

602,"Hi, 

I currently have an evening job and go to school part-time. I was hoping to take a couple classes next semester but they’re only available in the morning. I live at home so with my current job I’m able to pay the bills I do have as well as put money into a savings account. Not to be a whiny bitch, but I have depression and abruptly stopped going to therapy as my family lost our health insurance. I’m going through the whole “It’s hard to shower, it’s hard to connect, it’s hard to do anything”, but there are some things I’m doing well, like exercising and keeping up on my homework.

I like having my mornings free to do my homework, help my sister with her homework (she’s homeschooled), help my mom with household things or just hanging out. With this second job I said yes to, I’d be working ten hours a day. I only said yes yesterday, and I already hate myself for doing it. I already know I’m going to be miserable working, but I don’t know what to do. 

Part of me is like, “suck it up and you’ll have money” and the other part of me is “what’s the point of having money if you’re too empty to do anything”. I was thinking of getting a shorter job as a noon duty aid (I work in schools/childcare), as I would be able to make a little more money but still would have most of my morning free. Do I continue with turning in my paperwork for the job and hope all goes well? If I shouldn’t, how do I decline the job even though I already said yes? 

tl;dr I said yes to a job that would put me working at 10 hours a day, even though I don’t need the money and I won’t be able to take classes I wanted- I’m already feeling miserable about it",07Nov2019,1

This appointment (which i never requested or made) is scheduled for the 9th. Again i was told this was the only way to stop the service completely. Do what you gotta do.

605,"So my friend last year told me and about how she really needed a roommate and that she didn’t want to be with a random. Despite the fact that I don’t like living with other people or having other people in my private space or sharing bathrooms with other people. I said yes, because I’ll inconvenience myself for people I think are worth the sacrifice, ergo good friends. So past forward to this year, we’re living together.... It becomes very apparent to me that, she has multiple traits that I find annoying (to be expected) but on top of that I just don’t agree with the way she’s lives her life. And this isn’t the type of thing we’re it’s like introvert v extrovert. It’s like I know that the way she lives is detrimental to her ability to idk...do anything with life and she’s seemingly incapable of making real adult decisions. We have fundamentally different life philosophies that only overlap on rare occasions. This wasn’t apparent to me before because I didn’t spend nearly as much time with her now as I did before. She’s a sweet, simple, and loving person, but frankly I get annoyed with her too frequently. We have really good times but outside of partying...we don’t connect in the way that I feel like friends should anymore.

The straw that broke the camels back though, is that she finally got her 1st boyfriend and she spends every waking moment with him so much so that she basically neglects to hang out with me or her our mutual friends. No exaggeration, there will be probably only one time in a week where I see her alone. She’s always with him.  All this...and she calls her best friend. Like idk about anyone else but this behavior is particularly repulsive to me. Not only is it fundamentally terrible for you to make your life revolve around a single individual, your bailing on your friends in the process of it. I’m a very, very loyal person and friend and I’ve talked to her about my issues with abandonment so for her to do this shit? I’ve lost major respect for her...and if I can’t respect you....can I really continue to be your friend? Like idk what to do, I don’t wanna be annoyed every time I see her, I just wanna not care anymore it takes up too much mind space...what do y’all think? Cause I’ve talked to her about all this...in person and there’s been minimal to no change in behavior.",07Nov2019,1

Like when I lay awake at 5 in the morning not being able to sleep I can’t help but laugh at the fact that this is reality for me.

610,"I’m looking to make a career change into the film/tv post production industry either into editing or motion graphics. To make a portfolio I will need a much better computer than the one I have right now. I’m seeing building a desktop pc will cost me around $1500-$2000 CAD. Now I do have the cash in savings for that, but it’s part of my emergency fund, which by the end of the year will only cover 3 months expenses (4 if I sold my car)

I have been looking at everything from getting a line of credit, a personal loan, buying it off credit cards and paying off slowly, or even getting a second job on the weekends. However the easiest option I have is to ask my parents....and I’m very hesitant about that.

My parents have made it clear that they’d be willing to help in any way to help me advance in life. Asking for $2000 is no problem for them. My mom would even straight up refuse me paying her back, saying she just wants me to succeed (we’ve had this talk in the past) after all they come from cultures where leaving your parents house before marriage is uncommon (more so in the 90s)

But I just can’t bring myself to ask for help. Call it a pride thing. I’d honestly feel comfortable taking money from a faceless bank/credit card company with interest than from my own family at 0% interest. I mean I’ll be 23 in a month, and it feels like charity.

Why the pride? Honestly I’ve recently realized that my whole life I’ve had self esteem issues. Yknow like thinking I don’t deserve the things I’ve been given for the past 22 years. Being assured that I’m good and working hard at my day job and being self sufficient/ independent (even if it means I have to live as if I’m broke) is literally the only thing I have going for me right now. If I ask for money...”oh look little rich kid got a handout!” (Yes I do realize chances are people aren’t going to care)

I WOULD take a second job, but I feel like my time would be better spent working on motion graphics or an editing portfolio than working in Walmart. Even my parents would be hugely against it saying my time would be better suited if I worked on an actual career that I want.

I am sooo conflicted and I’m stagnating at my day job too sorta. Should I just swallow my pride and ask and promise to return it in like a year even though it kills me. I don’t want to use my own savings coz I want to build up to 6 months emergency so I can actually start to spend on something that improves my life like rent for a place that’s not a garbage basement suite like the one I rent now.

613,"Hi everyone, 

I'm working on a blog/website and hoping that your feedback can help me find some direction. A few things to consider:

* I love to write, so that's my main purpose, but writing for the sake of writing is just too broad.
   * I have tried making other websites, but never felt that I completely got it right. Here's an example:  [http://the30by30project.com/](http://the30by30project.com/) (this was a bucket list before I turned 30, I'm now 31). 
* I hate social media at times because it can feel fake and competitive. I also worry that by tying my social media accounts to my website that I will become lost in a sea of other women who want to be the next ""influencer."" But I also see that it can be a useful tool in nurturing a connection and reaching an audience, I just have to figure out how to set myself apart.
* **My main message:** be your fucking self and follow your passions. Don't let the world around you define your worth or who you become. Don't let your age, appearance, financial situation, boring office job, other life circumstances or meaningless distractions get in the way of living your best life. Eliminate excuses, take control and go after the things YOU want without comparing yourself to anyone. 
   * And this is essentially what I want to do for myself through my work. This project is about pushing myself to practice what I'm preaching, get out of my comfort zone and do anything I've ever fantasized about doing, because I can. I figured the blog would be a good motivator and give me a chance to share my awesome, weird, funny or even embarrassing experiences with everyone along the way. 
* **My inspiration: The Renaissance man.** I always said that if I won the lottery, I would spend all my money learning everything I could learn about the areas that interest me. I've never let go of that idea and then I realized it was foolish to wait for a lump sum of money to fall into my lap. If I want to learn something or pursue an interest - I should just do it. This has led to singing lessons, piano lessons, painting lessons, tarot reading lessons, soap making lessons and the list goes on. 

Do I have something here? I think I do, but every time I get started on this idea I end up losing focus. My content becomes more of a diary and sometimes I think my writing comes across as too cynical. I've been working on a website to launch in 2020, and I have few categories and some posts written, but I don't know if I'm going in the right direction. If you got this far, I'd love your feedback. My website has not been published and it is currently password-protected, but I'd love to share with anyone genuinely interested. 

Thanks in advance!",07Nov2019,1

He broke up with me in 2016. He kept close contact, he is a quite awesome friend, always going an extra mile to help his friends (not only me). Definitely the nicest person I know, and it was so hard to get over him because of that. Eventually I did, and we remained friends and it's mostly a nice friendship. 

The thing is that he is enduring some hardships now. And it breaks my heart every time he talks about it. It brings a huge caring instinct and I feel like I wish I could be more in his life so I could help him overcome this... so I guess I didn't get so much over him as I thought. I can understand why we don't make a good couple and I don't want to be in a couple with him... but I feel this romantic feelings quite tangled with my interest in helping him. I find myself thinking that if we were together, he wouldn't be facing some issues he is facing now. 

I think this is pretty dangerous territory right now, but I also feel a bit like an asshole in not being there for a friend who were very supportive and helpful for me. I think I'm bad at setting boundaries and I'm trying to understand how could I improve on that and be able to both keep a healthy distance but help him. 

I'm really afraid of bringing back too much of this romantic feelings. It won't be good for both of us. Is going no contact the only way? Should I have an open discussion with him about it?

619,"Just some background. I married into a fairly large family. My MIL had been married to a physically and mentally abusive guy for 40+ years, and only just divorced a little less than two years ago. The breaking point was another physical altercation with some infedility on his part thrown in. My MIL, probably as a result of years of abuse, in turn emotionally f'd up her children for years (guilt trips, verbal abuse, creating a hostile home, etc).

The different children of the family dealt with their parents abuse differently, most of them moving far away to get clean starts. My wife, fortunately, was strong and hasn't let her toxic parents affect who she is as an adult. Her younger sister not so much.

My SIL's parents set a pretty bad example for her to emulate, and so it's no wonder she's only been attracted to scummy guys. Guys who she later found out were secretly married, didn't love her, you name it. The sane side of the family (myself included) could see these guys were trouble but she was always blind to it, usually proclaiming ""love"" within a few months at most.

So now she's with another douchebag, and this one is tricky. She started a job in a small shop. It's just the owner (her boss), and his son. She immediately started dating him because she thought he was cute, despite our warnings not to shit where you eat. Because of her financial situation (she's broke, and is sharing an apartment with her abusive mom of all people) she really can't afford to lose this job.

She kept this relationship secret for over a year, only telling me and my wife. She only started bringing him around a few months ago. He is the fucking worst. He apparently was a major addict for about a decade, mostly doing meth (he has major meth mouth. It's disgusting), it climaxed with him going to jail after a home invasion to steal drugs. He's been on probation for two years. His dad gave him a nepotism job at the shop because otherwise he wouldn't be able to work elsewhere. This is primarily the reason my SIL kept their relationship a secret.

None of this phased me. I'd like to think I'm not too judgemental; the past is the past, the present is what matters. So when we met him I tried to keep an open mind (and even played devil's advocate with her brother, a cop, who REALLY doesn't like him). Unfortunately, maybe as a result of doing drugs during a developmental phase of his life (late teens to early twenties), he's really, really dumb, and has the maturity of a 14 year old. He'll complain whenever asked to help with something. He'll make rude comments. He makes no effort to show interest in her interests. He doesn't even act affectionate towards her, despite her clinging onto his arm and giving us all looks like ""isn't he dreamy?"" No. He's a douche. 

They have been having sex (likely unprotected. I don't think he's smart enough to know how to put on a condom) the entire year, and I imagine that emotional physical connection is the only thing she sees in him, because otherwise I can't imagine what she's getting out of their relationship. He does not act like he cares about her at all. She's said several times that she loves him. He's never said anything to any extent that even acknowledges they're dating.

He's also kept their relationship a secret from their boss (his dad), despite the three working in close quarters. Unsurprisingly, when he was doing meth for years, it was under his parents roof, them oblivious to it. He comes from a nice, suburby family. His excuse for getting into hardcore drugs was boredom. 

My SIL's family and I have tried being very gentle about our feelings to her BF. She doesn't take criticism well, and rebels against advice. She's upset that nobody likes her BF (nobody has outright said that to her. We have just occasionally pointed out, ""hey, it was kinda weird when he said this or did this"", which she took offense to).

My wife is concerned he'll relapse and drag her into a druggie life. My concern is that he keeps secrets and lies to his family with no remorse. We all desperately want her to see what we see, but don't know how to get through to her. She's mentioned considering eloping because she knows we wouldn't approve of their marriage. She's already thinking about marriage, and he has never as much as smiled in her direction around us. It's insane.

Considering her upbringing it's no surprise she goes after shitty guys. And living with her mom isn't helping. Her mom has been on a spree of dating random dudes, each sketchier than the last (the most recent was a straight up Dateline murder mystery waiting to happen. The dude owned a quarry and had three ex wives that all mysteriously vanished). Being exposed to this isn't helping my SIL understand what a good relationship looks like.

In turn, I've tried to spend more one on one time with her. Not to sound arrogant, but my marriage with her sister is very healthy and loving, and I think a good influence in her life (her older sister also is a good influence, unfortunately her family has moved out of state recently). I'm outweighed though, by her mom's influence, her shitty friends (the kind of friends who blindly support abusive relationships), and her own denial about this guy.

She's an adult and can't be forced to see a certain way. No one can drag her away from this guy. I realize she has to make these decisions herself. Beyond that, what can be done besides waiting and hoping she makes the right choice?

It might also be worth noting that before her parents finally divorced, we (the family minus the dad) had an intervention for my MIL about her husband's behavior. Everyone pussyfooted around the issue, while just myself and my BIL (the cop) flat out told her (my MIL) to get out of the house, she was in danger. It took another beating for her to wake up and file for divorce.

I don't want my SIL to have to be woken up by something traumatic because she wouldn't just listen.",07Nov2019,1

I love my boyfriend and he loves me. I feel like we are one of the two most compatible people ever, most people would agree because we share the same humor/ personality in a way. However, he brings out the worst in me. It is difficult to communicate when I am jealous because instead of trying to be a normal person and say hey, I feel x, y, and z, I lash out and become the most horrible version of myself. It’s been a year and we haven’t been fighting a lot but recently, my jealousy and hypocrisy really came out during an argument. Sometimes, my anger does stem from something rational, but for the most part, I feel as if I was normal without being in a relationship. I feel like I was carefree and happy because I didn’t need someone else’s approval or happiness to fuel mine. At the same time, I love him, but my attitude is the worst and I have been contemplating for so long as to what I should do to stop this stupid emotion from taking over. I hope I don’t come off as a “woe is me” type person, because I don’t even know where to start anymore if I’m going to continuously act like this whenever we fight.",07Nov2019,1

628,"Okay so I'm in college. Lets get a cast of characters here. Me (me); ""Bridget"" (my best friend); ""Cody"" (a third friend of ours). Cody and I both hold office in our club on campus, he's the VP and I'm Secretary. Him and I are both in a friend group with our club, as well as a friend group with Bridget and her suite mates.

Bridget and Cody met because they hooked up a few years ago while Bridget and her ex were on a break. They remained friends afterwards. Cody is known to get around, his body count is in the upper 60s.

Over the summer, Bridget and Cody came to my sibling's grad party. Myself, Bridget, my s/o, and another friend got totally trashed, Cody doesn't drink (he doesn't like it). We all went to bed in my family's RV (extra beds) around 3-4am, Bridget is go gone we needed to help her into the bed. Cody says the couch-bed is too short for him and shares the bed with Bridget. You can see where it's going.

The stories are pretty different, and his has changed like 10 times over, but the general consensus was that around 6am he initiated contact and they messed around for a little while. Her story, she woke up to him groping her and slapping her ass. His story, he woke up cuddling her and his hand *happened* to be on her breast, so he massaged it. Either way it was not a good situation.

When I found out this happened at the start of the semester, I was extremely taken aback. On the down low, I ended my friendship with Cody, but we still need to interact on a daily basis for our club. Bridget feels extremely violated but knows the absolute mess of ""he said she said"" it would become if she brought it to the authorities or to the university's attention. Plus needing to face her family, friends, and face what actually happened.

It's been a few months and it was going okay for a while, but everyone in our club is wondering why I've suddenly stopped inviting him to social things and seeing him outside of club activities. I can't explain it to them. The rest of us in a position of 'power' (Pres and Treasurer) can't kick him out of his position without there being justifiable cause, so to kick him out we'd need to go against Bridget's wishes and bring it to the attention of the authorities.

On top of this I've watched Bridget slowly fall into a really bad depression and I don't know how to help her. And on top of ALL of that, there's also a crap ton of drama involved with Bridget's roommate (serious drama involving this issue, not some dumb shit about toilet paper or something).

What the hell do I do?",07Nov2019,1
629,"Hello this is my first post. Sorry for long post.

I (22M) have been living together with my fiancé (22F, alias K) for a year. we’ve been together two years, have known each other way before.

Due to recent events in my fiancé’s family, her sister (21F, alias L) was kicked out of the household and was told to not come back.

K asked me to let L stay with us (the house is mine), and that L will contribute for expenses and help around with house chores. I was very reluctant, a new person would lessen our privacy and change the dynamics in my house.

As I expected, K began to not show as much affection, though understandably she just didn’t want L to feel awkward because of displays of affection. Things are still very good and our relationship is still very romantic and healthy.

L, contrary to what I’ve heard from her family, is a very kind and caring person. Very talkative, not in a bad way. Only problem with her is that she spends like 80% of her free time with K and I. She’s always the third wheel but she doesn’t seem to mind.

 Few months pass, L and I become closer, we share stories, joke around and other stuff close friends do. I then develop feelings for L and I had to confess, I told K firstly then confessed to L that I love her.

K didn’t take it well at first but accepted it, L and I agreed that we can not have a relationship and that we should disregard whatever feelings we have for each other since society will frown upon us for it.

Few weeks pass since my confession to L, and based on our agreement I thought that we would spend less time together and not do activities together as much.

Now this is what confuses me: L convinced K to let her stay in the same room as us (different bed though) since she didn’t feel safe staying alone in another room.K and I have way less privacy this time around. Why would L want to be close again? She approaches me time and time again and asks to do stuff together. She even makes sexual innuendos and jokes.

But this morning was the tipping point, I know I made a mistake by touching myself knowing that L was in the same room. 

But, it was 3AM, I thought both K and L were asleep. I was watching some pron on my phone so the light was in my face, I couldn’t see anything around me.

When I was finished I cleaned myself up and put my phone away, that’s when I noticed that L was awake on her bed and she was just staring at me. I asked her how long she had been awake for and she said since I started looking at my phone.

I was stunned, so I asked her what she saw, and she just smiled and said she saw what she saw. 

I’m confused as heck, why would she tell me she was against a relationship happening between us, but do things that are contrary to having less contact.",07Nov2019,1

They offered me morphine for the pain, but I refused due to being concerned about costs. At the end of my visit, they narrowed down my symptoms to either a stomach virus or an ulcer. They recommended I set an appointment to check for ulcers and they prescribed me sucralfate and ondansetron. I haven't picked up the prescriptions because I don't have any health insurance and I'm assuming the out of pocket costs to these meds will be more than I can afford.

641,"Okay, so I am sorry that this is going to be a long one. There is a lot of information to cover. Thank you if you read the whole thing!   
Some key points before I start;  
I live in Nova Scotia, the place in question was a small business revolving around car detailing, and I quit less than a week ago.   


So my biggest problem is that I am genuinely confused as to what to do here. I left this place because of the manager, and the owner both being not so great people. (I was pregnant in July, not very far along and had severe morning sickness, I asked to go home early on one very slow afternoon because I was so sick, the Manager, lets call him Bob, told me I didn't really need to go home and I ""should not have gotten myself knocked up"") So it wasn't exactly a great environment to be in. There were a lot more things that were terrible and should not have happened but the one thing I am confused about is vacation pay. So the owner, instead of putting 4% on every cheque, just took the 4% and put it aside in case you ever needed it. That's fine, it's an old way of doing it but whatever. My problem is, I worked there for 7 months and when I left, I asked the owner, let's call her Dora, to just add the vacation pay onto my last cheque. Dora said it was fine and she could do that. Now over the 7 months, I've worked there, getting paid $12.25/hr I accumulated around $536 in vacation pay. Yay! That's going to be a wonderful addition to my last paycheque. But when I received my last cheque, it was only $154. We have been going back and forth in text messages because I'm confused as to where the rest went and she claims I asked for it on two different occasions and there was $98 put on one cheque in July, and over $200 put on another in September.   
I know I did not ask for these as I have all of our text messages saved, and she never showed up to work for me to talk to her anyway. So the money was paid out on long gone cheques, and I'm not saying I want my money back. I just think its wrong to put vacation pay here and there along the way and claim I wanted it.   
Now I know what some of you are thinking, you didn't read your damn pay stub? Yes, I do. But I've never quite understood vacation pay on the pay stub, I'm still learning &amp; I told Dora that. I also reached out to the Nova Scotia labor Board Division and they just sent me a complaint package that I can fill out and send to them. I don't really feel that's necessary.   
I just want to know, what can I do? &amp; Is there anything I can even do?   
Feel free to ask anything in the comments that I didn't include in here. I will reply in the comments. Thank you if you got this far!   


TLDR: The owner went willy nilly with vacation pay and now I don't have money that I thought I would have. 

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I also forgot, we got tips sometimes at work and it was only me, and one other coworker there who cleaned cars so we are the ones who got tips. They made us put everything in an envelope and save it until Christmas, even though the owner and manager never really got tips, and the other coworker only cleans transit buses. Never cars. They claim that since I left, I cannot receive these tips, is there anything I can do about that?",07Nov2019,1
642,"I am in the U.S. I received scholarships this year and was offered a certain amount of federal loans. When I got my financial aid letter this summer, I meant to accept a partial amount of a subsidized loan. I accidentally clicked ""accept all"" so I immediately emailed the school's financial aid office and explained my mistake and how much I actually wanted. They fixed it, but made the amount I was asking for Fall Only instead of throughout the entire school year. Which was fine. I ended up having more school expenses this semester than I planned on (expensive books, parking pass, etc.) But on October 28 they emailed me and said I have to pay back $250 because they accidentally disbursed too much; apparently they can't give me over a certain amount per semester. But that money is already spent and I don't have it. They gave me less than 2 weeks' notice with a due date of November 10. If I can't pay it, I have to take out a temporary loan from the school for the amount of the loan plus a $5 handling fee and pay it by December 10. If I can't do that, I can't take my winter class which will leave me unable to graduate on time next May. This loan was already granted to me and it was NOT my mistake that they disbursed the whole amount. I've been arguing with them and now they have stopped answering my emails.

Obesity runs in my family, and it has encouraged more bullying than I can handle.

Wednesday comes and we take her to some sort of clinic, not 100% sure it wasnt  emergency care but it was somethinf she could see last minute. She was told she had a 102 degree fever. She went to the hospital afterwards for work cause she was not in any condition to work. 
They dont get sick days and have a point system for days off. She ended up using the last of them for the Monday-Wednesday. 

Anyways, she went back to work monday. Nobody really spoke to her much. Her friend did after lunch but that is all I know about. Her doctor welcome her back and things went like they usually did as far as I'm aware.

Today we have another older MA who, as my wife said ""wanted a word with me and basically pushed me towards a room"" from there she slammed the door shut and got in her face and screamed at her, blocking her path from the door. And even said something along the lines ""better watch your ass"". Her friend got the manager and sent my wife home as he dealt with the lady. This is all I know as my wife just called me about the situation and is in tears as not sure what to do and work already stresses her out.

So what exactly is the next step here? I mean there is no way this is brushed off and work continues. I dont know if my wife could ask for a transfer to another location nearby.

655,I’m sitting in my car rn crying my eyes out. My fiancée texted early this morning say “I love you baby happy valentversary”. I texted her back asking what she meant knowing that it wasn’t V day or our anniversary. Later today she asked why I texted her at 3:00 am. I told her she texted me. She said no I didn’t. I sent a screen shot and she said “Okay well my bad I guess 😂” So I asked her if she meant to send it to someone else and she hasn’t answered. I feel as tho my life is crumbling around me.

659,"My granny passed away in July after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and it was a major blow to the family. I've not been coping well- I was raised by her for a good chunk of my childhood due to my parents working a lot and we were incredibly close but I'm more concerned about my grandad. They'd been married for 40 years and my grandad was so devoted to her- when she was put into palliative care he stayed by her side every single moment up until her passing. 


I can't stand seeing him sitting alone by himself in his house whenever I visit. He's just across the road so it's very easy for me to come over and I do often. He's been keeping himself busy by doing work for people in the nearby town but I know he struggles when he gets back home. I've caught him crying a good amount of times as well, something he never used to do- even in similar situations. It breaks my fucking heart.

My bus was delayed on the way home because 
A) it wont stop raining and its turning into a minor flood. I like rain, but my coat doesn’t have a hood. If it keeps going like this, I wont be able to leave the house.
B) a kid was messing around at the front of the bus and hit his head so hard he passed out. A group of idiots at the back of the bus had no respect and just constantly yelled and made incredibly inappropriate jokes. It made me so mad that I actually wanted to get out my seat and punch them.

Then, when I got home (an hour late and completely drenched) I find a letter telling me that im in danger of failing to meet my target grade in art, and I need to go extra lessons after school. This is probably because I forgot my art folder the other day so I couldn’t work, but it still really sucks. I was already upset because I felt I wasn’t making progress in art, and this definitely isn’t helping. I couldn’t even go to the after school classes if I wanted to, because I would need to get 2 buses home, meaning at least an hour of travel. 

On top of all of this, I saw my dad for the first time in three years last week, and I’m now feeling really down because he had to go back to America. 

I’ve also had arguments with both my closest friend and my partner in the last two weeks.

665,"This might get buried because people have actual problems they need help with, and I’m okay with that, but I could really use some guidance. 

I got my windows tinted by a reputable shop my friend recommended to me. I had been going to another place for my last 5 cars, and had zero issues with them... in hindsight I regret even bothering to go somewhere else. 

I asked for 15% window tint, and immediately afterwards it didn’t seem right to me. I got the normal rap of “letting it dry, your front window isn’t done, you have a sunroof, etc” but I’ve gotten enough cars done that I know these differences. I immediately let them know that something doesn’t seem right, and I will have to come back to get it measured. Since they aren’t local to me it took a while to get back up there. Finally I get back and the Business Owner measures in-front of me at 18% which is a 20% film + factory tint. I know it’s a subtle difference but it’s noticeable to me. 

At that point I can immediately tell the business owner is trying to convince me to keep it the way it is, by saying things like “nah, do yourself a favor, stay out of trouble, it looks fine, you don’t want the attention, etc.” This puts a horrible taste in my mouth, and had me stewing the whole way home. I asked for 15, got invoiced for 15, and paid for 15... but I got 20. If I wanted to stay out of trouble I wouldn’t have even gotten 20, since that’s not legal either. It’s my decision to make, not theirs. 

After a few days I text the BO to tell them that I put everything into consideration (including the burden to a small business like theirs) and decided ultimately I want what I originally asked for. The BO then gives me the run around again talking about possible contamination if they strip the tint, and comes up with a plan to slap an additional 50% film on just my side windows to make it look darker at 10%, leaving my front window bare, and my back window at 20%. *I’ve been around cars my whole life and never heard about complications with a strip and re-tint. 

This seems super shoddy and I feel like I’m getting the run around, I just want my car to be the way I originally asked for it to get done. 15% on the side and rear windows. At this point I’m not even sure a re-do would get done at an acceptable standard since it’s a 100% loss on their part. 

What do I do?

TL;DR: Window tint company didn’t put the right tint on and owner keeps dodging a total re-do.",07Nov2019,1

672,"This happened about ten years ago when my friend was 8 and her sister was 15. So they are 18 and 25 now. My friend reported it to police and has an investigator building a case and they've spoken to some of their family members. As far as i know the older sister has no idea this is going on yet.

I've met my friends sister a few times and I'm really close with the rest of the family. Her sister has always seemed a bit odd, socially awkward and immature for her age. I do believe my friend when she says this happens to her. Her sister is definitely weird enough to have done this. BUT i am not sure if I agree with pursuing a case against her that would put the sister in jail. I don't think she's all there mentally. I also know that the older sister has been in a very sketchy and abusive relationship for 7 years now. I don't want to go into grea detail but i think she may be being sex trafficked. Her boyfriend has mind fucked her for years in the most horrible way possible. 
Everyone else sees this too including my friend. 

I am a little surprised my friend would want to do this during the toughest part of her sisters life. I'm not saying my friend wasn't affected by her sister or doesn't deserve some kind of help. But I'm looking at both sides. I think this way of handling it could cause more problems. They're both victims of some form of abuse. If this was an isolated incident i think getting police involved is a bit much. If she is still out there hurting children then she deserves to be punished. 

My personal belief is that my friends sister is a troubled misguided woman who needs help. There is so much abuse that goes on in prison and she's already endured so much emotional and possibly physical abuse in her 7 year relationship. Putting her into another abusive and traumatic environment will do nothing but give this girl more issues. I would like to encourage my friend to seek therapy for this and maybe finding forgiveness as opposed going to the police.",07Nov2019,1

676,"i moved in with my friend and her partner in august. these people were casual acquaintances of mine--one of my roommates, M, was a coworker of mine for two years before this. i thought living with M and her partner A would be fine, we all decided to stay in our college town a little later than usual so there weren't a ton of places left so we thought it would be fine to live together. 

well, it isn't, or at least, i don't think so. in september rent was late by 4 days and when i sent a message to our groupchat asking about it (no accusations, just literally asking) i got my head bit off and A grumbled online and in public for a week about how no one ever listens to them (they had told me a week or two before rent was due that it \*might\* be late, but never followed up). i have also heard A yell at my cat on multiple occasions. there are 3 cats in our home, one belongs to each of us. in addition to this, M's cat hates my cat and is generally just skittish and hissy/ fighty. this isn't the cat's fault, of course, or anyone's, but it makes living really tense, especially when my cat is the one getting disproportionately yelled at or blamed for any behavior. A is generally a very aggressive and negative person and they hate people without reason--one of my coworkers is ""banned from my house"" despite the fact that A and M don't even know her, and I actually like her. M dislikes another one of my coworkers, too, and both of these coworkers (who are my friends) are uncomfortable hanging out with me in my own home because of this. additionally, M and A do dnd, which is cool, but they recently started a new campaign and having people over every sunday night without any sort of heads up--they're there 7-midnight, and i have to be up at 5 the next morning for work. when i brought this up i was told to see if i can get my shifts changed. i they both went out of town one weekend and didn't ask me to take care of their cats, but assumed i would be in town and able to (i don't mind, but a heads up i think is necessary). these are all petty things, i guess, but in addition to this i just don't feel like an equal party in my house. the common spaces are filled with their things and designed to their specifications, and i don't usually feel comfortable leaving my bedroom. M and A also sometimes argue in front of me and i hate that. 

i suggested in october that i might want to move out for a combo of reasons (trying to be nice, no personal attacks), and both of them blew up at me about it. A subtweeted and blocked me a lot before we even had the chance to talk about it. we did all sit down and talk about it, but mostly it was 2 hours of me getting yelled at, talking about how they feel and emotionally manipulating me by saying how much they cared about me (""i did your dishes one time, i helped you with xyz, i thought we were friends""), saying they didn't sign up for this (neither did i, i wouldn't have signed a lease with you if i'd known how it would be), asking what's so bad about being their roommate, and arguing with my feelings. including berating me repeatedly for not coming to them about problems (i got yelled at for asking about rent, it took me weeks to bring this up, i don't think it's irrational to have fear of confronting these people), but then laying out all the petty problems they had with me (i leave pizza crumbs on the counter or don't take out the trash often enough, stuff like that) that they'd never mentioned. i was called selfish, a liar, immature, not a real adult, etc. they basically bullied me into doing what i normally do, which is shutting down and saying ""ok"" and just doing what they want. i guess they thought everything was fine since this conversation, but i've been uncomfortable ever since and have been thinking about it. to be fair, they moved dnd (i feel though, that because this other option could've been the first option initially, that they never considered me at all and just offered our place up bc they don't see me as a real roommate), and i got an apology for yelling at my cat, but that doesn't make it ok to me and i still don't trust or feel comfortable leaving my house and having my cat home where he could potentially be mistreated and i wouldn't know. 

on sunday i told them again that i wanted to leave, and if we wanted to talk about it more we could, but i wasn't changing my mind and i needed to do what was best for my mental health and my cat. they told me i couldn't sublease because they were uncomfortable with a subleaser (our landlord allows subleasing, it's very common in our college town bc of studying abroad or people graduating in december), but that i could move out and continue to pay them my portion of rent. we haven't spoken or seen each other really since then, and it's made me feel even less comfortable living where i do. 

do i have options? i've been marketing my room and trying to find ideal subleasers. i've lived with two subleasers before and in my experience most are just college kids who want somewhere calm and quiet to live. i'm compiling a list for them. i also don't really understand why it would be so hard for them to stay here alone. my portion of rent is $350. all utilities are included in our rent. if i left and they had to pay by themselves, they'd each owe less than $550 a month for all utilities and internet. minimum wage here is $10.10 an hour, and neither of them are students and also have jobs where they make tips. while i understand it is inconvenient and i don't truly know 100% their financial situation, we have a REALLY good deal here. meanwhile i'm willing to pay $800 at a new place (one beds are expensive here) to get out of this situation. but i can't pay that and the $350 for them to occupy our current unit without me. i'm considering just moving out in january, like i told them i was going to, and leaving them to deal with it if they refuse to let me or help me find someone else, or also move out to a more affordable place for the two of them (i even sent some available one beds to M and she scoffed at all of them). i don't want to do it and i know that is shitty, but i think they're being ridiculously unreasonable. they've also interpreted this as some personal issue, when i feel as if it's totally normal for people to be compatible as friends and not as roommates, and i've thus far managed to talk about it without saying anything mean or disparaging them as people. 

what should i do? is there anything i can do?",07Nov2019,1

678,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post so sorry if there are grammatical errors and such. Also I’m on mobile so yeah.

I’m just currently having some trouble on what I can do as I’m currently double majoring in college for two careers when one of the majors was just a compromise. That major being Computer Science. I started school very interested in it along with Counseling but Computer Science soon became tedious and a chore to do. I always dread taking the classes because it always gives me a bit of hope at the start and then I completely fall apart afterwards which results in a lower grade and GPA. 

However, I’m double majoring as a compromise because my parents didn’t want to accept that I want to be a counselor and possibly even a psychiatrist based off how I am and how little it pays or even the lack of jobs that are available. I don’t want to fail them as they mean a lot to me and even bought me something for my birthday that I did not expect them to buy me but are still expecting me to do very well in the major. 

Like, the best I can do I’m Com Sci is the basic stuff and then it’s very hard for me to puzzle together the rest of the programming inside of it. I want to give up in the major as I know I’m not good and majority of the assignments I’m given is just me starring into a screen, with little to no progress done after attempting multiple things for hours at times. 

Yet my parents believe I’m just going the psychology route because I want more time to play video games and text my girlfriend than my actual studies. I know I’m fortunate to have the opportunity to go to college since I’m a First Generation student. I’m just very bad at doing things at times and can’t wrap my head around concepts that get extremely complicated. I’m not even a good problem solver and tend to panic a lot when I can’t figure out a problem. 

What should I do? Do I follow my family’s expectations or should I just give up on Com Sci? How do I overcome this? 

P.S: Please don’t hate my family on this. They are very loving people and mean a lot to me.",07Nov2019,1
679,"So long story short (I work in property services): in May whilst I was in hospital following an operation management decided I’d take on a new role. I get back and am told I’ll be taking over asbestos management alongside my other duties. Months pass and nothing happens despite me continually asking as I was due to start a course in September. 

September comes round and I begin my course, week later I receive a redundancy letter. My role was being removed and if I wanted to I could apply for the asbestos role or take redundancy. I was hurt, confused and completely broke down. 

After a botched explanation it turns out that’s our policy, I couldn’t just progress into the role, a heads up would have been nice! eventually I get the new job description through. My role combined with the new. 

During my consultation period I voiced concern that it was too much for one person to do. No response, no solution. October comes and I take over the role, a month later I’m in pieces, I can’t keep up with the work load, my projects are falling behind. I’ve worked 18 hours extra in the month to accommodate the work load and I’m still behind. (We don’t get paid overtime)

I spoke to my manager saying it’s too much and somethings got to give. He agreed to try to reach a resolution but it’s not happened. Each time I bring it up “you knew it would take up a lot of you’re time and you’re not going to get admin support, it’s just not going to happen”

I'm pretty by the book and have been accused of being too negative before. I'm also fairly blunt and straightforward and matter of fact about things, but I try to say things in a nice way.

687,"I am in my third year of college this semester, and I do not have a job. It feels different for me because I worked throughout high school and my past years of college. It is really hard for me to accept that I need to focus on school and my mental health and not work. I have noticed that I am really hard on myself about my decision though. None of my friends work either while in school, and they are happy. My issue is the pressure I feel from my dad and other family members about working full time on top of being a full time student. It makes me feel terrible about myself and almost like I am not doing enough to be proud of where I am at.

690,"So 2 and a half months ago our German Shepard gave birth to a litter of  8 puppies, everything went smoothly and the puppies are as healthy as can be. We just started the process of finding people who would be interested in taking a puppy home with them at the end of the month as we have enough dogs to look after, we aren't in it for the money we simply just want to find these pups a good home. 

So far we've had a few people ask us if they can take one when they are old enough and we have made arrangements with a few, however the other day i had one guy that I've known for 10 years come up to me and ask me if he could have the whole litter, he even mentioned that he would pay for each of them. I guess this guy has a kennel and he breeds dogs all the time. Now as much as i'm looking forward to having these dogs go elsewhere i'm just having an uneasy feeling about it. We are trying to be responsible with this litter and make sure that these puppy's will end up with people who will get them fixed when they get older as this litter is mostly female. For some reason i keep picturing all of them being locked up in cages all day and only let out to breed. 

Now i know that's a big exaggeration and its probably not going to be the case with this guy as i know what kind of person he is, but still i just feel uneasy about it for some reason. What do i do here? We do eventually need to give them all away and cant afford to get stuck looking after an extra dog. Are my fears justified or am i blowing this out of proportion?",07Nov2019,1

693,"hello there i don't know what to do  


been emotionally and initally physically abused as a kid  
The physical abuse stopped after a couple years; i think it was supposed to be discipline but like i was forced to play the piano and i wasn't allowed to go to the br, smacked whenever i didn't play the piano the way they wanted, parent grabbed my right ear and would pull/jerk my head in a direction while dragging me along, was bitch slapped alot too lol + typical punishment if u got a bad report card   
also have seen my brother get stabbed by a pen, hit with a shoe multiple times and a rolling pin so that left an impression on me early on. My dad fucking bashed my brother when he broke a violin bow by accident; i still remember they made bro sit on a chair in the living room and he got beat while parents yelled at him. Sis and i were on the stair case watching and feeling horrible that we couldn't do anything

The emotional side well it's the stereotypical you don't have a choice study up be properous god i loved drawing but parents everytime would shit on it it's the usual oh it's the u'll end up ont he streets job, 

Mom believes all my accidnets were  on purpose according to them and just replying was considered arguing back --&gt; starts screaming fiesta  
Also did i mention that my mom would nonstop compare her children to other children, complaining about how bad we are to other parents and us ourselves? Always would degrade me and my siblings   
mom's a victimizer; nothing;s their fault.  
Man, and like none of my siblings wanted to play piano--not b/c they didn't like the instrument, it was b/c of how my parent taught it lol  
after several years of asking to quit and being yelled at for even asking, finally managed to quit in highschool but ofc not wo drama

piano teacher at that time really thought i was worthless b/c my sister who's better at piano had her and she wa slike why aren't you as good as your sister why are you so bad

My mom finally let me quit but on the basis that i was shit and wasn't worth continuing/was a waste of money--didn't really care for the reason just as long as i got to quit i was happy so i was like it's a money problem? and she said yeah SO when i went and told the teacher i was gonna quit and b/c it was a money problem, the teacher was like oh sorry to hear that and then my mom butted in huffing saying NO it's not a money problem long story short both adults got angry at me and mom made it seem like it was all my fault and like ofc since my mom is the adult the teacher listened to her. Before we left, i was like well i can at least stay until afte rht recital b/c i figured it would be rude to just leave when the recital was in a couple of days, but my teacher told me why should you bother when you mess up and freeze everytime you're not even good

shit man this whole post is really unorganized but yeah this whole stupid fascination of making me like my sister was really shitty; sis played 3 instruments and was good at them, i had to play 3 instruments, and i was avg to shit at them  
at least we both liked drawing and we both were yelled at lol  
High school teachers fucking witch hunted me down when i didn't return for highschool sophomore year; they had my friend get me to come to their office by myself and they proceeded to laugh and make fun of me b/c i didn't memorize my schedule yet (this was the first week of school mind you) when i pulled out my schedule to show them how busy i was   
The mentality that kids should just sacrifice their life or somehting just for music is so sickening in school music teachers. Ofc, some teachers actually don't have that mindset and r actually p cool and chill

The great thing about being hte youngest in this family is that every mistake your older siblinbgs make, the parents automatically assume ur gonna make the mistake and then ayaya &lt;&lt;big stress time&gt;&gt;  
last year i got a knife waved at me and was threatened to be killed and the kicker out of this is that the other parent like through out my life just doesn't give a shit rather they just find it annoying that their partner is being annoying asf nonstop complaining so they too join in to shut up the child b/c it's bothering them  
Both of them don't bother listen; they both think they're right

I mean negatives aside, they do provide for me... i think the one that complains alot to the other really just wants the best for their children and tbf they were also abused as a child and currently is not being treated well by partner

Things have gotten beter (like physical abuse stopped p much early-late middleschool i forget) and i think they're getitn gmore senile, but uh the get a good job track and not listening... yeah

i want a decent job i guess but uh ive asked for a year break after highschool b4 goign to college so i could rethink things but that wasn't even an option to think about according to parent so here i am, 2nd year of college in pre-pharm

college has it set up so u shove ton of classes in ur schedule so u can meet requirements on time (im doing a 6-year program) which is typical and better i guess if u don't havea lot of money i mean like i said, my parents are providing, but it's unlikely they'll have money later on and i hate being a burden like this for something i don't really want to do

I'm very stressed from school; so much shit/work to do in so little time; i've asked again if a break is possible to my parent and they said no

Last year i was going to commit suicide by jumping out of my 13th dorm window but that was when i realized that id idn't really want to die bc didn't want to have suffered all this time just to die LOL

remember how i mentioned that i liked drawing and my parents disapproved of it? well acutally it was one of my dreams to live as i dunno a freelance artist i guess, work on videogames, and make my own videogame. though with how my art is right now, it's kinda shit and not up to the quality where i could live off of it, also i don't have a big audience; being an artist is out of the question and my parents r gonna banish me to the shadow realm or not let me be banished and force me to continue

i just don't know what to do if i did happen to drop out, or if liek dropping out is good  
i think i can sorta continue but once i fail ochem! you bet im gonna be yelled at! my sis failed a class i think and well my parent likes to shit talk about my siblings and I  
Also, i thought about changing majors, but that's not really the problem here  
I also have no interest in any fields; just going w this one for money... and know more bg around it  
so if i don't continue college, how the heck am i supposed to i dunno live  
Like what areas should i look for for art jobs, any tips on shadiness of jobs; i've mostly just done online and posting commission info to social medias (but this isn't enough to cover rent or anything so i wouldn't be able to live by myself)  
Ofc, working at a retail job is something but i mean like what do in the long run  
Like am i just thinking about this too hard?? I don't know if it's just me holding myself back because im devoting time to my classes but i sitll do shit and then i get depressed from thinking about the future this stinky job has for me and the lack of time i actually have currently to do stuff i like

honestly it looks like suicide's my best bet but i really don't want to commit suicide so i've just been crying on my bed and sleeping a lot while skipping some classes (skipped by accident most of the time b/c sleeping to recovering from staying up doing work)

I just want to be happy with life but I don't know where to start  
My close friend told me not to think about it and that i was thinking too far in the future, but im thinking about the present as well.. im miserable right now because of what's happening right now, not just in the future

I tell my sister on fb about how im unhappy and how i wanna be happy doing the stuff i want but all she does is sad react LOL tbf she isn't very good with dealing with stuff like this, and the last time i admitted to her that I have wanted to harm parent then killing myself (this was in late middle school okay i was going batshit crazy and wanting + doing is a different thing; the harming thing was more like i wanted to end the problem that was constanting degrading and making me miserable but didn't do b/c thought i was going nuts and din't want to stoop down to parents level) she just called me crazy and condemned me

i don't really have anyone else that i can talk much to either about this because surprise surprise i had no friends while growing up, p shit at socializing thanks to parent correlating friends to being too much work/not worth it by making me doing all these chores, labors, play godddamn hour of piano b4 could let friend over imean now that isn't relaly much but as a kid that was torture, especially if u wanted a friend over after school but the whole chore/extra job thing lasted until past their curfew 

also people thought i was weird in school because was desperate to make friends at first, but now i prefer being alone because a lot of people are scary and maintaining relationships take a lot of work; i can barely take care of myself mentally so yeah i tried doing the maintain friendship relationship w someone and they ended up manipulating me by playing the victim and ""oh i have anxiety"" so many fucking times  


well im not really looking for like pity good god i hope this post didn't come out this way if anything i think i sound mad lol which i am but more frustrated; i just want like advice on what to do nO sAD REACT LOL plz don't do that to me i unwillingly have my sis for that

Also, i dunno if this is even possible (it prob is), plz don't report my parents or try to investigate lol  
sounds really contrary, but they are tolerable and there are a ton shit worse people out there... and they did try to do the best (?) for the children i think but man they suck ass at it  
i don't think this is really called forgiving if i still remember and hate what they've done to me, but like i just wanna live life happy instead of focusing on bad stuff all the time",07Nov2019,1
694,"So a couple of days ago my roommate who happens to be a girl. Told me that she owed her drug dealer some money and that I'd save her ass if I could lend her 50 euros. I reluctantly and regretfully did assuming that what she said was true and that she'd actually pay me back the money before Friday. I went to her room today after a long ass day in the library with no food and barely anything to drink. I asked for the money and she made the excuse that we agreed upon her paying me on Friday or before. At the moment I knew I fucked up because 1. I'm a minor so I can't even take her to small courts claim 2. I'm a mix of two nationalities that are known to be trouble makers in this country although I have nothing to do with them nor was I raised in an environment even similar to theirs so she can literally make up any lie and the police would easily believe her. 3. I genuinely have no idea how to handle these kind of situations with girls if it was a guy I'd tell him to fuck off to another universe get that money and come back. I seriously need that money back and I feel like any way of me showing any sign of aggression could easily fuck my whole ass future up. I'm trying to be calm and collective but people who lie to me or break their promises disgust me. Truly disgust me.

695,"I went to my local dunkin earlier and was going to get a donut. I was looking trying to decide and noticed little flies all over the glazed, like 6 on each donut. They were smaller than reg flies and bigger than fruit flies. Then I realized they were all over all the baked goods, it was repulsive. I just ordered coffee and left but felt like I should have said something. I even watched an employee grab a donut for the drive thru, totally not caring that the flies scattered when she grabbed the donut.

I've never been diagnosed with with anything but my mom was convinced I was depressed in high school (I dont even know, I was just smoking weed and doing the bare minimum) but I never saw a therapist long enough to be diagnosed. 
My days are filled with a roller coaster of emotions. Some moments I'm at complete peace with life, then I spiral into thoughts about my shortcomings, my regrets, my direction in life. I want to inspire people and spread love and positivity, but I just dont have anything to give. 

I waste all my energy just doing what I need to get by (about to graduate college), and I'm afraid of continuing this once I get a real job. 
I also hardly find anything fun anymore. Socializing is so draining, video games feel pathetically wasteful, other hobbies just seem too daunting and I cant commit..

704,"(Throwaway since my main account is recognizable.)

A few weeks ago, the company I was working at went belly-up. (I lost my job and, as a result, my mortgage approval and the house I'd made an offer on.) I'm disappointed and discouraged, but I'm a pretty independent person and I don't believe complaining helps anything. I mentioned it to a couple people who are close to me, but I'm trying to pick myself up again and not make a big deal out of it.

I'm usually the person that friends come to for advice, but recently, some of my closest have been non-stop venting about minor or repetitive things with zero regard to my situation or the resulting emotional state. The job they *do* have that's getting on their nerves, but they won't apply elsewhere despite that I'm always sending them job listings. A toxic person who they've been complaining about to me for a year and a half, but they always ignore my advice and go back. An infected blemish on their face (This has been a regular talking point for weeks?).

I always try to view things with a sense of perspective — while someone's problem may not seem serious to you, it's serious to them — though lately, I've been having a lot of trouble. It really feels like my friends are being insensitive and don't know how to discern a genuine problem from one they're creating for themselves.

She broke it off with me, saying that she needed to work on her own happiness for a while and work on her mental health. She also said that she wanted me there as a friend still, if I was going to be. I had already fallen in love with her, I knew that from the very start, that I loved her. I had said those three big words to her, saying that she didn’t need to save them back that I just need to get it off my chest and tell her, and she didn’t say it back. 
I’ve been best friends with her ever since. She talks to me about everything, including a new boy that she’s interested in, and a new coworker that she thinks is cute. And for some reason it hurts a little, just each time that it happens digging in just a little more that I can’t love her freely. 
I’m grateful to have her in my life still, I truly am. But I think I’ve fallen for her further. I think I actually cannot live without her, at least that’s what it feels like. I’ve never felt this way about somebody before, and it’s slowly starting to consume me. I had the opportunity to move back home, and I’m not sure if I can take it purely because I don’t want to leave her behind.
I don’t know what to do, or if I should even tell her that I still have feelings for her. People at work have started asking if she’s my sister because were always together I drive her to work almost every single day and then drive her home. The people at work just think that were two girls being friends that we were never exes or anything, and I don’t think anyone would be able to tell if we didn’t say anything. Hell, they might think we’re still together. I’m just confused and anxious and I don’t know what to do

711,"So I was seeing this girl, we'll call her Sue, for a few months, we had been taking it super slow because we both had gotten out of a serious relationship, everything was going great, her daughter loved me, and we spent most of our time together, of not we were always texting. I was about to ask her if she would be official with me when she cut things off. Everything was good one day, the next we barely talked, and the day after that she said she wanted to break things off. It broke my heart because I got pretty attached to her and her daughter. This happened 2 days after mother's day 2018. She is now in a relationship with somebody else. 

So last night I had a very very vivid dream about her that she never cut it off and we stayed seeing each other. Everything seemed so real. So natural. Like it was supposed to be that way. It felt right. I was actually happy. It was perfect.

It's not the first time I've had a dream like this of her. I'm trying to let her go but I just can't and it's fuckimg me up. Does anybody have any advice on how to move on.. How to get her put of my mind and stop these dreams... Any help is appreciated..",07Nov2019,1
712,"I really don't know for sure, but i think it comes down to a mix of the two. Basically, i am not happy with my communication skills. It cuts me very deep every time a social situation goes unwell because of my problem.

To start, it's my dream to be a clever/witty/funny guy (probably why it bothers me so much), but the things i say are very repetitive and generally not funny or interesting. People aren't really interested in what i have to say and i don't blame them. Like for example, if someone tells me something, my response is pretty predictable. ""Mhm. Hmm. Yeah."" Etc. Then i ask them something in my deep, monotone voice or try to follow up somehow to keep it going, but it's never really a fruitful convo. Also, i have trouble thinking of things to say, and i often mumble/mix Up words. Because this happens no matter if i am anxious or not, i believe it's because of a lack of skills. I don't know how i am to better them, because i go out of my way and talk to people pretty much the whole day of every day at college, but it's not improving. They say you have to practice a lot to get better, well it doesn't work for me :(

I've found that when i loosen up and don't try to be clever, i am the most (though still not enough). This, however, is very hard for me, because i'm insecure about being lame, so i unconsciously try all the time. I know i have a good sense of humor when i magically somehow get into the zone, i can be clever and witty as fuck, though this very rarely happens and therefore i constantly doubt i can be better. It's literally like multiple people living inside me. One minute i'm social and happy, and the other gloomy and quiet.

Overall, i am very confused and don't know what to make of it, because there are so many possibilities to where my problem lies. I'm 20 and been trying to fix it for 5 fucking years now, and of course i made some small progress, but not nearly enough. I'd like to know what you guys think and what should i do, because i am at my wit's end here. I have no meaningful relationships and it's slowly destroying me.

Just to list some od the things i've tried: meditation (1 month) Nofap (35 days now, some great changes in confidence, voice, etc but still doesn't fix the core problem), talking to a lot of people, putting myself in awkward situations, reading shit tons of material on this subject, psychologist (who was useless and blew me off as an introvert, which i may be partially, but def not totally since interactions don't drain me unless they go really bad and i really enjoy when they go well), mindfulness, alcohol ofc gets me closest by far, further prowing i have it in me but obv i can't rely on that, and probably a bunch of others i can't remember.

Thank you.",07Nov2019,1
713,"I’m 18/m and I’m 5’3-5’4. I had a relationship with a really great girl about a year ago and I ended because her family was too much. Now I really regret my decision. 

I’m really short for a male. I’m off to college soon and I’d really like to meet a girl there but being this tall is a complete turnoff. My ex an I only dated because I knew her for a long time and we had mutual friends. It wasn’t an instant attraction thing. 

I don’t think I’ll be able to meet someone. I’m worried that I let a really good girl go and now I’m doomed to never experience a great relationship again. Am I being ignorant? Are my fears irrational? 

Since the breakup I’ve just been going crazy about my height and the odds of me meeting someone else whom I connect with. It eats at me everyday, It’s the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to bed. Any advice?",07Nov2019,1
714,"My uncle is in care at a publicly funded memory unit. His needs are attended, and family visits at least every week. But it's a hundred-bed home, and there are too many inmates who don't have regular visits.

With the holidays approaching, I'd like to send a small but useful gift to those who don't have regular visits. I've tried several times to speak with the on-site social worker, but the phone just rings and there's no voice mail. I'd prefer to give a personalized gift to any resident who doesn't have outside resources, but I'm okay with a generic useful something for those without other resources. 

Obviously, food gifts are out. A small bouquet of flowers might be okay. I don't have a lot to spend, though, and I'd really prefer something more thoughtful and practical. Slippers? Lap robe?

717,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. So I'm in my late teens \[M\], in the later years of high school and am 60% sure I have what you would call serious mental issues. It took me a while to accept I'm different and everyone else isn't actually faking, but here I am. I'm not talking about depression or anything like that but I think I have antisocial personality disorder (aspd). I'm no psychologist but since I was a little kid, 9-10, I knew there was something different about me. I've never responded emotionally the same way as others and whatever and started to fake it. I thought, and still kinda do, that everyone else was like me and is faking, but apparently not. Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with being a ""psychopath"" (If you want to label it) and would be happy living my life never going to any kind of therapy or counselling, but my school and teachers disagree. After a ""long history of trouble making and serious concern for your mental health and the people around me"" they decided to basically tell my parents to send me to a psychologist to ""work through any personal issues"" I may have (yeah, condescending, I know, fuck them). I'm not exactly well behaved but this is 100% an over reaction. I'm obviously going to act as if I'm normal and end this shit asap, but can anyone tell me if a psychologist would see through this, and if I do get diagnosed with aspd what does it mean for my life, job prospects and whatever?

719,So I am letting a friend 18m stay at my place with the intention of getting a place with him and my bf.  His home situation was really not ideal and I wanted him to be safe. The saying you don’t know someone until you live with them is so true. I have been friends with him a year or so and really thought I knew him. He will host endless hookups at my apartment without even asking if it’s okay. He also cheated on his bf and never seemed to care. He will often just block guys after hookups and think it’s funny. He really doesn’t own up to his mistakes ever or share anything about how he is feeling. Everything to him is a funny meme. The last straw was he hosted a threesome in my bed and made a mess. He didn’t even wash the sheets or tell me. I hate that he has turned my apartment into some gross sex dungeon and doesn’t even care. He never gets tested and will have unprotected sex. He could be spreading hiv or a host of other things. There hasn’t ever been word of trying to get tested either. I told him I tried to be helpful but I can only give you until the end of the month. I no longer want an apartment with him. I offered to consign on the lease. I was honest with him about all of this and he simply said I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make you mad. I was hoping he would try a little harder to be sincere.,07Nov2019,1

721,"  

I am 32 years old, father of a (soon) 2 months old daughter.

My parents had divorce when I was 1 year old, I lived with my mother but saw my father quite often.

I always though that he was a good father, despite the fact that some his personnal pleasures were prioritized over my confort (for instance he used, almost every weekend, to had huge party very late at home, while I could not sleep because of the music).

Also he never ever paied alimony to my mother. She had a good job so she manage to do without while my father never had a stable job (always trying to create his own company, without real success...)

My mother had another child, I have so a half brother. My father never wanted another child until now...

My father had a stroke 16 years ago. He survived but it changed his « seriousness », and he never worked after that.

I always worried about my father, his economical health, his future retirement etc.

He always travelled a lot, and when I started to travel by my own he kept telling me over and over « you can have sex, but don’t fall in love, especially in poor countries ».

He bought a house in Senegal 10 years ago to spent his retirement (since he will have a poor pension and Senegal is cheaper than France...).

Since my father was always a notorious « womanizer » I knew that he used to « see » some girls in Senegal (and he have his girlfriend in France aswell).

Yesterday, he told me that he put a girl in Senegal pregnant and that I will have a little brother or a little sister in 7 months. I know that he give her money, she is a kind of prostitute, but he now say that he love her. Almost I never heard about her before yesterday.

I am lost, I don’t even know how I feel.

722,"Today was one of the worst days, I've had in a long time, basically I had to stay in school the whole day and we almost only had subjects I dislike. At fist, the day started pretty good though, but that changed pretty fast...

The worst thing at school was definitely PE, I don't like it and am also really bad at it, but that itself is not the problem.  However, two of my few friends had been jerks today, we just finished PE and then they started clapping directly in font of my face. I don't know why, but for some reason this really exhausts me and I got pissed quickly. I told them several times to stop(they already knew I dislike this!) eventually I just said, that  my phone(I got it in the hand at the time) weighs 240g(around 0.53lbs, I weighed it the last time, I was in a supermarket) and I will slap them in the face if they don't stop. They stopped, but I was still in a bad mood and got a headache. 

Then I had to go to driving school, the teacher tested me to see how good  I could already drive... imo I fucked up completely, at least he kind of understood and said that next day would be better, he gave me a second chance.

I just had to let it out, this is just a shitty day, but I feel like, all days got worse since about half a year ago, I don't know the cause of it, but I am often sad when I am at school and some hours after, this feeling outspread even to the holidays. Right now, I can't even tell wehter I am sad or not. I don't really know if this is a feeling, but I think, that I feel ""nothing"" right now, I can't find any excitement or happiness, but I am also not terribly sad if that makes sense.

1. C hitting, slapping, or punching J quite frequently and then many times saying she was ""just playing/joking"" or blaming it on a mental disability she has (autism).

2. C not taking into account J's feelings, wants, and needs, instead making it all about her. Like a few days ago J told C he wanted to legally adopt a family friend who was orphaned rather recently (family friend is 13, J is 25) and C absolutely threw a fit and started hurting herself, absolutely refusing to let him go through with it because she was worried she wouldn't be the center of attention anymore (even though she admitted she wants kids soon so it makes no sense)(also keep in mind, this is just a basic relationship at this point, C and J arent married or even engaged at this point).

3. C is always overly clingy and is extremely jealous when theres nothing to be jealous about. Such as J no longer being allowed to have girls numbers in his phone (even his mothers) and barely being allowed to have any female friends on Facebook otherwise C goes ballistic. 

4. Finally the biggest one is that C guilt trips J and blackmails him. If J even says he just wants to take a break from the relationship (not even break up for good, just take like a week or 2 break) C will threaten to kill herself or even actually attempt to do so.

I keep trying to make J see that this is not a healthy relationship at all but he keeps saying ""ive never felt this way about someone before"" (he has trouble feeling most emotions so him actually feeling someting is a big deal) and hes convinced that because he actually feels something, that C MUST be the one and hes afraid to let that go.

737,"So, I recently inherited from my grandfather who was a hunting enthusiast and a philanderer, not his most endearing traits, but anyways my mother has passed on to me his collection of rocks and hunting trophies and old books, well knowing that since I'm currently unemployed I go around flee-markets and the such to make myself useful and contribute to the household. To give you a bit more background I am a single child in a shit-economy country and I rely on the occasional odd job and my mother's income to survive, not proud of it but also not from a puritan country (it's quite normal to live in big families and to help each other out here e.g. up until recently my grandfather was living with us and not in a nursing home). So I was looking through his stuff to figure out if something would be more valuable, and this horn stood out. I checked online and it is a small rhino horn (500g), and apparently this is:  
(a) illegal to own unless you can demonstrate how it was purchased and I definitely can't.   
(b) worth a lot to some people  


So I have a moral and economic quandary here. I could do with the money but the market behind rhino horns is shit and contributing to their extinction. If I decide that since that rhino in particular has been dead for over 50 years, still there is no legal way for me to sell this thing.

740,"I (17f) am an introvert, but I also love acting. I know it's a bit hypocritical, but when I'm in a role and therefore not me I'm not the socially anxious part of me anymore, so I'm fine with acting and I love it. So when I learned about a class similar to drama class being offered at my school I signed up immediately. I've already been in this class last year, and so far it's been great, a lot of fun but I also learned loads. Now we decided we want to do a larger project. We already selected a play. Our group consists of 5 boys and 6 girls. In the play there's three couples, they're all showing different variations of romantic attraction on stage. Our teacher decided that the best approach at the play would be to just experiment which people work great together as a romantic couple. This is absolutely understandable as the couples, especially one of them, are the main characters. It started of with a task where we were to stand separated by gender in different corners of the gymnasium and then had to walk to the other corner and meet one of the guys from the other corner in the middle to do some couple-specific acting. The first pair straight up kissed which set some pretty high standards. 

I'm uncomfortable with the idea of kissing one of them for several reasons. Out of the five guys there's only one I like (in a minor friendship but definitely nothing more than friendship kind of way), three I barely even know and one I don't really like. I'm also single and I have been all my live, I never willingly kissed anyone before, and the little girl in me always imagined my first kiss to be romantic, somewhat special and with someone I loved. Theatre class just can't keep up with this probably idealistic idea. There were also certain situations in my life that involved men threatening me in a sexual way. I would prefer to not give a lot more detail on this, but this is why I'm uncomfortable when I'm very close to a male person or when I'm alone with a guy who is stronger than I am if there's no one around. And I'm also queer, meaning I'm not sexually interested in any dude at all, so I'm  quite uncomfortable with the idea of kissing a guy in general, even if I didn't have these issues. 

Today we had to do another one of these couple tasks. We were set up in couples and had to connect five actions to a short nonverbal scene. One of these actions was kissing. Luckily I had been teamed up with one of the guys I barely knew but didn't dislike. He was okay with me not wanting to kiss and respected it. However we still had to act that kissing part. We ended up acting like he was  attempting to kiss me and I was leaning away from him. While this was a rather smooth way of how things went, I was still uncomfortable. The way he attempted to kiss me was very similar to one of the situations when a man had approached me in a sexual way and was not willing to let me get out of this situation. This specific experience has been about half a year ago, and I'm still very uncomfortable and ashamed about it, and I hate being reminded of it. We had to act this scene several times in front of the group, and also watched the other groups. Especially one of them did a scene that was at least close to a r*pe scene, it involved physical violence as well as running after the girl and eventually hunting her down. It was so hard to watch them act this and when they were done immediately start laughing and joking. 

I'm really having a hard time with this class by now. I used to love it, but now I'm scared of it. Every class when we did such couple things, especially when we were changing partners, I was incredibly anxious because there is one boy I believe would absolutely kiss me. Especially today I was on the verge of tears for a large part of the lesson. But I'm also wondering if I'm not just being prudish as everybody else is just fine with it. 

Completely leaving the class forever isn't possible due to school rules. I've thought of just skipping the next few lessons, but I'm scared I might end up having to play one of the lovers if I'm not there to make excuses. I also can't really think of reasons to tell my teacher why I'd be missing only her class for several consecutive weeks. I'm not at all experienced when it comes to skipping classes. The only idea I have is faking a migraine, and I really can't get a migraine every week at the same time. Besides I also need my mums signature if I miss any lesson, and even in the unlikely event of my teacher not noticing I'm permanently skipping her, and only her class my mum will notice for sure. My mum knows I'm queer, but doesn't know about those certain situations I mentioned. Telling her about it is not an option. 

I'm also scared that I might have a mental breakdown in theater class. I once had an anxiety attack in another class, but my theater teacher walked past while I was getting some fresh air, so she knows, and I'm scared she might call my parents if it happens again. There were also some other occasions where I had breakdowns at school, and even though I do my best to conceal it some teachers seem to always walk in on me in the worst moments possible.  I believe my theater teacher knows of at least one of the other breakdowns. Because of this I can't talk to her about it, because she's really intelligent and might figure out more than I want her to. Besides that I don't want to seem prudish to her either. 

My teacher will be out next week, but she already mentioned we'll carry one with the task of today's lesson in two weeks. I'm anxious about it, but I also feel like it would be rude and unfair towards the guy I acted with today if I don't show up, as none of this is his fault and he'd be left without a partner and potentially without a task next class. But as we will have to continue working on what we did today I feel like if I turn up I'd be putting him into a situation where he potentially has to deal with me crying, panicking and freaking out and that wouldn't be much nicer.

So should I go, and if I go, how can I handle this? And how can I avoid having to play one of the lovers without being too obvious about having some issues?",07Nov2019,1

744,"The detectives contacted me before his wife and children when he passed suddenly last year. I was in his phone as his girlfriend. He was legally married and why they wouldn’t contact the family first I don’t know . When I learned that he was married I chose not to go to the funeral out of respect for his young daughter of 11 and his wife. It was extremely hard for me
To not have closure but I love/loved him so much that I also cares for the people he loved. We were together for 3 1/2 years. The last half year he told me his work transferred him
Out of state but really he moved back in with his wife. I found this out after he passed. I also found out that he lied to be about his age, name, marriage status, kids, being vegan and much more. He even told me he had a twin which didn’t turn out to be true. All of this was extremely hard for me to process because it was opposite from the man I knew. I’ve stayed clear of his wife because I couldn’t imagine what she would be feeling having kids with him
And their very long history. I wanted to be respectful and not make life harder. It’s been over a year and I still don’t have a straight answer on how or why he passed away. The report is in process by the police department and they said he had insulin with him and I never knew him to be sick. I have a million questions and I know she doesn’t owe me anything. I usually put other first but it’s killing me. I feel she has to know more then I do! Especially because it seems that he was actually crazy or a sociopath or maybe just a straight up jerk. Is it wrong or me to reach out to her? To ask her what she knows? If he was crazy? If he was sick? With  all these lies I wonder if The person I knew and loved was real at all.

I'm apart of this program in YMCA and they reached out to me to see if I wanted a job/internship. To give you some background info, I'm 18 with a GED and no work experience whatsoever. They asked me a few questions and I told them I like cars.

I'm not only anxious about meeting the owner there but also what they'll think of my credentials. I'm not sure what the people at YMCA told them. The person working with me at YMCA told me they can meet with me there next week to see the owner.

I have so many things that should make things be happy and stable a close friend, a job, a somewhat loving family, im in college, and a fair number of kind of friends.  However I can't stop myself from this cyclical cycle of having a good week to then feeling super depressed to the point of considering what happens if I jump off a bridge. While I'm in this mood I act differently and it impacts everyone I care about. I used to blame it on some sort of contributing factor like losing my job, learning a deep rooted family secret, or my dating life getting fucked up because someone betrayed me. Now though I just wonder if I'm the problem. Everyone says I'm a great person because I care about people and I never try to do any asshole things. I just don't think that's true. Eventually I turn into a walking talking mood killer when I'm depressed and I can never escape it or stop. I'm always trying to suppress it but it's hard to just shut it down and distract myself. Therapy only seems to stall it for a bit but that's starting not to work. I'm afraid that one day I'll just ruin everything and ruin everything going for me and after that finally die.

Yesterday we had a falling out for the same reasons. I’m 22. I don’t have my own place I don’t have my drivers license my only true source of income is my part time job at a dying retail company. I got into stocks. I was up $300 for the past month. I let my ego take over I never felt more alive I started depositing over and over again. Each time more ambitious that I’d make more. Yesterday during an argument I lost $200 and when I got feelings of remorse I let it ride and lost another $800. I’m down $1,000. I know this may seem like not a lot to some or a ton to others. From my perspective this was the pinnacle of my depression. I cried honestly for the first time today. I can’t seem to see better days. I want to better myself after this loss and I want to be able to provide for my future wife. Those 1,000 I can make back in a month but from my view it’s as if I’d lost 1 million. I have been the most disgusting frugal person for the passed year. And yea money comes and goes but that’s why this made me bleed.

Everytime I get asked why I picked this degree or how it will make me money I tend to keep my chin up although it causes me much anxiety inside. After this loss in the market this big mistake idk what I should do next. I seem to have a catalyst for good things. I want to get into sales and maybe save up for a portion of law school. I just don’t know yet. I just need any advice I can get.

758,"I was always interested in my education, I did all my work, I did homework, classwork, I payed attention, I was reserved, quiet, and I only had about 3 close friends. Now, I'm in high-school, I procrastinate, I am afraid of being myself, I'm anxious, and I have loads of friends that are keeping me from my goals and dreams. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of my friends are extremely entertaining people, but they've began to make me self-conscious and unaware of what I'm doing. I've began procrastinating A LOT, I barely do any assignments for school. I've also been terrified of coming to school and have lost loads of sleep. I was absent 30+ days first semester. My friends are very sympathetic towards me and have offered support when I have panic attacks, I am very aware they only understand to some extent but I know they're trying their best. All of my friends continue to lean on me and lay all their problems out on me. Sometimes I feel unable to express sympathy towards them because they put themselves in that situation and I feel as if it's stupid (which makes me feel selfish and fake). My friends expect me to be the life of the party, I lash out on some of them and sometimes I can't relate with any of them. I definitely don't want to blame my friends for my mental and emotional problems. I also feel very pressured to do specific things around my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to school now, I HATE it. I have moments in the day where I'm happy, but I only get about 3-5 hours of sleep every night and am extremely unmotivated. I wish I was independent and didn't have to worry about pleasing others around me. I am very anxious about some of my work, and sometimes in my classes I breakdown so badly because of a class presentation we have to do. I've even thought of online school, but my brother convinced my mother to not enroll me into an online school because it'd be dumb, and I had more capability. I also am very obsessive over how my work looks and how I perform on an assignment. If my essay is not up to my standards, or is not appealing to me, I trash it over and over again- which takes up hours of time I could be working on it.

761,"Hi,
I could really use some advice on a situation I'm in, currently.
I live at the dorms during the weekdays, because my high school isn't close enough to my home. On the first day we moved in this year, we found out we had an ant infestation. The staff said they set some traps and that it should clear up in 3 weeks. It sounded reasonable. They also said to keep any electronic devices home, as they could get infested, too. This is where the problem arose. I'm going to a school with a big emphasis on IT. 4+ of my classes are based on using a computer, the other classes don't require it, but it's a big advantage to have an access to some programs.
3 weeks seemed reasonable, as we haven't started learning that much, but after 3 weeks I kind of had to take my laptop with me, as the classes were beginning to NEED computer usage. I was very careful with my laptop, since it means a great deal to me, and always put it in a bag when I wasn't using it. It apparently wasn't enough because my laptop got infested with ants. I was absolutely furious. I worked hard to pay for that laptop and to see it like that, because of something that wasn't even my fault, enraged me to no end.
I barely managed to clean it, but it's doing well now. The thing is, I need the laptop for school immediately. I don't want to put it in danger again, but I have work to do, as we are 3 months into the school year. The infestation hasn't improved at all.
The dorm computers are 2 for one floor of students, and of course, they are always taken. Besides, the computers themselves are locked in wooden boxes, so we ""wouldn't steal the parts"". We don't have an access to USB ports or headphone jacks.
The computers in the library have got a usage time limit of 1 hour, and that's not nearly enough to get anything done. I'd barely install the stuff I need and the time would be up.
The computers in my school library are also an option, however a bad one as well, because my classes end 20 minutes before the library closes.
Now, today the woman in charge of us brought some wonderful news. They have investigated the infestation and it's a big problem. They will set some new ant traps, that are hazardous for our health, but we'll have to put up with it. The kicker? The whole process will take up 5-8 MONTHS. That is almost the whole school year!! I don't know what to do.
The ants are EVERYWHERE, in our clothes closets, in our hygiene products, school supplies, on fresh clothes after getting out of a shower, on our beds, some died in my roommate's water bottle, she even had to throw a new notebook away because a pile of ants the size of a fist got into a hole in the notebook and stayed there. The staff is trying to blame the food we have in our room, but all the food is packaged properly and is thrown away right after being eaten, and the ants aren't even around the food, seeing as they're in the closets for our clothes exclusively. It's disgusting and annoying enough, but I cannot take my school performance dropping and not being able to have my computer around.
Nobody wants to do anything, it's like nobody cares. I have nowhere else to go and don't know what to do. Any advice?",07Nov2019,1
762,"Hello! I'm new to r/advice, and I'm hoping I could get some advice on a recent situation that has been bothering me more than I expected. This may seem unrelated to me, but it has to do with my bf's little sisters bf. They have recently gone through a rough break up, and by rough I mean completely explosive and dramatic. Her bf accused her of cheating, started berating and attacking her on social media after the breakup, and even bullied and harassed her at her school and had his friends following her around calling her a slut and other bad things. The sister is 15 and her bf is 16. He has also threatened to beat up my bf and has sent a video of one of his friends saying that he was involved with my bf's sister sexually to her parents. The dad had to kick the bf out when he came to their house and started screaming at the sister. They even changed the lock passcode on the house door to make sure he doesn't get in. It was obviously a pretty rough break up, and I and my bf's family have been supporting her through it ever since.  

Yesterday, me and my bf get home and I see his sister and her bf sitting on the couch in the living room. It has been about two weeks since the breakup, and now they are back together. My boyfriend knew about this so he wasn't shocked when we got home yesterday.  Once we got home, we went to the gym together, along with my bf sister and her bf who also wanted to come along. And during the car ride, everything just felt wrong to me. My bf was making casual conversation with his sister's bf as if nothing happened. I talked to my bf yesterday about this and I told him about how I felt about the situation. I told him that I don't understand how his parents could allow the sister to keep seeing the guy after what he did. He's clearly not mature enough for a serious relationship and their relationship is obviously toxic. He is a possessive bf and one of the big reasons why they broke up was because he didn't want the sister hanging out with other guys, or even talking to any other guys. 

My bf's response was something along the lines of ""I trust my sister to make her own decisions, if she feels like she wants him back in her life then that's up to her. She tells us everything, and we trust her to do what she feels is right."" I understand that their family has a tight bond, and they believe in treating everyone fairly and equally, but this whole situation to me is a giant red flag that I feel like the whole family is just not seeing at all. My bf said he talked to his sister's bf and that he said he has bipolar disorder and he's trying to work on himself etc, but I feel like in light of what happened, what he did to my bf's family and to the sister is inexcusable. I have been dating my bf for two years and have grown close to his family, I know how much his parents value the safety and well being of their children which is another reason why I am perplexed at how they decided to handle the situation. My bf asked me to drop the convo because I don't understand his sister enough to know the family's reasoning behind all of this. 

I can't help but feel irritated and scared for his sister. This is a toxic high school relationship and in my opinion, it will not last. Also, if or when they break up, I have a strong feeling that it's gonna be just as explosive as the first break up, if not worse. I genuinely fear for the sister's safety, I have also been in a toxic relationship where my bf tried to control me and getting out of it made me see how bad the relationship really was. I feel like my bf's family is just brushing it off way too easily and I don't think the bf deserves a second chance. The sister is smart and kind, she deserves someone 100x better than her current bf. I don't know how to go about this without putting a strain on my relationship. I know it is not my relationship, and honestly, I agree that it really isn't any of my business, but I can't help but feel like something is wrong in the way this is being handled. I don't know what I should do at this point. I'm sticking to trying to ignore it for the moment. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.",07Nov2019,1
763,"Howdy. I've written this so many times so I'll keep it concise.

TLDR: can't keep my head clear when I've got fluctuating goals and self-doubt. Any advice on how to change my lifestyle would be sweet!

Including commutes, I work 7:30am-6pm. I do software development and get paid well. I'm a decent runner and got a 1h41 half marathon a month ago. I'm new to BJJ but want to improve. I want to learn to draw. I want to be strong, healthy and flexible. I want to be a good friend and son. I want to have a partner but have never had physical contact with one. I want to get better at running. I want to be a great developer.

But, sometimes I don't want to do anything. I'm either lethargic after dealing with the commutes, demoralized by never-ending work, anxious about the uncertain future, or I start questioning whether these goals are truly what I want or just a way to escape who I am. Sometimes I just think my goals are pointless.

With these two opposing forces, how do I stay clear-headed? Both prevent me from purely relaxing because that's neither progress nor inaction. It feels like I'm juggling these two things all the time and never moving forward or taking a break.

769,"Hello, all.
I am 14-year-old girl from the US. In a couple of weeks, a band I’ve been listening to for years will be coming to my city. My Mom has already purchased two tickets, but I feel that her coming with me is unnecessary. I’ve been to at least 4 other concerts in the last few years, and while I have always gone with another person, I spend much of my time at the show alone. 

I don’t find it necessary to have her present, because I  have functioned completely fine at shows in which she was nowhere nearby. I believe I’m smart enough to understand when a situation is escalating, but I could also be unintentionally overestimating my ability.

I have been treated maturely for much of my life, and the juxtaposition between being emotionally treated like a 16 or 17-year-old until I politely request to do something alone is  frustrating. I am a responsible, self-sufficient figure in my household until I ask to do something alone. Then I am a child. 

(Side Note: My Mom is a single parent. I communicate with my Dad, but he has no custody and doesn’t have a job. My Mom raises me and my twin brother alone, and often talks to about money or life problems and entrusts me to be “the mature one” out of my brother and I. I believe she treats me maturely because she doesn’t feel as much of a burden of parenting.) 

Many of my classmates (sophomores) are also attending concerts alone among other things, but my Mom doesn’t believe this.

I don’t know what to do. Seeing this band alone would mean a lot, and I am tired of being treated like an adult when it is most convenient for my Mom. 
Any advice is welcome - I really would appreciate all thoughts, especially from people who often attend concerts, even if they are not in my favor.

Thanks :)",07Nov2019,1

I’m in a point of recovery at the moment, but I’m still in a very fragile state as far as food, weight loss, etc. goes. About a year ago, I (23F) was at a really healthy weight of 145lbs at 5’8”, but I got there through pretty unhealthy means (bingeing/purging, excessive exercise, strict calorie counting). Over the past year, I’ve healed a lot of my disordered tendencies but put on about 20lbs in the process. I’m at the point where I’m desperate to lose the weight again and am wanting advice on how to safely do this without having to resort to methods that will trigger me in the process. I currently eat healthy meals and exercise about 4 times per week, but I’m really not sure where to go from here. I also have an office job in marketing, which I know isn’t helping. 

Basically, I’m hoping for weight loss tips that don’t involve calorie restriction, excessive exercise, or cutting out any specific foods to avoid falling back into an eating disorder. For example, things I can do at the office, throughout the day, etc, to kind of give my body a boost.

773," Hello r`/`Advice, how are you?

I'm procrastinating on writing my motivational letter for a university application and I'd really appreciate some help. Of course, I read a few guides on the internet, and I got the impression that you have to be very excited about what you're applying for. The thing is, the chosen degree, Mechatronics, was a vague decision based on what I thought my general interests were, as I am interested in ""machines"". However, I don't have any interests that I think would bear any significance in higher education, not to mention I am demotivated and at my lowest point in my life so far, having no ambitions and ideas as to what to do in the future. I don't have new hobbies and I barely have the curiosity to spare for any new interests, all of which I believe is the root cause of my procrastination. What's also stressing me out is the fact that I just barely passed last school year by the skin of my teeth. My grades weren't good at all and were quite erratic, which adds to the pile of worries I have regarding my educational future, because university may provide me a chance to study abroad, and this might leave a bad impression as I want to move out of my country and live somewhere else. I definitely aim to turn things around in my senior year (Grade 12).

Some background: I’m 32 and Male.  I’ve been dating a woman for the last 6 years, and in the last year we moved in together and I proposed.  I’m a high-functioning autistic, and she’s spent her life battling against Borderline Personality Disorder.  The first few years of our relationship had a lot of rough points as we grew to understand each other.  She would be afraid of me letting her down or leaving her, and I did plenty of the hurtful things a well-meaning person with Aspergers would do.  We did counseling for a few months, worked hard on the techniques we learned, and the last several years have been wonderful.  I’m very excited to spend my life with this wonderful, giving woman.

I have a decent job in the finance industry making a little less than $20 per hour, with a decent window of promotions available in my career even if I don’t enter management, enough that I should be able to live comfortably secure until retirement and beyond.  She, however, is still struggling to get gainful employment appropriate for her age and skills, so now and then expenses come up that I need to help her out with, like car repairs.  I figure that we plan to spend our life together, so I try to see our income as one that is pooled between us.  That said, she racked up some credit card debt a few years ago, and I’m making payments on a few extravagances that would have been no problem if I didn’t have to help with her burdens.  Money is very tight, but now that our lessons have been learned, we looked at our budget and found a path forward to get us out of credit card debt by early March of 2020, though each of us will still have years of student loan payments ahead of us.  We also recently moved into a 3-bedroom townhouse with two roommates in order to help save money.

So, I’ve been in high spirits lately as I feel that we’re taking control of our lives, and will probably be able to have a nice traditional wedding within two years.  I’m in this mood last night when my world started falling apart.

We were in the living room, talking and joking around with one of our roommates.  Right as a conversation is ending, she transitions to me and says, “I have something difficult I’ve been needing to tell you, but I don’t know how.”  I joked that as long as she wasn’t going to tell me she was pregnant or cheating on me, I’m sure it wasn’t a big deal.  She indicated to me that, yes, she was pregnant.

The delivery was bizarre.  It was strange to me that she did this in front a roommate despite saying that she wants to keep it a secret.  She claims that she just forgot he was there, even though we had all been speaking moments before.

I had a lot to think about, but came to the conclusion that I loved this woman, and I would in no way try to pressure her out of having the child.  As scared as I was that I was once again losing control of my life, I knew she had to be just as afraid.  Due to her (very) small size, she says that there is a large chance (50% maybe) that the child won’t last past 12 weeks, and she doesn’t want to start worrying about how we will make ends meet until that time comes.  She has miscarried once in the past already, when she was much younger. (She’s 34 now.)

We spoke about things for a while in bed, and ended up making love before sleep.  We did so unprotected (for the first time in my life) since, “Fuck it, we can’t get more pregnant.”

This morning, I realized something was odd.  She mentioned that she had gone to a clinic the day before to confirm it before telling me, but I realized with what I knew of our schedules that day that it wasn’t possible for her to have.  She apologized and said that she must have been confused, and that it was Tuesday.  She then said she was with a friend from work who took her.  This confused me more, since I knew that she had driven herself to work that day.  She’s never given me reason to think she’s up to anything really bad, but she’s the type to make a white-lie now and then to try and save face.  She’ll also often make a claim about something that she isn’t an expert on, and then when challenged will double-down and invent evidence that she has seen supporting her position.

I began to wonder if maybe she had known for longer and was afraid of telling me or something like that, and wasn’t being totally honest about when she went in.  Then I began to worry that maybe something else was wrong, and that I could help if I knew.  So, knowing full well that I would sound like an asshole by expressing doubt over any of this, I continued to push her about why the timeline she was presenting me didn’t add up.  I texted her asking for permission to look at her google travel timeline.  She was properly upset, but told me to if I didn’t feel like I could trust her.  I felt awful, but since I had the permission, I did not waste time in denying myself the information.  Her Google account was on a tablet I take to work, though I had only ever used it to collect items for her in Poke’mon Go, since I sit on top of a gym and a Pokestop at work.

The timeline didn’t add up.  I took screenshots of each day this week, and none of them allowed for her to have had time to go to a clinic.  Then, shortly after I started looking, her timeline started disappearing, as if she was deleting it from her phone.  I don’t know what’s going on, and I feel like my world is falling apart around me, so I took some PTO to step away from my desk and figure out what to do.  I don’t blame her for deleting that history if I am wrong and just being a jerk, but I need to talk to somebody and figure out what to do.  I don’t want to go to friends or family and hurt either of our reputations, especially if I’m wrong.

God, I love this woman.  Please help me.",07Nov2019,1
778,"I am 19 years old, i have 3 siblings that are 13, 8 and 6. I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. My parents are posing constant threats to all of our safety and consistently blame me and the other kids for it. They're alcoholic issues and fits are too much for everyone in the house to handle. They violently fight all the time.  They don't fulfill their responsibilities and then blame everyone else for it. The kids go to school maybe once or twice a week and then they get blamed and yelled at and punished for it. They have aimed guns at me, the kids, and at each other with full intent to shoot to kill because they were drunk. We have bullet holes in our house from accidentaly discharging firearms. They have also LOST guns in the house with zero clue as to their where abouts because they were drunk. I go to sleep every night wondering if I'm gonna be killed in my sleep because they can't keep their shit under control. The animals live in crates that they can't turn around in and only come out to eat and use the bathroom, and this is not the first time that has happened; we have put down dogs because they went feral after being locked in crates for their entire lives. It gets physical way too often. The kids worry about bills to the point where they come up to us asking if we're going to help with bills because 'mommy and daddy told us we have no money for bills.' The only reason I haven't gone to the police yet us because my step dad is a 3 strike felon and he would go to prison for the rest of his life. On top of that I'm concerned what would happen to the kids after all this is done. I also know for a fact that if nothing gets done in time the kids WILL suffer because of it.

780,"I'm autistic and very anxious. Please try to be understanding and patient with me.  

My coworker and I have tables literally about two inches away from each other. She's nice, we get along well and she seems to like me well enough. I was emptying a pencil sharpener of its shavings when I accidentally got some of the shavings on the floor. Without thinking, I took a tissue from her tissue box sitting at the edge of her desk, less than 6 inches from my hand, to clean up the shavings. She was sitting at another table a few feet away when just two seconds after I had grabbed the tissue, she rolled her chair over to her desk, grabbed the box of tissues, and put it at the table she was sitting at, away from where I was.

Do you think she did this because she didn't like that I took a tissue from her tissue box? Is she just super particular about people touching ""her"" things, including her tissues? I didn't even think about it, it was just a tissue sitting on the very edge of her desk. Should I have not done this? I would never just reach over shuffle through someone's things  and grab something, I understand how that would obviously bother someone. But it was just a tissue, sitting in the very edge of her desk, just inches from my hand. Obviously I'll never do it again but did I really fuck up that badly, that she felt the need to actually take the box of tissues away from me? I mean, I guess I don't know for an actual fact that that was the reason she suddenly moved the tissues but I have no idea why else she did that. I feel horrible. I invaded her personal space and I didn't even think about it. Please help me to not be so emotionally messed up about a silly tissue.",07Nov2019,1
781,"So as stated... my brother’s wife is an animal hoarder (still together) and I’m having a hard time with it. She just acquired a Great Dane, they have two other large breed dogs as well as a salt water aquarium, two fresh water tanks, a blue macaw, an 18 lb bearded dragon and rabbits. All this fits inside (none stay outside) their 900sqft house with their young child in addition to 3 horses they pay to board elsewhere. They work blue collar jobs, one a Sheetz employee (a gas station fast food combination, for those that don’t know what that is) and the other an RV salesman. They went a whole year and a half not being able to afford a new clothes washer and washed their daughters clothes at a laundromat after theirs broke. 6 months after the washer broke they spent $1000 on a new puppy and continued another year at the laundromat. They don’t make amazing money and I’m honestly concerned about my niece.... I KNOW she is my brothers world and he would do anything for her and I also know he is in a tough spot. They are having a difficult time affording the animals and their bills but the animals are family to the three of them now. It is a common occurrence that when his wife finds a little extra money he will come home to another animal or fish for the tanks despite them having multiple discussions about having too many and not getting any more. Her Facebook posts are riddled with posts about depression and “happy” posts about her horses and animals, but you would be very hard pressed to find anything about her daughter and husband. Her entire life revolves around her animals and her family comes second, it eats me up and I wish there were something I could do.

794,"I  never actually got diagnosed with depression, but, for the last 3  years, I have frequent thoughts of suicide (several times every day),  very poor self image, constant feelings of worthlessness, and have been  isolated for almost all of my 20 years of life. I'm currently going to  therapy, even though it's not affordable for me, and am considering  consulting a psychiatrist in order to get antidepressants through the  public health system (I live in Brazil). I'm not 100% sure whether I  have depression or not, but my mental health sure is an obstacle at the moment.

I want to join  my country's army, and I have one last chance at attempting the officer  exam (I'm 20 and the age limit is 21). It's a pretty competitive exam,  with 400 slots, disputed by over 30,000 young people in the entire  nation, and each candidate has to dominate high school-level maths,  physics, chemistry and other subjects. It's almost like an SAT exam.

The  thing is, I've tried studying by myself for the last 3 years, but would  always quit halfway through the year and start over the next year. I'd  get stuck on trying to solve problems and end up frustrated, which would  build up over time, and I would end up quitting after less than 6  months of studying. I didn't make any significant progress over this  entire time, and it's something that makes this situation much more  challenging and makes me feel a lot worse about myself.

Although  I still have one last shot at attempting the exam, I really feel like  quitting studies altogether, indefinitely, because of depression. We're  struggling financially at home and I'm considering just getting a  minimum wage job. I just am not sure whether it's a good decision, since  I've never made a good decision in my life, and I always regret  anything I do.

Is there any hope  on trying to study? If so, how can I overcome my mental problems while I  study? How can I get over those feelings of worthlessness when facing  challenges? Will antidepressants or any other sort of drug be of any  help?

I'm feeling kinda stupid  about posting this, it's pretty clear that pretty much all of the odds  are against me, and I feel very hopeless and pessimistic. It's my dream,  but I don't know what to do, if there's anything I can do. Any help is  welcome.",07Nov2019,1

810,"So I started going to the gym with 2 of my friends two weeks ago. For reference, we are all 18 y/o guys.  Since we don't live in same neighborhoods, our gym is halfway between our homes. So there is this guy at the gym, he is buffed and is clearly going to the gym for a long time. We have never spoke a word with him. His face/body gives off kinda badboy vibe, but through his body language when talking to others he seems really open and genuine.  


When we were walking to bus stop, he stopped his car next to us and asked ""Do you go towards neighborhood A (I use letters just for reference)? I can give you a lift."". My friends said ""No, thank you, we live in neighborhood B."". He just said ""Oh never mind then. Bye"" and drove off.  


The thing is that if I was alone, I would 100% without thinking accept his offer and get in the car with him without any thinking. I don't know why, I just didn't feel threatened. Was I wrong? Would accept or refuse the offer?",07Nov2019,1

I'll get straight (haha) to the point then.

Well, so I...like this girl. We've been friends for around 3 or so years. We've dated but only around 6 months but broke up... but I don't know if you'd actually say we ""dated"" when we've never been on a date before. The whole 6 months was kind of... okay. To me, it was all holding back my feelings of negativity for the whole time so that I don't bother her. I'd say I'm feeling the same as always but...you know, I wasn't. Because before we started dating I was avoiding her because I was nervous around her and for some reason felt like I need to create some type of space between us.

I was scared to be honest if our parents found out, ahah. We're both girls and... my fear made me break up with her because I didn't want her to get hurt because I asked her out. Religious parents, so..

.... I confessed I still like her recently and she responded with mutual feelings but it wasn't clear whether she actually wanted to get back together.

Like, I don't know. Ahahah. I feel like I'm doing this whole love thing wrong and it's just infatuation? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Is there something wrong with what I'm doing? I just dont know why I'm so pulled towards her. Am I ranting? My apologies.",07Nov2019,1

819,"Hi all, 

So currently, my family is adopting a new cat, Matty. He's an extremely friendly stray who's very talkative. If it weren't for him not being neutered and the fact that he was very skinny when we first saw him, I would've thought he was somebody's cat. My dad and I are really excited about it (my mom and grandmom took a bit of convincing lol). Everything's going well except for one thing, our other cat, Maisy.

We've had her for about 12 years now and she's honestly the best pet I've ever had/known. I lover her to pieces and she's basically my cat at this point since I feed her, clean her litter and she mostly sleeps with me. She really hates Matty. I was expecting this since I know cats can be territorial and she's been like this with other strays, but we've been feeding him for almost two months now and she hasn't gotten any warmer towards him. I've started switching out their beds because I read that that was a good way for new cats to become accustomed to each other, but I want to know if theres more I can/should do. 

Where I live it gets pretty cold in November so we're planning to bring Matty inside the house this weekend so he'll be safe from the cold and so he can get used to his surroundings before we get him fixed, if that makes any sense. I'm really worried about Maisy's reaction to this because she's about twice his size and could easily do some serious damage. Is there any way I can get them more used to each other? 

Also if anyone has any suggestions for names. My dad picked Matty but I think t sounds kind of goofy lol.",07Nov2019,1

825,"I was traveling home from an exhausting, but wonderful trip to Europe with my 12 year old daughter. We had already been traveling 30 hours when we got on our last flight home. It was a late night flight. 

We were sat next to a man who was obviously drunk or on drugs, or both. His pupils were huge, he smelled like booze, and he kept rolling his eyes like he was on ecstasy. He started talking to me when we sat down, and I didn’t respond much because it was apparent that I couldn’t have a true conversation with him. He was out there. He just kept dancing in his seat and kept touching my arms. He would try to get in my face to get my attention, but I ignored him. I didn’t want to engage. 

Right after takeoff, I started watching an inflight show. He got up to pee, as we were still lifting, and when he got back, he got in my face again, but I totally ignored him. All the sudden he grabs my crotch. I pushed him away really quickly, and he smiled, shrugged, and put his hands up to say he gives up. 

I sat there for 5 minutes processing what just happened. It was so surprising, and I couldn’t wrap my head around a stranger just grabbing me. I decided that I could not sleep by this man, so I got up to tell the flight crew, and asked to be moved. My daughter was asleep when it happened. 

The moved us right away, but they told me this was a zero tolerance kind of behavior, and they were going to take action. They also said they noticed he was wasted and shouldn’t have been allowed on the airplane. One of the flight attendants came and told me that the pilot was furious, and decided to divert the plane to have this man arrested. They announced that we were landing, and law enforcement would be entering the airplane. They removed him, then had me come out to speak to them. After that, they told me FBI was on the way. I spoke to them. They told me he was going to be prosecuted. The pilot talked to me, and apologized profusely. They had my daughter come with me while I explained everything. They were adamant about telling her that this behavior is never ok, and completely inappropriate. They were even more mad that he did that with her sitting next to me. 

This was all shocking to me. While I don’t think it’s ever ok for a man to put his hands on any woman without her consent, I didn’t realize he was going to be arrested when I asked to be moved. 

All passengers were angry at me. They didn’t know what had happened, but knew that I was the reason for the 2 hour delay. I was being ridiculed, and given constant dirty looks. I was being blamed. I was thinking maybe I shouldn’t have said anything, but then quickly shut that down because I know it was the right thing to do. 

It’s all I have been thinking about. I’m upset I was violated. I’m upset that my daughter had to witness all the drama. I’m upset that I pissed off everyone on that airplane, even though it wasn’t my fault. I’m upset that this one stupid action by an intoxicated man could have ruined his life. I feel guilty, and sad, although I know he was in the wrong. I just have so many conflicting feelings, and I know this is just the beginning.

Jim parted ways with his girlfriend yesterday. Now he told Kim, that he needs some time for himself. Kim got very angry bis this. They both were not at school today after Jim and Kim fought (not physically).

839,"Here's a little background to the situation. I bought a new car back in 2018 and took out a loan to help pay for the car while I was in college. I recently paid off the remaining balance of over $10k to save money in the long run by not paying interest going forward. When I sent the first check, I didn't include the account number (their instructions on their website did not say to include account number, you had to download a pdf to see that part) so when I called I was informed they wouldn't cash the check and it would be returned/destroyed (I forget the details) and that I would have to send another check with the account number.

Fast forward to today and I find out they cashed the first check yesterday and I'm way overdrawn now. Called my bank and they opened and investigation but that might take weeks+ to resolve. Called the motor finance company and they offered to mail me a check eventually. I highly doubt the ability of my bank or the motor finance company to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

Keep in mind I let J know how this is bothering me and is too much. He tries to talk to her but she doesn’t listen to ANYONE no matter what. Very selfish and manipulative type of lady.

Backstory, i dropped out of school at 15 and spent 2 years just coding and playing video games. I went back to school for my last year and failed, at that point I'd decided id consider becoming a mechanic. I got a job at an automechanics, but i quit after a month because the work environment was shit and I found the actual job in general to be incredibly stressful.

After that i was unemployed for a while, i took up various temporary jobs to pay board n stuff.

Got a farm hand job and worked that for a few months till i was unemployed again for a while. 

Eventually got a landscaping job, and now after months of that i want to quit again. I have work on a as needed basis and I havent been turning up of late.

I sought of had an epiphany recently at a party. I was very high, playing CS GO, and listening to music, and i was completely content. Nothing else was on my mind but the current task and i was just lost in the music. 

And since then I just kinda couldn't be bothered turning up to work. I mean obviously i need money and I'm gonna find something else but I dont see how this cycle isnt going to repeat again like it already has. 

I dont have any genuine idea of where I want to be, or what I want do. I dont feel particularly defined by anything as a person. I have done some not so very good things, but now I dont due to awareness of consequence, not moral fibre. The only ""value"" I could say I have is to respect nature and animals, thats probably the most important thing to me in terms of personal values. 

Ive gone out and experienced things for the sake of experience but it's brought me no deeper knowledge of myself or given me an urge to pursue new things genuinely any further. 

I'm decent with computers and programming and anything related since I've been programming since I was 9, I feel it would be a good option for me to go study for a computer science qualification but I just dont want to study. Or work. I dont gain any greater enjoyment than from when I minimise my responsibilities and just get to zone everything out. I like to learn things, learn things in my own time, but I feel no urge to accomplish tasks on standards set by anyone else, i gain no satisfaction from that. 

I dont doubt that if I tried to accomplish anything I wouldn't be more satisfied, cause currently im not, but I dont think id be any happier.

In terms of work I enjoy tasks with no challenge, I'd rather something mindless over any challenge because that's where im comfortable and happy, not necessarily satisfied but happier. 

I just dont know what to do at this stage, i dont know if anything i do I will genuinely pursue through fully, i thought i could go back to school and study for a computer qualification but then I got bored and failed, then I thought I'd be willing to pursue my backup, mechanics, but i came to hate it very quickly and now I dislike working on my own cars.",07Nov2019,1

854,I am getting a divorce and we have been separated for a while. I have met a few guys. I do have 2 kids. Everytime any of the guys text me it pretty quickly escalades to sex talk. Since I am getting a divorce it makes me feel that guys are either just using me since conversations sometimes get dull. I don't know if it's just because I was with my husband for 10 years before we separated and am just nervous. I just am getting a little weirded out because conversations always tend to lead to that so it is not good on the self esteem. Am I just over thinking this.,07Nov2019,1

I’m having pain in my stomach more than ever before, back pains, nausea, fatigue and i haven’t gotten my period but it’s irregular. I had sex 5 days before my period. I took 2 pregnancy tests and it’s only been week since me n my boyfriend did it. Idk if i’m too early since i already missed my period.",07Nov2019,1
856,"It was really weird. I was at my dads house where i lived at the time and my boyfriendwas at his house in another town. I was playing misic and watching some videos on YouTube on a Mac laptop. He was with me when i bought it and I believe i might of had it at his house a fee times. 

So it weirded me out when i started getting texts with lyrics each time i changed the song. Then i clicked on a video about a guy being addicted to having sex with fat old women. Then my boyfriend texted something about loving sex with fat old women. I wasn't sure how to respond. For some reason i didn't feel like i could get upset or call him out on it. 
I'm not sure if it was spyware or him being logged into my YouTube account. If he was spying why would he make it obvious?
Because if i was hiding something I'd be really really careful after that and then he wouldn't find whatever he's looking for. This was a few years ago but i was reminded of it recently. 

He has admitted to spying on my phone in the past because of paranoia and insecurity since his ex cheated on him. One time within the last two years he called ne while i was out and i told him to hang on while i plugged my phone in. He said in the most normal tine ""i know i hacked your phone."" He said that as if it was normal. I didn't react. 

For a while now i haven't had a reason to believe he's spying on me but I'm always looking for signs of spyware on my phone. I've tested it a few times by pretending to cheat with my own google number and nothing.",07Nov2019,1
857,"I am 16 and currently struggle with terrible depression and anxiety, my doctor has given me meds that have never been tested on minors so that is one thing.  However, he has done a poor job of following my health, my depression became quite severe about a year ago and he finally did something when we told him to.  My case could have been prevented much earlier as I rarely ate as a child and we recently took a blood test which stated that I was missing key nutrients which he said were unimportant, and my mother said things like folic acid should be checked in my bloodstream so we may find out what is happening chemically to me.  My doctor told her off as she does not speak English natively despite his currently living in USA, doctor said that it wouldn't be important to check my blood and that I have enough of vitamins in my body as I am still growing.  We took blood test with the doctor and he said I was fine and what meds I should take.  I read through the 10 page packet of info on my health, which was odd to read as many terms I was not familiar with were in there.  When I reached the last page it said I was missing many things in my body including folic acid, they company which provided the test for us to our doctor wrote to him they suggest I take supplements as I cannot process some foods correctly and it is ruining my health, our doctor wrote back to them he agrees with supplements.  However, we were quite confused when reading the packet at home as he never told us about this when at his office.  We have gotten the supplements on our own, I believe the doctor didn't want to tell us about the supplements as he is ashamed to be less informed than my mother from Latvia who went through communism and lived in poverty while my doctor was very well off getting his tuition paid by his wealthy family.

Now this is just my problem with him, but my mother had also suggested this doctor to an elderly family friend.  That family friend has just been diagnosed with cancer.  It turns out, he has been reporting symptoms to the doctor such as internal bleeding for about 5-7 years, and the doctor never did any testing or anything on it, he said the elderly man was fine.  That man went to another doctor bc he felt as though something was wrong only to find out he has been had cancer developing for nearly 10 years, and now its too big to cut out in surgery bc they took too long, so I think the sad truth is this elderly veteran will die because my doctor is garbage.  We think we should sue him but we dont know what to do.

Please someone help, everything is just going wrong for me right now, this elderly man is my only role model that I have, we think of him as family and I'm scared my depression will also get worse if he dies :(",07Nov2019,1
858,"I asked out a girl in college, to her im essentially just a guy from class that asked her out two years ago, she said no. I recently joined instagram and found her page.

859,"So basically the title, for the past week or so I’ve been going to the library after school for about forty five minutes a day and every time I go I sit at the same table as a boy about my age. I sit in that specific spot because it’s the quietest space in the library, especially on weekdays and he never. He never seemed to mind that I sat with him, especially because everybody knows the entire library is crowded on weekdays. The past couple of days he has said hi to me and asked me to watch his stuff while ho goes to do something. I want to start a conversation with him, but me being the absolute socially unaware dingus I am I don’t know how to go about doing this, or even if it’s a good idea. What should I do?",07Nov2019,1
860,"So I bought a used care almost two years ago now, its a nice 2013 Chevy Sonic. Fancy blue tooth radio. Never gave me too much trouble other than it constantly needed the thermostat checked as it was difficult to keep warm during the winter months. This year however I noticed a lot of leaks coming from the coolant system. So I get it checked out, needs new clamps, got it fixed, a week later, oh the hose is cracked, fixed that too. Oh the tank is bad and needs to be replaced. Fine cool, not that expensive. Then after everything in the system was replaced with new parts, it started giving me issues again. After this point I was practically an expert on my car. Checked it out, nothing seemed wrong, ran the coolant but something was up. Went to the guy I bought it from. (used dealership) Guy checks it, claimed I was lying or bsing him. Said it was fine, but I begged him to seal spots he thinks it might break in the future. So he did. The day after, the car breaks down, and the down engine arrow light goes on. I run it slowly and safely to the nearest gas station. The coolant wasn't even cycling, it was trying to suck it in, but got regurgitated back out the same tube it was supposed to go down into and bringing up some bronze looking powder. Got pissed and just took it to a chevy dealer. Guy tells me that there is patch clogging the tube and possibly caused the head cylinder or gasket to blow or warp. Now I am down a car for almost two weeks. Used dealerships is mad at me for not coming to him, and my father keeps insisting its no ones fault, and is angry when I say that I call bullshit on the used car dealer.  


So I have to ask, what the hell should I do about all this? Just brick it and sell it and get a new car. Fix it for possibly hundred or thousands of dollars and hope it runs from then on. (during the winter season). Or say fuck it and let my dad take it and give it to my little sister who wants her own car?",07Nov2019,1
