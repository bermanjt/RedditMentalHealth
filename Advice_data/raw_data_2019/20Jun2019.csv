0,"He got my number from a mutual acquaintance, and asked me out. After I said yes he said that he'd been falsely accused of rape twice. I don't know whether or not I believe him. I'm a feminist and several people close to me are sexual assault survivors and knowing rapists, a lot of them don't even know what they've done. I know I don't have the whole story but I'm extremely cautious and the longer I dwell on it the more nervous and off put I am by the whole thing. 

He's made prison rape jokes and already jokingly said he wanted to marry me. I move away for school in September and he said he's got family where I'm moving to and that it won't be a problem, just assumed I'd be okay with long distance without even one date. He could just be awkward and insecure, I know he's a gamer and a redditor, but I kind of don't want to be associated with him after that. I don't really know what to do or think at this point. Any ideas?",20Jun2019,1

3,"I've been (18F) dating a guy (18M) for two months and I only just realised now that he never really got over her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I kinda thought he wasn't over her at the beginning, but I've read a few articles about it and holy shit. He's literally been showing so many signs, and still is. 

&amp;#x200B;

They text and call constantly. He drops literally anything for her, including work. He would never do that for me, and sometimes cancels plans with me for his work (non-compulsory shifts). 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I'm starting to get the feeling it's becoming less important, but I can't help to feel gross thinking that I'm a rebound to him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to lie, I feel angry? Like I was used to get over his ex?

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I can't help but think that I'm stupid for sticking around with him? 

&amp;#x200B;

Like the relationship now feels so one-sided? 

&amp;#x200B;

He denies that he was ever 'not over' her. He says that he must not be articulating himself and that it makes him anxious that I am bringing this up.

Side note: I wrote a post on Reddit \[deleted\] that was at the beginning of this relationship, doubts on whether he was over her and everyone except one person told me to get out.",20Jun2019,1
5,"The children are 3 (female) and 5 (male). 

Their father is 60 years old and their mother, the ex wife, has become addicted to drugs so she now lives about an hour away and the father has custody. The children still go visit but come back obviously different.

The father and children live with the fathers girlfriend and she has a roomate. The house is absolutely disgusting. The father drinks at night and the only reason I know so much about what goes on is because they have fought in front of me and the children numerous times or because the roomate will literally spill everything to me about what is happening. 

Just yesterday everyone was home and i made lunch. The girlfriend and father were in the kitchen and the girlfriend yelled at the boy. The father snatched him up and yelled at the girlfriend. It just didn't make sense because theyre both in the wrong. The kids need disciple but it is as if they have no idea how to care for them, which may be the case. I understand they are trying, no judgements I am just concerned for the children.

The kids are extremely misbehaved and behind developmentally. It is really sad. The five year old does not know how to count and does not know the alphabet. They are violent with others and to each other at times and they dont follow instructions. They also have no attention span. 

I am not quite sure of the right decision here. I know the father loves them but something needs to change. I am comfortable saying something but I am unsure if the better decision would be to talk to a social worker. Doing nothing is non optional.",20Jun2019,2
6,"I know this might sound like a small and stupid problem, but to me it isn’t as I’m very sensitive and hate loneliness. Recently I’ve been finding out that many people think I’m annoying. People that I thought I was friends with actually dislike me and find me to be very annoying. Earlier this year two girls rejected me because they think I’m annoying. It hurts to know that barely anyone that you know likes your personality. I’m so upset and feel so lonely. I barely have any friends and when I do have lots of friends I lose them because of my stupid personality that consists of being annoying. I feel so weak and upset right now.

7,"So I’ve been good friends with this girl for about 2 years. Mainly everything was cordial and we hung out on weekends, talked frequently. I confessed my feelings for her about 8 months ago. We were kinda dating last summer for a bit and I must have messed up somewhere and she started to become a bit more distant ( still snap chatted everyday until I told her what was good). She responded very nicely and was really understanding even though she didn’t feel the same way. She texted me randomly a few months ago after we didn’t talk for about 2 months. We met up and everything was going nice but then she got upset about something (we were both pretty drunk at the time), and abruptly left. She apologized but didn’t give a reason for leaving the next day. After that I initiated convos with her in which she would reply as if she was into it and what not, but always stopped replying when I don’t ask a question in return (happened about 3 times). She rarely texts me first which does not seem like a good sign, but she’s a bit shy in general so I’m not sure. I haven’t talked to her in about a month and a half and kinda miss her. The issue is I don’t want to annoy her or seem like I’m just orbiting her. I want to text her to see how she is, but I think it could backfire a lot (honestly do not know how she feels about me in general). What should I do?",20Jun2019,1

She was my first kiss, I have a pretty good relationship with her family I think, and I guess this is kinda what love is like. I’m 15 by the way. When we hang out, I think it’s pretty enjoyable-we laugh a lot at stupid things, share stories, cuddle, watch classic movies, ya know. We’ve done escape rooms and I took her to her first concert and a stl cardinals baseball game. Which all of that I find pretty great, and I don’t want to lose that. But when we don’t hang out, all we do is text each other and FaceTime. Which I don’t have a problem with, but sometimes i just get bored texting her because it always kinda turns into the same conversation. It somehow always boils down into sending emojis back and forth, which is kinda embarrassing but whatever. I’ve always thought of it as we’re better talking in real life because we are which to me was a good thing but I don’t really want to be bored texting.

13," this is my (m17) first post but i feel i need to do it as it has been something I've been struggling to deal with since I was 15. I've been totally obsessed with fitness, aesthetics and the gym since i was 12 years of age. I absolutely love the gym and I could not picture my life without it. I've always been obsessed with food, fear of eating one cookie at the age of 14 in fear of losing my 'abs'. I've also played football at a decent level from a very young age but this problem i have in combination with other things has cause my love for football to fade. I attempted to deal my eating issue last year when I went to see someone (I was in a really bad place and luckily my parents noticed). I am in quite good shape for my age and I feel my physique is something people associate with me. Months went by and the binge eating episodes were less frequents but still occurred. Embarrassed, I hid this. I act as if im fine but im really not. I feel that tracking my calories has helped me a tiny bit but I still binge eat. It ruins my confidence for weaks and quite frankly controls my life. Binge eating leads me to not going out with my friends and trying to avoid other people. It leads to poor performances in sports which greatly affects me for weeks on end. I don't know if anyone could recommend anything for me to do or if anyone who has experienced this (I know people have experience much worse and come out better) can offer me a helping hand..days or weeks can be going great but can be ruined by this...

20,"Apologies for typos as my thoughts are spinning and I'm on my phone.

I've had this pattern of behavior mostly my whole life but it's been mild. But recently, I've had this simmering anger and resentment that I logically understand is unreasonable and petty. Yet, I still find myself (as a chronically single person full of a lot of insecurity) feeling like I'm ""owed"" a happy ending or what other people have. Mainly, because I feel I've I've played by the good cosmic rules and done what I could to do the right thing as much as possible, to fight materialism and trends and things that see superficial, act with what I consider integrity and kindness most of my life and sacrificing a lot of personal happiness for it. But on the flip side I'm judgemental and think shitty thoughts while projecting ""goodness"" only to get upset when I'm not achieving as naturally what another people are when it comes to dating, jobs, social standing, etc

I know this is wrong. I don't want to be this way. But when I sit back and see people who just use and abuse people or jobs or are what I consider inauthentic but project a ""coolness"" I dont feel I have I get so upset. And then I get upset at myself for being upset. And then I just fold in and its self sabotaging to the point I never think I will be the person I want to be without having to force it.

And yet, at my best when I'm not this way I have great friends who care and are patient with me and am adventurous and have a good job and so many things I should be proud of. But for some reason I struggle and even turn my back on those things and just want it to stop.

It's me and my younger sister in this house. I'm leaving and so is my younger sister. She's going to Wales in January for a few months and when she comes back, she doesn't know what she wants to do. Stay or leave again. My ma is on her own. She has no mates or partner.

She's renting this house and the contract is for the next 7 years. When it's up she has to leave and she'll be 60. I'm worried about will she get a new place in 7 years or not? And will it be for life or will she have to rent again for a few years or go into a nursing home. 

I ain't putting her into a nursing home. If it comes down to it, I'll put her into my house with my family. 

I'm just scared for my mother's mental state. She got institutionalised yesterday for a mental breakdown over the stress of my parents divorce. 

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to live my life but the other part is telling me to stay and be there for her and look after her. I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to her when I'm gone.

22,"(In short- I tried to achieve my dreams, however the plan failed after 2 months. I am now broke and unsure where to go next)

The whole thing has been a disaster. 

My bf (26) and I (27f) met just over a year ago, and bonded over our dreams of traveling. It was my first relationship, and 5 months in we decided to book the trip of a lifetime together. 

(With hindsight I can already see what an idiot I am). 

The trip was going to eventually take us across the globe, and we would find work as we went along and maybe even the golden egg of sponsorship at our country of choice. (Insert other pipe dreams here). I'd saved up a lot of money, and 4 months later we embarked on the trip.

2 months in, the cracks that had been there from the very start of the relationship opened up and it all went to sheet. After the initial breakup I was optimistic and planned to get a job then continue traveling, however the weeks following were a rollercoaster of emotional manipulation, and I decided to just go home to get away from him. I didn't feel safe being near him and had just enough money to cover my flight back.

Going home was the worst decision I have made so far. I am now back in the small town I grew up in, and while my family are supportive, they have made it clear that they think I'm a stupid niave idiot and I should never have put myself in that situation. I have barely any money left and nothing to show for the trip.

What I should have done was just get a visa for another country nearby and found work there. To make matters worse, he has messaged me to rub in how it is now all working out brilliantly for him and he is earning more than he ever did over at home.

Its been 3 days since I've been back, and I want to leave and start over as soon as possible. I've been applying for jobs and accommodation in the city, but I can't stop crying at inappropriate times and I have been feeling suicidal. I am worried my general 'Eeyore' state will impact any interviews I have.

26,"Sorry for the kind of click-baity title. I couldn't figure out how to word it as this is such a nuanced situation. 

My mother was recently diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer. While she's fine for the time being, the 5 year survival rate is about 30%. My mom hasn't strongly expressed a desire for grandchildren as she knows I'm probably 5+ years away from having my own. She has never put any pressure on me to have them now because she wants me to be 100% ready and settled. For reference, she had me in her early 30s.

I'm 22F, dating a great guy I'm 99.9% sure I'll end up marrying. Recently I've been having some weird symptoms that make me think I *might* be pregnant. I'm on the pill but I can't shake this gut feeling. Normally I would definitely abort. I always planned on having kids in my late 20s. There's still a lot of my life left to live first. However, I am financially stable and *could* raise a kid now if needed, and I know my partner would 100% support my decision either way. The child would have a good, middle-class childhood with 2 loving parents.

Obviously I need to take a pregnancy test and confirm my suspicions. I think I need to wait at least a week for an accurate reading. But my mind can't help jumping to the possible outcomes. I love my mom and want her to experience being a grandmother before her life is over.

I'm feeling so conflicted. I can't ask my mom, because if I do end up aborting, she doesn't need that stress. She would support my decision, but she would personally never abort so I know it would weigh on her.

TL;DR: If you were pregnant and you knew this might be the only opportunity for your mother to have a grandchild before she passes... what would you do? If you could ""make it work"" but the timing was really not ideal?",20Jun2019,7

Over three years ago I was really really into computers, I had dedicated machines with virtual boxes on it where I would do advanced pentests and talk to other netsec hobbyists who do close to the same thing. I had a CTF team and spent most of my day learning about and practicing stuff involving computer science. Then one day, that all changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started with me being framed for a DDoS attack. I had my stuff searched and it made my house hell because my dad was screaming at me because it looked like for a while I might actually end up on trial for this shit and he was convinced I did it. Luckily the real person that did it was found and I was let go. I then tried to apply for jobs involving it, but every job required a degree or experience. I had neither. I couldn't go to school because I had no savings and no scholarships. I was a white upper middle class dude with bad grades. Nothing to help me financially, family wasn't willing to help. My dad made it big in the 80s without a degree so clearly I could too today. Ugh. After a while I started to read more and more about the damage tech has done on modern society. I started to really see how much had been taken from my life. I started to really hate them. I was never good at them to begin with, and was slow burning since I started to get into them. I hoped one day I would be good enough I could do something, anything with it. Then I get the feds knocking on my door AGAIN trying to pin some shit on me, nothing happened because of it but the suspicion was once again brought on me because of the heavy amount of computer stuff I do compared to everyone else. At this point, I am ready to just throw away all my computers and my wifi and just go totally off the grid so I can stop worrying about the police and feds and all this dumb shit. I really want to be left alone at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do want to live off the grid though. I have never liked the big cities and like the idea of peace and quiet. Issue is not a lot of career paths allow for that unless I want to do a long commute. My knowledge of computers can open a LOT of doors for me to make money both in a job, and other stuff I can do when you have a solid knowledge in a specific field. The cyber security industry is booming right now and even though I have a six year jump start on most people around me, I don't care enough to go into it again. I really just hate computers because it does nothing but bring bad things into my life. It just makes me get screamed at, and ostracized, and hated.

30,"Hey everyone, the title essentially says it all.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really want to make this a sob story kind of deal and I also don't want to ask anyone for any monetary help so please don't assume that that is why I am here. A little background on me I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I am going to start by saying thank you for taking the time to so much as look at this. That alone means a lot to me. 

I struggle with some rather serious mental health issues. For reasons that I don't particularly want to get into, mainly because it's just so much information, I don't feel comfortable or safe going to a hospital. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I tried and failed to kill myself about a year or so after returning home from Afghanistan where I worked as a combat medic in the Army. Its been a really bumpy ride ever since. A couple of months ago I went down a pretty seriously dark rabbit hole and sort of lost my mind. I gave away all of my money. I still don't really know what happened. Because of my epic dumb ass decision, I lost my apartment and I lost my car. My phone service has been shut off and I have exactly $1.99 in my bank account. I don't know what I'm going to do. But right now I am trying to stay focused on important things. For instance, food and shelter.  I was able to get a hotel room for this month, but I'm running out of resources fast and I don't have anything planned for next month. I made sure to bring my laptop and Nintendo switch with me for the specific reason that I thought I could go to a pawn shop and sell them and that would give me a decent financial boost. Well, the closest pawn shop to me is a little over 6 miles away, which would end up being a 12-mile round trip walk without being able to use my phones GPS. Are there regular stores that I can go into to just sell stuff? Can I find people to sell stuff to on the street? Is there an area in a city that might be better for finding change or money on the ground?

I have a dog that isn't a certified service dog or emotional support animal, which is what is stopping me from getting into homeless shelters and the psych ward. She means everything to me and I won't just abandon her, regardless of whatever physical or mental consequences I personally have to suffer. She is the only good thing in my life and seeing her smile and jump around all excited is the only light that I have anymore. I can't just up and abandon her.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would really help. Seriously, any advice. And I am at a point where I am just an open book so ask me questions if you want clarifications. I need advice like a man dying of thirst needs water. In a lot of different areas. I don't have any friends, and when I tried to reach out to my dad he told me that I need to ""stop bitching so much"" Soooo, its been pretty lonely. Haven't talked to anyone in around 2 or 3 months except for people at the VA who can't really seem to help.

TL;DR  

  Borderline homeless and unable to pursue traditional services that could help. Want to sell stuff at an actual store since pawn shops are too

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).  I AM able to make eye contact, I hardly fidget, I'm more than okay with leadership, and speeches are no problem whatsoever! BUT when I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and old-friends have ended friendships due to me being too nice.

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is positive. I just want to be ""enough"".

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She probably tells me I'm ""too nice"" about once a month.

This could ruin my chances of getting into the industry, especially since women have higher expectations in so many areas than men.

So what are the basics of becoming an attractive woman? I don’t mean the cheesy stuff like “smile more” and “fix your posture”. I mean what parts of a woman’s face should be changed to not look like a drug dealer?",20Jun2019,4
35,"So I've been accepted into a good university for Music Performance. I enjoy the professors and atmosphere, and have been offered a scholarship that should pay for about half of my tuition. I am a transfer student who was explicitly told by my previous instructors to not take any music courses at community college, and instead focus on those classes at university. The school itself is three hours away from where I live in a large city that I have only visited once for auditions. 
Today, I was catching up with a friend of mine who is also a music major. He told me about how much better some of the freshmen are, the cutthroat competition, and that he decided to major in Mass Communications instead with a minor in Music Studies. He said he didn't feel secure in the music industry with all the talent around him, and that a Communications degree would guarantee him a job of some sort. I understood that there would always be people better than me, and that the industry is very hard to get into, but the way he said everything made me start panicking. 
I love music. It's my passion and I'd say I'm pretty alright at it. All of the concepts make sense to me, and I haven't gotten anything less than an A- in any of my music electives (I took Theory in high school and Music History and Piano I as an elective). My previous instructors have stressed the importance of connections and I take talking to potential employers very seriously. I love teaching music and it brings me a lot of happiness to see a student of mine finally get something. Despite all of this, I'm very anxious about my future and would hate to fail out of yet another school. 
English (because I'd probably double major in Communications/English) also comes very naturally to me. I don't like it as much, but I have gotten near-perfect grades in all of my English classes. Writing and analysis are interesting at times, and a drain at others. I'm not super into delving into fuddy-duddy classics like Great Expectations. I know that majoring in this would guarantee me a job just because of how fundamental English is. 
I've been having doubts about majoring in music for a while, but I chalked it up to anxiety from the uncertainty of it all. Part of me says to major in music for a semester, then see where I am. The only problem with that is that those courses can't transfer to a potential English degree, and that's a lot of money to lose out on. There's also the fact that the scholarship I received is only for music majors, and I would lose that if I changed majors. Then there's yet another fact that I chose this school specifically for its music program. There is a much better Communications school forty-five minutes away from where I live, that I wouldn't have to worry about a lot of extra costs because I could live with my parents (they told me I could stay with them if I chose this route). 
My friends tell me that I should follow my passion and stay with music, but my family says that I should be smart with my future and get a more usable degree, and maybe have a little music studio when I'm older. I'm at a loss on what to do, and I'm terrified of making the wrong choice.",20Jun2019,1
36,"Okay so I'm 17 and I'm starting to become closer to this guy at school.

Tomorrow the group is going to the park to play D&amp;D like we did today but I just don't know how to ask him for his number, or at least his snapchat. Like it's so easy to talk to him so when we talk, it's subject after subject so I don't have time to think about getting those digits cause it's nice talking to him.

41,"My parents are getting a divorce after my Dad decided to cheat on my mom and wanted to be with this other woman. He essentially only communicates with my mom unless it's about the divorce matters. He also cut off all relations with my older sister both financially and emotionally and this tears me apart because they were incredibly close and she saw my dad as both her mentor and her best friend. Recently my dad screwed her over through which ended with her crying, but I don't know all of the details. I know that my dad is still somewhat mad at my sister for the fact that when he tried to leave my mom, she stopped him, and after trying it again with my mom (and failed), he went back to this other woman and started distancing myself away from sister. My dad still wants to have a relation with me and he's starting to become a sort of mentor for me (which is funny in the sense that all of the life advice he gives me, he never followed in the past). However, I don't know whether he's doing this because I'm his child or because I don't look down on his new relationship (I actually do), or because he wants an advantage in court, I don't really know. I'm just wondering two things

1. How do I figure out whether or not I can trust my dad?
2. Should I help my dad and sister build a relation? 

( I know my sister still wants a relation but I don't if my dad is a trustworthy person anymore). Anything would really help, I just need help figuring this out because I can't ask anyone that I know in person.",20Jun2019,1
42," 

Throwaway account incase anyone digs this up or anything. Just some background: I'm young, and I dated this guy (We'll call him G) for almost a year and a half and broke things off a week ago. We still talk and we still go out sometimes and there's the occasional kiss here and there but we both agreed that we wouldn't rely on each other or have any ""commitment"" in our friendship in the way it was in our relationship? I know I know, it's very messy and not defined. We're both a little confused but we agreed that we still want some intimacy but not like a girlfriend boyfriend thing? I dunno, maybe it's a fuck buddy thing, we aren't even sure. We still do love each other, we still mean a lot to each other and we both talked about how maybe we could get together in the future again. I broke up with him because I felt like i wasn't prepared/not ready to take on a serious relationship, but I was in one with him. I had some ego issues and impatience that drove us apart and only stressed both of us out. On top of this, we were very relationship-y and not very FRIEND-y, I found that if we weren't in a relationship and we were just friends, the whole thing would just be kinda...dry? we weren't very similar and our interests were crazily different (he enjoys sports and i enjoy gaming and philosophy) and we weren't into the other persons interests.

tl;dr I broke up with my almost a year and a half boyfriend due to incompatibility and my personal problems, but we're in this weird not girlfriend-boyfriend relationship but rather a more fuck-buddy-esque relationship but with feelings involved and everyone knows we're both single.

G meant and still means the world to me and he got me through some of the worst times in my life so far and he made me an overall better person. But a week after the breakup and I'm already finding myself wanting to kind of have flings and mess around while I'm still young. For example, just earlier I bussed home with a close friend I recently started talking to. We clicked right when we started talking. Today I slept on his shoulder in the bus. To him and everyone else that was there it was a very platonic thing, but I just felt something more. Also when me and G started going downwards, I made loads of new friends and realized I almost clicked better with them as friends than I did with G. This made me realize that he deserved someone he worked better with. Anyways, getting back on track, I am already finding myself attracted to others. Like not in a sense that I want anything serious with them, but like I said, I'm interested in flings and just having fun and making some deep connections, but again, nothing serious. This makes me feel super super guilty because I know G meant so so much to me and for me to find other people already and feel strong connections with others just feels wrong. I never meant to break off the relationship just to find someone else, but now I'm worried that maybe subconsciously, that's why I did it. I'm very out of touch with myself I feel and so this is all just feeling like a clump of confusion and guilt.

But yeah, I'm in a moral pickle. hopefully my writing made sense and wasn't too too all over the place, I tend to write very messily when speaking about my own thoughts. If you made it this far, I'm pretty surprised, thank you! I'm open to all advice if you have any. But thank u very much for taking the time to listen to me. Is this something to feel guilty about? Why do I feel this way? I've no clue : \^)",20Jun2019,1
43,"Hi, so I'm in my first year of college doing hair and beauty level 1 and I am coming to the end. I'm stressed and feel like my teachers are being unorganised and in a way just given up on us for a few reasons.
• They are normally more preoccupied with the higher level (we are level 1).
• our tasks never really end up going as planned because of the teacher changing something or swapping something around (we'll get into a more in depth example later on).
• There's just not that much support. They aren't the most approachable teachers in the world I must say (again will get into an example later).

Our last unit to finish the course is to set up a display and sell some makeup to bypassers in out college. The first task was to make some posters. I come in go to the library and a girl (we'll call her Tammy) tells me what I need to do. She tells me the dates that we need to put on our posters and all the advertising stuff. Do that, print them out, all good. Go down 3 flights of stairs (the library is on the third floor and our classroom aka Salon is on the first) and proudly show my teacher and guess what...It's the wrong dates. Great. What makes it worse is apparently a girl up there knew the correct dates and didn't bother to inform the girl who told me. Alot of the people upstairs who were doing their posters didn't include a date so they didn't have to bother going back upstairs to do it again.

So me and Tammy go back upstairs to make more posters. I double check with another girl (Rose) what the dates are. She says the 21st and the 18th. Make 2 posters with the dates and one without just for good measure. Now before I continue Rose has a thick Irish accent you'll see why I'm mentioning this later. I go down the dreaded 3 flights of stairs and again we got the dates wrong. Apparently I misheard Rose because of her accent (I swear I didn't but who knows). Now because of my little backup poster without the dates I refused to make anymore. One was enough. However, my classmates decided to call my poster ""bland"" because I used muted colour. Well I'm sorry that my poster doesn't look like a cross between Claires and tacky party accessories. They used bright neon purple and blue in powerpoint to make their posters and me not wanting my poster to look like utter trash decided to use muted tones to make it look actually decent. But no I guess the tacky look was what we were going for.

That was the first thing to piss me off. It was a small thing but don't worry guys it gets worse. So we get put into pairs. I'm with a girl called Jill. She's a nice girl, I get along with her. All is well until I get a text from another girl from college 
(Rose) after not coming in. She says ""You're with Rhia now"" out of the blue. This annoys me because I'm not getting switched because Jill wanted to be with her friend (Jazz). I decided to switch Rhia with a friend of mine Diane seeing how this is obviously allowed now. I get mad but it's whatever. The day of the selling comes and oh boy it's a mess.

I come in and Diane is nowhere to be found. I ended up pairing with another girl (Kelsey) who was Diane's partner before the switch. It's 11am at that point and our timeslot was half 2 so we both went home and decided to come back a little bit before our slot seeing as no one was really doing anything. Big mistake. I come back at 2 and to my horror I see the whole group of 5 people (minus Diane, Kelsey and even Jill) selling makeup. Turns out they decided to do it as a group. We have a groupchat (which will be important later) and no one could have texted it informing us. What was worse was the fact there was only half an hour left. During that half an hour I was standing there like a twat. I also found out we had to make an individual sale (as in you talking to the customer and getting them to buy from you). I don't think that was fair with 5 other people doing the same thing. Especially as everytime someone came along, the more confident ones would speak up first. It also didn't help that I have social anxiety. Not gonna lie I did try. I tried to get the person's attention and I kinda shouted as a sad attempt to do so. And I got laughed at by 2 of the girls. It shook my self confidence a bit cause it felt like they were mocking my efforts. Moving on. 

Here's the final thing.

I decided to vent to the groupchat about how I was feeling about the course. How it was unorganised with the whole changing partners to a group, ect. I was upset and basically said I wanted to give up at that point and everyone just went at me. There was a lot ot mockery to it like laughing emojis, another girl trying to stir shit up by saying oh shade has been thrown. They went at me saying if I felt like it then I should drop out and just made me feel like shit in general. I may post screenshots with the names scribbled out of course but it depends if people need the exact details. All I know is I'm now quite nervous to go to college next week. I feel like I've been ganged up on by the whole class except from a few people.

I sound so over dramatic and it sounds like a petty thing but please take into consideration. Again I have severe social anxiety with autism on top of that. Things like change, peoples words and actions have an affect on me that is different to people who don't have the same things. I want advice on how I can deal with this, what I can do to get this over and done with. Just any advice you can give based off this post.",20Jun2019,1

49,"I'm 15, m. Ever since start of 9th, I fell hard for this girl I met in geo. Did some of the most stupid shit to make her laugh, smile, any reaction to me. After geo ended we fell outta touch, right as I was gonna tell her. I've barely felt happy the last 4 years due to other issues, and I completely forgot her dude to working on grades and shit.

Then, we met up again. Holy shit, all the emotions flooded back. She found out a week fore I was gonna talk to her about how I feel. When she asked me what was up I asked her out. Surprisingly, she said yes. You have to understand, this is the happiest I've been in 4 long years. Then a few days later she sent me a text saying: 

""Hey I'm sorry, you're a nice guy and all but I'm not ready for a relationship right now, my emotions are to confusing and sorry if this is offensive but I dont see you like that, once again I'm sorry and I hope you understand, we can still go to the movies and I might change my mind, I'm just not feeling it right now. Wanna still be friends?""

Course I said yes to everything. We booked the movies a while later, but she said she wants to have a few friends along. Including her recent ex. Ouch. I talk to him later and he's a pretty chill dude. Tells me to be patient with her. And I was and am.

After I noticed her mood was off, I asked her if everything was alright. She finally opened up to me. I told her I could never relate or probably never understand whatever she was going through, but I'd always be here to listen and try my damndest.  We start talking bout her hobbies, family, and common interest. After which, I ask her how she feels. Tells me she's never had someone to talk to, and she feels happy for once in a blue moon. She doesn't feel empty anymore.

""Thank you""

That meant so damn much to me. Then she hits me wit dis:

""I know but I'm confusing so people usually get nervous or stressed and leave""
""So I'm glad I had someone to talk to""

This is when I realize: holy shit there's nothing I wouldn't do for this girl

We talk nightly and daily, and we are planning to meet up at the park.

How do I tell her Ill never leave her?

They started dating (or at least made it social media official) a couple of weeks later.

52,"This might be a bit lengthy and for that I apologize. Here is the quick rundown. I have been friends with this girl since kindergarten (not a joke here, we have photos to prove it!) and I have considered her my best friend for a really long time. Now to keep a long story short, she joined the air force. We wrote letters back and forth and she ended up settling down in Tennessee because she got pregnant and wanted to keep her son close to his dad and his dad's family. Her mom had passed away and I was there for her through all of that, I have never missed a birthday or Christmas for her or her son. I have considered us to be best friends. We have partied together, went to dances together, graduated high school together and now we are even attending the same online college. We talk nearly every single day via all social media platforms, Snapchat / Facebook /  Messenger / Texting. We hardly go long with out telling each other something. 

   My problem is that every time she comes to town visiting her family **she never makes time for me.** We either make plans before she leaves TN, or while she is here and she 1. Never texts back or shows up. 2. Never texts at all and 3. Texts me after she gets back home in TN. I shouldn't have to beg her for at least 5 minutes of her time just to say hello or have lunch. What does this say about our friendship? Does this mean that she doesn't value me or what we have? I need help here because I don't know what to think.

53,"God, I don't even know where to start. Okay well I'm a 20 year old female, I'm in university and I currently have a full-time job and I just... feel so fucking lonely. Like, all the time. I have literally no friends in real life. I have one friend that pretty much only hangs out with me as a last resort type of thing and that's about it? I have lots of online friends (which sounds so sad to say lmfao) so I don't think I am totally unfriendable or just so awful that no one wants to be friends with me...

It just really has me down lately. I see pictures of my old friends online hanging out together and despite the fact that we all still live in the same area and I do talk to a couple of these old friends everyday, I'm just never invited. This has to be my fault... No one wants to be my friend and there has to be a reason but I just *don't know* what it is. 

When we were in high school, I dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and because of that I would always turn down my friends or make excuses as to why I couldn't hang out and I feel like they just took that from then and until now as me not liking them or something, I don't know. I also had an older boyfriend throughout most of my last years of high school who preoccupied most of my time but we have since been broken up for the past year and yeah, you guessed it, I've been very single ever since lol

In university, I'm too anxious/shy to just go up to someone I don't know and talk to them to become friends so that's difficult and a whole other issue. I tried joining groups and clubs, I had a part-time job, I went to parties, I went on dates... 

I was driving home from work today and it hit me. I'm completely alone. I spend my days working, go home to my cat, fuck around on the internet, sleep, rinse and repeat. I don't know how to fix this and I am so so *so* tired of being alone. I never considered myself to be someone that depended on others to feel happy or complete but I can't help but see everyone around me enjoying their time with friends and it hurts me. I want that. There must be something wrong with me for nobody to want that with me.

57,"  So this guy and i became friends really fast. We were texting everyday followed by FaceTimes that would last for hours into the late night. Time seemed nonexistent when we talked. In one of our conversations he mentioned not wanting any serious relationships right now. He basically indirectly explained that he doesn’t want to be more than friends. I agreed because, though he’s cute, 100% my type, and easy to talk to, he’s a bit immature. We are just at different places in our lives.
  Our friendship kept growing, and kinda started turning into flirting. One day recently he said he wanted to hang out. All the things he mentioned doing sounded very date like. I said i was down cuz i hadn’t seen him in a bit. The very next day.... he texted me saying he didn’t want to talk to me for awhile because he was catching feelings, and he wanted to keep things just friends between us. I told him he can take his time and to just talk to me when he was ready... 

This wasn’t that long ago and i already miss talking with him. I was kinda catching feelings too. I don’t know really what advice I’m asking for but it just sucks. I never really envisioned us in a serious relationship, and I’m not tryna force one on him. I just want my friend back. ☹️",20Jun2019,1

61,"My boyfriend (20) and I (17) want to go to a convention sometime next year and neither of us want to take that long to get there and home for 4 days straight. It would be a lot more convenient to get a hotel for the three nights we will be there and it will be a lot better on my body as I have physical/medical problems that are worsened by long car rides. The convention site isn’t terribly far and we could just drive those days but we’d rather not and it can take away from some of the fun. 

I brought up to my boyfriend that we could bring one of our parents to stay with us in the room (probably my dad tbh) and that would likely fix the problem, but a 2 bedroom hotel is more expensive than a 1 bedroom hotel so bringing a 3rd person puts more cost on us and I have sensory problems and I do not want to sleep in the same bed as my dad as it’ll make me extremely uncomfortable (it’s a miracle I’m not like that with my bf) and I don’t want my boyfriend to sleep with him either because it would make him uncomfortable. It’s unlikely we will be allowed to stay in the same bed together but it’s a possibility. (That situation applies to my bfs POV if it were to be one of his parents to go). 

Is there any easy ways to help convince my parents (and his because he still lives with them bc it makes college cheaper but his parents are pretty strict but I guess he can pull the “I’m 20 let me do what I want card”) to let us just go by ourselves to save money? 
Also sex is not of interest on this trip we are just weebs that want to have fun and not feel pressured or uncomfortable around our parents

Numb is a more accurate word actually. I truly dont know what to say to a person during a time like this, and I dont want to say shit that they've already heard. I don't speak to them that often so I feel like I shouldn't even make the call, I don't really want to bother them by bringing it up like everyone else has. And I especially feel like it's disrespectful that this would be one of the only times I would make an effort to reach out to them. I cant ask anybody else, and this has been gnawing at me all day. I'd appreciate any suggestions you may have. I guess I'm still in shock.",20Jun2019,1

We have been together 2 years now and this last month we have practically had no sex.

Also, for the past 3 months, the only sex we have is when I initiate it.

What I want is to tell him that:
a) I’d like more sex

b) I’d like more sex where he initiates

76,"  

Hi everyone! This is going to be a long question/ story so bare with me! 

I (F/29) started working for a retirement community in May 2016 as a security guard/ front desk worker. I worked overnights (11:30-7:30AM) and I loved it. I loved the hours and the people. The primary focus of my job was to be available when an emergency arose. Emergency situations were conveyed to us (Security guards) via a radio – sometimes residents would call the desk and tell us other times they would hit their “Life alert” type necklace. The type of emergency would vary; sometimes it would be someone having a heart attack, other times they were just a little confused. I’m not going to mince words…I liked my job and I was pretty freaking good at it. I was not always the most diligent but for a slightly above minimum pay job, I was better than the other overnight security guard. My boss had recently left the company and his replacement had been hired. In the beginning I got along pretty well with the replacement but that quickly went downhill. 

I will continue this by saying I’ve always been very open with my employers in regards to my numerous medical issues including chronic migraines, depression and ADHD. Hell, I tell employers during interviews about all of those. Mid-January I was finally, officially, diagnosed with ADHD but it had been expected for a long time. The next morning I told my bosses at work about the diagnosis and subsequent medicine I would be prescribed. Honestly I didn’t know how I would react to the medicine and wanted to make them aware.  My bosses were onboard and whole heartedly seemed to accept this. 

My issues started maybe a week after disclosing my diagnosis. I went to speak with my boss (I’ll call him L) and we got into a verbal disagreement over the way he was running things. Basically, when I had my days off and there was no other security guard that could work, so L would have to come in. I know from both other employees and security camera feeds that he would not leave his office. Since there is always someone at the front desk, I know he never went to check on her. Not “check up”, just to kind of ask if she was ok or if she needed anything. She didn't even get her breaks some days! I know this is trivial but I can’t imagine leaving someone by themselves for almost 8 hours, and not even checking if they needed a break or to go to the bathroom. Freaky and sometimes scary things were known to happen there... During this argument I mentioned that one of my coworkers (Call him P) was constantly sleeping on the job. Honestly, I don’t care what a person does all day, if they do their jobs. But he wouldn’t even do his job. He didn’t answer in emergency situations and never patrolled the campus like he was supposed to. 

So this argument ended with both of us basically screaming at each other, (I was back a forth between crying and straight anger.) He ended this argument by telling me not to “Over react, like women normally do.” I let it go, maybe L just misspoke.  It should be noted however, that I was the only female security guard (other than one girl that filled in once a month.) and the main overnight guard. L was also previously a Police Officer and should have known better. 

In the beginning of February I was told my schedule would be changing (again). The entire department had schedule changes when L started in October(ish). Then more schedule changes in January. This proposed change would be the 3rd time in less than six months. Anyone who works overnights can tell you, more time than a few days is needed to get used to new schedules. I told both of my bosses L and I’ll call the other man R, I could not work those days they wanted me to work.  I told them multiple times and they said they would figure it out. 

R had previously been made aware of P sleeping (other employees had ratted him out too) but he had never done anything about it. About a week after disclosing to L that P was sleeping I got a (what myself and my husband consider) threatening text from P. I received this text because L told P that someone said he had been sleeping. P assumed it was me.  Note that I am 160 lbs (5’7) soaking wet. P is 6’1 and well into the 200 lbs and worked out A LOT. I was threatened and I was scared. P had previously had a situation at that job were he was told by HR to stay away from someone and he was harassing them.  I went to L &amp; R, and even got HR involved. I was told by all these people that nothing could be done until he returned from vacation a week later. I was also told by L and R that I needed to take this new schedule “or else”. I asked if there was any room to change their schedule and the response was a hard “No.” So Valentines Day 2019, I set down my radio and told them I quit. No, I did not go to the police (like I should have), because I was under the assumption that HR would take care of everything. 

So that wraps up that part. I have more however. 

\----------- 

I was lucky enough to already have another job lined up before quitting on Valentine’s Day. During my training period at the new place, I got a call on my cell phone from an individual (whom I was close with – call her S.) that lived at this facility. She told me that she needed help; she had just returned from the hospital and needed her medicine but the onsite pharmacy was closed and she had no way to get to one offsite. I immediately called the desk at the facility to send someone up to see if they could help her. They weren’t able to do anything (I called them back a few minutes later.) so I told her I would be over as soon as my shift was done at 11:30 PM. 

I get to the facility (see the typically sleeping coworker actually awake.), tell them what’s going on and go to her room to get her prescriptions. (There was a 24 hour Walgreens pharmacy not far from the facility.)  As I’m getting ready to leave to go get everything there is a knock at the door. P had called L, and both said it was “inappropriate” for me to be there. I explained again, that I was asked to come by and told them exactly what I was doing, only to be told that if I didn’t leave police would be called. I then had to tell S, that I couldn’t help and she would need to wait until the morning to get her medicine onsite. 

About a week later a previous coworker sent me a picture of an email that went out to the company saying that I was not allowed to visit S or be allowed on campus. Nothing was ever sent to me to tell me not to be con campus again. S called a few days later and told me that L had spoken to her and severely bad-mouthed me and said I could not be trusted, and I was trying to steal from her. I was also told that P had bad-mouthed me constantly.  

So my question after all of this about what (if anything) can be done legally? I have already tried going to my state’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but was told there wasn’t much they could do because nothing was really documented. Is there anything at all I can do? If nothing else, should I go to the police about the threatening text? 

Thanks for any and all help!

The thing is that I’ve been there a month and on one of my first assignments I was sick and had to go home and have declined 2 assignments due to 1 clashing with existing plans and the other being too far to get too.

However I don’t know what I should do because I’m scared that if I phone in sick that they won’t give me anymore work. I do make sure I work hard and everything it’s just I think that I won’t be able to get anymore work if I don’t go do a shift today",20Jun2019,2

84,"So I know there’s no way to make this sound good. And I know that trying to excuse myself is useless. I’m just going to explain what happened: 

So I’m taking a chemistry course this summer because I need it for some classes I needed to enroll  in for the fall. Since this is a summer class, it is very fast paced. I’ve never been good with tests and get very bad test anxiety. I studied for our first exam all day yesterday and this morning, but I realized that I was not going to be able to retain this information. This is where my mistake began. I decided to make a notecard with different formulas and some key points. I put it in my pocket, but deep down inside me I knew it was wrong. I got to the test room and started working on the test. I tried to do as much as I could without the help of the notecard (because I knew it was wrong) but I got to the last question 5 minutes before test time was over and I panicked and decided to pull out the notecard. I wasn’t very discreet about it though because my professor caught me. She asked to look at my lap and she saw the notecard. Then she told me in a strict tone that I was done with the test and that she would be emailing me later today. 

Eventually she did and I am supposed to meet her after class tomorrow. She already gave me a 0 on the test, and I accept the 0 but I am very scared if the situation is going to escalate. I know that I have no excuse to my behavior. Whether I cheated through the entire test or only the last few minutes, I still cheated. I feel extremely disappointed and ashamed in myself for having had stooped so low because even though I know that cheating is wrong and my conscious was telling me not to do it, I still did. I disrespected and broke the trust with my professor, I disrespected myself, the rest of the class and the university. It’s a shame that I had to get caught to learn my lesson, but now I am just afraid of what is going to happen tomorrow. I plan on telling her the truth and admitting to my fault (I don’t know if trying to explain myself and mentioning that I didn’t use the notecard for the entire test will make matters worse) and I plan to apologize to her. I guess I just want to know if there’s anything I should avoid saying that will make things worse and if there’s anything I should do to make things a bit better? I have been having anxiety attacks all day today and feel so bad. I understand that I should have had just taken whatever grade I got with honesty, but I can’t undo what I did and just want to know what I should expect and do tomorrow.",20Jun2019,1
85,"Long story short, I (24M) was living in LA and decided to move back to SD for personal reasons. I applied to a lot of different places cause I needed a job to keep paying bills and all that. I got two job offers, one of them was because my brother knew the manager and they helped me out and the other one is an outlet retail job. Since im not going back to school until the fall, I figured I could work both jobs and be okay. I accepted both jobs and they said they would work with my schedule. However, after only working two days at the retail job, it reminded me of how much i really dislike working retail and I really want to leave it but I feel it would look so bad to leave after 2 days. I am really dreading working there again tomorrow though and just dont want to go back. I am taking Summer classes as well but theyre only online classes. What would be the best way to tell the manager in the retail store that I do not want to go back or what would be the best way to go about my situation?",20Jun2019,1
87,"During my freshman year, things were great. People were encouraging me to speak up more, be more confident in my own skin, become more involved in the fraternity. I liked that. It was good to have people behind my back, but this atmosphere of confidence soon began to die out. During my Sophomore-Junior years, there was a major political split in our fraternity in which both sides would almost always disagree with one another on a plethora of issues. One side was all about ""survival"", i.e., They wanted to become the best fraternity at the university, they wanted fame and recognition. The other side, which was where I was on, wanted the fraternity to become an enjoyable experience for everyone and we regarded fame and recognition as irrelevant.

One of the people that I really liked in my fraternity had a pretty big weakness for alcohol. It got to such a point where he'd almost always cause a scene at a party, which resulted in him losing his girlfriend. It intensified to such a point where he even lost his executive board position (I even testified against him and so did several other people). He was then expelled from our fraternity for hosting an unregistered event, which caused more than 20-25 people to leave in protest. They felt the decision was extreme, the chapter didn't do anything to help him out of his situation, and claimed that they cared more about winning awards than protecting the brotherhood. I even feel guilty myself for not having helped him however I could.

To give a quick rundown of what transpired later on, here's what happened: One of my brothers takes over my room, claims that the admissions department gave him the room, only to find out that he lied about the whole thing. The same person snitches on me, telling others whatever I've told him in confidence, getting others to turn against me. Some of my own pledge brothers end up getting bullied, with one older one telling me ""we give this person shit because he keeps on making mistakes and teaching him all this will stop him from fucking up"", my fraternity big, who has held a profound presence on campus, ends up being lambasted for ""being a nice guy"" and isn't given an executive position. The same people that encouraged me to speak up and stand up even called me a ""nice guy"" and didn't support me for any executive position that I ran for. One person admitted that he opposed me for one position I ran for because he didn't want me to serve on a particular committee. One other person was left abandoned at a particular place because one guy that was supposed to have picked him up opted to watch the walking dead instead. The political rift in our fraternity intensifies to such a point where even our nationals had to intervene. Then I later hear rumours/stories about tinder hookups, flipping dumpsters, and so on.

I mean, had it not been for their encouragement, I wouldn't have sat down and helped out with philanthropy events. I wouldn't have designed and maintained a fraternity website. I wouldn't have been more confident in speaking up. And if this is how they repay me, I wonder what I was really doing there. I will also admit that I'm not entirely innocent either. During my Sophomore-Junior years, I was dealing with a plethora of mental health issues (depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety), and this alienated many people away from me. I also started speaking up and openly disagreeing with the way some things were going around in the chapter, which also alienated others away from me. My depression started due to stress and unresolved issues I was facing at home along with whatever overwhelming business was going around in the fraternity. It got too much to handle. I feel like it's just my fault for alienating people away due to my issues and becoming more needy by talking to others if I was in a plight or if I needed to understand others.

Then, having had enough, I decide to quit along with several other people. Other members of the chapter call us out for ""being pussies"", ""we're not being committed to our chapter"", ""we're sore losers for running out on the fraternity"", and so on. I don't know if I'm an A-hole for opting to quit despite everything that happened.",20Jun2019,1

90,"I think I fucked up.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I feel fucking terrible

I really genuinely like this girl and I took her on a date and everything was going fine. Took her to a nice place for dinner and all that. I was acting really confident because I have issues with my confidence and I didn't want to seem like some antisocial loser who would have to lean on her and I'm generally working on those confidence issues anyways.  We went to a drive in theater, made out and stuff, and I overstepped some boundaries. I went under her shirt and grabbed her boob and she went with it, so I didn't think anything was wrong and I thought she seemed into it. I don't know why I just felt really confident and just *did it*. She didn't say anything, again, so I thought I was fine. I wound up getting caught in the heat of the moment more and put my hand *down there*. Not underneath the clothes or anything. Just put it on top. I didn't even realize I did it at first. 

She took my hand off and said ""not yet"" I said I respected that and we went on and I thought it was fine.

She had a friend call me today and tell me she felt uncomfortable with what had happened and that she wasn't one of the girls I would just be able to have sex with, she felt like she couldn't stop me, and that she needed me to earn her trust more and said some other things which I know how to fix and will. 

I'm a virgin and I feel like I fucked up any chance I had of this being a good thing though. I feel like shit for making her feel uncomfortable and I want to redeem myself and earn her trust. I am glad that she at least told me instead of letting it hang in the air. I apologized profusely to her and told her I would make absolutely sure not to let it happen again. I promised to take things slowly from now on and I didn't promise it but I plan to make sure she's absolutely comfortable with anything I do. 

Am I doing enough here to make up for it? I really do want to make things work out with this girl. She's one of a kind and I really do feel fucking terrible for this. I don't want her to feel like I'm using her for sex because sex really doesn't matter to me and I've never done something like this before. I want to make sure I make things right after doing this before doing anything else like pursuing a relationship with her or inviting her on another date.",20Jun2019,0
91,"I made this account as a throw away. I wanted to seek help with something that has been happening all my life.

I'm getting to the point where I'm fed up of helping people and not getting any help in return but just critical feedback saying I'm too nice and/or too much (in real life, not on here).

I need to know now how to stop being ""too nice"" and ""too much"".

92,"**Friendship situation:** Hi I'm in highschool and I switched back to public school last year and had one friend who I had talked to throughout all the years, I'll call him Billy. When I switched back to public schools Billy was nice enough to invite me into his friend group with kids whom we had went to elementary school with so I already kind of knew them. Anyways, as the year went on they were very hot and cold, sometimes they would invite me to hang out and other times they would try to avoid me. When they would do this I would get a sick feeling in my stomach and would get upset because I knew what they were doing. Not sure if they ever realized what I felt like to me. Summer after my first year back at public school and everything was fine and they were starting to invite me to hang out, but never to parties so I could meet more people. Fast forward to the start of the school year again they were very hot and cold again avoiding me, and inviting me to hang out other times. Fast forward to now after a long year of grinding my junior year of highschool and them being the same way I was getting tired of this, it was making me question whether something was wrong with myself. After finding out Billy was throwing a party and didnt invite me I started to tell him that I didnt want to be friends with them anymore if they were going to be like this. He admitted what he was doing being hot and cold and doing shit without telling me. He said to me why would I question our friendship after years of being friends and spending hours upon hours hanging out playing video games or just hanging out in person. Anyways, after we got into this argument over snapchat (which by the way social media fucking sucks) he messaged me a day later but deleted it before I could see it. He has not messaged me since, and I'm sure he is doing fine. My problem is that I don't have any other friends to hang out with, but I don't want to be friends with Billy and the other kids if they are going to treat me like this.

The jacket fits ok, but the shoulders are padded and the slacks are quite baggy, like 1990's baggy. That's why I was thinking that I'd just wear what I normally wear which is an oxford cloth button up with khaki pants and red wing boots. The boots are a bit scuffed so I was thinking maybe I should go to a thrift shop and buy a pair of nicer shoes instead of the boots. Thoughts?",20Jun2019,3

He also gets uncomfortable when I say “I love you” other than at night. As in, he doesn’t mind it because it feels too soon etc etc, affection just weirds him out but it hurts sometimes because affection weirds him out he’s not very affectionate, and sometimes when i’m upset about something all i want to do is be told it’s okay and be given a hug, he just doesn’t think to do those things but i’m such an insecure person that i’m not going to ask for it. It’s basically just a romantic trying to make it work with a nonromantic. And lately it feels like i’ve always done something wrong, like it feels like he has no desire to talk to me, like today in the morning we were talking, he left for a bit to clean do some things, and then came back, it’s a bit embarrassing to say but we sexted and he came, and then he asked to leave to hang out with his brother and i of course was like “sure! of course, have fun” because i can’t expect to be 24/7 his top priority, i just don’t. but then he stayed away, all day. i waited 6 hours and texted “hey” and he said “still busy” and then he texts me 2 hours later and i ask him what he’s been up to for some friendly conversation and he just goes “just playing games”. and i guess it just hurt because i sat there and one-way sexted to get him to finish and then he immediately left and i sat around all day with pretty much no one to talk to.

105,"My friend (20/F) and I (20/F) have been friends since 5th grade. We have varied in closeness throughout the years (some years being very close, other years being a little more distant, but still in close contact).

I went away to college when we graduated high school and she stayed home, but we stayed in touch.

A couple months ago she got engaged, and I honestly expected to be in her wedding party. Our 2 other close friends got asked, but I never did. I honestly didn’t think much of it (those 2 stayed home when I went away to school so I figured all 3 of them had gotten very close). But then I found out a random girl that we all went to high school had been asked to be in her wedding party. This is when I started feeling hurt.

I should add by no means am I made at her. This is her decision. No matter what I just want her to be happy and have the best wedding possible.

However, I can’t stop thinking about it. I thought we were so close. I just really want to know why. Did I do something? Did she think I wouldn’t be available to attend the festivities since I would be away at school?

107,"I think that my dad gave me my mum's medicine without telling me and I'll just consider it a mistake. However, the recent medicine that I'm on has had terrible effects and I'm just now getting out of it all. It was Zolaft 100mg and I hate it so much. It makes me extremely paranoid, lazy, and a general asshole. I can't get off of these meds until I come back from Texas and my dad is definitely not letting me off of them. 

I did call CPS like some of you suggested, but after I realised that they couldn't do anything besides send a guy out to see if is abuse and then take me away from him, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I might use CPS if he hits me again though, but I don't think this is proof enough because it might've been an honest mistake?

I didn't question him about the pills at all, but I had a long argument with him about not going to Texas and I'm glad that I'm aware of his tricks now because the manipulation was intense. He kept on trying to make me seem like an evil mastermind when I just wanted to stay home and build my computer and such. 

Unfortunately, I'm going on the vacation with them to Texas (a vacation with him isn't really a vacation, because he is always on edge and we usually end up having no time to relax, also I have no personal privacy which is a really big deal for me). 

I did identify some of the pills and it seems like only 2 wete really changed and the other 2 are the same pill in a different shape, colour, et cetera.

I did not call the pharmacy because I was scared about them calling my parents about me calling them. Obviously my dad wouldn't be happy with me trying to get all this information about my medicine and let alone contacting the pharmacy

I didn't reach out to any adults simply because I do not know any that I could trust, and school is out for me, so I don't have any teachers

The only plan I have for the future is just to keep that CPS report I made with me and if he touches me then I guess I'll have to make the call. Unfortunately, I'll probably get put up for adoption because my mum always said she wanted to put me up for adoption


Any advice or comments about anything is appreciated


TL;DR -
The meds were probably my mum's and given to me by accident. I called CPS and made a report that will be turned in if my dad touches me again. Unfortunately, that means I'll probably be put into foster care",20Jun2019,1
108,"I posted this before but left out a few things and now there's new stuff going on.

M asks to borrow my charger at lunch on the last day of school. I say ok, not knowing she's got a history of stealing stuff and ""losing"" stuff. 

I ask M for charger. She says A has it. A says M has it. M says she didn't touch it all through lunch and A used it. I think this is weird. I ask M for the charger and she says she knows where it is. Walks off. Says A has it. Walks off again and tells me just go to A. I don't know either of these girls super well. I don't even know who A is. I ask Y to call A. She knows A pretty well. A hangs up and doesn't pick up.

I go to the office. Office does nothing. Today is the last day of school. I get upset and walk home.

I try to get other people to text M and A and ask about the charger. Both deny having it. M says A has it. A says she doesn't know what happened to it. They give vague answers. I finally try to reach out on Snapchat. They ignore me. I finally get ahold of M who claims A had it the entire time and left it in the cafeteria and some other bullshit excuse that doesn't line up with past responses. I ask her why she can't get it if A truly has it and why can't A just give it to P or Y, two mutual friends, or give it to M to give it to P or T. I state A has already said she doesn't have it and both are giving different answers. I ask she either returns it or pays the fine. She removes me as a follower (I only did so to message her because this was over Instagram) and I think she blocked me. I can't get ahold of A and I'm afraid to ask for more help from our mutual friends because I'm afraid I'm bothering them too much but at this point I can't do anything else. I'll end up asking for help anyway though. Right now I'm just thinking of posting the conversation all over my social media and sending it to people we both know in hopes something will happen. She gets worked up enough and somehow her parents contact mine, or our friends keep texting her and A enough that she'll give up and pay. I'm waiting on a response from A. I'm hoping A tells what really happened and helps me out.

I’m now entering my fourth year and I’m about to graduate with an accounting degree, but there is nothing I hate more than any work even associated with accounting. 

The only thing I found that I like is working with information systems and programming because of a class I took in the spring of my third year. It is far too late to change my major, and there is no way I want to continue school with the amount of money that has to be spent. With all of that said, I’ve started doing research on military and found that through joining either the Navy or the Air Force I could receive hands on experience and get paid, which will help get rid of my school loans. 

I truly feel that the benefits of joining far outweighs any negatives, but I have no idea how to bring this up with my family. I want to make them proud more than anything, but I don’t want to be stuck in a job that I hate for the foreseeable future nor become a deadbeat having to rely on their parents.

Now, I know this next part was a bit forthcoming of me, but I asked her for her phone number before we parted ways because I had a small crush on her throughout the class. She gave me her number.  I also mentioned I had won a free happy hour and that it would be cool if she came. She said she probably couldn't make it because she was working but that it was nice talking to me.

Soon after, I got back home and realized that she gave me the wrong number. I was upset but I realized that maybe it was because we just met and she wasn't comfortable giving me it. I was fine with that but it still sucked to get rejected.

Anyways, that night or the following morning she started to follow me on Instagram. I did not follow her/message her or make any contact other than that conversation that we had and a text to the number she gave me to say ""this is my name"".

122,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory, graduated from High School last year, had a choice to go to a college out of state near my father which would have costed a ton of money, but he said he would pay for everything, but I ended up going to another college where I am on full ride scholarships which is away from him. He also said he would give me an allowance through college to help with expenses. With this, he said he would get a vehicle for college that I would enjoy and last me all through it.  (He is well of) At the time I was driving 1996 K1500 pickup (which i love, but just isn't reliable). Came here, he ended up rushing me get a vehicle so we could make sure nothing was wrong with it for a a cross country drive a few months later. I got a 2011 Hyundai Sonata, which long story short, blew the engine on the way over and got it fully replaced for free.

&amp;#x200B;

Went Freshman year of college without a vehicle, besides bringing down my truck for a month during Spring break to use to move out of my dorms (6 hour drive). I am back now and we are planning on driving this Sonata out in August. However, after realizing how rushed I was, and how much I used my truck the one month I had it, i realized that a mid-size sedan wouldn't work out. I am going to school in the mountains. Harsh winter, and so far it seems I will be moving apartments or houses once a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be too greedy to bring up the idea of selling the Sonata for a pickup that would aide me in my college years? I've always driven a pickup and feel a car isn't for me.  I go on hiking trails alot, always use the bed, need something good in large amounts of snow (small town and roads take forever to get cleared). I'm offered to pay for insurance and gas, no help from my dad. The only financial help I've had from my dad was the Sonata. He has wanted to purchase a new F250 for years now and I am thinking about bringing up the idea of taking over his 2013 F150. I'm afraid to bring it up, because he gets angry when I bring up something other than the Sonata. If I should talk to him about it, what should I say?",20Jun2019,1
123,"A friend(17M) of mine(17F) told me he liked me around a week ago and I told him I liked him back, because I truly did (still maybe do?) and we started dating 4 days ago. We hung out yesterday for a couple of hours and idk why but I got really turned off (I think it’s because we kissed and it just didn’t feel great...) 

The problem is that our relationship moved reeeallly fast especially on his part. He said he loved me and I said it back. He was literally talking about the future and just saying that we were meant to be and that it’s destiny and a literal fantasy of his. Basically, he’s so happy to be with me. He also always mentions how heartbroken he got when his ex broke up with him and how he wishes to never go through that again. he also said he was scared to get into this relationship, although he’s the one who made it official, because he doesn’t want to risk getting heart broken again. 

We were suppose to hang out tomorrow but I lied and told him I couldn’t make it. I feel like shit, he’s such a nice guy but I truly can’t force my feelings. I know I’m dumb because I got myself into this situation but it all moved so fast I didn’t know what to do. If I break up with him he’s going to break down. But I can’t pretend to love him because although I do have some feelings towards him, I really don’t think I truly love him. I got myself into a big mess and I’m not sure how to get out. 

We were really good friends before this. And I honestly wish it could just go back to that. I don’t want to completely lose him. Anyone have any advice of what I can do?

I've done some researching of my own, and I know my field's not the best paying especially when you only have your bachelor's but I was hoping to market myself well enough in my field and others so I could make at least $17-$20/hour (I'm currently working on finishing up a cert course that could lead me to a starting pay of $17). I've just felt like a fish out of water because I know I'm a qualified candidate and it feels like it's hitting even harder cause I'm in love with having a routine and set schedule and now that graduation has come and gone I feel like I only got to bask in my glory for a few days and immediately went into stress mode. I'd also like to mention that I thin a big part of my stress is due to the fact that I want to go away for graduate school which means I need a solid income coming in to achieve that and also to make sure I'm not being buried in debt (not to mention my family puts an incredible amount of stress on me so I'd really like to only have myself to worry about for the first time in a really long time - think borderline narcissistic family members with a close family member needing me as emotional support even though I'm the youngest among the lot).

131,"My significant other and I have been together for a little over 3 years now. I’m wondering if I see a future with us. 
He has a very abrasive personality. When we go out in public, I get anxious thinking about the way he talks to people- his tone is generally rude and he talks down to people. I then feel like I need to bend over backwards to make up for it. He has his times of being sweet to me, but he can also talk to me like that and it makes me feel worthless and like I need to apologize for just existing. I have asked if he is happy with me, and he claims that he is, but I’m not sure I believe him. Is fairytale romance really a thing that exists?

132,"So... for the the summer I got a job working at a restaurant as a buser. The pay is good, I love the food and atmosphere. 

I have just finished my third shift and well... people have told me that I have quickly become one of the best we have (we are struggling to get busers and I have always tried to work my ass off and have a good attitude). 

I work from now until the middle of August. And while I do think I am an important part, I’ve had this dread that this job isn’t fulfilling. I get a lot of my energy from interacting with others and I feel like I would be better as a server. 

Another thing that somewhat upsets me is someone else got a server position when they interviewed after me, where they told me they weren’t taking servers due to a lot of their staff being short term... she is short term too. 

The manager I interviewed with also told me multiple times that he think I would be a good fit for server and has hinted that “if a space becomes available, I would love to have you fill it”. But I am worried that will never come. 


Again, I don’t hate the job I just feel my overall enthusiasm draining. Would it benefit me to ask to move to a serving position? How do I block out the negative energy I feel when I do see my job as unfulfilling?

Thanks",20Jun2019,3

134,"I have a friend, let’s call him Alex, that I have talked to every day for the past 4 months. We talk practically all day. We dated for about a month and a half but I ended things a few weeks ago because we didn’t see each other often and I felt like he wasn’t making an effort. We have remained close friends. It’s important to note we also work together and have always been professional before, during and after dating.

3 days ago Alex sends me a meme saying something along the lines of wanting to die. I laughed at first because sometimes I also joke about my depression. However, he sent that to me 5 times over the course of a few hours and I asked him if he was okay and if there was anything he wanted to talk about. He never responded but read the message (read receipts are on). 

I’ve sent him countless messages asking if he was okay, to talk to me, random things that have happened at work, and a few memes. Today was my first day back at work since he stopped replying to me. He isn’t working today. I asked a good mutual friend of ours if she’s talked to him the past few days and she said no, not since he sent the SAME meme. We are both worried about him so we asked in a group chat if he wants to go mini golfing with us this weekend (something we’ve all talked about doing).

He hasn’t responded. I know he’s okay because I can see that he is reading the messages, he’s just not responding. 

I need some help on what to do: how can I help him if he doesn’t respond? I don’t know where he lives and he doesn’t work until Friday. That’s if he comes (he called out Sunday and talked about calling out Friday. This is not Normal for him).  

He has a very hard time opening up. I’m just really worried because I care for him deeply.

It is still there now. I have no idea who he is. 

Looking at previous alerts, he's been parking each morning in my elderly neighbours driveway the last couple of days, but she must have caught him or something, so now he's trying his luck with my place.

I'm thinking I need to write an epic note that will give him the message that he's not welcome.

143,"Hey Redditers, 

I need some advice (obviously, since I'm here). Sorry for any funky formatting. 

My life is currently split between a career in the professional 9-5 business realm, and a desire to be acting on stage. I'm really struggling whit what is the best course of action here, and I've outlined the pros and cons as I see them below. Please don't tell me how chances of ""making it"" in acting are bad - I know the stats. I went to school for this and I fully understand how hard it is to make a living doing it. 

BUSINESS CAREER
Pros
-pay way better than acting ever would. 
- solid schedule where I am consistent, at home, can spend time with my husband. 
- consistent benefits, pay, and retirement plan 
- generally looked upon as a good life choice by others 
- did I mention steady and consistent income? 
Cons 
- early mornings 
- boring as f*** 
- bored, bored, bored. 
- lonely 
- very structured, not really creative 

ACTING CAREER 
Pros 
- acting, singing, dancing all make me incredibly happy 
- time doing what I love 
- performing 
- being with people who accept and understand me, that I genuinely like. 
- no 5:00am mornings 
- I'm a night owl so the late nights are fine 
Cons 
- husband thinks my wanting to get back into it is a whim. That i won't really like it - the grass isn't always greener on the other side. 
- less stable 
- would have to travel and/or spend periods of time away from husband 
- money, benefits and retirement are more up in the air. 
- generally frowned upon. 
- the industry is very... Political? Who you know and where you went to school can make a huge impact on your ability to get cast/hired.

I see plays or musicals around town and it just makes me depressed. Like horribly depressed. I feel this aching in my chest and I miss it so much. But I also worry that it's just a ""flight of fancy"", that it wouldn't work, or it wouldn't be as great. I worry about money and my relationship with my husband..... I need some outside input...",20Jun2019,3

145,"I'm just kind of lost with what to do, I've had feelings for her basically since the moment I met her last year, and they've only really grown stronger over the past few months. She's now part of my main group of friends that I hang out with.

Shes the type of girl that brings happiness whenever she goes and always seems to have a smile on her face, I could spend days around her and not get even slightly annoyed which is hard to say about others. I started working at the place she worked about 2 months ago, not just because I like her but because I needed a new job and they were hiring and she suggested it to me. Its a good way to get to hang out with her when I normally wouldn't be able to.

But the thing is, she's not the type of girl to be in any sort of relationship, from what I know she's never been in one and doesn't have plans to be in one according to her friends, I only know this because one of my friends had feelings for her and got told by our friends that she isn't one for relationships. 

I have no clue how she feels about me if anything at all, we have good times together, when she leaves work and I'm still there she'll walk past, and like put her hand on my lower back or arm and be like ""bye, cya tomorrow"" and that's what really throws me off because I don't know if she's just doing that as a friendly thing or if she maybe likes me also because of the unnessacary touching but then other days at school and stuff she'll just be ""distant"" and won't really interact with me.

I really just want to tell her how I feel, that I understand if she doesn't feel the same way and all that, but if I tell her and she doesn't then it would make school awkward since we all hangout as a group, it would also make work weird since we spend a good 10+ hours each weekend with each other.

I'm thinking I just shouldn't tell her and just leave it and just stay as good friends and try and move on but on the other hand I know I'll regret not telling her but I also don't want to make things awkward.",20Jun2019,5
146,"As the title suggests, I get obsessed with people. I feel like obsession is the right term, if anyone knows a better one I'd be glad to know. In a way it's sort of like an addiction? I fixate on someone and have a kind of routine of checking their social media for updates and trawling the web for anything they are mentioned in.

It is always someone I have met and the more I interact the worse it gets up until a point where a mild case of obsession can be mostly overridden by talking to the person on a frequent basis and we can become friendly acquaintances. The people are always in some sort of a position of power over me in one way or another although they may not actually recognise this themselves (might be a control thing?).

With every person I fixate on it seems to more or less get worse - here are some details on one of the most recent which seems to be the worst:
I could see a blurry figure in the back of a photo taken 10 years ago and instantly say 'yup that's them'. I could give details on their career history spanning 20 years and tell you the progression of their hair length changes over that time. I dug out literally everything referring to them that was publicly available. I knew where they were born, where they grew up and where their family moved to. It might not seem like that much but they have no social media profiles whatsoever so this was a lot of gathering and piecing together. It sixth months ago and I think I have everything I can reasonably find so now I just check back on a series of relevant websites for updates. I get a kind of emotional high every time I find something new.

They are the fourth of five main occurrences, I think. The line can sometimes be a bit blurry on whether it's just a normal-ish bit of internet creeping (we've all been there!) or something more out of control. The first that crossed the line into being weird was three years ago and has basically died down which is good (probably due to not seeing them since then), but I don't think it was ever at this level of intensity. I also think it has the potential to come back with a vengeance if we ever have any more contact.

All of this is bad enough but it's my thoughts that are the worst bit. I get these thoughts about hurting them in really specific ways/scenarios, like I find myself imagining how I'd kidnap them or cut them with scalpels? The idea is pretty repulsive to me in 'real life', I'm a really non violent person who has never been in a fight, still feels guilty about throwing something at my sister when I was a little kid, and gets distressed at the thought of killing a mosquito. But I think about it all the same, have even dreamed about writing messages to them in my own blood. Really creepy disturbing stuff. It can swing between this and imagining intense romantic relationships with them, even though they are all varying degrees of significantly older than me (I'm 19, the youngest is about 30 and the oldest is maybe 50-something). I'm dating someone my age who I really love so this feels really weird but I just can't stop.

The searching is almost like a ritual maybe? I've struggled with OCD for much of my life (had therapy, seemed to be mostly resolved) so maybe this is related. Also had issues with anxiety and depression.

I just don't know what to do. My family and friends know basically nothing about any of this and would be completely surprised as this is not even slightly how I am in everyday life, I am so ashamed of all of this and have hidden it from everyone. I have sort of implied some of it to the person I'm dating (who I usually tell absolutely everything) but I don't want this to be another source of worry in their life or have them think I'm a terrible person (honestly unlikely given that they are the kindest and generally best person I've ever met).

 I have considered going back to therapy but I don't know how I'd explain it to my parents, who I still live with. I can theoretically avoid some of the people I'm obsessed with but some I can't without giving up key parts of my life that contribute to my emotional/financial wellbeing.

He's in Europe, I'm in Latin America.

He's a drug addict - Not a recovering one, a drug addict. All he does is spend thousands of dollars on drugs and call me/message me when he's high. 

He's into crack and cocaine. I hate seeing him in that state, he is extremely skinny and frankly difficult to talk to. I always feel a disconnect. People think I'm cold and that I don't love him because I ignore most of his messages, but I ignore him because he's always in this state.

I told him I don't want a relationship with him on this state, but all he does is deny it and proceed to get high again and again. I know addiction is a sickness, and frankly, I don't see him willingly walking into rehab anytime soon.

It tears me emotionally because while people misinterpret my rejection of his state as a lack of affection. I tried everything I could as a daughter- I can't cure him from his own addiction. I hate it. I never really had much of a family since addiction is a recurring theme in our genetics, so I don't know.

149," My nana (my mom's mother), was diagnosed with lung cancer a couple of months ago. She actually broke her back 3 days after finding out.

Today, she found out that she has cancer in her esophagus. I just feel so bad for her. And my mom is taking this pretty bad too.

150,"So, my partner works full time, pays the mortgage and has car/insurance payments and even though we have food at home and he goes to work with lunch, he still spends a lot of money on food... 
to be polite he’s shit with money and doesn’t have a cent in savings. 

I was working full time but have been on maternity leave for the past 6 months (get paid maternity leave so I still have money left), I pay the bills, house insurance, groceries, I own my car but still pay insurance monthly, I’ll be paying for daycare when I go back to work next month. So it’s not as though I don’t pitch in and he has to pay for everything... 

My partner and I have discussed marriage, but I just know for a fact that he will never be able to afford a ring, I don’t want anything flash or expensive and he knows this, but I know that he will want to spend the money on something both of us will like and has the good quality that will ‘last a lifetime’. 

There are options of afterpay at jewellers here, but even then it’s still a fair bit of a lump sum per fortnight to pay off. 

I’m wondering, do I just leave it and if he wanted to buy me a ring to propose that bad, he’d stop eating his money and put some aside to be able to buy me a ring... or do I offer to go halves as I’m the one going to be wearing it anyway? 
This isn’t to rush him so I get it sooner as I’d still have to wait until he’s ready to ask me... 

I do not want to upset him or make him feel like shit in any way that he can’t afford to buy me an engagement ring, I want him to feel like we are in this together and it’s our money not his money or my money (obviously it is at the end of the day but hope you understand what I mean). 
I’m going to be the one wearing it as I said, although it’s ‘tradition’, I don’t expect him to pay for all of it anyway, especially if it means we can spend a little more money to get one that I want and pay for quality. - again price isn’t important but.

I don't know what else to do, but something needs to change.  I can't live like this anymore.  I can't wake up every morning terrified that I've done something wrong.  I can't spend my life making sure everyone else is happy with me before I'm happy with me.

I’m 17 but I haven’t intentionally eaten seafood since I was about 5. One day it just grossed me out. I think it just started building since then and I forgot why I hated it so it just turned into a fear. It’s not even that I don’t like the taste. It’s the thought of eating it. I accidentally got served shrimp buns at a restaurant two years ago when I ordered pork buns. I took a bite of one and cried and went into the bathroom and thought about making myself throw up. 

I went on an organized tour in China for about a week and the tour guides ordered a family style type of meal for every single meal and I had to say I was vegetarian to avoid accidentally eating seafood.

My ex and I were best friends for 2 years and dated for a year and a half after that. After we went away for college, we did our best to keep the relationship alive but in the end they felt like “they couldn’t handle a relationship”, yet they still talked to me everyday after that like they hadn’t just broke up with me. After a while of this I got sick of the idea that they wanted to act like they hadn’t ended the relationship, so I stopped talking to them. Now that we’ve come back for the summer, I realize how much I missed them at school and being home makes me miss them again, but we haven’t talked in a month. 
So, do I try and talk to them, for closure/another chance? Or do I just not talk to them ever again and hope to never see them in public ever?
I’m not sure what to do because they have been on my mind for the last few weeks and I can’t shake the thought of them.

163,"Obvious throwaway account.

Heres the story:

I had decided to sublease a room near campus for the summer, I went home for 3 weeks before coming back and moving in. On the first night of moving in, I already want to move out. The only word that I can describe the place as is : shithole.

Firstly, theres nothing wrong with the room itself but the previous tenant didn’t clean anything when he left. The moment I step into the room, all I see are dust bunnies and garbage strewn all around the room. I spent my move in night cleaning the garbage off the floor and furniture. [For the people who like to imagine: theres empty chip bags and cookie trays and some zip locked bags of snacks which have all been here for at least a month.] I haven’t even wiped down the dust yet.

Second, the bathroom has a huge hygiene issue. The floor is caked in dirt/mud or whatever unholy substance. The tub is streaked with orange marks. I went to take a shower and dropped a white shirt for 1 second. I picked it back up and half of it was caked in dirt. I’m not even sure I want the shirt anymore, I’m pretty sure I’m going to get an infection if I put it on.

Third, the kitchen situation. It’s a miracle that the tabletops are somewhat clean but as usual the floor is caked in some unknown substance. 

I know its my fault that I should’ve spent more time checking the place out and such but its extremely difficult to expect conditions to be this bad. I know I should’ve checked the place out more thoroughly but at the time I was in a rush and it was mu first time renting anything.


Would it be a dick move for me to look for a new place for the next month? I already payed the rent for this month so I’ll stay in the room and I’ll find a solution to the shower situation but, I don’t really wanna stay here anymore.",20Jun2019,1

165,"The owner of the house lives out-of-state and has been renting to these new tenants since October. The new tenants are very loud, often come home at 2am, blaring loud music, as they pull in the driveway. I routinely hear very loud arguing and they do a poor job of maintaining their front yard. But recently, they have started parking their cars on their front lawn. I have no idea why. I think additional people have moved into the house. I don't understand why they can't park the other cars on the street. I haven't met the neighbors yet. How would you suggest approaching this situation? I did look up the owner of the house and do have his phone number. I suppose I could call him or text him pictures to him. The house does not belong to a neighborhood's association, so it doesn't violate any covenants. But I wonder if it violates a law of some sort -- perhaps a fire code violation or something? We are contemplating selling the house soon, and am concerned that this eye sore, will make this difficult to do so.",20Jun2019,0
166,"  I'm going into my senior year of college and due to some life circumstances (roommate bailing on lease) I'm having to give up my apartment and move back home. I can't afford to live there by myself and do not want to risk trying to find a roommate this late in the game just in case it doesn't work out. My lease is supposed to renew in a month and I don't want to be stuck with it all alone if finding a roommate doesn't work out. So I'm moving back home which will save me lots of money but the commute to school will be about an hour and 20 minutes 5 days a week and im driving myself. Does anyone have any tips on how to survive? This is not an ideal situation and I'm really worried about time management issues. My school days are long, the commute is long and I also have work. I'm not sure how to juggle it all. I've commuted before but I was going to a community college much closer to home and only had classes 3 days a week. On top of this I don't know how I'm going to survive living at home. I love my family but I'm going to have zero space for myself.

167,"Okay so I was just going to come out to my parents but since I doubt they would accept my sexuality I told my brother first. And though my brother is straight he said he would support me and advised me not to tell it to mom and dad because they're too homophobic and dad might even disown me. This was true because I just asked them what is their opinion on gay guys and they were disgusted and it was confirmed they are homophobic. So I poured my heart out to my brother and he told me though he's into girls he has always found me attractive and if I allow, he would like to have sex with me. I was taken aback initially but then I thought being gay the chances of finding real love are minuscule, and I might end up being alone forever so I gave in and we did have sex twice. He said he wants to do it again and again but in secrecy so do you think I should continue? I am 19 and he's 23.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this brief and to the point, about a month ago I started on assignment for a staffing agency working through one of their offices. In my role I was able to get elevated privileges due to the nature of the work I was doing. While working with one of the new temporaries there, I was showing him one of the portals we use in our troubleshooting, onto a page we don't really use, and when showing him what a user would see, I searched for my profile, no big deal, right? Well, I ended up stumbling onto the section that showed the details of the assignment, and right there I saw it: 

*Bill to Rate: $24.00 an hour. Pay Rate: $16.00 an hour.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that these guys have been getting an $8 hourly profit off of my work, which I mean, I completely understand, from a business perspective, it needs to occur (they gotta make money too), but I wasn't expecting it to be that high at this level of pay, I was expecting maybe $3, maybe $4 at the most off of the top, but it turns out they've been getting 34% of what they're being paid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just a little bit unsure of what my next move should be, should I simply start looking for other positions and explain if they inquire of the timeframe that the pay wasn't competitive? Should I address this with my employer (the staffing office and not headquarters that I physically report to)? I've had no issues with the work, and honestly enjoy it, as well as getting the experience from it, but that's a difference of $16,640.00 yearly (prior to tax ofc) that I'm not receiving, and anything additional would be helpful at this time. I'm honestly just at my wits end with this.

My girlfriend (19) and I (20) have been dating for around 4 months now and are very happy together, and are going strong, I have met her mom and her grandparents, and all accepted me and made me feel welcomed.

Then came the day my girlfriend asked to meet my parents here where issues number one comes in, I have a large family consisting of; My Dad and Stepmom, My Mom and Stepdad, 2 Brothers, 3 Stepbrothers and 2 Stepsisters. Now my family is predominately Mexican, Hispanic and African American,  they are not racist in any way they treat everyone respectfully and don’t discriminate against anyone, now would be a good time to mention my girlfriend and her family are white, this is the Second issues.

Before meeting my Mom and Stepdad I told my girlfriend that they had made some comments about me dating a white girl like “Those white people are crazy” and “Those white people have a lot of things just be glad they aren’t taking our (Insert Something Here).” So, she was a little hesitant when meeting them, but everything went well and nothing was said until one of my stepbrothers came over and saw my GF and said, “What the heck, hello white lady.” Me not seeing much harm in it shrugged it off but when my GF was leaving, she told me that all the things I had told her about before and that comment made her not feel comfortable coming over as much. 

Now my dad and step are a lot more humorous and serious about making white people comments but he does have a good heart and doesn’t mean it all seriously and these comments do make my girlfriend uncomfortable. These comments are “You sure she’s not training you” or “She’s not using you” or “Maybe have her come over and do some yard work so she learns what work is” or “watch out her family may be trying to get you” and I told all these comments to my GF because I believed she had the right to know. After hearing this she does not want to meet my dad and stepmom at all Understandably, but I know my dad and stepmom wouldn’t say anything to her. They are good people my dad especially and he means a lot to me, and I am not going to force her to meet them of she is uncomfortable. 

I Just need to know what is the best way to tell my family this, so my GF is comfortable coming over and meeting my parents or if anyone has experienced something like this?

TL:DR – How do I tell my parents their racist comments make my GF Uncomfortable.",20Jun2019,1
172,"Basically while I was at work earlier today the van I drive, as well as my partner were being silently recorded by a strange man in the car next to us. I have no idea what to make of this. I was the passenger, and I'm unsure if the driver, my partner, did anything to piss anyone off.

 More to the story though; the dude drove in the lane next to us for a bit and just kept recording us. When we came to a light, my driver aggressively pulled up behind him intending to follow the guy. He was being a hothead. Anyways, the guy just parks at the light with his hazards on. I guess to piss us off. I have to admit, at this point, I thought the dude might get out of his car and things might get bad. My partner decides to back up and go around the dude, but hits the car behind us. So we get out of the car to deal with the accident we just caused, and in the process of exchanging insurance information, the guy that was recording us gets out of his car and keeps recording us without saying a word. He then just took off.

So...could this be a part of some kind of scam? Are we being targeted by a gang? I kind of have a lot of paranoid theories running through my head, and I do NOT want to be shot or tracked down by someone who thinks they've been wronged. At the same time, I really do not like that this man has clear footage of my face. What should I do?

173,"I'll try and sum up my situation in as few words as possible but it's a pretty long story. So about two years ago I was living on my own and was in an open and long distance relationship with an amazing girl. We were very much in love and brought out very positive things in each other. That relationship lasted about two years and ended when I decided to get involved with the woman who is now my son's mother. So things get a bit messy at around this point. I started seeing my son's mother while in the long distance relationship and I was pretty transparent about the whole thing. I had an agreement with the long distance girl that we were free to hook up with other people and there was no need to talk about it with each other unless it became something more serious. I had some history with my son's mother, we randomly reconnected through social media one day and decided to meet up for some drinks. It all started off platonic but soon became sexual. I told her I was in a long distance thing and she didn't seem to mind. We continued hooking up and eventually things became complicated. We started developing feelings for each other. Long story short things got pretty heavy and emotional and I was forced to make a decision. My son's mother was having emotional outbursts about my other relationship and couldn't comprehend why I did not exclusively want to be with her. To be honest I felt I had a stronger connection overall with the long distance girl but I had a stronger sexual connection and attraction to my son's mother so I was very confused by the whole situation. At the time I was also getting pressure form the long distance girl, she wanted to start planning out a way we can eventually live in the same city. In the midst of all of this I was struggling with my personal issues. I actually left a very depressing 5 year relationship when I met the long distance girl. I have always felt that I needed to stay way from relationships because I have a lot of personal issues I need to focus on but for some reason I just haven't had the strength to do so. I have been trapping myself in relationships since I was a teenager and I am now 32 years old and I feel like I've done nothing significant with my life. Being with the long distance girl was the closest I ever felt to be being alone and making positive changes in my life but I was still technically in a relationship and I was definitely feeling burdened by that. So I'm in this predicament now where I feel cornered and I have to make a decision. I decided to break things off with the long distance girl and to this day Im not really sure why. I think it was my son's mother's relentless determination to be with me that confused me. I've always struggled with making decisions, I'm a very emotionally driven person and I often take on the emotions of the women I'm with and I make decisions based on that. So I break things off with the long distance girl but I flip flopped once in between. I broke it off with her but then felt very conflicted about it so I changed my mind and broke it off with my soon to be son's mother and ultimately decided to be with my son's mother. So I decide to dive in head first into my soon to be son's mother's life. She's 31 and already had three children from two different men. She had her first when she was 18 and her second shortly after that. She's a great mother which is something I admired about her. I was raised by a single mother so I empathized greatly with her struggle. In a matter of months I completely turned my life on it's head. I got rid of most of my possessions and moved in with her. I wasn't exactly sure what her financial situation looked like, I just knew she made things work somehow. She was receiving child support and doing things on the side for cash. She didn't have a job but she kept a really nice and comfortable home for her children. She cooked and cleaned everyday etc. So as soon as I moved in I ended up having to use my savings to catch her up on rent. Apparently she was behind. I find out that she only received child support for one of her children from her most recent ex but he gave her extra since he was basically the other two children's only father figure. The first guy was never really involved. So fast forward a couple of months and  we find out she's pregnant. I'm not really sure what was going through my mind during that time, I felt like I was in some sort of manic state because I was not thinking clearly at all. I just felt like I wanted to be with this girl regardless of the circumstance. I ended up taking on full responsibility of the financial needs which I didn't make nearly enough to do so. After we found out she was pregnant she pressured me into leasing a van because her sedan wasn't going to be able to fit our new born. I had very strong inhibitions about this because I've always made sure to keep my life as simple as possible, I was never in debt and lived well under my means but during this period I was dealing with alot of emotional backlash from her. As soon as I moved in she started behaving differently. She was being verbally abusive and witholding affection. She was basically projecting all of her insecurities onto me. The whole situation with the long distance girl left her feeling very insecure and ""disposable."" I wasn't prepared to deal with any of that. I thought that my actions were enough to prove to her that I wanted to be with her. So I made a lot of decisions based on her emotions. I've given her complete control of our finances and I've gotten myself in debt with a lease, a loan, and 3 credit cards. Our relationship was pretty shitty during the whole pregnancy. I worked two jobs for about 8 months. I worked 6 to 7 hours at a digital print shop in the mornings then drove straight to a paint manufacturing place to do an 8 hour shift. So my schedule was 6 am to 10:30pm and everything I earned went toward bills. I stopped doing all of the things I enjoyed. I used to work on art and go climbing, that all went out the window. During the whole relationship I was made to feel like I wasnt doing enough. Like I wasn't doing enough to show her I loved her and I wasn't doing enough to make more money etc. It turned into a pretty emotionally and psychologically abusive relationship. It wasn't all horrible. We shared a lot of good times with the kids, we have a similar sense of humor so we're always makings dumb jokes and laughing at things. We have a strong sexual connection so we had that going for us. She has alot of personal problems. She has suffered from sexual abuse since she was very little, she was raped by her uncle at the age of 16. Her mother basically abandoned her when she was a child because she did now know how to handle her post sexual abuse behavior. She was showing signs of PTSD and instead of seeking help, her mother admitted her into a psych ward when she was around 5. After that she got passed around different family members or lived with foster parents. She's had an extremely rough life. So I know that all of this has contributed to her behavior and I know that my personal issues contribute to the negativity in our relationship as well. After our son was born we had multiple conversations about breaking up. At one point we both agreed that would be the healthiest thing for both of us and for everyone involved. So I came to terms with that and I was fully on board because at this point I was burned out. I was completely checked out emotionally and psychologically. Shortly after that she started taking anti depressants and she suddenly changed her mind. She decided she wanted to leave all of the negativity behind ( she was still obsessing over how our relationship began) and start fresh and really try to focus on loving eachother etc. All of that gave me anxiety because I felt like we reached a decision already and I wasn't prepared to go back on that. I told her I still wanted to break up and told her how I've felt throughout the whole relationship. I felt verbally, psychologically, and emotionally abused etc. And she was having some pretty extreme reactions to that. She believed I was victimizing myself and making her seem like a monster. She felt like I was turning my back on her at her most vulnerable moment, when she was prepared to let her guard down and allow herself to love and be loved. I remained fixed on our original decision to break up and I eventually left the house because things were getting very messy. We were essentially broken up for a couple of months before I left. During that time she immediately got on dating apps, she would randomly go out to bars and leave me at home with our baby. She would come home blacked out drunk. Sometimes she would do this on my work nights. I never really reacted to any of this behavior because I understood where it came from. And I knew that it would only create more turmoil at this point if I tried to address any of it. I was just kind of looking for a way out. Eventually she was pressuring me to leave, my presence there with us being broken up was too much for her so I ended up sleeping on my mom's couch which is my current living situation. I've been here for a little over a month now. I've been seeing my son as much as possible. She's been trying to convince me that we can work through this and that I should come back. I've been struggling with all of this because I love my son so much and it breaks my heart to not be living with him. He's going to be 1 year old in a week. He's such beautiful boy. I recently had a moment of weakness and told her I wanted to start over but after one day of being over there everything felt weird. It felt forced. And I told her I just didn't feel it anymore and she was crushed. I realized the only motivation I have right now is wanting to be in my son's life. She's been having a very difficult time dealing with this. She tells me I'm the love of her life and she really believes we belong together and she's willing to do whatever it takes. She doesn't understand why Im throwing the whole relationship away when our son isn't even a year old. I'm struggling with my feelings right now. A part of me believes that the best thing I can do is regain my independence and finally allow myself the time I need to figure my shit out so I can be a positive influence in my son's life. But the other part of me is terrified that I might be making a mistake. That maybe I'm idealizing this idea of being single and in control of my life again. That maybe I am throwing in the towel too soon and I should give it another shot so that my son can grow up in a family unit. Im having very conflicted feelings about the whole thing. At the same time I know how I feel and how I've felt being in her life. I feel like I don't stand a chance at having any sense of individuality and autonomy. I feel like the circumstance with all of the children and what it takes to maintain it all requires too much of me to the point where I have nothing left to work on my goals and aspirations. But then I also consider her in all of this. It feels fucked up to leave her after she gave birth to my child and added more to her already full plate. She's been telling me that she doesn't want things to go back to the way they were. She's planning on working on my days off to help out with bills. She says she wants to get therapy, she's already on medication but that also concerns me because during this whole process she has also taken up drinking. A part of me thinks that maybe I need to suck it up and man up. That I should just figure out how to be there and just try harder to do the things I feel I need to do, and that maybe we can learn to love each other. I'm also afraid that If I don't go back she will be forced to move somewhere more affordable. She already talked about moving about an hour away because the rent is cheaper and she needs to rent a place with at least 3 bedrooms. This is sort of the summary of what's going on...there are some details that I'm leaving out because this post is already extremely long and ranty. My life is a mess. Thanks to anyone that actually took the time to read this. I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this, maybe I just needed vent. Thanks.",20Jun2019,3

So long story short some dumb bitch in my building set her unit on fire. The fire wasnt that severe but it was enough to run the sprinkler to the point where the entire place was flooded and water got into electric parts and broke everything.

Its estimated to last a week or more in fixing which in itself is absolutely awful but initially the landlord told me to go to red cross shelter.

I dont have friends or family or funds to book myself a Airbnb or hotel or something like that but I begged my landlord I do not want to go to shelter (I've been there with my homeless mother and it was awful memory) so I am staying with landlord for now.

Just wondering if you could give me your advice, other than the typical ""get help""

If you need more information then message me.

So, here's a bit of background,

From a young age I've always had a weird obsession with my Mum, from the point of masturbating to degrading thoughts of her, and using her underwear as masturbation aid.

As times went on and I introduced myself to the pornographic side to the internet, and understood what candid/creepshot photos were I started taking photos of her, never once have I photographed her naked, but maybe in fairly revealing clothing.

I've then gone on to posting these photos of her to multiple people on chat sites, and this went on for a couple of years, I'm 21 now and she's 55. 

I don't know why I do this to my Mum, I love her, but I just dont know how or if I can stop showing her off to people.

179,"Hello everyone! So I am starting a business and I have a lot of great things going for me. I’m doing very well. I’m gonna be making decent money and it’s just amazing because of my past. I’ve struggled with a lot of things. A lot of ups and downs over the years, but over the last 5 years I’ve missed out on a lot of my life. So the main part of starting a business was to live life and have as much fun as I can to make up for the time missed.

A few months ago I promised my brother who lives a few states from me, that one day once I succeed I will take him on a trip to Florida to spend a week on the beach and having fun. I told him the main reason was to go down there and meet a bunch of people and hang out with a good bit of people we meet. He told me he doesn’t want that. He just wants to spend the week with me because he doesn’t want to take the chance of me hanging out with new people and him being left out. 

I told him I want to live my life and have fun. If I meet some people down there and want to go to a party or just hangout with some genuine people, I don’t want him to be that kind of party pooper. I’ve tried to tell him, but he keeps insisting that we just spend the trip together and what not. I asked him why and he said it’s just that I promised a trip for him to the beach to have fun. To me, having fun is meeting other people and well, having fun!

Am I wrong for wanting to make friends down there and hangout with new people. After all, this is what I’ve missed out on most of my life. I’ve broken out of my shell and I know have the ability to effectively communicate with new people, and I just want to have fun. He also said he wouldn’t want me to hook up with a girl because he’d be jealous. How do I go about this?",20Jun2019,3
180,"I am a 25 year old with 3 years of teaching experience. I babysit pretty regularly in the summer and during evenings/weekends for extra money. Although I don’t have a “going rate”, people usually pay me really well because they know I’m a professional. I typically get anywhere from $12-$15 an hour, but some families even pay me $20 an hour. 
Recently, I babysat from 2:30pm on Father’s Day until the following day around midnight, and even picked the parents up from the airport to bring them home afterward (per their request). I babysat for a total of about 36 hours, including sleeping overnight. The kids are 13 and 16, but this wasn’t completely an easy job because I had to drive them around all day and they had friends with them the majority of the time. 
Long story short, I only got paid $100 for the entire 36 hours. I texted the mother and asked if it was a mistake and asked for $100 more so I would feel fairly compensated (even though $200 for 36 hours is still a rip-off in my point of view, but I’m letting it go at this point). The mom was SO nice and so apologetic that it caught me off guard. She made it seem like she just didn’t know the going rate and is mailing me the extra $100. Was I in the wrong here?

It feels like people like what I do, but not me. I met a girl recently who felt so different, and since then she has ghosted me. 

Maybe I’m impossible to love, I just don’t know anymore. I definitely don’t know how much longer I can take feeling this alone anymore. Every day I inch closer to ending it all, and the only thing stopping me is some stupid hope that one day I might matter. And that is fading quickly.

185,"Hey everyone, so I'm 18 and I want to be an FBI agent, specifically a profiler or something of that sort. I'm majoring in psychology and I'm excited for it, the problem is that my parents hate the idea of it and they want me to be like a doctor or some other high-status thing, but I already made it clear I don't want to be a doctor, so they want me to go into IT. Lately, we've been arguing every other day about it, and it just really hurts hearing my parents crush the one thing I want to do, nothing else really excites me as much. I know that it's my life and I should live for myself which I agree with, but if there was a way for them to support me, that'd be great. I don't think that's going to happen though, at least not anytime soon, they really care about what others think, and they seem like they're ashamed to even tell people about my major. I feel like it's a cultural thing (I'm brown), they seem to care about status and money, while I just want to follow my passion, but nothing I say seems to get through to them. Up until today, it was just me and my mom arguing, but now my dad chimed in because I guess he had enough of my ""delusions,"" and he didn't really seem to want to hear me out and basically said, I've been where you are and I know a lot more than you and you should go into IT because that's the best path for you (he's in IT). Any advice on how I can get them to understand would be greatly appreciated.

If I just had this little fantasy that I got off to, that'd be fine, I could accept having this unususl, bi fantasy. 

The problem is, everytime I'm getting worked up now, I want to actually do it more and more. And if I wanted a relationship with a guy that'd be one thing, but I don't. I want a relationship with a woman, and the thought of that makes me genuinely really happy and excited. And I'm concerned how this fantasy might affect said future relationships. 

I'm not trying to repress anything, I don't think that's ever worked for anyone. I'm just looking for ways to deal with this fetish or fantasy or whatever, so that I'm able to live the life I want without it interferring.

I hope to deal with similar issues, consistently, mental health, death, drugs, abuse, racism, war, all of these I want to incorporate in my storyline.

My main advice I'm looking for is should i continue aiming for a kids platform like Disney, or set my sights on adult swim? Would kids even be able to understand these issues?

I told him I wanna work in Cali one day and he says “I think I can def pick up some legal work in Cali”. He Texts me daily. Changes behavior when I say I don’t like it. He says he only thinks of me when he masturbates and he did when we broke up last year. He also told me he would be there for me for forever whenever I had any issues I wanted to talk about. Lastly, he recently told me “Thanks again for coming with me to Visit my family. you are the best gal a guy could ever want 😍” he also randomly texted me “you’re really awesome, I just wanted to tell you that”

He never says he loves me but I also left him last year so he may be hesitant. We got back together three months ago. We dated for five months. I left him because of some issues. He resolved his and I resolved mine and now we have been seeing each other again for two months. Yet, he says he takes things super slow which I think Is code for “I have commitment issues but don’t wanna give up that vagina” he says he takes things slow so he doesn’t get wrapped up in infatuation and make poor decisions about someone since he is old and doesn’t have as much time. I think he just wanted someone to pass the time with since this girl he thought he would marry left him two years ago for no reason except that she fell out of love.

196,"Here's the chronology of this saga: 

I found an ad online for a room and emailed because I was interested. Tried to set up a meeting but I was in a different city at the time so it was slow to set up; he told me to call him then explained that he had rented the place. We talked a bit just casually and he was like ""Aw bummer that we don't get to live together since you play piano plus I like living with students"" (the dude is like early 30s I think btw and I'm early 20s). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember how it happened, either he asked for my full name or somehow acquired it, so that he could contact me if the place opened up in the future and I was looking for a place or something along those lines.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of months later he asks me if I've found any leads and asks how it's going. Days later I respond that I've just signed a lease with two of my friends. He asks me where I got the place and how big it is. I give him information as vague as possible. He asks me to specify where it is in even greater detail, I break the neighborhood I gave him in half (told him north side of x neighborhood). He says we should go for a beer sometime, I don't answer because at this point I'm really trying to indicate that I'm not interested in being this guy's friend (as I've kind of been doing throughout by either not responding to his messages or taking a long time to respond). 

&amp;#x200B;

A month later he tells me he got a place in the same neighborhood. I don't answer. 2 months later ""What's up?. I don't answer. And this pattern continues for a while. He invites me to a show he's playing. I don't respond to any of these messages, really trying to communicate that I'm not interested.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically what do you think I should do, has this happened to you before, what'd you do, how'd it go? I feel like this happens to girls a lot (I'm a dude), but most of my friends think it's pretty weird and I should consider blocking him, but also maybe not because that might make him mad.

Our History:
We met online and don’t live near each other. We’ve been talking to each other for 4 years. We get along really well, and are each other’s best friends. We have managed to meet twice. We have a friendly and sexual relationship. We haven’t dated other people while we were talking and we don’t have sexual relationships with other people. We refuse to do long distance because it would be too difficult. We often talk about having a relationship in the future when we live closer.

Around 9 months ago it was decided that I would be the one to care for my 90 year old great grandfather. This wasn't so bad since the place I was living at was kicking everyone out (that's another long story for another day) and I needed a place to stay. I was sold on the idea that I would be doing almost everything around the house and that it essentially be a full time job and that I wouldn't have any real free time. So I dropped out of college and moved in ready to do what needed to be done. Turns out it isn't anywhere near that busy, my grandmother insists on coming over and helping care for her dad (she lives 4 houses down) I dont really do much. My job has been reduced to taking out the trash, dealing with the recycling, occasionaly fixing the TV and making sure he gets to bed ok. That may sound like a good deal but there are quite a few restrictions to living here. I have to report every time I leave the house with where I'm going and when I'll be back, I'm not allowed to have anyone over ever and can't be out past curfew (9:30pm) and I don't have any real control over things. There are a number of things I want to do with my life and I need to ask permission before doing anything. Basically I'm treated like a kid.

I’ve been feeling really burnt out lately and uncertain that this is actually something I think that I’ll enjoy doing, but I’m fairly close to completion.

206,"Obligatory sorry for the format; I'm on mobile. 

So here's the deal: I have had a dog for the last three and a half years. I bought her as a puppy at 6 weeks old, and she's been my baby since. Thing is, it's been a long time and I'm thinking about getting rid of her.

Of course, emotionally, I don't want to. We've moved out together, she went through months of medical conditions, new jobs, bought a house, I was diagnosed with lifelong conditions, got married, lost another dog, and even got divorced together.  It's been a long time and she's a huge support system for me. I also go through bouts of depression and have pretty severe anxiety; she's been the only constant in my life for these past years. 

On the other hand, I've done a horrible job training her. I don't know how, and things I look up come off as so time consuming amd difficult that I don't even give it my best effort. She is not potty trained, she begs at the table, and she even chews on everything. She is also cooped up all day. I crate trained her from a puppy, so she does well in a crate during the day, but overnight I've been having a really hard time waking up and not sleeping 10 hours a day, so she has been peeing on herself overnight for over a year. She gets maybe 4 hours of playtime on week days, but rarely a walk since I get so bothered by bugs outside. I don't even have a fenced in yard so whatever outside time she gets is leashed. It's to the point an entire floor is unusable because it smells so bad, and the furniture on the second floor has been drooled and pissed on so much my roommate refuses to hang out in the living room. 

I feel like if I tried really hard, I can fix most of it. I would need to invest 5 grand in a fence (expensive due to HOA requirements) and a TON of time amd effort to break the bad habits that she's gotten away with for so long. Honestly, I don't know if I can handle it, I don't know if it'd be successful, and I don't feel like I would accomplish anything given my track record of previous failures with this kind of thing. I'm worried that she is unhappy or hating being in her crate all day, but she has separation anxiety and never stops smiling when we are together. 

This feels like an impossible decision for me and I'd like some advice here. Is it ok to give up on her since I've tried so long or am I a terrible person? Is it even Ok to take her away from the only mother she's even had and adores? My ex husband made me get rid of a dog around this time last year, and I miss her daily.

The way I process emotions is weird. When I feel something, I immediately think about it like I'm writing a post like this one. The way I think, it's like I'm narrating my life. I feel so disconnected from my own feelings, always trying to understand them in this cold manner. Look, the way I'm writing this post? These words are pretty much exactly what's going through my head. When trying to think about the way in which I think, I was thinking like J was talking to someone, or like I was writing a post like this. The way I wrote that passage was what passed through my head as I was processing the idea. I hate feeling like this, why are my feelings some grand narrative that I have to piece together, that I have to think about analytically? Why I can't just feel?!",20Jun2019,1
222,"I’m normally a crier. I can assume someone is sad and start feeling extreme empathy and try my hardest not to cry because I feel like I can feel their pain. I don’t know what happened in my childhood that made me like this, but it can be annoying and frustrating. However, lately, I’ve been feeling very....neutral. Nothing makes me cry, nothing stirs up sadness or happiness. I am getting agitated and anxious by the day because I feel like crying makes me in tune with the people around me and myself. I don’t know how to not feel neutral and feelingless. This could be my body protecting me from recent behaviors that does not sound like the person that I am. I am not sure. Maybe my brain is blocking me from the pain and regrets I’ve been burying inside. What could this be? What should I do to start feeling again and feel like myself?

TLDR;

I guess the main problem I’m having is feeling like I can’t overcome my ADHD symptoms with conventional strategies ie. regular exercise, healthy diet, good sleep, etc. 

Despite being fully aware of the negative side effects of stimulants, I wan’t to revisit the idea of getting a prescription. I have a lot on my plate and want to ensure that I can fulfill my goals. If anybody reading this has been in a similar situation, any advice, words of wisdom, strategies, or stories are welcome. 

&lt;&lt;&lt;

(LONG VERSION) 

I have always had severe ADHD. Im 24 and haven’t had a prescription since the end of High School (roughly 6 years w/ out using them) Recently I have had a lot on my plate with work and school (I recently re-enrolled in school to complete my degree) and have been feeling mentally unable to meet the demands of my schedule. 

I decided to buy a couple adderall from a buddy to see how much they might help me focus because its been so long since I have used them. I immediately can notice the difference. I took them before a shift at work and the usual brain fog and distracting brain chatter was gone. 

I think it would be prudent for me to think about revisiting a prescription. I just want to ensure that I can be successful in fulfilling all of my goals. Maybe if I used something with less half life so Im not feeling the insomnia affects (like w/ my vyvanse prescription in the past) it would be better?

The pros of increased focus and executive function outweigh the unhealthy side affects of the stimulants IMHO. I wish all of the conventional strategies in overcoming ADHD (exercise, good diet, regular sleep) would be enough for me to feel like the symptoms aren’t hindering me. I feel a massive increase in my mental ability to prioritize tasks and make decisions. I know that these drugs are literally prescription meth but at this point: quality of life &gt; quantity. 

The main challenges / side affects I have experienced in the past are:

* circadian rhythm disturbances 
* Lack of appetite 
* Feeling like I have to mentally rely on the drug to function 
* Small things like increased body odor/ bad breath 

If I could come up with a plan to conquer or deal with these challenges and side affects I think it might be worth it to have the prescription again. I definitely need to think about it and weigh the pros and cons.  

Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated. Thank you.",20Jun2019,2

228,"Basically the gist of my problem is I’m worried at my friend’s eighteenth birthday pool party I’ll get groped by his older brother again. 

Not going isn’t an option, I really have to get out of the house and I love swimming and this guy. I spent so much time making him custom resin dice (he’s in my DnD group,) and want to see them delivered in person. My therapist has also told me since I’ve struggled with self harm and self esteem issues in the past, that I should find excuses to wear things that make me feel good. I only have one swimsuit, one that his brother almost undid last year after groping me, and I like the way I look in it way too much to let a creep ruin my self esteem. 

In defense of the man who groped me, he didn’t know I was fifteen at the time and had been drinking rather heavily. After it happened I tried to find ways to avoid being around him, and had tried to do it before hand as well. Eventually he tricked me into drinking alcohol and got forced me to sit in his lap. It was a bad situation and thoroughly uncomfortable. 

I’ve since told my friend this and he’s told me it wasn’t at all my fault, and if it happened again he would talk to his older brother. He’s told me that I’ll have to file some kind of report if he does it again because he feels like talking won’t solve the issue (I think it was implied he has a long streak of mistreatment of younger women.) Since the older brother works for the city now, filing a report will make him lose his job. I really don’t want this to happen because he’s genuinely cleaned up his act, less drinking, no smoking weed, reliable income. I don’t want to ruin his life, no matter how much his actions upset me. Thought he’s sobered up so to speak, I’m still not convinced he won’t try to assault me again. 

I just want to know what I should do to avoid the situation. Maybe I’m over thinking it but I’m pretty worried about everything.  Thank you for reading!",20Jun2019,1

232,"I'm a high school student that's not sure what to do right now. My family (especially my parents) are what I would describe as cruel to me. Although they never hit me, starve me, lock me in a room, or anything on the physical torture spectrum, they often verbally abuse me by saying they wish I wasn't their kid, that I'm an idiot, that I'm a worthless piece of shit, etc. I have a feeling I may have been an accident. Outside of home however, I have many close friends that I really enjoy being around. But even then, I have never talked to anyone about how depressed and hopeless I feel in the fear that I would be looked at as an outcast. And besides, if anyone (such as a school counselor) told my parents about it then I would be in for a world of pain from them. Around October of 2017, the abuse became really bad and I began contemplating suicide. What kept me going then was my circle of friends and the hope that it will all be better when I graduate high school and don't live at home. However, the suffering kept piling on, and about five months ago I just fell into a deep spiral of sadness. I spent almost every waking hour thinking about how much I wanted to die and my plans to kill myself. I started failing school because I was often too sad or tired to do any homework or studying. About a month ago, I attempted suicide for the first time but failed because I chickened out last second. At that point, I decided to just suck it up and wait for summer, since then the burden of school would be off of me. But it still hasn't stopped. My parents still yell at me constantly, and my siblings are pretty big assholes to. And now I'm here. I don't know if I should kill myself, scrape together the money I have and run away and start a new life somewhere else, go to a friend's house and talk to them, or some other idea. The bottom line is that I cannot stand another second of my life being the way it is. Unless someone has a better idea, I'm planning to delete all my IDs, wipe my computer and phone, run away from home at 5:00 AM (its's 1 where I am now), and live as a homeless person under a new name. It really does pain me that I'll never get to see my friends again or tell them why I did what I did, but I just can't go on. If you got this far, I just want to say thank you so much. And sorry if my story isn't very coherent, I'm tired and emotional right now.",20Jun2019,1
233,"He invited me to his parents house for Father’s Day. Call me babe. Kiss me in front of their parents. Clean up after me cause they wanna. Say “I hope we don’t have to worry about that in the future” and holds my hand when I talk about certain health issues. Says stuff like “what kind of wedding would you like us to have?”. I told him I wanna work in Cali one day and he says “I think I can def pick up some legal work in Cali”. He Texts me daily. Changes behavior when I say I don’t like it. He says he only thinks of me when he masturbates and he did when we broke up last year. He also told me he would be there for me for forever whenever I had any issues I wanted to talk about.

He resolved his and I resolved mine and now we have been seeing each other again for two months. Yet, he says he takes things super slow which I think Is code for “I have commitment issues but don’t wanna give up that vagina” he says he takes things slow so he doesn’t get wrapped up in infatuation and make poor decisions about someone since he is old and doesn’t have as much time. I think he just wanted someone to pass the time with since this girl he thought he would marry left him two years ago for no reason except that she fell out of love.

234,"hi! this is my first like asking for advice post so hopefully it’s in the right place.

my parents went through a really messy divorce in 2015 and have really hated each other since. i overhear them cursing at each other over the phone and mom makes comments about him that aren’t great (although she does try to stay unbiased, i think).

basically my dad had an affair and it was super messed up. she found texts on his phone and threw him out in front of my sister and i.

my sister hates his guts and refuses to talk to him. honestly, he is an asshole. i remember him throwing things when i was younger and my mom putting me in the car and threatening to leave him or coming into my room really late to sleep in my bed. he was never REALLY there. my sister and mom HATE him and our dependence on him as he is a main provider and makes a lot of money. 

okay beyond the background, i want to go to law school (i’m a freshman in college now, just an idea i mentioned to my dad). my dad is encouraging of this/wants to pay for my law school but wants me to experience his lawyer life. my dad offered me a gig at his successful law firm for $15 an hour, which would really help for college. the problem is the law firm was started by him and the woman he had an affair with (his girlfriend now). 

my mom is passive aggressive about the job and i think she’ll be hurt if i take it. i know my sister won’t talk to me if i do. the only thing is i don’t want to completely destroy my relationship with him (at least i don’t think) and i want to make money and show him i can handle/am open to handling his career choice.

236,"As the title says, I hate my uncle. 

He's almost 50 and still lives with my grandparents. He refuses to get a job and constantly asks my family for money for cigarettes, weed, beer, and fast food. He's extremely selfish and makes everything about himself.

He also goes out of his way to make situations uncomfortable and has actual tantrums when people don't want to talk about how vaccines gave his friend's cousin's daughter cerebral palsy or how GMOs are what is ruining America.

He's also super racist, sexist, and homophobic.

I could go on for days but I think you get it.

Whenever he comes around I've got to the point where I just ignore him. If he tries to talk to me I give him short answers and try to make myself busy/leave. I'm never outwardly rude to him beyond ignoring him but he doesn't seem to get the point.

He'll also make rude jokes at my expense to try to force me into conversation.

My family is under the impression that because he is family I should just deal with it. They keep telling me that he loves me and that should be all that matters. I don't love him. I think he is a leech who has only hurt my family and doesn't care about anyone but himself.

237,"I am a 23-year-old university graduate with an English degree. After graduating last year, I worked variously as an essay editor for younger college-bound students, an oddjobber for a family friend, and as a farmstand employee, living with my parents in my childhood home. In mid-February, I moved back to my university to serve in informal advisory positions of clubs I'd been a part of and as a research assistant to a former professor. In May, I flew to Thailand to teach ESL for a 6-month contract. Within that info, I am sure the absence of a singular focus is clear. As I have done before, I expected an external change of setting to create change that really must come from within. 

In 23 years of life, I have been a disaster. In my college summers, I found excuses for not actively pursuing work beyond sporadic odd-jobbing and one food service part-timer at 19. I have lived a purely passive and consumptive life, compulsively using the internet, engaging in cyclical self-pity, and permitting my own inaction to impact my loved ones. I have experienced depression for a decade, but have invariably used it as a way to escape responsibility, throughout high school deceiving my parents and myself that I could not attend for huge stretches of absenteeism because of invented/imagined physical limitations. 

When I left to do research this past spring, I felt I was finally breaking out of my years of idleness and wrongdoing. I felt convinced that I would not be returning home again, that I would move into an apartment with a buddy and summarily find a job upon returning, and overall, become the genuine adult I should have been long ago, and have been legally for 5 years. Being in Thailand, I have realized that such a future right away is illusory. I will have nothing in the way of savings, as what I save now goes directly to paying off credit card debt before more interest accrues. I lacked the fore-thought and awareness that one needs to demonstrate financial stability to a realtor or landlord. My father shared that he in fact expected me to return home for at least some transitional period.

The prospect of being a 24-year-old at home for any stretch of time daunts and shames me. I have already robbed my parents of so much time and energy. My thoughts often fall to suicide, with the classic rationalization that others would be better off without me (i.e. the emotional distress my own troubled-ness must cause my parents). There is another, faint part of my brain, that says I do possess positives - I am well-liked by others who find me personable and compassionate, and I am often told how unique I am. But if I am to keep living, I need to get gainful employment, move out quickly if I do return home, and work harder than I ever have to make up for the hurt I've caused.  I would be grateful for any and all suggestions for getting my act together - career advice, self-improvement practices, anything at all. Thank you.",20Jun2019,2

239,"TW: Suicide Attempt/Mention

Obligatory I’m on mobile bullcrap

So, a couple months back, about March, it was a thursday afternoon and we’d just gotten home from school. The day prior, my sister was in big trouble for hiding a lot of shit from our parents and being caught in it, etc. So i’m sitting in my room, taking off my uniform, when my sister comes up to me and looks me dead in the eye and says “i just took a bunch of pills”. 

Lets call Sister S for now

I..froze. I had trouble processing I suppose. She jokes about this stuff a lot so i suppose a part of me didnt take it seriously. I hear a phone call downstairs, and my mom talking to one of S’s friends mom. She SCREAMS at my sister to go downstairs, and my sister, now a little dizzy and out of it, stumbles downstairs and admits she did it. 

There was a whole fiasco of getting S to the hospital, texting my dad, and me being home alone for a very long time while that happened. My mom and dad were wrecks. I cried very hard to my boyfriend over the phone, but after that I suppose i took up the role of mediator, appealing to every party, calming my parents. It’s something i do to cope. 

My sister loved the mental hospital. She loved the attention (my parents are anything but neglectful) she loved the people, and she would (and still does) get PISSED if you mentioned she tried to kill herself. She never apologized. A single time. She stopped saying i love you to us for a very long time. S did this for attention (and coming from someone who has trouble with suicide himself, i dont take that statement lightly)

It’s like she forget we suffered too. My grades heavily suffered. My health both mental and physical suffered because of the stress. She blames ALL of us for what she did, we did nothing. Shes always been incredibly narcissistic, rude, violent, angry. she loves watcing us suffer. Shes a fucking momster.
I want an apology. We apologized to her for things we may have done. She holds this over our heads. Our home is not our home its a worry that shes gonna do it again and she loves it. I’m angry. I’m upset. I still haven’t forgiven her. She fucked so much up. 

I’m probably not making sense. I’m just angry with her to this day that most of all she never even apologized. She thinks this is just okay. What she did was not okay. 

And yes, she is receiving help from therapy and anti-depressants, its not like we have ever denied her these either.

245,"Cousin 1 is C1
Cousin 2 is C2
(different sides of the family)
Girl 1 is G1
Girl 2 is G2

To preface, I love my mother very much. In the past year, she has given birth, become the sole source of income in our house, taken in C1, and puts up with my cheating POS father. She’s going through a lot with all of this on her plate and it recently got worse.

You see, C1 is visiting our family with a visa. Two months ago, he hit it off with a family friend’s daughter, G1, and they’ve been spending a lot of time together since. C1’s dad heard about them from my mother and he proposed a marriage between C1 and G1. C1 was excited about the prospect of getting his papers because he wants to pursue a music career in the US and my mom just wanted to help her brother, C1’s dad. So, as his proxy, she started a conversation with G1’s family about the two of them getting married and they were all for it. My aunt immediately got mad because her son, C2, had a failed marriage with the daughter of one of my mom’s friends, G2 and they never got back the money they paid her. G1 was supposed to be C2’s backup plan and my aunt got very upset with my mother for “stealing” G1 from C2. It affected my mother a lot because she doesn’t have many friends and the way my aunt and her family talked about her and disrespected her was very rude and nasty. Anyways, my uncle paid 5k to G1’s family as an advance and things looked like they were going well. About two weeks ago, my mother and G1’s mother stopped talking and G1’s mother has my mother blocked on everything. Neither she or G1 are picking up any calls or responding to texts. The one time my mother managed to talk to G1’s mother, she said that she and G1 were no longer interested and she did not listen to my mom and her questions about the 5k. My mother sent C1 to G1’s house and her mother yelled at him. My mother and C1 went to their house today and they didn’t let them in. My mother found out that my aunt and G1’s mother are talking again (my aunt iced her out after she found out that C1 and G1 were going to get married). My mother basically got scammed and she’s been freaking out about the money her brother will lose. She doesn’t know what to do and she’s the only one doing anything about the situation because C1 is honestly useless and cowardly. My father doesn’t know about any of this because he’s abusive and would likely just yell at my mother and kick out C1. My aunt is probably not going to help my mother out of self-interest. So basically, my mother is shouldering the burden of the situation all on her own and I’m very worried about her. She’s losing weight out of stress and is sleeping only a few hours every night because of a combination of her crazy schedule and stress. The bags under her eyes are practically bruises and she’s angry all the time. I’m very worried about her possibly having a breakdown or getting sick.

248,"Okay so I have 3 girls who are into me and me into them. The first one has liked me for over a few years and we have been kind of rekindling what we had for the past few summers. Lately I’ve been into her since she’s super sexual and knows what I like. The second girl I’ve been fwb for the past year and helped me with a lot of emotional baggage from my past relationship. She helps me with a lot of situation that usually result in me growing as a person. The last girl is an old ex of mine that is just into me this summer and usually calls me for support. I don’t foresee a relationship with any of the three since I’m still muddling through my past relationship and I’m not emotionally ready for another one as of yet. Despite this, the first two are still sexually involved with me and I have kissed all three. Am I in the wrong for being into all three and not pursuing one? I’ve told all three that I’m not looking for anything serious.",20Jun2019,0
249,"I just need to understand what’s going on through his head? I wish I could get your thoughts on this.. this is gonna be long.

So my ex’s (29m) relationship background: he was with this girl for around a year, but for some personal reasons they can’t be together, so she breaks up with him and then 2 weeks later she comes back running, crying wanting him back, they get back together for 2 weeks, she leaves him again and it goes on.. And its happened so many times. Their relationship was very unstable but they loved each other apparently.


So I met him.. right off the bat, we clicked, he pursued me and we were great, and I fell deeply in love with him. Until a week ago, we were fine.. but he did confess that he missed his ex a few months ago.

We planned our future together, planned to get married by December, where we wanna move, travel, etc.. (mostly him planning, not me)

Then last week, he wasn’t acting normally all week long. Just very iffy, snappy and sad.. i asked him whats wrong? And he just starts crying and sobbing telling me he doesn’t know what to do, he doesn’t want to break my heart but he still loves his ex(?) and he thinks that if he was with me, he’ll just think about her..

I’ve asked him so many times when we first got together to tell me if he was sure about us and he kept reassuring me that nothing’s ever gonna change his mind about me.

He kind of asked me to make a choice if I were to stay or leave, and I asked him what did he want? He said “ i dont know what i want.. i won’t be okay if you left and I won’t be okay if you stayed (because he loves her).. i dont want to lose you, you’re an angel and you’re a million times better than her, i swear.. and no one’s ever going to love me and care about me like you do.. but the heart wants what it wants”

And I guess he kind of didn’t give me a choice. So I told him that okay, I’ll just leave. And i left.. but it was like he dumped me. I dont know how to explain. He asked me to make a choice but didnt give me one.

I found out he got back with his ex 2 days after, and that she called him last week wanting him back lol and he just went back running to her lol

He blocked me on twitter, whatsapp, calls...


What the fuck was that? Is he ever going to fucking feel bad about stringing me along for this long to just do that? How does he sleep at night? 

I fucking gave him all the love, attention, care, respect.. everything. I gave him my all and it feels like he just brushed it all away...........",20Jun2019,1
250,"So, I turnt fifteen recently. I tried getting one when I was fourteen, but everywhere that had a position was 16+.


But *somewhere* must be willing to hire under sixteens. My cousin had a job as a paper boy, but I do not know the area well enough for that. I know the name of my street, and that's it.


I even tried volunteering, just so I had *something*, but everything I tried, you had to be 16+


Babysitting is out of the question because I don't know many people with babies, and those I do know wouldn't pay me for taking care of them. Believe me, I tried it.


So, what I'm looking for is job suggestions, places to look, and tips on how to actually get the job, if they hire 15 year olds 


I wish I could just get one of those card thingies so that I could make money online, I could do that, I'm good at internetting, but my mum refuses to let me open one, even though, I looked into it, and she'd be able to see everything I buy, where I get the money from, literally everything. 


It would just be that I wouldn't have to go to her every time I want to buy something online, and I'd be able to make money whilst at home.


A little advice on how to convince her of that would be appreciated, too. I looked it up, I can't open an account without her 


Card or not, though, I'll need a job either way.


Btw, I'm in england, I know there are some laws in place that limits the time underage people can work, I don't really understand it all, would I be able to work more than one job? If someone could explain those laws in dumb teenager terms, that'd be great, thanks!",20Jun2019,1
252,"My mum's had a messed up life, abuse both physical and sexual as a child, abusive partners, partners commit suicide, and separation of partners. And it's all taken a toll on her mental health. Which, after he last ex boyfriend, has tanked. 

After indulging in high amounts of drinking wine and alcohol for the best of two years, my mum has formed a dependency on alcohol. Even though her ex boyfriend, when he was drunk, physically, emotionally, verbally and attempted to sexually abuse her, did the same. 

Now every night when I get home from work, there she is on the back veranda, drunk, off of already a whole bottle and is getting ready to start the next. I feel like I've lost my mum, and now, she's become a ball of hurt, upset and anger, mixed with alcoholism, and regret. 

I've had fights with her, but when she told me she wished my brothers and I were abortions, that was too much. 
I want to get my mum back. The mum that was there when I was weak, the mum that when I was hurting, fought for me.

255,"Ah, I tried making this post a couple of nights ago but I basically didn't have the guts to leave it up and I deleted it. Another situation happened today and even though I partially talked about it with my friend I didn't tell her everything and I'm just scared in a strange way. Just to get this out of the way before I explain, I am NOT self diagnosing myself. I am not a doctor or a medical professional so I have no say in whether or not I have an eating disorder or not. 

On with the post. I'm not exactly sure when I started having these thoughts or when I started binging, I never really paid attention to it growing up. I've always been overweight and self-conscious so I thought maybe, I was just making up things in a strange way to help myself cope. Lately, it's gotten worse though. Whenever even a slight inconvenience comes my way the first thing I immediately reach for is food. It's not just small portions either, sometimes it could multiple meals worth within in just a few hours and then I'll eat my normal meals with my family as well. The strange thing is, I don't feel full anymore. I just still feel empty. I may be full physically but emotionally I'm just so drained. I haven't purged (yet) but it's definitely a thought that has crossed my mind a lot. It scares me and I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying to tell myself it's just me being a fat bitch and that I can stop, but I feel like there's always something there blocking me from being the healthy person I want to be.

I haven't even mentioned the dark part yet. These thoughts don't come often and I don't think they've gotten any worse, but sometimes I'll look at women at school or on social media and feel ashamed of myself. The shame drives me into thinking ""if you starved yourself maybe then you could be proud of yourself like they are. do it. don't eat. you'll be happy"" It crushes me so much to admit that I think like that, but I just need to get off my chest. I don't know if I should get medical help our not, because I haven't done anything bad to myself (yet) 

The last thing is, even if I do want to get medical help where do I start? I'm not comfortable talking about this with my parents and I currently am transitioning between doctors so I don't have a close enough connection with any of them to feel safe or comfortable sharing such personal emotional issues.

I apologize if that was an emotional dump, but I feel the lowest I have in years and it's so draining. I just want it to be over.",20Jun2019,1

259,"Hello Reddit, long time reader, first time poster. I'm going to try and keep this as anonymous and as SFW as I possibly can, because I would like all the advice that I can get. I'm 20, and there's this woman that I have worked with for the past year that I have always found to be extremely attractive, despite our age difference (she is in her early 30's), and the fact that she is married. I have never explicitly hit on her because of that fact, however she has made comments on my body in the past, and I have been in no hurry to stop her, even playing along occasionally because I know it would lead to nothing. Fast forward to this past week, I have been working at my new job for about 2 months now, and we have made multiple plans for hanging out, and today, she asked if I could help her move her friend into a new apartment. I agreed, seeing as how I had nothing to do today anyway, and throughout the day she was very touchy feely and flirty. During the move, she told me about how her and her husband have a hall pass agreement, because he had cheated on her in the past, so she gets a certain amount of hall passes for the amount of years he had cheated. She has never used any of these hall passes she says, but she wants to use her first on me. She told me to consider it, and I really am, but I have a couple of problems. 1. I am currently a virgin, and she doesn't know. 2. I mean obviously there may be a moral conundrum on my part, in that I would be  having sex with a married woman, even if hall passes are in play. Nevertheless, I still would love to have sex with her, but I'm afraid that my lack of experience may hinder my performance. I don't really know if I should tell her, because if I do, maybe she would no longer find me attractive? What if I don't, the sex sucks, and she basically just wasted a hall pass on a bumbling loser? If we do go for it, should I ask her like the boundaries and whatnot, like what I can and cant do, such as going down on her? Or should i just do it, and if she doesn't feel comfortable with that, just lay off... Is this morally acceptable on my part to do, having sex with a married woman, knowing that there is no chance of an emotional connection because she is married? I don't know, this is all just new to me. Any advice on any of the questions I presented would be much appreciated. Thank you.",20Jun2019,1

It didn't take long till we made up but our friend had informed me that the entire time that she was talking to him she kept saying ""I'm never going to date someone who's bisexual"".

263,"Hi, everyone.

So yeah. As the title says, the idea of joining the work force is scaring me a bit. For a number of reasons.

First reason is my social anxiety. Some of you might know how it is. Every time you talk to someone, even friends and family, the idea that they're judging you is a constant presence in the back of your mind. Sometimes you're way too quiet because, as much as you want to contribute to the conversation, the thought of saying something stupid or unintentionally rude scares you into silence. The second something finally leaves your mouth, you spend the next few minutes, hours, even the rest of the day, wondering if it was inappropriate. I'm a psych graduate, so I'll be looking for a job in HR. That involves *a lot* of talking to people.

Second reason is that I don't think very highly of myself. My brain has formed this notion that everyone is smarter and more competent than I am. This might be an inferiority complex, I guess. I try to remember that I'm better at certain things than other people, and that everyone is better than me at some things, but a lot of the times I'm just stuck telling myself ""everyone is better than me at everything"" and ""there's nothing I can do that they can't."" When working in groups, this thinking holds me back from actively participating and making suggestions. It leads me to believe I shouldn't bother because nothing I bring to the table will be worth anything. 

This next reason kind of ties in with the second. I feel like the idea that everyone is better than me partly stems from the fact that I'm a very unfocused and forgetful person. I'm way too easily distracted, my mind wanders a lot, and I find myself lost in thought all the time. Back in school, projects and homework would often take up more of my time than they should because I'd always pause and think about useless things in between. I'd misplace my things a lot because, well, I forget where I put them. 

All of this put together creates this fear that when I get a job, someday, somewhere down the line, I'm gonna fuck something up. The worst part is I can see how irrational the fear is. I know people don't judge me as much as I think they do, and I know I'm not as incompetent as I think I am. I'm pretty sure most of us can see that our anxieties are unreasonable. But it's when you're in the moment that the anxiety takes hold and you forget the reassuring things you've told yourself at the beginning of the day.

But yeah, that's all I got. Not really sure where I was going with this post. What you just read (if you made it this far, thanks for reading) is basically what my train of thought has been for the past fifteen minutes. Thought I'd get it out in some form.",20Jun2019,1
264,"I recently moved across the country into a house with my best friend and signed a lease with them to get out of a bad situation. We both get a certain amount of money given to us each month and agreed to split it in half but I haven’t seen my half of it (the money gets deposited to her bank account). At one point she even agreed I should use all of it for a few months so I can get settled since she has a decent job, a car, luxury items, and has lived here for a while.

I recently went on a long trip and was only sent a tiny amount and it wasn’t nearly enough to cover any expenses or close to being my half. Her excuse for not sending more was she had to pay her bills but my money shouldn’t be used for that especially when she pays for things that aren’t needed. She spends money like crazy and I need to save my portion of the money so I can get a car (where I live a car is necessary to get a job or go to the store) and small things that I have needed for a while. 

She expects me to ask permission to use any of the money instead of depositing it to me, but I am an adult and should be given my money so I can use it when I need it. Its very demeaning and embarrassing to ask for basic things like underwear or a toothbrush when I could easily buy it myself. 

I know half of the money should be given to me without asking for it but I’m not confrontational at all and don’t really know how to bring up these types of  subjects. I don’t want her to think I’m being mean or demanding especially since I’m bad at bringing up serious subjects.  I’m really struggling and she has a full time job plus tons of benefits so her half of the money is just for extra spending. I’m really upset that she has spent hundreds maybe close to a thousand of mine and I can’t even get what I need to be comfortable living someplace new and I’m not sure what to do.",20Jun2019,4
265,"Hi,

So for some context to who I am and my situation.

I'm a 15-year-old male currently in my 10th year of school in Australia, I live with my single parent mother and 2 siblings, one older brother, one younger sister. I wouldn't diagnose myself with social anxiety as I can function in social situations I just often or not isolate myself preferring keeping to myself. I'm not the best looking and not fit \[Things I would like to change about myself\] and have a decent plan for my future. My father lives with his parents and I only contact him once or twice a week.

&amp;#x200B;

My complication comes with my current living situation, I live with my mother and 2 siblings and I'm currently having difficulty with all my family members.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister is 12 years old and is favourited by my mother, she can do anything she likes and more often than not will get away with it, she constantly attempts to ruin plans I make and I am unsure why, I have attempted multiple times to get along with her but I'm usually treated to a bundle of emotional abuse

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 20 years old and currently unemployed, he is constantly emotional and at times physically abusive with me when my mother is not around, and when she is it is usually dismissed as banter or he will get a light slap on the wrist, my mother often compares me to him which I severely dislike as in my eyes he is nothing but a waste of space, and that is very harsh to say about a family member but the amount of abuse he's put, at this point I don't consider him family and without a heartbeat would disown him

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a single parent and cash flow is very scarce, I once offered help in the financials of the house but was treated with a bunch of offensive comments towards my education and blame shifted towards me having no respect, she often just plain ignores me and when I do get to talk to her becomes hostile easily and with me and emotionally doesn't support me.

&amp;#x200B;

I myself am not a saint, I am not a very clean person and can admit it, I often become emotional over things easily, recently I have become very emotionless, often not even feeling joy in everyday activities I use to love. My social life is a wreck considering I now isolate myself furthermore and at this point in my life, I don't have a single person to emotionally open up to and as a very emotional person, it has taken a toll on my character.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I really don't know what to do, The home space I currently have is very hostile and I often come home late and sleep early just to not contact with my family, my education suffers, my personal and social life is crumbling and the only choice I see now is to move.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents are nice people, they raised my dead beat farther but also my uncle who has proven to be a very successful man. I feel like my best option now is to disconnect from my family and move in with them, this has it's own issues as they aren't very young, all my activities are located away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think, I believe to better myself I need a non-hostile environment but is it right to just get rid of my family like that? I don't know I'm honestly at this point very confused with my own life and need an outsiders view.",20Jun2019,2
266,"Hi reddit, so today I started a new medication called Truvada. For those of you unfamiliar with the medication, it’s essentially a medication that has a 90% success rate in preventing HIV transmission into the human body. Now I started this medication because I am a gay male who engages in anal/oral sex with other gay men. However, the ethics behind Truvada (or PrEP) are a little skewed and I noticed that today.

I’ve had a history of making risky/poor choices when I go out to bars/clubs, particularly gay bars/clubs. As of recently I think I’ve begun to realize, that even though I’ve continuously tried telling myself before I go out, I will NOT make poor choices (such as leaving with a random man) I continue to make these choices. And thinking more about the situation, I’ve began to realize that maybe if I can’t truly control myself in those settings, maybe I should try to avoid those settings altogether, as I do not behave that way when going to “straight” bars. 

So today when my family found out about my new medication, they were bothered by the fact that I even feel the need to go on the medication, as instead I should try to change my behavior. They’ve become more aware of my risky behavior habits, and agree that maybe I should stray away from gay bars, as they trigger me to make poorer choices (along with alcohol use).

So here is my current issue:
I have a friend who moved a few states away this past year and I am visiting this friend in a month for a few days. In our itinerary we decided we want to try to go to a gay bar together. HOWEVER, if I did leave this friend, they would be VERY angry with me. And upon the realization today that maybe avoiding gay bars might be a good idea, I tried explaining to this friend that I don’t want to go to the gay bar anymore because I don’t trust myself in that setting. Well, she believes since I “care about her so much” that if I were to go to a gay bar with her, I would have the self control to not leave her with a random guy. And what bothers me is the fact that she’s not understanding of the fact that it isn’t about me not caring about her, it’s more so of the fact that I know myself and I know I have a hard time controlling myself in those settings.

If you’ve read this far, congrats.

269,"The company I worked for had me sign an NDA so I can't say much, but the jist of it is that death means nothing to me. It is all just numbers and stories. A mother forced to wash her hands in the blood of her daughter, a market bombing, a city leveled- it's all the same. My ex could never understand what I saw or read and made me feel alienated, like I had no compassion for what was occurong. She cared so much for the dead in the city square, but it was just a number and an event to me because how could I care for the ten dead over there when there were thousands every day?

I ended up at a genocide museum one day and when she and others asked what I felt I had to lie instead of saying nothing because my work had made me so used to death and the way of genocide and making people disappear. I said that I felt something but not a lot to seem normal, but in reality it was all numbers to me and I felt no sadness.

The company lost their contract and now I am left with a useful skill, feeling nothing towards the massacred. A skill companies that deal with death on a mass scale may value, but I think this may hurt my ability to be empathetic in future relationships.

I do the same thing every day, wake up, read, watch tv, play videogames, eat, repeat. Can someone help me figure out what the hell to do with my summer and what can I do to keep myself entertained.

She just graduated high school (I graduated a year before her) and have found out that she’ll be attending the same university as me.

284,"So I meet my friend this year, and we got close pretty quickly. We got each others snaps and texted every single day. The more and more I got to know him, the more I realized that he would do anything for me. He always thought he was a bad friend and would go out of his way and buy me stuff I didn't ask for. And don't get me wrong, it was definitely reciprocated. I made sure he was always happy and listened to. Now here's the problem. He is really fucking annoying. He is loud as shit and when we are walking, people stare at us and make comments. At first I thought, 'fuck them.' But then I began to understand where they were coming from. He would say really weird, gross crap very loudly and the attention of everyone would shift to us. Now, I'm known to be a calm and quiet girl and I hate the damn attention. And when we were in class it was obvious that no one in the room liked the guy because of how annoying he was. He would make really loud cringy jokes that no one would laugh at. My friends would come up to me and ask me, 'how could you be friends with him?' So I talked to him about it. He apologized a lottttttt and kept going on about how he felt like he was a terrible friend and he couldn't believe someone as awesome as me was friends with him(his words). Anyway, he told me he would be more courteous and aware. And he was...for about a week. Then, the cycle began again. 

One more annoying thing about him, is that he is clingy as hell. 

A part of me regrets ever befriending him, but he is such a good friend to me that I feel bad for having these thoughts. And he has never had someone treat him as well as I have(according to him).

Should I drop him?",20Jun2019,1
285,"So lately I've been thinking a lot about my sexuality. I've identified as lesbian for the longest time and I have a girlfriend too so there's no doubt in my mind that I am attracted to women..but sometimes I am also attracted to men. Ive dated, kissed, and flirted with men but I have never had sex with one..Nor do I have the desire to. And that's kinda why I'm confused. I know for a fact that I love women but I'm not sure if I like men in the same way. 

For example: I've had things guys before I decided to just stick with my ""lesbian"" title. Even after when I wasnt dating a girl I would flirt with guys and even talk to them in a romantic sense..but it would never be anything more than that. I am completely fine with having physical contact with guys up until it comes to sex. I just simply cannot be sexual with them. Not only that but my past relationships with guys also have never seemed to last long either.

So I guess the question I have is- what does that mean for me? I find guys and girls attractive and I seek attention from both sides. I find both physically attractive too. Hell, they both give me butterflies lol. But I only enjoy the thought of sex with girls but not with guys.

What does that make me?

(P.s. I am very faithful to my girlfriend but I would just like to figure this out so I'm not constantly thinking about it)",20Jun2019,1
286,"I'll try not to ramble too much as I know you guys might see this post frequently...  

I'm never good enough. For the job. For the relationship. For friends. I'm currently in my room with tears pouring down my face with the thought of suicide in my head. I'm 21 and my whole life has just been a series of me not measuring up. 

I'm never as good as my siblings, and I can see the disappointment in my parents eyes every time I fail.  ( Comparison isn't good, but it's impossible to ignore when friends and family do it for you ) I'm the only one in my family with no friends or significant other. It doesn't matter who I meet or become friends with, I can only get so close with them, and then they eventually lose interest in me. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?! 

What happened to that ""there's someone for everyone"" bullshit?!! why the fuck haven't I found them yet? Where's my group of friends?! you probably can't tell from the post, but I'm such a good and nice person. I get along fine with everyone, but no one really cares about me...

my social anxiety doesn't help ( can't get medication for a few reasons) finding friends online is probably my best option but I don't know where to start, And highly doubt they'd respond.  I don't have much in common with my co-workers so that isn't an option either.

The few friends I do have don't really care about me. It's pretty obvious. They don't message me out of the blue or ask how I'm doing. They'll send memes here and there, but don't actually start a conversation with me. They also never ask anything about me... There's so much shit they don't know. 

Having friends is the bare minimum of having a life and I can't even manage that. 

I'm lonely and miserable as shit, and I can't think of a reason why I shouldn't end it. It's been around 5 years of this depression and nothing has changed. I can't go to therapy because I can't afford it and I don't have insurance. I'm fucking screwed. People say it'll get better... Okay, well I don't want to waste all of my 20s and get to my 30s and still be this way.

288,"This guy I was friends with, we'll call him Dan, confessed that he liked me around early May. I didn't return the feelings, because of unrelated details, but Dan was persistent so I eventually started liking him after about 2 weeks. When I asked Dan what he'd do if I told him I liked him, he said he'd ask me out. So I told him, and... nothing. I would've asked Dan out first, but I didn't want to push him. Since Dan forwardly told me that HE would ask ME out, I thought when he didn't, he wasn't ready. Nothing happened for about a month and a half, except flirting.

 I was getting really tired of flirting, and I had asked him multiple times if he wanted anything more than what we had. He would always say ""not yet"" and ""I want to take things slow."" Now, in mid June, he has finally asked me out, but I'm unsure if I even want to go out anymore. He said he wanted to get to know me better, but I've known him for almost 3 years and I don't really have much left to share. I consulted my other friend, and he said that Dan was leading me on. However, I believe I'm to blame because I knew Dan would take things slow, I just didn't understand how slow. Now, it's clear that he likes me more than I like him. (It wasn't always like that, I've just drifted apart from him since May)

I tried my best to wait patiently, and I said time doesn't matter to me even though it does (Which was my fault). I'm afraid if I tell Dan that what we have is going too slow, he'll want to jump into a relationship now, which isn't what I want anymore. My friend says I should put my needs before Dan's, because the only reason I'm miserable now is because I only think about what he wants.

 Dan is a sweet guy, but this whole thing has dragged out to a point where I don't know how it's going to get better for me. I want to break it off, yet he has already told me about girls who have broken his heart because they say they like him, and then change their minds later. I believe I'm no different from the girls who have hurt him before.

296,"The last half year of college I have been mostly in a team with 3 people. For this post I will call them Pete and Tom.

We had to form groups in the beginning of this semester and I happened to be together for the rest of the semester with Pete and Tom.  All good, I thought, little did I know what was about to happen.

During the first half of the semester I noticed that Tom wasn't really that active so I did most of the work together with Pete.  In the beginning, it didnt really bother me that much as the workload wasnt that bad yet. Fastforward, 1 month later, Tom started getting way less active and never responded to any messages. If he showed up, he was an hour late . I wasnt looking forward to the next 3 months as this was really getting to me. During this first half of the semester we had 2 courses and for both I decided to just put his name on the reports and move on. 

Second half of the semester was basically the same. We had 2 courses with the 3 of us and 1 course with some other people joining our group. For one course we had an exam and at 4 AM THAT DAY he messaged me that he was not going to be able to attend the exam ......... GREAT. 

Now, the last course of the year, this is where the fun starts, we have had 1 month the time to make a report with 7 people of about 20 pages, nothing to crazy, we devided the roles and most of us started working. Except for Tom, after asking a couple of times how his progress was and not getting ANY reaction I decided to take his part together with another team member. We just finished the report in time and I was doubting if I should put his name  on the report this time. My heart said yes but my mind said no. 

So I didn't. I send him a message that I didnt include his name on the report because he has done absolutely nothing, 0.0, for this report and that it isnt fair to the others. Now he says that he has done so much for our team bla bla bla and asks me to still put his name on the report. 

Should I include his name on the report or not?

300,"Hello, I would like some advice on what me and my aunt (mom's sister) can do here, or even if we can do anything. Bear with me because I would also like to put her background on this so you know all the facts and see why I need outside advice.
   My mother is in her early 60s. She will never admit it, but it's obvious that she has depressed my whole life maybe even before, She doesn't take care of herself or her hygiene, and there's other things that contribute to it. We've even tried getting her into therapy, together even, but she stopped going when it got to real for her and the therapist basically told her about herself. We know that now she will never willingly get mental help because she doesn't want to face anything. Shes the type to run away from ALL her problems. Ever since she got on Medi-Cal where everything is free for her, it's been an annoying repetitive nightmare. 
   So About 2.5 years ago, She told us that she has cancer. She hasn't been able to tell me what stage it is, or any factualndetails because they ""have been trying to figure it all out"" she doesn't have a primary care physician or oncologist. She gets her care at a friggen walk in clinic (which I found out later on). Back then she would talk about her treatment options being radiation then maybe chemo... well 2.5 years later and she hasn't started any treatment.
  Our biggest problem is that She has become addicted to the Emergency Room with her main goal is to be admitted. Not even joking, they send her home, tell me and my aunt she's fine, but she'll be back the next day. They can't deny service so... yep. It gets worse during holidays, or when anyone in the family has a health problem. This year has been too excessive. Sometimes they pump her with pain meds so I thought it could be that, but idk. She's run all of her friends away because they don't wanna hear it anymore. She will send pages and pages of text messages when she gets upset with anyone, and throws a fit and gets really childish especially when we ask her specific questions, especially when we ask for the names of  the doctors and nurses treating her. She does not tell us because obviously she herself knows she exaggerates, and that we'll find out some truth or something. But she'll turn it around and say we don't believe her thats why we ask, then she goes and tells everyone that does speak to her that we don't care about her while constantly talking down to us.  🤦‍♀️ There have been instances where me and my aunt have taken time to leave work to drive her to the emergency room because she says that she is in SEVERE 10/10 Pain or bleeding from (down there cuz we can't see). So because of her repetitive history, we would drop her off, and go back to work which would set her off into one of her tangents. I am one of her emergency contacts, so if something serious were to happen, they can reach me. My aunt told her that if she keeps going to the ER just to get released in a few hours, she will not take her anymore. If there was A real emergency, she can call an ambulance and it will cost her nothing. She has now been driving herself to and from the hospital. She will tell us she is going to the hospital again, but not go for like 4-6 hours later even though she tells us how much pain she's in. She has convinced one of the ER doctors that she has a hard time walking, so he let her have a Walker, and she was ecstatic. Even though others told her she doesn't even need it. She asked for an arm sling,.. just cuz she probably thought she'd get more sympathy. She got one, and was wearing it out, and my aunt called her out one time when she didn't have it on, and was lifing things fine. Then my mom instantly acted like she was in pain again. She has done this being obsessed with hospital thing in phases before, but not this bad. It's always been clear to us that she is exaggerating, or simply just trying to get attention. Getting worse after separation from my dad. 
   My last straw was when in February when my grandma (her ex husband's mom) passed away, then she decided to tell me that the Doctors only gave her two years to live. I highly doubt ER doctors can come up with a life expectancy. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt just in case because of course I don't want to lose her. She told me this almost a year ago... still no primary care or treatment of cancer. She has no explination for this and won't give me the name of the doctor that told her this. 
   She gets pumped with painkillers then gets sent home. I've called the nurses station multiple times that she's fine, nothing serious to worry about. Im fkn over it. This last time when she was in there, she tried to talk them into transferring her to a skilled nursing facility and my aunt said she was there with her, and my mom was told that there's absolutely no medical necessity to send her to one and she got upset. Medi-Cal won't cover it anyway so idk who she thinks would pay for it.
   Me and my aunt have talked a lot about how she really needs mental help. It's obvious that she has a lot going on in her brain, maybe even chemically because of this behavior and all the drugs she's taken over the years that she didn't need probably doesn't help. I have tried to speak to a case manager at the hospital, and it got me nowhere. Me and my aunt I have no other options to think of. We really want her to be psychologically evaluated, and I am surprised that the hospital hasn't taken any measures to get her the mental help that we keep telling them that she needs. Because she will not go willingly. Is there anybody else that we can talk to at the hospital, or anybody in general oh, so we can hopefully get a handle on this? I feel horrible because of the fact that I'm thinking in the back of my head she might not even have cancer. But I'm not going to bring that up and open up that can of worms. I just really want help getting my mother the help that She actually needs. Me and my aunt are so scared of something happening that actually is serious, and that nobody will believe her, including ourselves. And it is really upsetting that we have to feel that way about her.
   I appreciate any advice that is given, even if there really isn't anything that we can do, at least I will know and then take measures some other way. If you read this whole thing, thank you.",20Jun2019,0
301,"I'm not that kind of person who seems problematic or has issues on the outside. People define me as a person with a likeable attitude and with an exemplary sense of humor. I also am the universal go-to for people with problems, since I always give the ""proper"" advices (or at least, that is what they told me). It's fine for me before, however, as 11th Grade progressed, school has been hell and my grades are becoming low. Being an asian (lmao), having tiger parents is a common thing so their expectations has put a lot of pressure on me.

Then, prom came. I really have a very very very low self esteem and confidence, and I feel like I can't do anything, I don't deserve anything, and I am not worth it. When the event started I felt like a loser since when the dance part came, everyone stood up, leaving me. No one asked me to dance. It's not that big of a deal, really, but it really makes me even more unconfident since I dolled myself up and no one approved of how I look. My friend and I have the same make-up artist but when we both entered the area she literally had been showered with compliments. That very same night, I couldn't even cry myself to sleep since seven people called me and told me about their problems, and I helped them settle it (I wasn't able to sleep). I only told myself ""they had a bigger problem than your whiny self"" and honestly, it whenever I had a problem, I just shut it with that thought. 

I really thought I was fine and that I was that typical class clown without any problems in life until we were reminded that it college entrance tests are coming. I had to pass the #1 university of our country since my parents wanted me to do so, and I also wanted to go. I was so pressured since my sister took the same entrance test and became one of the top 40 examinees (out of 100k takers) that when she told me in public that ""It's your turn to pass"" I literally fainted. 

I thought I was only dehydrated, but the mere thought of the exam makes me dizzy and naseous, and my hands couldn't stop shaking. My head hurts a lot nowadays. I also space out without me noticing, and lately, my tears flow without me realizing it. There are also a lot of family problems happening, but I can't share it to some relative or friend. I couldn't. No matter how hard I try, I couldn't muster up the courage to share them about my family problems, or my anxiety, or how a lot of people have done me dirty since I am afraid to change what they think about me. I don't want them thinking that I'm problematic or that I'm more than just funny. 

My mom scolded and told me how severe my low self esteem and my anxiety was and said she'd appoint me with a psychologist if I wouldn't stop. Should I consult one?",20Jun2019,1
302,"So since forever I always wanted to be a star. Just be the best at whatever I do or have all the accolades and joy. I know, cheesy but true. You know what I mean, expectation.

I still carry around this mentality of when I’m better my life will be better. I just have to aim higher do better. Well I’m sick of it. I should just accept that I like to smoke weed, watch tv, and sleep my life away. Joking but not joking.  My question is at what point do you just say this fantasy is not reality. Real life is boring, lame, and sometimes just the shits. It’s not that people are not aware of this they just don’t have this unrealistic expectation.

303,"Before I start, I'd like to mention that I am female and on the younger side. I'm also very lonely and anxious.

Most of my classmates have crushes, either celebrity ones or boys in my class. I, on the other hand, really do not understand what I'm feeling.

A lot of boys tend to call me names and bully me, so I'm obviously not attracted to any of them. Another reason why I'm not attracted to any boy is that I've had two friendships with boys which ended horrible and ended up making me feel pretty bad about myself.

I've seen some celebrities who are good-looking, but never really felt attracted to them. I find it kind of weird to crush on someone you'll never meet and will never truly know personally. But that's just my take on it.

However, there's this one girl that just makes me feel a certain way. I've been feeling this way the entire year, although I haven't given it much thought until now. I feel nervous but warm inside when I talk to her. I admire her a lot as well. It's not her physical appearance that makes me feel this way, but rather her personality. She helps me a lot with different things and she's a very kind and generous person.

I hung out with her once, when I had the courage to ask her to hang out. I really want to do it again. I had to work up a lot of courage to ask her, and I'm not sure how to ask her again considering that we hung out a month ago and that summer holidays are coming soon.

Sometimes I tell myself that I shouldn't feel this way or that I'm being silly. I get intrusive thoughts about it sometimes which I try to immediately dismiss. I feel really bad for having these thoughts.

Is this just a passing phase? Will I find a guy later on that I will be attracted to? Do I just want to be friends with her but feel weird because I have no friends?

I had something smaller but similar to another girl last year. 

I'm too nervous to talk about it with anyone else, so I decided to post it here. Please help me out, I feel clueless about this.

TL;DR: I don't have any feelings towards boys but I feel warm yet nervous with one girl. I feel like it's silly sometimes or that it's a phase.",20Jun2019,2
304,"So one of my coworkers is having a going away party and invited pretty much everyone except one of our coworkers. It’s very obvious that this wasn’t a mistake because it’s happened before and I hate it.

This is the only time I’ll be able to see that coworker before they leave and I don’t know how to proceed. Do I let the excluded coworker know ahead of time to lessen the blow?

310,"So my best friend and I were talking, and I’m not quite sure what a message they sent means. Here’s a part of the convo:

Friend:
“Ok”
“Well I’m excited to talk to you tomorrow”

Me:
“Thanks for having this talk [best friend], I’ll talk with you tomorrow”

Friend:
“I feel like the last week has been a busy one for both of us”
“I missed our conversation”

I’m not really sure what they meant by that last line. I thought maybe they meant something like they missed talking to me, but I’m not sure because of the way they said it. Any advice on what to say to this, or what it means?",20Jun2019,2
311,"First things first, I am raised by a conservative family. We don't have strict rules about dating but in our culture, being an aggressive woman is a big no-no. That man should court woman, not the other way around. To know the person well first before accepting them as your girlfriend-boyfriend. No sex on first dates or even no pre-marital sex. I was raised that way, but when I studied in the city to study for college, I met a few women who is a total opposite. And for a few weeks now, I was working as an intern and I have met a co-intern who is totally opposite. She always brags to us about her sex life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't have a boyfriend but dates with a foreign man on tinder and have sex with them. So this co-intern went to Macau and just came back yesterday. She brags about meeting a Russian man in a bar, dancing with him while they were drunk and even went to his place to have sex in the bathtub. As I am not comfortable to hear the rest of her story, I just put on my headphones and listens to random songs on my phone but I can still hear her. Bragging that the guy is super hot with 8-pack abs and how great their sex was. I can still hear her right now how hot this certain guy (another guy she met). She keeps on saying that d\*ck is the most important or whatever. I just can't stand her. Take note, she is like 2 or 3 years younger than me. I am 24, F.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being judgemental? I can't help but find her cheap and an easy-girl. Or maybe I just can't accept that girls/woman of new generations are just like this and this is normal?",20Jun2019,2
312," Let me start this off with some contextualization. I come from a heavily conservative Indian family, which means that while growing up, my parents have constantly been telling me that I need to study either medicine or engineering. From the moment I hit middle school, I faced a constant bombardment of IIT-JEE prep courses and general railroading towards the engineering world, especially as both of my parents are computer engineers. The catch? I've never been even remotely interested in medicine or engineering. From a young age, I've excelled at debate, which honed my research skills, analytical thinking, and policy exposure. I've always known that I wanted to do something along those lines, but growing up in South India, that was always out of the question.  


After my sophomore year of high school, we moved to the US, and boy did it hit me like a breath of fresh air. I was introduced to a land of endless possibilities, and families that were supportive of their children no matter what field of study they entered. I was enamored, and began to think that maybe I may have a chance to study what I wanted. So one day my junior year I summoned enough courage and told my parents I wanted to study government, with a focus on environmental policy.  


I was ridiculed and branded delusional for even bringing up such ideas. Liberal arts are for white kids, they said. What's this about you not liking math? That's not acceptable. Stop debating and focus on your studies.  


When I began applying to college, I had the chance to apply to some very prestigious universities. My grades were great, I'd gotten 5s on all my liberal arts AP tests (think APUSH, AP Gov, AP Lang etc), and I had the extracurriculars to back me up. The moment I brought my idea to my father though, I was immediately shot down. ""If you want to study government, pay for it yourself,"" I was told. Things got to a head when he refused to pay my application fee unless I applied as a prospective mechanical engineering student. At the time, I was financially dependent on my parents for everything, and had little sense of independence. I put my head down, allowed myself to be bullied into submission, and said okay. Maybe engineering wouldn't be so bad, I told myself. Maybe I could study environmental engineering, and it would somewhat align with the goals I had envisaged for myself.  


My first year of college has been miserable. I managed to BS my way into a top engineering college on the East Coast, and I am struggling like I never have before. My grades have tanked because I am way out of my depth. Competing against kids who have studied multivariable calculus since the tenth grade and who are there because they want to be is both incredibly challenging and incredibly demoralizing. I feel like a fraud, and like there's nothing I can do in my situation.  


To make matters worse, my university is divided into individual colleges. To feasibly transfer into my university's College of Arts and Sciences (to study gov), I'd have to submit a formal transfer request, for which I have nowhere near the required GPA. My grades are in the dirt, and I've been placed on academic probation because I'm just not able to keep up academically. I'm lost, demotivated, and in a rut.  


I can't bring this up to my parents, because when I do, they give me the same stock responses, every time. ""Engineering is hard for everyone. This nonsense about government is just an escapist fantasy."" ""You're an arrogant, ungrateful child who can't appreciate the sacrifices we've made for you."" ""If you're too stupid for engineering, there are always minimum wage jobs looking to hire."" I cannot tell them that I have been depressed for the past three years, that I am absolutely miserable watching my friends live out their dreams elsewhere, that I feel guilty because maybe I am being ungrateful and throwing away a shot others would kill to have. But I don't know what else to do.  


I really want to study government, and I really want to work in the public sector dealing with environmental policy in the future. I'm not a bad student, either. I had straight As in high school, and got really high grades in my writing and singular environmental policy class in college. I'm passionate about the environment, about political theory and analysis, and about civic engagement. I've recently been looking at withdrawing from the College of Engineering and reapplying to my university's College of Arts and Sciences, but I'm terrified that my low GPA disqualifies me from consideration. I've been looking at external academic forgiveness program at other universities, but I'm afraid my parents will cut me off financially and I won't be able to afford college anymore.  


I'm terrified, you guys. What do I do?  


Tl;dr - I want to study government but my parents have pushed me into engineering. Now I'm flunking college and I have no clue what to do. Please help",20Jun2019,1
313,"Okay. So I've been reading through some things posted in r/inceltears. And I've been having a good laugh at it. But there were a few posts that kind of stuck with me. 

The first was basically about how your teenage years are the ones that decide who you're going to be. 

Now, I've always been a bigger guy. (I've actually lost alot of weight recently, and gained some muscle while losing fat. Not the point. But carrying on. I feel myself falling back into patterns I had back when I was younger. (I felt like everyone secretly hated me, I felt like no girls would ever want me.) And now I'm 21, and managed to get a spot as a cadet Firefighter, and I love it, but still feel odd about things. 

And the 2nd was basically a ""daily reminder"" that... 

""You will never have a girlfriend

You will never have sex without paying for it

You will never be normal

You will always be creepy

You will always be hated

It's your fault

It doesn't get better.""

Now I like to fancy myself as a hopeful person, but I'm a 21 year old virgin. (A little embarrassed to be admitting that.) And no, I'm not blaming women for my lack of success or anything, I don't blame anyone except for myself. I'm the problem. And I'm trying to get better, but what if it doesn't work? What if I just end up right back where I started and end up again a bitter, lonely, and just awful. 

I guess I'm just trying to keep up hope that I won't become a bitter, sexist, racist, homophobic pond scum, but idunno. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but right this minute, it's rough. Maybe I'll feel better after I sleep for a bit. Idunno.",20Jun2019,1
314,"So recently the new roommate came in, we talked for the first two days and now we don't talk that much. I'm very quiet around new people while she's the opposite.She said that she is very expressive, and even the landlord had told her that I was very quiet. The apartment is very small, and we sleep in the same room so it's really uncomfortable, 
I'm upset because all my other roommates aren't shy or quiet for the first few days but they become so when they're around me. I try to keep the house clean and I'm not noisy so I'm just uncomfortable to be around with. I don't know if they don't have conversations because they think I'm creepy or because they think I don't like to talk and don't want to annoy me. I have anxiety for which I'm taking medication  so that may cause my quietness a little and I'm also going through strange times. 
How can I make the house feel friendlier for both of us, I don't necessarily want to become best friends with her, I  just  don't want to feel like we're living with a stranger. This has happened to me before so it's my problem, it's not like I'm just not clicking with this specific girl",20Jun2019,1
315,"So I'm turning 21 this year, and I've never had alcohol. I've maybe had a sip of wine before when I was a little? But I have actively chosen not to drink since I knew what drinking was; nobody in my family is/was an alcoholic, but I saw how stupid and dickish they were whenever they drank.

I've been in college for three years now and most of my friends drink, especially at parties. I still go and have a lot of fun sober, but of course I've wondered sometimes if having a drink or two would make it even more. I'm confident in myself, and I've never felt peer pressure to do it, it's just curiosity more than anything. I'm not interested in drinking to excess, or reaping bad health benefits from alcohol or anything, and if I ever do try to drink it would be when I'm legal.

Am I missing out on experiences because I don't drink? Should I try it? I don't feel like my social life is lacking because of not drinking, but I've always wondered if it would make things even better. Any advice is appreciated!",20Jun2019,0
316,"When I meet people it usually goes pretty well for a few months but after that when they start to want to hang out more and more I slowly fall behind and have a hard time wanting to do more and more things with them. Usually it goes downhill from there, how do I avoid this?",20Jun2019,1
317,"I found out this girl I have a huge crush on has a bf, but we are still somewhat close even though we were never together together. I feel so sad around her when she visits, and she doesn't know that I found out about her bf (she never told me but unknowingly snapped a clip of her and a guy eating lunch together on table for 2 - they are together obviously). 

She notices my behavior has changed around her and she keeps asking me if everything is okay. I make excuses like I am sleepy or tired or something. I can't look her in the eyes anymore and can't smile because I feel heartbroken. I never dated her or slept with her, but I still feel heartbroken.

Someone might say to distance myself from her, but I don't want to be rude and tell her to go away. I also have selfish reasons - she makes me so happy being around her normally when I don't have this heartbroken feeling. I have never been close to anyone like I have been with her to feel comfortable to share my inner thoughts, even if I don't feel her reciprocating. I lose my mind when I am around her, and I spend so much time rehearsing conversations in my head before she is even here. Not a single day goes by that I don't think of her.

Anyways, how do I hide my sadness from her? I don't want her to feel like she is making me sad and stop hanging out. She is like one of those people who make everyone happy when they arrive and disappointed when they leave. I want her to keep coming and conversing. I just don't know how to mask my thoughts and feelings. If someone were to observe our interactions from a distance, they would know I had crush on her right away. She doesn't realize or chooses to ignore it. I can't tell with her since she is so private about herself.",20Jun2019,1

319,"In November 2018 a family friend opened a sneaker shop and I had around 70 sneakers that I decided to sell him that totaled to be around $2,828, I helped him because I’m close friends with his brother. 

Now the agreement was he make payments to me and I would collect biweekly, and every time I hit him up he came up with excuses. 

Then in March 2019 when I asked again, he tells me the shoes got stolen when he put it at the storage, I called bs and he still proceeded to make an excuse. 

We arranged for him to start making payments of $100 a week...until he blocked me on everything. Mind you he was posting pics with cash.

The guy is a brother of a real close friend of mine and if he was anyone else I would have jumped him by now. 

I now know where he works and the time he works but I don’t know what to do.

Some options are go in there try talking nicely, get a couple BIG friends go make a visit at the store, or sue him in small claims court but the only thing is he shows no income so there’s no point.

We both signed up for a summer course and in the first day of summer course I went to see  my class  and the weird thing is she is with me in the same class same subject 😅 we were shocked and all and then after we finished the class we couldn't talk to eachother because we got busy with our friends even tho we both were giving the eye contact and we really wanted to talk to eachother.. the next day she came and she was shy to talk to me we had fun and she felt comfortable around me but later on I have been noticing that she is replaying late to my messages like it can go to 1 hour maybe 2 sometime  to 40 minutes and I don't know what did I do I didn't even annoy her with my messages nor irl like when I see her I be busy with my friends even her too and I noticed that she is looking at me from time to time I know everyone gets busy with their life but that doesn't mean to reply to me after 1 hour and you be online and posting stuff on your account..

329,"I guess a bit of history is required. My parents had a love marriage (contrary to the arranged marriages that are common here) (Indian here) and even after 27 years of marriage, mom's family hasn't accepted their son in law. I'm the younger 19 year old daughter while I have an older 26 year old brother.

Mom has depression from work stress and the fact that she feels lonely. That she has no family for herself. Both me and brother are away for our studies. I'm home right now for my summer year end break. My brother will be home in a weeks time.

My dad has anger issues and depression and takes meds on and off. He usually blames work stress for it. Yesterday, after already being stressed about work, mom and dad got into a fight.
About not travelling for vacations enough (mom) but being too sick and tired to actually travel (dad). I knew the fight was going on but actually kept quite and didn't interfere at all. Mom was giving dad the silent treatment at dinner and finally he broke. He slammed the plates and shouted. He even shoved mom/ hit her and it got nasty. He spent the rest of the night in his room in a huff. Mom already had  issues related to her spine and neck and this only worsened it.

Dad had never been physically abusive towards her and she was so scared that she spent the night on my bed with me. Both of us didn't sleep. The next morning dad apologized (of sorts) and even went on to say that she has to stop with the tantrums as he was feeling suicidal and that he didn't want his children to be fatherless.

Dad went away on a business trip tonight and I guess that will serve as a breather for both of them. But I doubt things will ever become normal again. They've had nasty verbal fights ever since I was 12 and after years and years of butting in and trying to solve it, I had given up. No matter how many times I tried to mediate, it never worked, but it rather affected me quite drastically and my friends and therapists had suggested I stay away from their issues. Me not butting in yesterday was my attempt in doing so. (Eventhough I did make him stop hurting her and shooed him away after that). Leaving for uni (I'm done with 1 year now) was refreshing as I didn't have to know anything about the fights. Which made me resent my brother now.

He's been away since age 17 and that's when the fights were beginning. He never had to deal with any of their fights while I'm constantly having to butt in and help. I hope that he can help with the issue, once he's here, a week later as I honestly don't know how I can help solve this problem. But at the same time I feel like I failed as a daughter by not butting in yesterday. Help, please?",20Jun2019,2

331,"I really am at a loss here. My mom will be super happy one minute, and really angry the next. 

Yesterday she was talking about booking a doctor’s appointment because she was feeling unwell. I offered to do it for her, because she somehow feels as though she’s wasting the practice’s time (even though she’s registered) and doesn’t deserve to see someone. Her mentality is if it isn’t immediately life-threatening it’ll be fine, but only when it comes to her own health. She agreed to let me book an appointment, and that she needed to be seen by someone because it’s getting worse. I told her last night I’d be calling at a particular time to secure a slot for her. 

So I call up this morning and give her date of birth and ask for an appointment. Usually there is no issue with booking on behalf of a family member. However, because it was a follow-up,  the receptionist asked to speak to the patient (my mom) to confirm all the details. I said I understood, and asked the receptionist for a moment so I could wake her, as she was resting next door. 

I went in and my mom sat up, described her symptoms, thanked the receptionist for booking her in. While on the phone she seemed pleased, but after she hung up, she proceeded to get angry at me, for doing exactly what was arranged the night before. Her reasoning was that because we had spoken earlier that morning I should have reminded her of the phone-call, even though we had literally had this whole conversation before bed yesterday. She’s not a forgetful person, and I didn’t see a need to say anything because in my view it was already sorted. 

I want to point out that I didn’t force her to have an appointment, just suggested that if her only issue was booking that I would be happy to do it. She had also been complaining that she was feeling unwell quite a lot, given that I am not a doctor this was the best I could do. She started saying that I shouldn’t be booking on her behalf (even though... she asked me to) and that I should have reminded her, but other times will ask why I bother asking when I’ve already said I’ll do something. 

I’m not really sure how to navigate this. I know she has some other bookings/ errands coming up which she’ll likely ask for help with, and whilst I understand being part of a family means not keeping score with disagreements I’m not sure whether I should just let her tackle these herself, so as to avoid a repeat?

I was invited to go and play football/soccer with them so I did. I got there and it was all good but like 10 minutes later, Bob just turns up out of nowhere around the corner. He goes up to me and a fight breaks out and then I just leave.

Anyway, I tell a few people from school about it and I get a mixture of responses. Some really supportive, others confused but one of these guys I told is going around and telling absolutely everyone about this as it is some joke. He is saying stuff like “Guess what haha? He got punched by Bob hahahahaa” to everyone and everyone is responding by laughing as well.

Everything was going smoothly but for the past week I've started to suddenly feel uneasy whenever she won't reply for just 5-10 mins or longer. I started overthinking whether she still wanted to talk to me. The thought that there are some things that take priority over me always took over my mind and i don't like it. Because of this, i always ask her what she's doing, and she would really be weirded out and quite annoyed since i keep asking. I would even be ""cold"" when talking to her because of these thoughts. I've never really been like this before and i don't know why I'm like this. There's even this time where she invited some of her friends for a sleepover, and we both knew that i can't go because her parents might discover our relationship and such. However, i still got upset since i always kept thinking that she didn't want me to go anyway. We've talked about this already a few times and i thought that was enough for me.

339,"I have a friend who was my college roommate for 3 years, we get along really well and have a lot of the same interests.  Lately they won’t do anything with me, like play video games or watch shows online.  Heck, they barely respond to my messages.  We haven’t fought, yet, but we probably will tomorrow.

See, my friend has undiagnosed autism, and so they’re not good with social stuff.  The other night they were upset that their special interest friend was treating them, well, like they treat me basically, and they wanted advice or comfort or something from me.  So I tried to stay as caring and helpful as possible even though the topic was striking a nerve, but then it came out that they consider me a throwaway friend and wouldn’t really mind if they lost me compared to their special interest friend.  

They backtracked pretty hard without me having to say anything but it felt insincere and I am still hurt.

I still tried to help them, I don’t think they even realize I’m upset, but I’ve been trying to ignore this feeling for days and it’s not getting any better.  I don’t want to lose them as a friend because I have social anxiety and struggle with making friends more often than not, but I feel like I have to talk to them about this.  I also have the feeling if I talk to them about it we’ll stop being friends.  

I’m so anxious about tomorrow that I can’t sleep.  Any advice would be welcome, but mainly on how to handle a delicate subject.",20Jun2019,1

341,"Ever since I was young  I have always felt like the black sheep of the family, an outsider.
Its my father's side of the family and it means the world for him. He was raised to belive that family comes first and its the most important thing, he passed those values to me and it screwed me up. 
My cousins have always been close and the more I tried to fit in with them the more they pushed me away.
 At first I assumed it was the age gap (I am 19 and they are 21, 22 and 24)  so it caused me to date a 21 year old while I was 15 (luckily it only lasted a few days and nothing happned between us) but as the years went on and I have made many friends who are older then me (my best friend from collage is 23 for example and most of the guys I dated were 23-28 years old) I understood it has never been about the age so I started to serch for diffrent reasons. It was the easiest thing to blame my looks since they are all very attractive and beautiful while I am a bit of a plain Jane (or this was what I thought, now I am more confident). 
After I left my abusive ex, my cousin (24) started to ask me while I left him and what happned so I said by mistake ""I dont need a boyfriend to lower my self esteem when my family does that perfectly"", at first she did not understand but I told her the whole story . 
Problem is that it will not change a thing, they have grown up together, they have history but it hurts, I know I will never be able to truely be a part of them and it made me resentful towards my whole family and caused many issues. 
I fight with my parents all the time because of that, every family gethering is a strugle for me.

342,"I've had this friend for the past 2 or 3 years and we've been really close. Him I and another guy are sort of a group, and we go on discord most nights to chat and play games. When things are going well (which admittedly is 90% of the time) we have a good relationship, he makes me laugh which literally nobody else can do. Throughout these years I've had numerous ""big"" fights with him over trivial things that escalated, and we didn't talk for months after some of them. The last time it happened, we were just hanging out one night with a couple of others and we started discussing politics when all of a sudden he started personally attacking me and saying things purely to hurt me. He does this a lot, the moment he is annoyed or wants to win an argument, he will do anything to win the argument even if it means throwing away one of his ONLY two friends. I don't say it as an insult, he's introverted and doesn't like a lot of people's company so he's distanced himself from past friends and now he has me and the other guy in our group. But that being said, to win one petty argument he will insult and embarrass me in front of other people and keep on going, and in that moment you can tell there is this inherent nastiness to him, that he doesn't give a shit about me at all. It's so strange, he's just all of a sudden able to snap into this horrible insulting person that is set out to be a dickhead for no reason. It's the sort of behaviour I had as a child, and I worked on hard to improve because I was a prick as a child. I used to get angry and say the rudest shit to the people I love and not just simply not care about what I said, I'd just be in this rage and then turn nasty, but as I said I grew up when I was like 13 or 14 and realised that I can't treat people around me like that. The most annoying part about this is that he always manipulates the situation into me being the asshole, and that his opinion is only stated after he carefully thinks about things whereas I'm irrational. He'll also just deny any times he's been a dick in the past. I don't know what to do, because yes after reading this it seems obvious- ditch him. After our last fight all my other friends said cut the fat, and told me he isn't worth it, and yet after a while he came to me and apologised (albeit right before this trip to see our third close friend in another city, so it did really look like he came to me when he was bored, alone, and needed something out of me). I forgave him and we've had one fight since but honestly, when I'm chatting with them on discord every night I have a great time, I actually laugh and just enjoy their company. Every other friend I have that I see on a weekly basis are clearly more thoughtful people which is why I try to maintain a close friendship, however they don't make me laugh, and I feel like I carry the friendship. That's fine by the way, but it's tiring and it is nice to have someone who you can bounce off and just have fun talking to. So, all this being said, I feel it's almost inevitable another big fight will break out, I've de-escalated things a few times recently but it just always happens, he is so dead set in his opinions, even though he is a strange dude with a very unique outlook on life (which is fine), however he seems to think any opinion he has is obviously true and everyone else is a sheep, therefore no constructive debates and ZERO arguments can break out, literally zero, otherwise it WILL turn into a big fight. This is dragging on so I'll finish with this; I am in a point in life where I really need friends, and friends that I can enjoy spending time with. Whenever I see my other mates we end up doing the same thing, having the same conversations, and to be honest if I don't come up with some idea of what to do or talk about then it'll remain the same. I want to enjoy my life, and I do enjoy it with this guy, he's just a fun friend to be around and I hate being alone and just not socialising. I've tried to meet new people but it's not easy where I live. In the end if I do cut the friendship with him I'll probably feel like I have a backbone and feel as if I've stood up for myself, but until I find new friends that I can relate to, I feel the negatives of being bored and continuing the same pattern of having a dull life for the past 2 years will outweigh my ""pride"" in shedding the only person I can find joy in hanging out with. So yeah, any advice?",20Jun2019,1

And I cannot seem to let it go and not think about it anymore. There was hours of crying and many many sorrys and he has promised me up and down that he would never do that to me again and I believe him and trust him again yet, I keep worrying about it a lot.

He always reassures me that it'll never happen again and there is nothing to worry about but yet it comes up in my head...and it makes me think it happened in the first place because of the way i look....and my self-confidence is like a roller coaster.

348," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it also she sometimes look at my hair funny sometimes :/",20Jun2019,0
349,"Hi! So I'm currently in a relationship with this wonderful girl. However we decided to keep it lowkey since our parents would surely not approve with it, and we're currently separated this summer break. 

Everything was going smoothly but for the past week I've started to suddenly feel uneasy whenever she won't reply for just 5-10 mins or longer. I started overthinking whether she still wanted to talk to me. The thought that there are some things that take priority over me always took over my mind and i don't like it. Because of this, i always ask her what she's doing, and she would really be weirded out and quite annoyed since i keep asking. I would even be ""cold"" when talking to her because of these thoughts. I've never really been like this before and i don't know why I'm like this. There's even this time where she invited some of her friends for a sleepover, and we both knew that i can't go because her parents might discover our relationship and such. However, i still got upset since i always kept thinking that she didn't want me to go anyway. We've talked about this already a few times and i thought that was enough for me. I know that I'm being too immature and clingy to her. I'm sick and tired of being like this and I'm afraid that i might destroy our relationship. I'm really thankful to her for being patient with me. I need help. Thanks.",20Jun2019,1

351,"I will not go into the full details of what happened, but there was a situation whereby I was told to ""f\*\*k off"" by my friend for interfering in a matter whereby they were treating someone else unfairly. After over a week after this event, said (now ex-)friend removed me from all social media and has not talked to me ever since, nor makes eye contact when passing by me. From my point of view it seems especially strange that someone would engage in such tactics when they are at fault and could have clearly handled the situation better.   
It's been over a year but for some reason I feel like I want to approach them and ask what really happened and why they reacted as such.

The conversation went so well and we had so much in common. We talked through the night and she ended up falling asleep.

365,"So I was in a long distance relationship with someone for about a year, we had known eachother online for a good 3/4 years before dating. Both young when we met and 19/20 when we decided to date.

Things fell apart in the weeks leading to our 1 year anniversary, I had been placed on strong meds and she was having her own mental health issues.

When I was on the meds I completely changed, I lost interest in everything in my life (100mg zolft btw) I didn't lose interest in her, but the way I was acting made it seem it I think from her view, I still loved her very much, maybe too much, but I stopped showing it, I didn't call as often we didn't set date nights and I basically became this distant asshole.

We had fights over things like anyone does, our main one was money and how we'd visit eachother, (I never gave her money she never gave me money we avoided that) I was struggling to get a job and she got sick of it often,

But we had a fight over it as we would, she lost hope in me fully this time, I recently broke a promise, that was 9 months in the running and it deviated her. I couldn't visit, not for a while.

The fight happened and I honestly ignored her texts and calls this time I just wanted to sleep so I did, and woke up to a shit load of messages, with her finally saying I wasted her time and she was done with waiting for me.

I never replied, after a few days she took that as a sign and blocked me on everything,

What we had was gone she wiped me from her life

I did get in contact a few times but it was in the worst ways possible, after the ""breakup"" I stopped my meds, started drinking heavily and doing drugs again, that I had previously had stopped when we started dating

I know this is long sorry,
I've cleaned my act up, even discovered who I was really and came out a trans,

But after all the change I've made I still can't shake her, not necessarily wanting her back, just needing to apologise, I have nightmares for what I did to her, she basically haunts everything I do and I feel so guilty for how it ended and how I let myself get angry at her while high and drunk.


I noticed a few weeks ago that she unblocked me on one account, she doesn't follow me on it but it's unblocked and I really want to message her but it seems her life is going well, doing the things she always spoke about, if I message her I'm just the bad past hurting her good present.

Should I message her to make amends, not even to get back in her life just to apologise for my actions and how I made our happy relationship fall.

366,"Her and I have been best friends for almost four years now and have been through a lot (seriously way too much). We almost dated during the first year but ultimately stayed best friends mutually. Through these whole four years we've always been there for each other and put each other over everyone else.
Recently she's changed a lot. She's become supercial and somewhat fake, I suppose she's always been like that a bit but now she's gotten way more. She's made a lot of new friends that are superficial like that as well and I think they're affecting her too much. To top all that, that fake personality she's going with has lead to be the most negative person when I'm around her. Just sitting with her takes a lot of mental effort.
Another thing she does that really bothers me is that since she broke up with her boyfriend she's making a lot new male friends and just starts separating from me. It's not a nice feeling when you're willing to give your all for some you consider a best friend and they're just not.

368,"To Post all the details would take too long.. So here's a summary

Abusive dad since birth-

Crazy strict, controlling mother-

Older sister who treats me like trash -

About 2 irl friends, no more, no matter how I try-

I was born for my sister, she asked for me so my. Parents had me. She was good for the first few years, but by the time she was 14 and I was 9, she treated me really Badly and we got into lots of fights. This was ok, since we were still kids, but it seemed to have gotten much worse since my. Mom seperate from my dad 3ish years ago. Dont get me wrong, me and my sister both hate him, but It's like she has become him. Keep in mind im 17 now and she's 22. 

When I was younger I struggled with baby fat, I wasn't that unhealthy, it was just hard for me to get thin. She would use this against me, vc ING me fat cake, obese, etc, but then later acting nice and saying I was pretty. I actually had developed an eating disorder because of her comments which I had only recently started to get over.

Ontop of that, she will constantly put me down, act as if everything i say or do is stupid or useless, and the worst part, be extremely agressive and make me out to be worthless.

For example, I had refused to do the dishes (not a set chore) as I was studying for an important exam the next day, she got mad and I told her to fuck off (keep in mind she started insulting me first and I was stressed) the next minute she slams my door opens and makes this extremely agressive expression. Im use to this though. When we were younger she would constantly hit me, and when i told my parents, she'd get a ""talking too""

Even today that's all she gets, ive talked to my mom multiple times about how she hurts me, she just nods and says she will speak with her. I get that she can't be punished, but it's like, no one cares about the fact im being mentally abused every single day by my own sister.

Its made me lonely to the point of suicide, considering I have went through much worse things all alone, mainly because whenever I tried to talk about how upset I was, my family members would act worried in the moment, but then not care at all. I've tried so hard to. Ale friends, but i only have two that live far away.

Im trying.. Im studying and trying to keep. My head up but.. Im so lonely.. And idk what to do anymore


Its like im not important.. I dont even have a family..",20Jun2019,2
370,"Oh boy, where should I start?

Well my name is Marc, I'm 21 years young and I'm from Germany.  
I never thought that I'm gonna ask such a weird and intimate question in the world wide web, but here I am...

&amp;#x200B;

I've no idea how to describe my problems, so maybe I just start by describing how a normal day looks like in my life.  
Basically I get up at 5 am, get my stuff ready and head to my work.

I wouldn't call myself socially awkward, I'm a very friendly and open person and like to sit together with my colleagues. I'm definitely introvert, but wouldn't identify myself as a shy. I enjoy conversations, however I'm always that guy that only listens. I just don't feel confident to say anything, 'cause I think it's not worth to mention and I don't want to bother anyone. It's not that I don't say anything, just way less than anyone else, I just talk if I really thinks it's important.

I'm pretty sure that this is one piece of the puzzle why I'm like I'm and why I feel like I feel.

To summarize, I like to connect with my colleagues at work. However, I'm always the guy who just works there. I don't meet my colleges out of work. Maybe this gives to conclusion to others, that I don't care about them and that's just work to me. That's not true!

&amp;#x200B;

After work, I go straight to my apartment. I don't do anything else. Basically I just jump in my bed and play games or try to find something interesting on Netflix. After a couple of hours I go to bed and the whole boring life starts all over again...

It's not that I don't do anything else then work and sitting in front of my computer. Activities that I would call as hobbies are:

* Diving
* Gym
* Motorcycle

However, these are activities that you do mostly alone or not that often. Other than that, I don't have anything else to do.

As you might think, I don't have any friends or event a relationship. I always know people which I like and which I meet due to work, family and ""hobbies"". But those are just people which I like, I wouldn't call them friends. I guess the problem is on my side, I'm not giving clear signals to people that I'm really interested in their life.

On top, because I don't have any friends and basically no social connections to people, my conversation skills are shit.  
I don't know how to hold up a conversation and can't even talk about more than just the weather. The conversation ends after a couple of minutes. I think that people think that I'm boring, because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, my whole life suffers. I really don't enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, I love to life. I just want to change anything. I would like to connect with people, I want to have enjoyable hobbies with others. I'm 21 years old and basically don't have any valuable experience in life. It makes me so incredible sad that I haven't done anything worth living for so many years. I've just thrown the best  years a human could possibly have in the trash.

But I really really would like to stop with that. But I don't know how, it's not that I don't know how. Just go out, leave the apartment, do more hobbies, speak to people, etc. The main problem is the lack of motivation.

I know it's quite hard to answer to such a generic question, but I need help. I don't want to suffer anymore.

How can I make my life worth?

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks to you all.",20Jun2019,1

378,My boyfriend has been working at a restaurant for the past 3 years and last year he got promoted as a supervisor. I meet him there and our relationship started around the fall and i knew that once he was going to get his next step promotion to salary manager i would have to leave. For other reasons one being i felt like i was being pushed out i left a few months ago. My bf talked to the man in charge for his promotion and claims he’s “working on it” but my bf now has put on more responsibilities with the same hourly pay and he’s now more stressed and miserable bc he no longer has me or his brother which worked there as well. I tell him to get a new job where he’s appreciated more and makes more money but he doesn’t know what he wants to do. He has a BA in engineering but doesn’t want to go into that. So my question is what job would you suggest for someone that doesn’t know what job they want. He likes video games and comic books but i don’t think he can do much with that. He doesn’t want to go to another restaurant but he also doesn’t know what else.

384,"Alright, here’s the deal. 

My life has not been perfect up to this point. I’ll say that. It hasn’t been the worst though, either. I’m not trying to look for sympathy points right now. 

But thing is, I can tell all of the negative experiences I’ve had have had a negative affect on me. I can’t really pinpoint anything, but I know it’s there.

Because of the stuff that’s happened to me, I have a goal. I want to live a normal/stable life, unlike the rest of my family has managed for a long time. A lot of people in my family are very... not nice. Many of them have very bad problems that bring down everyone around them, ranging from alcoholism to narcissism.

I want to move past this and not get caught up in this web. But I don’t really know the best way to do that. I mean, I think I’m on the right path, but how can I really know that? My family thought they were on the right path too. Heck, my dad, probably the biggest offender of the stuff I’m talking about, had a goal just like mine.

So, I’m asking for advice to try and get as far as possible away from the web of issues. I understand it may be a little difficult to prescribe any type of advice since I’m not really talking about anything specific. But, I’m looking for anything. If you have any tips for self improvement in this type of way, I will take them.",20Jun2019,1
385,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new (about 2-3 months) who I haven’t talked to stared at me smiling as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and then looked away back to the glasses  still smiling, I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm tight (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the tall cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery and  quickly said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and full on  smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.

386,"So I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend before. I think I might be bi. I think I know. The thing is, I've been recently exploring my body–of course at my age, why wouldn't I–but I know there's a shame that comes saddled with touching yourself as a girl?

My stomach really rolls at just typing that, but I only recently started and I already feel grossed out with myself (and at the same time not for the obvious reason). I just guess I feel scared now. What if I get a boyfriend and he doesn't believe I'm a virgin? Is that how this works? What if he doesn't believe me? Have I ruined myself? Would he even be able to tell? It's not like I'm even looking/interested in dating right now, but it's still stupidly concerning. I don't wanna sound so naive.

388,"I don't really know where to start, or honestly why I am even writing this - maybe it's because an anonymous community is the only place I can go to, without judgement or persecution.

I'm so overwhelmed and so confused. Have you ever been tossed by a wave, and struggled to figure out what was up towards the air - and what wasn't? Your own perception can be so wrong. Bear with me if you're reading this, even the nutshell version is longer than I wish it was. 

My boyfriend (36) and I (33) have been together 4 years. We work(ed) in a restaurant together, where we met. I am a server, and he is a chef/cook (I say that because we are a high end restaurant, but he has no culinary school). We have lived together for the past 3.5

When we first began, everything was great...as things always are. My family life took a big turn about 3 years ago...my father contracted a very rare bacteria, went septic and almost died. There's more to it, but it resulted in what they call frontal lobe damage - and it resembles advanced dementia. He is bedridden, wheelchair bound, and doesn't always know who I am. 

This brings me to my mother - and brother. They are the only family I really have. My family immigrated to the US from Canada when I was 3 months old, and they are all I have ever known. My parents have been together for 35 years...a stable, if deceptively emotionally abusive (in retrospect) relationship. With my father's prognosis and dealing with the financial aftermath...she reconnected with her high school flame.

Let me be clear, I do not fault her too much. When you look death in the eye 10x over, and then pick up the pieces and live in an empty house that will never be the same....I loooove my mama, and despite my selfish tendencies to be bitter, I want her to be happy. So she sold our family home, and moved 2,000 miles away to be with her old flame. We all deserve happiness, and  life is too short. The backlash in our social world hasn't been so kind (yes, I grew up in what some would call a privileged world - but i do not reap the benefits of that - I am a fucking waitress)

And now it's back to my boyfriend and I. All of that has been unimaginably horrible for me at times. Like, a real struggle that I really dont know how to express the depth of. 

He faults me for it. Says I have given up on life. I haven't, I feel like I have just been processing grief. There have been very deep lows, but i feel like I have persevered. My entire life flipped upside down, but I went to work with a smile on my face and my makeup done. He says so many awful things. Ugh, so much. He says my birthday isn't important, and I am a fool for thinking it should be.

Our spare room is packed with boxes, relics from my life that my mom kinda dumped on me when she cleared out our 4,000 sq ft house and left me with. Wedding albums, family history items, my dads belts and suitcases. He thinks its ridiculous (and maybe it is) that 1 year later I havent managed to ""handle my life"", but when I ask for his help he says it isnt his problem. 

He very suddenly quit his job last week, drinking was involved...so was a fist fight because a coworker called me a cunt. I set him up with a friend of mine, and he's working construction with him.

I dont understand if I am as selfish as he thinks. If when I get off of work, if I shouldn't be able to sit comfortably on the couch and watch my shows. If I am so crazy to think that my feelings matter - he says they don't and that I am delusional for ever thinking they will. If I am just so crazy, or so wrong for all my life in thinking things like that.

Example...riding in a car with him, one of my besties and her hubby after a night out. Drunk, but for some reason the bass and the volume of the music gave me the worst anxiety. Felt like my heart would explode and I would throw up. He says that I am wrong for asking 3 people to cater to me, when ultimately I got out of the car and was fine. I wouldn't want anyone i cared about to feel that way?

391,"So basically I graduated and got a big girl job. My previous roles during college were supervisory positions but they were in fields that weren’t “professional” attire or atmosphere. I had to be professional since I represented and was a “role model” but it was relaxed and I enjoyed my time there. I had fun and looked forwarded with working with everyone, but of course some days I didn’t feel like going in. 

With this job it’s serious and professional that I don’t really like? I know I don’t know anyone yet but it’s just not the same vibes or any team work. I work well independently but I like to discuss and collaborate as well. I do like guidance and training and this job sorta throws you in. So far 85% of the day has been staring at my phone and computer. I also have a ton of responsibility that I have no idea on. I’m told to do stuff that just shouldn’t be mixed in with this department. It’s big position and would be a good step but I don’t see myself pursing these skills after this job. It sounds weird but I’d rather work my way up? Ornis that an old fashioned way? I also don’t like how I don’t really have an end product and that honestly the lack of interacting with customers or people. On top of this I have noticed there’s a lot of confusion and mixing of departments that shouldn’t be mixed and I don’t like that. I think I’m good with critical thinking but this is overwhelming. On top of that my commute is an hour one way so I travel two hours a day and I feel pretty drained already. During that commute I find my self barely being able to make it in without feeling dread. I have been nervous about previous roles but usually after the first or second day I’m over it and already have a grasp. 

A lot of my family was happy that I got this job since I have been graduated in the fall and think it’s a good opportunity and pay but I don’t think so with the responsibility they are already given me? Am I being a baby about this or should I stick this out? Anybody with similar experiences?",20Jun2019,2

TL;DR: if I work at my own pace I make good parts but I’m too slow, but if I speed up to meet the hourly requirement I’m much more prone to sending off bad parts. 

I’m 19 and I’ve recently gotten my first “real” job, I work with CNC machines. For those unfamiliar, they’re basically machines that make metal parts for surgery, the ones I work on are usually straight parts of various lengths and sizes. Some only have 2 tolerances to check and some can have more than 30. For each job there’s a certain amount of parts that should be made each hour depending on what part I’m machining. I usually work slower to make sure I check the parts very good so I don’t accidentally make bad parts and waste company time and money, but my supervisors have been getting onto me about being faster and making more parts an hour, but if I work faster to meet the parts requirement I often miss things that would make a part bad. It’s a terrible situation and I’m not sure what to do.",20Jun2019,2

396,"Few days ago, I got the worst haircut I’ve ever had in my life—a $70 + tip haircut that landed me with uneven and choppy bangs, which looked nothing like the magazine picture that I found in HER OWN store that SHE RECOMMENDED me to get because my picture was “undoable.” I specifically chose this place because the other Yelp reviewers seem to extremely love this place , but alas, it was a different story for me and I felt like I needed to speak up and write one of the first “terrible” reviews. I guess what alerted her was how I constantly kept editing it because over the next days, I kept noticing more and more uneven ends and messy parts. 

So, just now, the hairstylist messaged me via Yelp stating that she is very apologetic and that she “can not receive money from [me]” then offered a refund. From here, I don’t know what to do because usually, people who have this “bad hair cut” problem would ideally go back to the salon and get it fixed as a solution, but I really don’t trust her anymore to touch my hair and I don’t want to sound like a jerk and just take all the money back (unless that’s normal???). What should I do ???? :C What makes it worst is that she’s a nice person, but I feel like she’s trying to hint that I should delete/edit my review (unless I’m just paranoid) and I’m obviously not going to be swayed by money to delete my review. 

I wanted to note that while I am extremely upset and embarrassed about this haircut, I don’t want to go out of my way to destroy her business or anything ... I just don’t want other people to fall into my situation and stress out about unprofessional work that can’t be fixed.",20Jun2019,1

Hence, me and my mother are very different- it often feels like we live in different worlds and speak different languages. Unfortunately we don't have anything in common as people and I'm sure if we weren't related and just randomly met somewhere, we would not like each other at all.  

I have made my peace with the fact that our relationship is never going to be like other mothers and daughters, being best friends, even though it's something I really lack. But my mom is a different story.  She is the type of mom who totally sacrificed all other aspects of her life for her kids, and is still trying to baby us and keep us very close (even though the 3 of us are adults now). She keeps obsessively trying to be with me, then gets so incredibly hurt when we inevitably argue and don't get along well. Then she starts fights about us not getting along which make it even worse to be together.  it's gotten to the point where we can't be together for 30 minutes without fighting over how hurt she is.

I know I sound like a terrible daughter, maybe I am one. But the reality is me and my mom are simply a terrible match and you can't fix that. I wish she would accept it rather than fighting with me all the time about something I can't change. 

I feel like we would actually be able to get along for a while if she ""chilled"" a little and accepted things as they are. But I have no idea how to communicate that to her. Does anyone have any advice on how to talk to her about this without hurting her more?

Last year due to finicial reasons I had to leave my previous high school and attend my district high school. during my first meeting with one of counselors and a vice pricipal they made it explicitly clear that the school was already over capacity and we were only being able to attend because it was our district school and they were forced to allow me to attend.

Fast forward to the end of the first semester and I pass all my classes with a 60%+ and 60%+ attendance. On the first day of the second semester I was called to the vice pricipals office where he told me that any attendance below 90% was punishable in his eyes (even though the school board requirement is anything above 50%). He then started to talk about how since I was on route to graduate a year early I should homeschool to allow for more space for students who ""were actually going to come to class"" and that Infact he had already forced my brother into this (I wasn't 16 at the time and you have to be over 16 to make this decision yourself otherwise your parents have to sign off on it[he did not tell me this and I didn't know this at the time]). Since I didn't have to many friends as I had only been at the school half a semester I told him I would take the offer and stick with my brother, he then said ok and we will be in contact soon.

After that meeting I went and got all the course material I needed from the school with no problem. After about a month I never heard back from him so I went to his office myself to see what was happening. And it went something like this 

AP:look who decided to show up
Me:?
AP: you were supposed to come in weeks ago but never did
Me: we never had a meeting scheduled, last time we talked you said we would be in contact soon.
AP: I know you were supposed to come back here and talk to me about your decision
Me: I gave you my decision at our first meeting,and we never talked about another meeting
AP:well it's too late now, I didn't register you for any courses and it's too late to do it now so your hooped

I didn't even know what to do so I left, and I have never heard from the school since, they never even informed my parents they weren't going to register me for any classes.

I recently had a split with my partner largely due to the fact that I couldn’t handle her social anxiety/OCD during a abnormally stressful time of my life.

If anything, my experience is really only with a past family members episode of serious depression that hasn’t reoccurred.

We still talk on social media, say hi in school and start some small talk if i bump into her. I’m giving her space and time obvs, convo is limited between us atm and convo irl is just small.

Everyone’s telling her to break up with him but she’s still living with him. Idk how to help her realize that she’s worth more than this, and that based on his track record he’ll probably do this again?

412,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on. 

Edit: I’m scared she won’t like me because of my body I posted pics on my account history it’s the only reason I backed off from the hug she offered :/",20Jun2019,0
413,"It started off in the school bus in the morning. I had recently been very sick and this was my first day back to school in ten days. I felt fine when I woke up and I had a massive breakfast, as I was very hungry and I never ate a lot during the time that I was sick. My mom said that I should eat lots of vegetables and healthy foods so I wouldn't get so sick again. She served me a plateful of beans, carrots, peas, potatoes, eggs, and a few slices of bacon. While sitting in the bus I felt a dull ache in my stomach, and it made a loud rumble. I thought that it was just gas, but I couldn't release it as I knew that it would cause a stench and everybody would mock me, so I just kept it in and prayed that it would just go away. After stopping to pick up more students, I bent over slightly and farted (luckily it wasn't that loud and I don't think anybody heard it), I started coughing to try and hide the fact that I had just let loose. I thought that I felt better now that I got it out of my system. I arched my back and brought myself forward to get comfortable in my seat, when suddenly I did a massive fart, and I felt like something shot out of my behind and had left through the leg of my shorts . As I looked down the floor around me turned brown and it smelled really bad. I had pooped myself and some of the diarrhea had sprayed on the shoes and trousers of a small boy, as he was sitting right next to me when I had soiled myself, and there was a puddle of runny poop that was slowly running down the bus. My bowels released themselves again while I was farting , brown bubbling liquid surrounded me, and I could see bits of carrots and intact peas floating around, and I even got chunks of it stuck on my schoolbag. It smelled like rotten eggs, and beans, it was awful, I was almost choking due to it's stench. Everybody was laughing at me as I was struggling to escape my pool of runny poop, and the poo covered boy was horrified and started to shake his leg viciously as parts of poop came flying off his clothes into my mouth and eyes as I was trying to exit my seat. All the students ran out of the bus except one who had slid on the pile of diarrhea and fell on top of me as I was trying to escape bringing me back into the river of poop. The bus driver forced his way through students who were leaving the bus and slipped on a pool of diarrhea and face planted on my seat which was covered in crap and children held his head down into the bubbling poop as they tried to force themselves out. Since we were so close to the school entrance a school teacher came out and told me and the other boy covered in crap to remain in the bus until they got wheelchairs through for both of us so we wouldn't get poop all over place. They told us to take all of our clothes off so we wouldn’t make a mess with our poop covered clothes. Me and the other boy both stripped down until we were both completely naked and then they had us put our poop covered clothes in a trash bag and then they took them away. I felt a strange arousal from standing their naked and I ended up getting an erection. I was so embarrassed but I just couldn’t help it. The chairs arrived and I exited the bus and as I was going to sit down I farted again and pooped all over the chair, but they said that they only had two and I had to stay in it. All the other students looked at me as I was getting wheeled into the school naked in a chair covered in poop. The teachers were standing outside their classroom doors in the hallway as I was being wheeled through. Eventually we got to the school nurses office where they let me use the shower and gave me a change of clothes to put on. They said they called my parents to come and take me home and told me to sit down and wait until they arrived. Eventually my mom came and took me home. This was 5 days ago and I haven’t been back to school since. I need to make up some important tests but I don’t want to go back to school because I will surely get made fun of by my classmates. The boy who also got covered in poop emailed me saying I humiliated him and ruined his life. He also said he wouldn’t be returning to school ever. The school also contacted me by phone and demanded that I pay them money for a new seat for the bus to replace the one that got covered in my poop. What should I do?",20Jun2019,0

421," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

423,"I’m 18 years old. I’ve held a job for almost 4 years. At this job, we have an online scheduling website/app. Our schedules and our coworkers’ contact info is there. The app is also used for things like trading shifts and requesting time off. 

Ever since I got my job, my mom has required me to give her the password to my account for this online scheduling system. When I first got the job, I was 15 and this seemed fair. But now it’s getting annoying. If she had the password but didn’t use it often, it’d be no big deal. But she acts like it’s her job to keep track of my schedule even though I’ve spent the past three years trying to prove it’s not. She checks the app almost as often as I do. She knows exactly how long my commute is and questions me if I leave home earlier than necessary or come home later than expected. She gets all anxious when I have a schedule conflict, even when I know I’ll be able to get someone to cover it.

I’m a good employee. I show up to my shifts on time, regardless of whether or not my mom reminds me. I do my job correctly. I’ve never been written up. I get along with my managers and supervisor. And when my work schedule conflicts with something else, I *always* manage to get someone to trade shifts with me. I don’t need my mom’s help in any of this, and she keeps injecting herself into my attempts to be a responsible adult. It’s starting to feel very invasive. 

I’ve explained to my mom that I’m responsible enough to handle my own schedule. Everyone else at my job, except for the really young ones, manage their own schedules. I write my schedules on the fridge calendar too, to demonstrate that she’ll still know my schedule even without access to the app. At one point I got so fed up that I straight-up changed the password and refused to give her the new one. That resulted in a fight I’d rather not repeat.

This is really driving me up the wall. I feel trapped. I’m frustrated that my mom still doesn’t trust me. I’m annoyed that she won’t back off even though she knows I’m annoyed. I want to become a self-sufficient adult, and that’s really hard to do with Mom breathing down my neck. 

I know it seems like such a dumb thing to ask for advice about, but how do I get my mom to let me handle my own job?",20Jun2019,1

425,"Hey I’m posting this to reddit to get other people’s opinions on my problem and if you have any advice I would appreciate it a lot. Basically I’m 19, I’m 6,1 and stocky. I have big shoulders but a little bit of a belly so I’m not in the best shape but I’m pretty strong. I have 7 sisters and I am the only boy in the family. I am the oldest so I was a very feminine kid growing up being raised by women. My dad was never really around so I didn’t have much Male Input in my life. I have a fear of fighting or losing a fight. And this wouldn’t really bother me if I didn’t live in such a rough area and now that I’m getting older fights are becoming more coming between my friends and other lads. I know I’m strong but for some reason if someone (even if there younger and smaller than me) gives me a sense that there might be a chance of them fighting me I freeze up instantly and I can feel the fear run through my body. I got bullied at school and got hit a few times but have never hit someone back because I physically can’t bring myself to do it. Maybe it’s because when I was younger if I got angry and gave one of my sisters a thump my mom would get very angry with me and say never ever EVER hit someone. And that happened quite a bit when I was younger and maybe it’s a subconscious thing I still have now to this day. I know I could do damage to someone but for some reason I can’t bring myself to lay a finger on someone who’s taking the piss out of me or slagging me or starting on me and I hate that I’m not able to. Ive taken boxing classes and Krav Maga and I’m not to bad and I played rugby for 2 years so I know what I’m capable of but I just can’t bring myself to even stick up for myself in a real life situation. And I really feel like I need to be able to because my area is very rough and fighting between young adults is common. I’ve heard that If you have an abusive childhood it toughens you up for when your older but I had a very abusive childhood from my father who is huge but that seemed to only make me more scared. I don’t want to go out and beat someone up I just want to be able to have the courage to stick up for myself and my friends if someone is starting on them. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this. I also have dreams where I hit someone but my fist is moving really slow and I miss. I really need help on this. If you have an answer on why I’m like this or how to overcome it it would help me a lot. Thanks",20Jun2019,1

That aside, around 2am we bumped into this girl and her friend, and and ended up sticking together for the rest of the party. Her friend had left around 3am, and so did mine until eventually it was just us two. I ended up talking with this ridiculously beautiful girl until 8am in the morning, sitting on the beach and watching the sun rise. It was such a romantic atmosphere, with other couples who stayed up sitting along the beach aswell. I ended up learning a lot about her, and what kind of person she was, and the fact that she was keen to stay up until sunrise with a guy she had never met before was crazy, I even added her on Facebook. Fast forward a couple of days we all met up again at this place called the amsterdam bar and then went to another party later on in the night. I guess my friends assumed I was only looking for a good time, and I kinda didn't want to give them a reason to make fun of the whole situation so I let them believe that.

I currently have a very stable career and make decently good money that I could live on my own if I choose to and would be fine but I want to buy a house instead of rent.

My parents had a house about 5 years ago and it had went foreclosed. My dad was ill and in and out of the hospital, family of 4 only living on 1 income...

My dad currently does not work, so we live off of my moms income. My brother just graduated high school and does not have a job or wants to go to college. I am the only one with a well paying job (I make double what my mom makes) and only one with a college education (not that it matters but... it is the 21 cent.).

Anyways, my parents found a house to buy. The problem is, they want me to sign for the house. There reasoning for this... because I would be able to get a lower interest rate. There plan is for me to sign and then they would pay the house and bills, and in a year I would sign the house over into their name.

How is this going to affect me when I go to buy my own house next year??How do I even file taxes???Will I still get government aid for college?What happens if they decided not to pay the bills??

I DO NOT want to sign for this house but I feel like if I don't I will burn a bridge with my parents and I do not want that! If I sign for this house, I will have to kiss ass until that house is out of my name so my parents DO NOT screw me over... My mom even threatened me that I sign for the house or pay rent (I do not know how much she is threatening to charge).

It was in 3rd grade when they had to move across the country for various reasons and excluding one or two events during the summer where we really didn’t have a lot of time to hang out we have not seen each other in awhile and are now in high school. It was decided that in this time of the summer we would go visit them for a few days. Yesterday was our first full day with them and we have today before we leave tomorrow.

 I was in a group call with him (on discord) with some other friends, and he mentioned in that self depreciating, ""humorous"" way that he felt like taking so many pills that he was dead, but not really dead, just... Numb, or whatever high he gets out of it. After that I hung up because the worry has been eating away at me and I'm really scared for him. 

He texted me asking why I left and I said I was worried for him. He kept telling me that he had the situation under control, that he could stop whenever he wanted, he'd done it before, and that I didn't understand anything about his situation or how he feels or what's best for him ect. He then said to ""stop fucking nagging me"" and that ""you're stressing me out for no fucking reason"". 

I've hardly broached the subject of drugs with him, and him saying that I'm nagging him and stressing him makes me feel even more horrible about the situation. I don't even know what to do, because whenever he calls me he's usually high as shit and I can't do anything but sit there with him and keep him company. He doesn't want to confide in me about whatever is causing him so much stress that he has to drug himself constantly. I don't want to become another stressor for him, but I'm just so worried.

441,"My Grandpa (my Mum's father) has lots of stray kittens around his house. Sadly a lot of them die. The area isn't the nicest and one time a few stray kittens were poisoned by an unknown neighbour. In the past a kitten warmed up to my Grandpa. He let it in the house, fed it and basically adopted it. My family has 2 cats so we know a lot about taking care of cats. My Mum took it to the vet and got it vaccinated for him and took care of its fleas etc... My Grandpa put a collar on it, but one day it just vanished. We have no idea what happened to it, we presume it was killed as that is what happens to most of the kittens there (there are a lot of stray kittens but unfortunately not a lot of adult stray cats).

About 3 months ago another kitten warmed up to my Grandpa. She's an adorable little kitten and my Grandpa started feeding her and letting her in the house. My Aunt (my Mum's sister) visits my Grandpa every week on Saturday and loves the little kitten. Initially, she suggested we take her home to avoid her being poisoned but my Dad ""didn't want another cat"" so we didn't. Now, 3 months later, my Mum again took this kitten to the vet to get vaccinated, micro-chipped etc. This time my Mum took the kitten to our family vet and was going to keep her at our house for a couple days before bringing her back. But my whole family, including my Dad, fell in love with her. We were worried that if she lived at my Grandpa's house she might get killed and so my Mum asked Grandpa if we could keep her. He said he didn't care ""as long as she's in a good home"". My Mum called Grandpa two more times to ask if he was sure he didn't mind us keeping her and he said he was fine with it. My family consists of me(23), two siblings and my parents.

My Mum texted my Aunt to tell her what she thought was good news and my Aunt responded ""Well I'm not happy about it, I enjoyed spending Saturday's with the kitten and I felt like she was my pet too, but you and Dad make this decision without even asking me"". My Mum didn't respond. Later my Aunt texted my Mum two more times, one text said ""You already have 2 cats but I finally have one little thing in my life that brings me joy and you take it away from me"" the other text said ""I hope you're happy for making me miserable"".

My Mum feels really bad. We thought adopting the kitten was the right thing to do if my Grandpa didn't care, which he said he didn't. We didn't think to ask my Aunt because she only saw the kitten once a week. I do feel sorry for my Aunt because she lives alone (no husband, no kids) in an apartment so she can't have pets. But her reaction seemed unreasonable, especially since 3 months ago she suggested we take the kitten.

Now my Mum feels bad. We don't know what we should do. Were we wrong to adopt the kitten? Should we take her back to my Grandpa's house? We are really worried she might not survive in that area but is it the right thing to do? How should we deal with my Aunt?",20Jun2019,2

443,"I'm 24 years old and I don't want to live anymore. I have an extremely bad gambling addiction that started when I was 17 and has now got me up to my neck in debt. I'm a terrible person.

 I was brought up well and have been given every opportunity to succeed but have wasted everything. In the last few days things have escalated very dramatically and I can't take it anymore. I have an amazing girlfriend but all I want now if for her to break up with me and hate me so that I can kill myself and it wouldn't affect her as much. 

Things got bad a few years ago and I told my family and they helped as best they could. I really tried to stop from then on, went to meetings and everything but nothing worked. My problem is I overthink and I can't let go of how much I've lost altogether which would be easily €30K plus.

 I've had the reddit app for over a year now, never made an account and never posted. I don't even know why I'm writing this to be honest, maybe someone will see it and it will wake them up and make them stop gambling because they'll see that it can lead to suicide. This is the only thread I could post in that didn't seem to break the rules, I'm not looking for advice, I don't want help. I've tried everything and I've given up now. I hate myself so much.

445,"Im not sure how to deal with my roomate and his girlfriend. I understand that they like each other but when they are groping each other on the couch right next to me it seems a little.. Gross.. Now I just recently got am apartment and my roomate and I have been friends for a very long time. He just got back from college and I told him he could room with me over the summer. I am allowing him to stay with me in his own room rent free and utilities free as I thought he would be going back to college at the end of summer. I attended the first semester of college in the dorms with him as my roommate and we didnt have any issues. I moved back to my hometown and got an apartment while he finished out the second semester. Attending the first semester helped me understand how strapped for money you will be which is why ive decided to let him live rent free. I figured saving up some funds will be useful as the summer season wraps up. The thing is he came to me recently saying that he is gonna be staying longer so I can contact my landlord and let him know that my friend will be staying longer than expected. Now it is fine with me but he still as shown no effort into upkeeping the apartment or pitching in for any costs for the apartment. Again I am trying to be a good friend and keep him afloat for if he decides to go back to school. The thing is now his ""girlfriend"" is here on a pretty regular basis. She is practically helping herself to anything and everything in my apartment, such as food, drinks, etc.. So now not only am I feeding just myself and my roommate but also his girlfriend. I have a decent job and can for sure keep myself in a good position, but it is getting out of hand to where I am nervous I will not be able to afford payments. I dont really know how to go about this situation. I hate being a bad friend and asking for money. 

Summary: Ive allowed my friend to stay in my new/first apartment over summer break free of rent to save money and now he said he was staying longer. His ""girlfriend"" has also been staying regularly and both helping themselves to food, drinks, etc. All of which I have bought. I have a decent job to live comfortably but lately have been strapped on money from excess groceries and bills ive been paying for.",20Jun2019,1

447,"My thoughts are a mess right now and I would appreciate some clarity.

A few months ago I was accepted on to a study exchange where I'll be spending 3 weeks in Beijing. I've paid for the flight (£530), which will incur a £200 cancellation fee if I choose to do that. However, I still need to fork out £151 for a visa, and an undefined amount of suitable clothes (I only have a winter wardrobe), vaccinations, other travel expenditures. It will rack up is what I'm saying.

I've been given £350 towards the travel fees from my uni, which I may need to give back (most likely, but I can't find anything about it in the T&amp;Cs). If I go to China I'll receive another £150 from them. 

I have around £2600 left in my bank account right now. I am unemployed, and won't be receiving another student loan payment. I've had my last. 

I also have a 2 week holiday in Japan in November. I will need to spend another £600 - 1k approx on a hotel, JR Pass, spending money ect. My share of rent is £250 a month, then I'll need money for food, gas, electric. Basically, I'm going to be more than brassic/skint by November. I'm expecting to be well in to my student overdraft, and then some - I'm lucky to have a wonderful boyfriend who will support me. But I don't want him to - I don't want that to happen.

Nowhere will hire me (retail) because I need so much time off this summer for China, but I desperately need some income. There have been a few opportunities that have arisen recently, but the recruitment process is long, and will be ongoing throughout the time I should be in China. I think these opportunities suit me well, though, and I'd have a good chance of employment based on my qualifications and experience. They're not guaranteed though. 

Do I go to China, even though it will waste me financially and won't provide sure employment afterwards? Or do I cancel my flight and seek out employment opportunities?",20Jun2019,4

I'm not unfamiliar to feeling like this, but it's so frustrating that in every part of my life, I can't even enjoy who I'm around because I can't be myself. It seems that ever since I really became an adult, I have never known how to act, like ever since my world got bigger for myself, and started to go to university, my anxiety also got much, much bigger. I am not depressed, I want to get this out of the way. I have been treating depression for a couple of years now, consistently going to therapy for it.

I used to be a lot more charismatic, outgoing, and took life MUCH less seriously. I was able to light up a room I went into, and I was so proud of that. It was part of my pride as a person.

I am always worried about my future, my mental illness, and whatever moment isn't right now. I can never be hyper conscious in the moment, and just visualize myself doing things.

My boss charges the phone then tells me ""i couldnt unlock it, its icloud locked, i called the owner.""  which was totally fine with me since i couldnt unlock it and i have a better phone anyway.

He even randomly brought up the fact that he has old MetroPCS phones i can have, even though he knows i have my own. This didnt sit right with my intuition.

I have a big issue with my girlfriend[17F] who was going though some weird shit some years ago before I [18M] met her.
As I mentioned before she was going trough some weird shit because she had no parents to support her or to help beside a uncle with whom she was living.
She’s truly gorgeous and smart but not long time ago due to a high need of validation she was talking to some older dudes who were asking for nudes and she overall had a very slutish behavior even in real life.
The main issue is the fact that after one month of being together one of those guys repeatedly blackmailed her in order to receive more nudes.
Some of you might say that she should have asked for help or something but she didn’t and that’s what’s bothering me the most.
I understand that she was going trough some phase but the fact that she didn’t asked for help and that she somehow continued to talk to them is making me go nuts.
The worst part is that some people know about this and I don’t know what to do, I’m not even close of being perfect But the thought of her doing those things makes me really question if I should stay or go, she might be worthy or she’s just using me for some sort of support , I’m afraid that she’s using me and I tend to believe that, what should I do?

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.

This is making me suicidal. I am intelligent enough to know that there are easy solutions to these two problems: quit my job and leave my wife (while still supporting my children).

But the problem is how this is going to received by others. These appear to be extremely selfish acts given we have a baby due.

However, do I have that conversation now or in August when our lease is up? I feel like breaking up would be a mutually wanted thing, but my boyfriend will probably still think it's my responsibility to provide him with stability for college. 

For some background, I used to be a full-time student and a part-time worker. My boyfriend was just a full-time worker and offered to do so in case I needed help financially. The one time I needed help making rent, he threatened to break up with me if I didn't get my finances in order. Today, the roles are reversed, he is a full-time student/part time worker and I'm both a full-time student and a full-time worker. I've offered financial help many times during this 'role'.  


So, do I have this conversation now, possibly break up, and live with him for 2 more months - leaving him to find out a way to support himself when the lease is up OR do I wait until August, a little before the lease is up so he still has time to find a place? Breaking up now and moving out is an option for me, but I don't want to leave him with 2 more months of rent he has to cover in full, because he can't afford it.

481,"Before I start thanks this is my first post ever on reddit.

I(23f) have been dealing with a problem. My family especially my brother(29m). My family has never been good with money. So I learned young that I wanted to live comfortable with extra in my pocket for a rainy day. (So I'm the only one that has an emergency fund)  Well as for my brother he is in nursing school and was in the military. He has 2 kids and is recently separated(1year). 

Back to my problem he asks for money to pay his bills because he runs out of money. When he asks it's usually through text and never a phone call. So i have not been paid back for the bills I have paid(over 1,000). Today he asked me for money to help with is youngest bday party. I said no I did not have any to give. Truthfully I do and would love to give but i feel as i need to stop paying for everything he can't buget for. 

What bothers me the most is  he still goes out drinking and takes his kids to expensive places. I understand that you don't have to live in a hole but it's irresponsible.

Yes, I have offered to help him buget.
Yes, I have shared links and items I use.",20Jun2019,5
482,"I'm recently coming to terms that I was sexually pressuring and possibly emotionally abusive to my ex.

I'm realising that I have some real issues around sex. In exploring this, I'm realising that I have some issues stemming from getting into dark things online when I was probably 12 or 13. I'm trying to figure out if I abused or damaged myself there. I got out of that but have had a chronic and secret porn issue going on since.

I was with my ex for eight years and never told her about this due to the shame and assuming it was my own fault.

Now I'm realising how I behaved towards her, being sexually pressuring and pushing things she didn't always enjoy, and how I got worse as I isolated myself and fed the issue more. I'm consumed by guilt and shame. I didn't acknowledge this wasn't normal because she was my only sexual partner.

I am scared though that me acknowledging this now is just some form of manipulation to make myself a victim. I just want to fix it and help her heal. Can I explain myself without excusing it? Would anyone believe when I've never spoken about it before?",20Jun2019,1

492,"I feel like I'm in a pickle and will preface this by saying that I don't really get allergies with dogs. I live with 2 dogs and walk/care for other dogs pretty much every day. However, I am currently dogsitting/housesitting these two weimaraners for the first time and for some reason they are giving me the WORST allergies and it's triggering my asthma.  I haven't experienced it like this before. I was thinking that maybe it would get better over time but nope, I am miserable with allergies when I'm at her house and I wake up in the middle of the night needing to use my inhaler. It has me questioning if I should continue to dogsit for her in the future (I am scheduled to dogsit them again in a couple weeks). 

I am asking advice on what I should do and on how I should approach her about it.  I feel bad because the dogs are sweet and I'm also a person of my word.

497,"Hey all! Thank you for taking the time to read this. Strap in because y'all are in for a ride. Also this is long as fuck, so sorry.

A while ago, I was in the dating scene. I was using dating apps like tinder and bumble, but people were really just looking to hook up while I was looking for something more meaningful. I was on YouTube when I watch a Cody Ko video (Shout out Cody) where he talked about his time on Hinge (a dating app). I decided to try it.

This was when I met one of the most amazing people I have ever met, call her J. We clicked instantly, talking everyday, phone calls, FaceTime, etc. The only problem was that she lived roughly 2 hours from me and she didn't drive. I decided that I wanted to see her and drove to her and our connection was even better in person. We quickly expressed our desire to pursue a relationship but both of us wanted to take it really slow. Then time come to return back to university, where I study in California and she studies in Pennsylvania, which was not mentioned to me. I was apprehensive about the long distance and I told her this, to which she told me to push through it because she had never had a connection like that with anyone. I accepted and thus began the 4 month long torture session of not being able to see each other. 

She came home for Thanksgiving and I decided that I had to go all out and take her on the most amazing date of her life. I got a hotel near where she lived so that I could spend as much time as possible. I took her to a really high end restaurant with probably the most ridiculous view I have ever seen, then I took her on a hot air balloon ride over the city. I made her cry, and she told me that no one has ever done anything like that before. She told me that I made her so happy, and that she was thankful she met me.

The next day she has a problem with her iPhone and asks me to take her to Apple to see if she can get it fixed. Now, before this point, we both talked about how we deleted out Hinge profiles and deleted the app as well. So in the Apple store, as they try to fix her phone, I notice that she still has the app, but I hold my tongue because I don't want to make a scene. After we left the store I ask her why she still has the app, she then goes on to explain that when she updated her phone once, it auto installed it again and she never got around to deleting it. She then proved that she doesn't have a profile. We talk about it, then everything is fine. She then returns to Pennsylvania.

This is where I notice that she got a little distant. One day I ask her if anything is wrong and she starts explaining how she had been ignoring me for a few days. She tells me that she is going to Spain for a semester, which I was okay with because she had told before. She then goes on to explain that over the summer she is going to travel all around Europe and won't come back to California for a year. I'm crushed. 

For some reason she threw in the whole app thing and explained that she got freaked out because I entered ""boyfriend mode"" because of the app. I explained that I had a right to be upset because she told me she deleted the app, so when I saw it I felt lied to. I also explained that it wasn't ""boyfriend mode"" that it was ""I'm not trying to get played mode"". She says that she doesn't want me to wait for her and she thinks it was better if we stopped the romantic side of the relationship and stayed friends. I agreed because I wanted her in my life. She also talks about the possibility of us getting back together if we are ever in the same state again. We stop talking.

I get a text a couple of weeks later from J asking how I am and telling me that she misses me. Then every so often she texts me that I'm a great person and that she hopes I get everything I want in life. These texts stop when she leaves for Spain.

I start to focus on school, getting my grades up, really trying to focus on myself. Then I get a message from J. I get a rush of emotion, remembering all the good times. She explains that she is coming back to California and that she would like to see me. I want to see her too. My problem is, she is a free spirit. She loves to travel and I'm scared that what happened last year will happen again. I'm also scared of the future. If she essentially broke up with me during the ""honeymoon"" stage, what can I expect in the future? I don't expect y'all to make a decision, but maybe some words of wisdom? Do you guys think she is playing me? My sister thinks she is, but I think she is predetermined to hate anyone I date so her opinion kinda means nothing to me. 

TL;DR: I met an amazing girl last year, she sorta broke my heart, but now she wants to get back together. I'm a little apprehensive because of the uncertainty the future holds. looking for any kind of advice.

If you read all of it, thank you. Truly, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.",20Jun2019,1

501,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am an undergrad doing a summer research internship; however, three weeks in, my mentor has had me doing repetitive tasks, and plans to have me continue doing those same tasks during the entire summer. While I have learned some, refining my own wet lab techniques and practices, I will not be running experiments or helping others with their experiments. In scientific terms, I am simply repeating the same protocol, generating proteins for others to use. (my   
mentor plans for me to clone 5 proteins during the summer, repeating what I have done before. My work will help others; however, after learning the initial ""how-to,"" there is not much left to learn or experiment. Furthermore, I will have to present my work to the lab and write a scientific paper for my summer internship, and frankly, repeating the same protocol over and over would limit my ability to do either of those (in my view). There are five other interns in my lab, and at least four of them are helping their mentors run experiments and advance science, while I am not doing so. I am not even optimizing a protocol or anything, just repeating the same steps over and over again. 

I don't know what to do. I could go straight to my PI (though she is extremely busy) and try to pitch my own project or ideas what I would like to do (which I would try to back up with previous analysis I have done in another lab, demonstrating my capabilities), but that would make me look bad with my current mentor. I asked my mentor yesterday about his plans for me during the summer, and he said that he plans for me to make more proteins with the same protocol. I could ""suck-it-up,"" but repeating the same protocol over and over is not why I am doing a summer research internship. I don't expect to be discovering anything new or significantly advancing science or publishing, but I don't want to just do the same thing the entire summer. (There is no way I could improve upon the process since it has already been developed and optimized by others in the lab). On the other hand, I am worried for my letter of recommendation, since I plan to apply to subsequent summer programs, and a bad letter of recommendation would be detrimental, especially coming from a tier 1 research university/PI. Is there any advice you all would have me do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Just some background:

&amp;#x200B;

My current mentor is the staff scientist/lab manager, so he does not run experimental experiments, only generates proteins for others to experiment with. However, he is nice and an excellent teacher. 

PI: principal investigator, the head of the lab 

&amp;#x200B;

This is also a big lab, having around 40 people. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am repeating the same protocol over and over for the entire summer. I talked with my mentor, and he was very hesitant to say we would be doing anything else, besides generating proteins for others to use. I don't know what to do, since I am doing a summer research internship to gain experience, advance science, and learn, not to repeat the same thing over and over. I could talk to the PI (and would like to present a project proposal), but she is very very busy, and would make me look bad to my mentor. Also, I don't want to jeopardize my letter of recommendation.

505,"⚠️ Trigger Warning: Homophobia, abuse 


TL;DR at end

I have a younger cousin who is nine years old and is your stereotypical minecraft and roblox fifth grader. He is very flamboyant and has declared himself to be on the spectrum of LGBTQ+. Like I said, he’s nine years old so I’m not sure he exactly knows what all the terms mean, but he does tell me that he likes boys and he seems to enjoy dressing very feminine. (I’ll refer to him as YS (younger sibling) throughout the post)

I also have an older cousin who is your stereotypical sporty idgaf teenage boy. He is really funny, and their whole family, like mine, is very liberal growing up in a very diverse and democratic part of the US. I’ll refer to him as OS, older sibling, throughout the post.

It all started the last time we visited them. My older sister and I did YS’s makeup because he asked us to and we also took a bunch of “model pictures” for him. He LOVES Billie Eilish and actually has an amazing singing voice and dreams of being a singer one day. He also asked us to cut one of his shirts into a crop top, and we did (once we asked his Mom to see if it’s okay). He LOVED this croptop. For the rest of the days that we were there, he wore it everyday for everything. His parents are used to his feminine and expressive personality, so this wasn’t out of the ordinary to them.

Fast forward to two days ago. My sister, YS, OS, and our other cousin who is in between the two in age also came with us. She’s very soft spoken and shy, and is surprisingly close to OS and YS. OS walked ahead of us, and as he later told us it was because he was embarrassed to be seen with a younger brother wearing a croptop. Kind of weird, but we didn’t think anything of it. This is where it starts to go downhill. 

At the pool, OS was with his other teenage friends. Upon seeing us arrive, one of his friends called out to YS, “Why are you wearing a croptop?!” and then to OS, “Why is your brother so weird?!”, where then OS called out “Yeah, [YS name] go change!” and then OS’s other friend called out to the middle cousin, “Why is your brother wearing girl clothes?!”

YS was beyond words, humiliated that these teenage boys were shouting these things to him across the pool infront of everyone. I grabbed his hand and my sister, middle cousin, and I walked over to some pool chairs to set our stuff down. I told YS those boys were assholes and that he shouldn’t listen to them.

Fast forward that same day at dinner.  It started when OS said “I don’t appreciate you wearing a crop top to the pool” 
YS: I don’t care. I don’t care what you buttholes (the word closest to a curse word he knows) say to me.
OS: It would just be easier if people like you just wore normal clothes.
YS: Well I don’t care. It’s 50-50 with you buttholes and people like me.
OS: Actually it’s pretty much 90-10 us versus you.
My sister then said “Yeah but [OS name] you don’t have to be one of those buttholes.”
Then while laughing, OS said “Yeah but it’s just easier.”

Then throughout the dinner he kept on mocking the whole “Did you just assume my gender?” and making fun of people who don’t consider themselves to be cis boy or girl.

Because YS is only nine, he could never really make any valid argument against him. My sister kept on telling OS to cut it out and that it wasn’t funny. He stopped, for the most part.

Later, YS told us that at school there was this boy being bullied during recess that YS had a crush on. He told us that when he told the bully to stop, the bully starting kicking YS instead of the other boy that YS defended. Then, instead of standing up for him, the other boy said “Yeah Go kick the gay boy!” 

Their parents know that OS has been making those comments. They have talked to him countless times about being nicer. My older sister and I talked to him and he told us that he’s just “preparing [YS] for what people are going to say in highschool” and that he just wants YS to “tone it down” in public areas. It’s obvious that OS’s friends make fun of YS, and OS is embarrassed by his brother and just chooses to make fun of YS too. 

Their parents never interject when OS is saying these things, they only ever talk to him after the fact.

What do I do? I want to help YS but I don’t know how because we only see them rarely. It’s horrible that YS is a fifth grader and is already exposed to homophobia.

TL;DR:
Older cousin has been making fun and making homophobic comments to his younger brother who is very feminine and is gay. Older brother says he’s just preparing his brother for the harassment he will get in highschool. Younger brother doesn’t know what to do, and parents don’t do anything except for talking with older brother after the fact.",20Jun2019,0

Well we reached out to the man and he never really wanted to talk to me or find out. Well my mom recently reached out to him again two years later and today I spoke to him on the phone for the first time.

511,"I'm 22 year old guy. At a local bands show I have met a 16 year old girl. Now we are in a relationship. I was very conscious about how weird that was, but I really liked her. I really like it when I'm with her, and I can't notice age difference when we talk... She had two relationships before, one lasted for a year and other for six months. She was sexually active before being in a relationship with me, and is with me. We are together for about 3 months now, and so a lot of people have heard about me being with her. 

I get really stressed when I talk to people about her (And, obviously, I would like to talk freely about my girlfriend), because they tend to judge me, or just change the tone of conversation when they find out what age she is. Also, I cannot really see myself hanging out with her friends, and I think she might get a bad reputation at high school.

Now I am thinking about breaking up with her, solely based on what I've written above. But I cannot seem to imagine going up to her and telling her this stuff, because I like her so much, and she likes me, and we are very happy when we are together. 

I talked to a few friends and they said that it is alright with them and that I shouldn't care about what others say. But this is a constant stress for me.

I've told her a few times that I've always wanted to move to Cali so this is not out of the blue. I'm moving out for a lot of reasons, but living outside of my family in a state where I can practice my career much more freely will be very liberating for me and my mental health.

How do I get over this kind of jealousy? I’m trying to kinda let go a little bit and stop caring as much but I have a really difficult time. Everyone else says I should just try to make friends and go out more but i don’t want to build any kind of bad rep for myself again

516,"My grandmother can be very negative and typically you cant talk about much without her acting like its an attack on her or if its a subject she can turn on us she usually does. Occasionally she’ll refuse to talk about important subjects just because she doesnt want to think about it.

My mom and grandmother got into a fight about schooling my brother two weeks ago and have barely talked since then. My mom had enough of my grandmother picking at my mom everyday for weeks and said to stop bringing it up everyday. My brother is 15 and is being homeschooled. My grandmother believes hes not being schooled at all and continuously bothers my mom over it. 

My uncle is a sore subject but it’s necessary to speak about him and his kids that live in different states. She refuses to speak about it at all. 

Im not sure how to go about speaking to her at this point on these particular subjects. Any help would be appreciated",20Jun2019,1

518,"I know about Sling and other similar streaming services, but currently I have Comcast tv and internet for $170 (I know). Our bill has slowly been creeping up over the years without notice and I'm sick of the run around and games with Comcast. We tried using our own modem to save money and that bit us in the ass. 

What I'm afraid of is if we leave and our next internet and tv service we choose won't be as good or offer as much Comcast. Unfortunately in our area Google Fiber isn't an option, but AT&amp;T Fiber is. We don't do a lot of downloading or need high speed internet essentially. We do enjoy sports, food network, mtv, vh1, and other channels Comcast offers. 

Does anyone have any similar recommendations that won't break our bank? Any amount under $120 a month is more reasonable than what we are paying now.

Thank you in advance!",20Jun2019,1
519,"I am so lost right now in my life. I feel this job change is a major point in my life. I just want to make a well-educated decision, and how best than to ask Reddit, right?

About myself: I am 26. I have a boyfriend. I have car payments, I have a house payment. I am working to eventually become a dental hygienist. This is my ultimate goal. I am not in college, however, because I didn't want to add more debt to myself. I am not doing well financially. I have almost had my house foreclosed, and almost had my car repossessed. I used to be a manager at a company, and got paid good money. I was let go, and I was not able to keep up with my bills. I managed to get a loan from a family member that helped me catch up, and my boyfriend moved in. Right now, I am finally catching up. I have made deals with companies I owe and am working on paying my loan from my family off. As it stands, my bills are caught up. Slowly, but surely, I will not be in complete debt.

This is where my job change comes into play. The best way to explain these jobs are that I am just going to name pros/cons in a list, and hopefully the people of Reddit can help me decide what to do.

Job 1: My current job. I am a dental office manager. I have been here for over 2 years.

Pros:

* My job is easy. I sit at a desk and get to play on my phone a lot.
* It's just me and the dentist, and we get along very well.
* I feel appreciated here, something I have not had at other jobs.
* The Dr. understands being human. I make mistakes and he doesn't get upset.
* When I was at a very low time, I told him that I was depressed, and afraid that because I felt that way, I was going to lose my job (Which is what happened at my last job). He told me that I was not going to lose my job because my depression was not something I chose to have. He told me if I ever needed a mental health day, that all I had to do was let him know.
* If I were to go to dental hygienist school, he'd be here to help me with homework/questions.
* If I were to go to dental hygienist school, he'd probably hire me after I graduate.
* If I were to go to dental hygienist school, I could get work credits to help complete school faster.
* I get free dental care.
* I get free dental supplies.
* I like the patients, they like me.
* He pays for me to take some classes in OSHA/HIPAA compliance. He wants to send me to take an x-ray taking course.
* He's a nice person, and although I feel I am a slight kiss-ass (this doesn't bother me. I feel being nice to people, especially my boss, is just something you do).
* I'm good at my job. I understand it.
* People give us things, food mainly, as gifts. I normally get most of it. At Thanksgiving, we are given a whole Thanksgiving meal, and me and the Dr and his wife eat together. I then keep the left overs.
* I get around $250-$300 bonus for a Christmas gift.
* Sometimes the Dr gets sick, and I have to be at the office to cancel and reschedule the appointments. It's super easy, and I get paid for around 6 hours because he wants me to get the mail in the afternoon. During this time I really do a minimum amount of work, because there isn't anything to do.

Cons:

* It's not 40/hrs a week. It's 32/hrs.
* He takes extra days off, which I don't get paid for. My hours vary from as little as 20 hours to just recently, 36 hours. But mostly, it's below the 32 hours.
* I sometimes feel he doesn't listen to me when I tell him things.
* He isn't progressive in moving his business into the 21st century. I've tried to explain to him he needs to get certain things for the office, but the final decision is not mine.
* He's 65. I don't think he'll be a dentist much longer, but he always says he isn't going anywhere for a while. 
* He just had knee surgery a month ago, and if I leave, that means he will have to do most of what my job is now. A new office manager will have to take the OSHA/HIPAA courses in order to do everything I have been doing.
* He's looking to get a hygienist for a day or two of the week, but isn't having a good time finding one.
* I feel he doesn't pay me enough to do everything I do, and he won't give me a raise. After his last hygienist left, I picked up the extra stuff she used to do, (obviously not cleaning teeth) I clean his room and clean his instruments.
* He has made me cry before, only out of frustration, not because he was calling me names or anything.
* I have to pay for my own insurance, although he does pay half of my premium every month. (He has to pay half, by law.)
* He's been trying to convince my boyfriend to marry me, and I am 99% sure it's because I would go on his insurance and he'd have to stop paying me the extra money.
* He's cheap. Anything I need for the office he gets knock-off versions of. And he still has yet to give me most of the things I ask for, because he doesn't want to buy them.
* He tells me to collect money at time of service, but if patients don't have the money, he gets mad at me.
* He makes me tell patients what prices for things are, and acts like he has nothing to do with the prices. Many times he's done the work and they don't know the expense, and I have to break it to them. It is not fun.
* He has tried to sue someone, and made me deal with them when they wanted to talk about it. This was extremely stressful. 
* He knows I'm struggling financially. He's had to sign paperwork for me to get assistance for bills, and for food stamps. I'm not saying he has to pay me more. I understand he still needs to profit off his business, and if I can believe the last hygienist, I'm the highest paid office manager he's had.
* I'm getting fatter. I've gained 20lbs over the two years.
* He has the radio set to 80s music. At first it was okay. Now it's been 2 years. I wasn't even born in the 80s, and yet I know all the songs. Many I do not like.
* There's no up from here. (Unless I become a hygienist)

&amp;#x200B;

Job 2: It's a warehouse position for a place that rhymes with pamazon.

Pros:

* My boyfriend works there, we can carpool and I'll have the same shift as him. We can see each other more often.
* After working there for 1 year, I am eligible for up to 90% of my schooling paid for by them. Does not have to be a degree in something for them. I could get my dental hygienist degree.
* I'll get 20% off their website. If me and my boyfriend get married and work there, it becomes 40% off.
* I have friends working there.
* It's 40/hr a week, with possibility of overtime.
* They pay for close to 6 months maternity leave.
* My boyfriend and I do want to get married, but we just don't have the money for it. If I work here, we can make enough money to do it sooner.
* In a few months, I will make enough to pay off almost all of my debts, and pay back my family. And probably have money left over.
* Health insurance day 1, basic plan paid entirely by the employer.
* After 30 days, eligible for dental, eye care, PTO, 401K...
* It's 10/hr days, with three days off. Even with overtime, I'd still have two days off.
* I could get into better shape here.
* I have a possibility to move up after 3 months. I've been a (real) manager before, and I loved it. 
* If I don't become a hygienist, I still could make good money working here. 
* They are very active with their workers. They have dress-up days, and you can earn tickets to buy from their workers only store.
* It will make my boyfriend happy, even though he's said if I stay at the Drs, he won't be upset or love me less.

Cons:

* I have a bad knee, that I've had surgery on. It is not great, and sometimes hurts a lot.
* It's a standing position. For 10 hours I stand in the same place pretty much.
* I haven't done a lot of strenuous activities since I started at the dental office, so I've gained some fat and lost some muscle. This job will be hard, probably for a few weeks. Hopefully not long.
* You are not allowed your phone, or headphones.
* What if I can't do it? What if it's too hard for me?
* It's boring if you get certain places in the warehouse to work.

\-----------

I know it seems like I have more on the list for my current job, but that's obviously because I actually know my boss, and have been there for over 2 years.

Please, people of Reddit, help me.

I have already been accepted at the other job, they are waiting to hear from me when I can start.",20Jun2019,1
520,"8 months ago I(24M) was out drinking with a group of people at a party which was mostly girls together with my best friend(23F) that got really tipsy there. I called an uber for her so she gets home safely and stayed at the party a little while longer..Taking a nap at a corner I woke up with a group of women accusing me of groping their friend and I obviously didn't believe her because I had control over my consumption of alcohol.

Though they didn't have any evidence on me, rumors started to spread among our(my bestfriend and I) group of friends and she believed it..I felt so betrayed I was depressed for a few months and cut ties with everyone that believed the rumors. It hurts a lot.

Now that new info has come to light that someone saw the chick placed my hand on her breast only to cry when she was caught. (The way my finger tuck into the cleavage of her shirt and body position I slept on the couch it looked like I did it drunkenly and was pushed down)

The group of girls have lost their shame in this mess and still act like they're right about everything they've said even though someone I didn't know revealed the truth which gives a lot of credibility.

My best friend has made no apology for betraying my trust in her. 

She jumped into a conversation with me out of the blue when she saw me pass by and I just nodded a few times;giving cold short answers to whatever she was talking about.

I don't think I am in the wrong to do so. Does she even deserve a second chance after that level of betrayal?",20Jun2019,1
521,"Ok so this really begins with the fact that my father wants me out of his house and I cant move back in with my mom.


My girlfriend has been living with my dad since her sr. Year of highschool, after she was kicked out of her house and living with a friend. She didnt ask me, she asked my step mom if she could move in, and my dads conversation with me was ""oh and (your gf) is moving in with us, is there anything wrong with that?"". At the time I was 16, and I had it in my mind that we were special and that we were unlike other highschool couples and we were going to last forever. My father lives a town over and I ended up only seeing her whenever i saw him. Close to the end of my sr. year (I graduated hs in June 2018) i was suffering with some serious emotional baggage because of everything that was going on and was constantly getting in trouble at home because I was smoking weed. I was fighting constantly with my mom and when I would talk to my girlfriend about it she told me ""why dont you just move in with us"" and I told her that it was because I had to finish highschool. She was upset about this and we got into arguments about it, because if I wasnt living with her even though I could be it obviously meant I didnt love her. She eventually said ""I'm not talking about this anymore until you're living here"" and I was at a breaking point. I couldn't let 3 years of a relationship go, and I thought that if I lost her I would end up killing myself. I ended up leaving to go live with my dad in April, after he my step mom and my gf all were telling me that my mom was a narcissist and manipulative. I was so torn that I felt I had to leave, and I ended up floating the rest of my 2 months through highschool and just barely getting by. When it came time for me to go to college I found out that I lost my student assistance when I moved in with my dad because he makes significantly more than my mom, and he hadn't saved a cent for me to go away(despite me being a gifted student) so I had to take out a student line of credit from my bank. My girlfriend was heartbroken that I had to go away and I ended up coming home almost every weekend which seriously interrupted my studies. She went on antidepressants because she claimed she was in such a dark space being away from me, and when my first semester mid terms came around and I had to stay at school she told me she felt like killing herself and sent me pictures of her cutting herself. This continued for the rest of my time at college and she still never made effort to come to me.


My dad threatened to kick me out and has told me now that I am out by the end of the summer because of the fact that I am upset with him for being a drug addict when we were young (which he only told me in February) and lying to my stepmom. It was revealed to me that they have been lying to me this whole time (step mom is clueless because she has only ever heard his side) and they have both told me to ""just forgive and get over it"" which I dont feel like I can do, and my girlfriend wasnt there for me to talk to, she just told me the same and also told me that I have ""daddy issues"". I told her that i was done, i was going to join the navy and leave her and them behind. She told me that if I left she would kill herself, and she has also told me that if I didnt get my act straight she would leave me, which she has twisted to say ""I just meant leave to find somewhere else to sleep"". I dont feel like I can rely on her and the only reason I am staying now is because I cant move out with the money that I have and I feel like if I did leave her behind she may actually kill herself. I plan on moving back to the residence where I went to college and working for a year, getting OSAP and going back to school. Our relationship has fallen apart and theres practically nothing there now. I feel like the correct choice is to leave because I cant control her actions either way, and I know that what shes doing is manipulation. 


She wont move back in with her mom and the rest of her family is in Quebec. I feel like I would be leaving her stranded if I just picked up and left, but we wouldn't be in this situation if i couldve just counted on her for support and she been there for me to talk to like I was for her when she was having issues with her family.


What do I do reddit, I care about her but it's not the same as when we were in love. I dont think a relationship like this can last and I dont think I should be having to make a choice like this at 19. What happens if we were to get serious and have kids, is she just going to run from those problems too? This may sound like more of a rant than asking for advice, but I dont know. I just need reassurance that leaving to be on my own wouldn't be the wrong thing to do.",20Jun2019,1

523,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on. 

Edit: I’m scared she won’t like me because of my body I posted pics on my account history it’s the only reason I backed off from the hug she offered :/",20Jun2019,0
524,"I just turned 16, and I really want to help out my family by making some money, but I don’t have a car or a license. Does anyone know of any jobs that can be done by a 16 yr old online or something where I can stay home? I live in a large apartment complex, so things like babysitting and dog walking are pretty all taken up by other/older kids. I wanna be able to make some money but also have time for school and marching band, once that starts up again, so I’m wondering if there’s anything very accessible that I can do and make some sort of an earning from it.

525,"So either I'm crazy or this girl in my class that I am somewhat interested in, is also interested in me.
I am a 19 y/o male, so, obviously I can't read women and need strangers on Reddit to help me out.

I have knowne this girl for about 5 months and have recently started getting to know eachother a bit better. We live 1km from eachother but have never really hung out, outside of the course, bar 3 occassions. 1 of which, I met the boyfriend and the family. (I'll get into that later)

The past few weeks I've been noticing little things that she does around me, as well as some odd things she has told me that I can either take at face value or it's deeper than what was said. (Which is why I am confused)

She has repeatedly laughed at purely dumb shit I say/show her, that I think is funny (when it really isn't). For example, today I read the first couple of words in a class group chat and immediately thought it was funny. I show her the message and she starts laughing as well. Remember, I haven't read the full message, so I was actually missing context to what was actually said. Another class mate asks what is so funny, so I read the message out loud and as I'm reading it outloud it's not as funny which myself and my class mate acknowledge. Pure silence from her for a good 5 minutes until someone came along to break the awkward silence.

I'll tell you about a couple of other things that happened today, long story short, she gave me her 
Origin account login so I can play Sims 3 &amp; 4. Which first off, what a fucking legend... and secondly, what the fuck???

The other thing that happened, I need to provide background details on. The course we are doing is very practical and hands on, so we're all, always working, doing something, that requires quite a bit of concentration to do. Today she seemed very attention-seeking, really going out of her way to talk to me from across the room, even when I was meant to be doing an important job. It got to the stage where at one point I had to ignore her so I could do my job. She seemed very dissapointed when I spoke to her about something unrelated, later on.

She has also said/done some weird things to me.
For example, on one occassion she told me that I was the only person in the class that she likes. (Which I obviously took at face value).
And she is always complimenting me with how ""smart"" I am. (Which I again, take at face value).

She has confided in me a lot recently.
So her boyfriend is 4 years older than we are, which is fine obviously, idc. He doesn't have a job, doesn't drive, plays Fortnite all day, everyday and it just so happens that his parents have been best friends with her parents for anywhere ranging from 20-30 years. They also only see eachother once a week (they have been dating for 6 months). Their parents have raised concerns about them breaking up and it ruining their friendships with eachother, it's very regularly this topic is brought up by them. She is very submissive and because of this, she has started calling his family, her own family and never in an enthusiastic way. She is afraid of ruining their parent's friendships if she leaves. The one day they do see eachother is a course contact day and she leaves campus (or doesn't come in at all), she is very smart but I feel like she is being held back by her boyfriend and her family.

At the moment I have not been entertaining any thought of pursuing her romantically as she has a boyfriend (although I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested). I just want to know, from what you have courageously read so far, (kudos to you), am I just her male best friend, is she interested in me or both? As well as, what are signs that I should be taking what she says/does, deeper than face value.

TLDR: I don't know whether the girl I am interested in, is also interested in me. She has a BF but, I feel like she's been dropping hints and flirting with me, but a lot of things can be taken at face value. What are signs these things are deeper than face value?",20Jun2019,1

So, I and my girlfriend have been dating for a day less than a month. Tomorrow at 6:54 AM, we will have officially completed one month. And it is a big deal for me. But the thing is, I don't know what I should do. We communicate only through text since we live so far away from each other (We can't call due to time difference and parents being at home and shit). So can you guys help me out here? What's the best thing I can do???

527,"So, there's this dude who some years back used to be a close friend of mine, but in the past years became a very narcissistic, manipulative and clingy person and, after having tons of fights over his behaviour and realising he's never really going to change, I decided to drop him. He didn't take that well at all, so I had to block him on all means of communication. 

However, one thing I didn't know was that you can't block an e-mail address the same way you would block someone on social media(as in, they won't ever be able to contact you anymore), but rather e-mails from blocked adressess will just end up going into your spam. I did check my spam a few days ago and I saw this e-mail from him saying (roughly translated, since English is not my mother language): ""I will make you regret this. I won't physically hurt you, but I have ways of making you regret this and I will do it first chance I get. Just wait and see"".

So, my first question is: legally speaking, does this count as a threat? I know this guy quite well and he's a big all bark and no bite and I highly doubt he would try anything, so those are most definitely empty threats. However, I would still like to have a safety measure and tell him that, if he ever tries to contact me ever again, I will send screenshots of his e-mails to the police. Would that be legal to do, or would it fall under the scope of blackmail?",20Jun2019,1

533,"I'm 19 (male if it matters), just graduated highschool and moved back to my hometown. I am immediately searching for a job since I have to take a gap year before university, and I'm doing whatever I can do use that year productively. My brother has graduated highschool over 3 years ago and due to some completely immature issues with his girlfriend and the depression that this caused, he's been living on my parents money doing literally nothing but sit on the computer all day. He's not even trying to get a job or apply to university. He is soon finally moving to the Netherlands for university, which will also cost my parents a lot of money.

I do not jump to conclusions and assume his problems weren't big and extremely sophisticated, but they were by no means debilitating and he absolutely could've gotten a job at the very least. My parents were paying absolutely all his expenses without pushing him to do anything, and he lives/lived in our apartment in our hometown. Now that he's moving and I'm taking that apartment, my parents expect me to pay for everything (bills and all living expenses) with the small amount of money I will earn. 

I do not complain, I think it is normal that I pay for my own expenses and I don't want to ask my parents for money, but I think it is extremely unfair that they gave him absolutely everything with zero expectations while I have to do everything by myself. 

I don't know how to talk to them about this and I feel uncomfortable demanding them to pay for my expenses, and my idea was simply to move to a different, cheaper apartment (This would force them to pay bills in an empty apartment since they live abroad). 

Any advice on how I can handle the situation or where I might be wrong would be greatly appreciated.",20Jun2019,2
534,"My girlfriend and I have been together for some time now, and about a month ago she started slowly moving her stuff in. Now, everything is here, we share on groceries, and essentially they are living with me until further notice. Weve talked about it recently, and decided that this is okay, were both comfortable with it, and that it isnt just sleeping over but actually living with each other. 

So that being said, would it be okay to ask her to split some expenses? Their job pays more than mine does, not a lot but enough. Of course, because this was my place, I pay for all the bills and the rent and everything although we take turns buying the groceries. I feel like if I ask for something, it would seem like I'm just asking for money. I guess I sort of am, but I dont think it's fair to let them live for free now because they have moved in with me. So we havent talked about money and I have no idea how to bring it up. They don't have a key or anything, and the bills were all my responsibility before they moved in so it isnt like its financially impossible.",20Jun2019,3
535,"I just started my dream job about a month ago at a chemical company. I love the work, but I cannot stand a particular coworker. Let's call her Lindsey. 


She has been working here for only 2 years, but most of the chemists love her because she is good at her job. I can't deny that, she knows what she's doing. However, Lindsey has an ego the size of small countries and always talks about herself, then compares you to her. She knows just how to jab me to hurt me or piss me off. 

Today my manager called me to his office to talk about how things have been going and to go over last week's review and he told me that the 'girls' have had a few complaints. (I work with two other women, only one of them is the problem however.)

Basically everything that I've done wrong (which is a pretty short list) he brought up. She has apparently told him every little problem with me, from a sample I messed up due to a simple mistake, to being sleepy at work. They also told him that I'm ""resistant to being given advice."" 

I explained to him that one of the girls (I explicitly didnt give her name) has a bad habit of giving snippy, downright rude comments and advice, and there's only so much crap I can take before I dont want to hear it anymore. He basically said he knew exactly who I'm talking about, but to ignore it because she's good at her job. So I guess she had a free pass to shit on my day everyday.

You see, from time to time I would have this great idea that seems fun to do and actually freaking cool. I basically enter, as I call it, ""mad scientist"" Mode. I would be really excited for like 10-20 minutes, but then... Bam. I start overthinking.


Suddenly I am no longer excited for this new invention. I just feel like I wouldn't do it right. I no longer have the motivation to do anything because of my overwhelming self-doubt...

Then there was Festival we went with our group and she was hugging me and holding my hand all the time, baiscilly we spend all night togheter. Next day i asked her what can i order for dinner because i had nothing in fridge and she brought me food. Overall we had great time talking and everyone from group thought it was it but form wednesday last week i started to feel something was off. I asked her for dinner and she responded she cant because something was complicated but she didnt said what. She started responding for my text with hours long gap then at friday she snapped that her evening was the best and she feel like happiest woman alive. When i asked her what happend she told me that maybe i would find out soon and thats were she stopped texting me. What happend next was me texting her tuesday and finding out that she has boyfriend since friday and this is what happend that day.

My mom in the past hasn’t let me go on trips like this with my friends because she doesn’t trust those parents and she thinks we will be stupid, but this is the first time she is letting me so I was very excited to go with my friends and I told them all I could go and they’d be pretty mad if I couldn’t or at least annoyed.

Maybe a day later I was talking to my girlfriend about it and she told me that is was the same week that she bought us tickets to go see a soccer game for my birthday forever ago. We were both very excited to go to this and she spent a lot of money. I talked to her about it and she insists that I go on the trip and she can sell the tickets but I would still feel terrible. Her reasoning was that it’s one day of fun for the game vs a whole week which makes sense to me but I still feel shitty thinking about it.

On top of this, if I went to the beach I’d be missing a week of football workouts and a week of work that I could be making money. I don’t care that much about missing football because I could always work out at the beach, but a week of work would be a pretty substantial amount of money that I won’t get.

550,"Some quick back story about myself; I have long suffered with bi polar disorder and a constant anxiety. I am medicated to control mood swings but some days are definitely harder than others. I panic and become overwhelmed very easily and can not control my emotions at a certain point. I am a SAHM and wife, if anyone is in the same boat then you know how isolating and depressing it can be to be home everyday with a ton of household chores to tend to, not to mention my own children to (happily) care for. Every household chore is my responsibility. 

My sister and brother in law had a child about a year ago. I told sister I would help with the baby since I never had help with mine and I wanted to be there for her and her husband so they could continue to work without having to pay the crazy high cost for daycare. 
I think I may be being walked on.
I have kept my niece for almost 9 months, full time hours, 40 hours a week.
It wasn’t until my entire home life was being swallowed up after 4 months of keeping her that I mentioned to a friend that I wasn’t being paid, at all. I decided something had to give and with my anxiety and overwhelming feelings, it was extremely difficult to say anything about “maybe I should be getting paid??”, but I did and we settled for 50/week. 
Over a course of time my child wanted to start playing a sport which would require practice, which requires some days off, so I can tend to my child. When this was brought up sis and I decided that I would get those days off, or at least the last few hours of the day.  Which was fine. 
After a short time my child decided soccer wasn’t the sport, and because I would no longer have the extra days off I was going to need to paid a bit better so we decided on 75/week, an extra 15 bucks. And things went back to normal, full time babysitting. 
The 75/week lasted for possibly 3 weeks. 
I am now being paid 30-50 a week, depending on how much she hands me. 
I am getting tired, I’ve expressed to sis that this is now to point where it isn’t worth it anymore, that I am missing out on summer and my child’s summertime before mines first year of school begins. It’s getting increasingly harder to control how I feel about keeping my beautiful niece, and I am ready to stop. I am crying everyday I have her, I feel like I am being mean to my LO because all my focus is on the baby. I am losing my mind. 
I told sis that my last day keeping niece would be end of next month. I still have several weeks to go, at an extremely low pay and I am still losing all this time with my child my husband and my family. I am at a loss, I am ready to stop keeping her now. They only reason I didn’t give a sooner date to stop is because sis work hours are already scheduled. What is more important right now, my mentality or my sis and bro in law?",20Jun2019,1
551,"Okay so this situation is kind of tragic and I think I may have screwed it up for myself. 

I want to protect everyone’s privacy here so I won’t be sharing any of the specific messages that were sent. 

I have been seeing this guy for a few weeks and things have been going really well. He’s a little bit older than me (I’m a senior in college, he’s 25) and honestly that does intimidate me a little bit as he’s established an financially independent and all that shit. But honestly that discomfort was just making me try to get my shit together, so I didn’t view it differently at all. 

I went out with him and his friends on Friday night. I had a special project for work that I had to do over the weekend and essentially I was gonna be working all day from 7 to 7 Saturday and Sunday. We had a little bit too much to drink that afternoon (don’t ask lmao) so we just went back to my place and crashed at like 9pm.  Woke up early the next morning because I had to, walked him to his car (we parked near the bars and walked home). We kissed and agreed we were gonna meet up that night. 

Later that day I was texting him and he told me that he was heading out of town. I asked him what he was doing and I got no response. Okay, I thought, that was fine. Later that day, my phone broke. I got home and immediately messaged him on Instagram to let him know I needed to get a new phone and to talk to me there in the meantime. I saw him posting on insta and figures he was ignoring my messages. Okay, I thought, he’s just having fun with his friends and doesn’t wanna text right now. 

Sunday comes around and I’ve heard nothing. Monday. Nothing. So I send him a message asking if everything’s alright. No response. I get really mad because I figure he’s ghosting me. Finally on Wednesday I get a new phone and see he had texted me and never had seen my instagram dms, but not before I texted him a (not egregiously terrible) low-key aggressive message essentially demanding an explanation. Honestly, I thought he was ghosting me. I thought I was never going to hear from him again. 

He texted me back a few hours later telling me he thought I was ignoring him and he had no idea about the DMs I had sent him. He said that this whole thing was making him uncomfortable and he wasn’t sure he could handle this. 

We talked for a while and had a really honest conversation that I do not want to get into the details of because it was very personal and it’s just not place to do that. 

It was going so well and now he has doubts about the whole thing and I really want to best for him but also I really like him. What’s the best thing for me to do here? How can I express that I’m willing to work through whatever it is that’s making him uncomfortable or at least try to? 


TLDR: we both thought we were ghosting each other and I sort of scared him off once we realized the mistake. I want him to feel comfortable and I don’t know what to do.",20Jun2019,1

560,"It's a long story but I'll try to make it short.
My mom (45) and dad (50+) got a divorce 13+ years ago. My dad made a loan at the bank without a signature of my mom while they were married. I don't know the actual information around the loan but since my dad made the loan while they were married, my mom is also responsible. And since my dad is- not that good of a person-, when they came to his house (he has his own child and wife) and made a request for the money he told them the loan was my mom's. Also his occupation isn't officially in the records. 
Since he sent them we have received letters addressing that they would be paying a visit for items of worth.
So here's the thing, since my mom didn't sign the loan contract she can sue him for fraudulent actions. The reason she doesn't want to is because he has his own family and life. Therefore if she sued him he might go to jail and won't be able to provide for his family.

Extra Info:
Loan: €10.000+
Country: The Netherlands
Mom's occupation: Entrepreneur, doesn't earn much

564,"I came home early today, and I was going down to my room when I noticed that my brother left his door to his room open, and his computer was still on. Out of curiosity, I looked at what was on his computer, and noticed that he had a 17 page document which he was still working on. 

I looked at the document, and the first page or so went over his background, how he was raised, what he believes in life. 

Then, it went south real fast. My brother then starts expressing fondness for some genocidal figures throughout history, he starts from BC to AD. 

Then the document goes to him describing the issues with today’s world, he explains how the LGBT community holds back scientific progress, and that the same goes for other non-white ethnicities. He then concludes saying “that we already know the means of fixing this, us humans have done it before.” 

I tried calling the police, and explained the situation as best as they could, but they informed me that he still has a right to be racist, and own guns, as long as he isn’t hurting anyone.

565,"My brother is 28 years old, has always lived with our mom and has never had a job. He has mental health issues where he is antisocial and has anxiety and anger management problems, so he gets social security disability checks. He likes to drink alot and often gets way too drunk to function. 

About a week ago, he drank all his beer and decided to drive his broken old truck to get more. But this truck was not drivable, it had very bad brakes. He was ""working on it"" for a few years now, but it wasn't even registered. He ended up rolling the truck into a ditch and fleeing back home. No property besides the truck was damaged. He ended up breaking his arm, at least 2 fingers, and his wrist was maybe broken. We can't be sure because he refuses to get treatment. The police have no data to track him down really (the previous owner died), but he refuses to go to the hospital still. If we call 911 he will probably refuse treatment unless we pull the mentally unfit card.

Now if he wants to mess up his hand for life I figured it sucks but I cant force him, I'm not even in his state. But in just 1 week he is calling so many people complaining about his hand hurting or not being able to do things and asking for help, he really wants everyone to pity him. I can see it now, he is going to have a badly healed hand and want everyone to feel sorry for him about it for the rest of his life.

568,"I'm sorry if this is a bit long so there is a TLDR..

I'm 19 almost 20 and studying chemical engineering since i was 17 (got into college after finishing high school, from brazil). 

I have been doing slightly above average in terms of grades with no during these almost 3 years, but since the first one i'm not sure this is what i should be doing with my life. Everything feels just like an obligation and nothing more, I'm studying just to pass exams with decent grades and meeting deadlines. I don't really see myself working in this field at all, but being here gives me a feeling of security in terms of my future, work, money, even if not guaranteed.

So everything about my life feels devoid of meaning, because my life is dedicated to college, and i don't particularly feel interested in what i am studying. I am thinking and worrying about my grades every moment of the day, and doing anything that isn't related to my 'academic performance' makes me feel guilty and anxious. My personal value and mood is very much linked to how my grades are doing, and because of some mental struggles i'm currently on psychological therapy.

I am very passionate about art since i was a child.  I like painting a lot, and everything about it is very compelling and interesting to me. Since talking about this issues with my therapist, i have been thinking a lot about leaving my current course and trying to get into visual arts, in the same college.

But I really have no idea if this would be a good decision. It makes me very scared to think what if i left chem eng for visual arts, but end up not liking it and getting dissapointed? And art also becomes an obligation? Also i think i would feel less secure about having a stable income and job in the future with a degree in arts. Not that it's completely assured that i would have a job with a degree in engineering, but it does give me a sense of security as i said before.

Also I would have to study at least half a year or more for the entrance exam and would risk losing another year if i don't get in at first try.

Tldr:

Thinking about changing from a degree in chemical engineering, which gives security in terms of future but no personal gratification; to visual arts, which i'm passionate about but afraid to make such an extreme change of fields and worries me about my future. How can i know if this would be a good decision for my life? What do you think about this?

Now I don't really know if she has it in her to actually do it, but she's brought it up a few times to me within the last couple of months. Last night it felt like she was gonna do it for real, texting me things like ""I don't want my mom to be the one that finds me. I love you &lt;royalgoldhouse&gt;, thank you. I'm tired of hurting and feel like I have nowhere to go.""

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of context: she has been having relationship problems with this guy for about 3 months now. It's really a cycle at this point. I keep trying to tell her that she can't try to change him back to the way he was but that she has to find something else to put her attention on that actually makes her happy, but she always finds a reason to try and ""make it work"" or ""get some answers."" To be honest I'm kinda tired of giving her relationship advice since it feels like I'm talking to brick wall, but I digress. What happened this time, is that they stopped talking for about a week and a half for whatever reason, and within that timeframe he had sex with someone else. She feels like he cheated (they were never officially together) and that he should be on his knees begging for her forgiveness, he's not hearing it because he thought whatever they had was over with, seeing as though she wouldn't talk to him for that week and a half. He's pretty nonchalant about the situation. Not disrespecting her in anyway, just saying ""hey, i thought we were done, so yeah, i had sex with someone else. sorry if you felt like that's something i shouldn't have done, but that's what it is."" Cool.

&amp;#x200B;

The most I know about her childhood from her, along with some info from her best friend, is that she has always felt starved for love and affection from her parents growing up, and her parents raised her with ""tough love."" She and her best friend told me that her mom can be pretty mean. I don't know much about her dad, but he lives in another state and visits every couple of months. I don't know what the relationship between her mom and her dad is. But from what I can tell, she is afraid to talk to either of her parents about any of her emotional issues. There should be no reason why she's texting me these things and not talking to her parents. She says she loves them, it's not like she hates them.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, her best friend and I drove to her house to talk to her mom, but she wasn't there and neither of us have her number. So we just stayed outside of her house and called our friend hundreds of times, until she told us what park she was in. We bolted right on over there, they hugged it out and cried together, and then started conversing like they always do. After an hour and a half or so, we all separated and before I went to sleep, I sent her a text saying ""Listen, I want you to talk to one of your parents, because if you don't, then I will.""

&amp;#x200B;

I had planned on driving over to her mom's house one day and telling her the kinds of things my friend sends to me and that she obviously is afraid to talk to bring it up to her. I also want to tell her that she's pretty much starved for affection and that she's felt that way since she was a kid, and because of it she keeps ending up in these shitty relationships. But that's kind of a last resort, because I'd really hate to get involved in family situations. I really want her to do it herself, but I doubt she will. I might ask her best friend to do it, because they have a closer relationship, but I'm not sure.

576,"Hi,

I have recently received a book that my birth mother made for me when I was a kid, in preparation for when I was older so I could read and understand what occured in my life up to that point. 

I have had my birth father shielded from me since I was a kid, I always was told he was a random guy she slept with one time so assumed I would never find him. Though, in this book, I was reading the family tree when I realised my dad was listed. I was happy then I saw the birth date of 1935 and it made me shit myself. 

To put this into context: my 20-year-old friend's grandparents are only late 50s/early 60s. My Dad was 9 when D-Day happened, the Queen of England wasn't the Queen when he was born and he has witnessed technology evolve as well as seeing racial segeration wiped out, JFK assassinated, 9/11, wars, Clinton scandal and so much more. 

I don't know how to react. Whilst I am very happy that I have details on people who cared for me as a kid e.g. care workers that I can find and meet, I am feeling angry and weirded out by my Dad being so much older. I don't wanna end up meeting him in a carehome and he has dementia or doesn't remember me or his family don't know he fathered a 18 year old kid, as I don't wanna ruin their lives. I also feel like I am now suddenly a very weird person considering most people my age have parents who are 40-50.

One other girl on the team is nice to me, but she doesn't make small talk outside of Volleyball. 
I'll have no friends on the team and everyone else on the team will be in their groups, I don't want to be that person.
A lot of the girls from my old team are doing club volleyball, but I can't afford to, so my skill is good, just not as good as theirs.
I love volleyball but I don't want to be the outsider on the team, what should I do? Thanks",20Jun2019,1

581,"I’m constantly annoyed/angry/sad/disappointed . Am I the problem or is everyone else the problem?

Everyone in my life seems to be a let down in one way or another. I don’t believe that I have high expectations, in fact they’re rather simple.

Lately every person in my life has been winding me up in one way or another and I feel like I’m about to snap. 

I’ll give you some examples. Please tell me I’m out of line or my feelings are unjustified.

Below are the four big examples but it’s like every single person in my life is a source of frustration. I don’t know what to do anymore. 


Husband: constantly ignores me, not in yaw way you imagine. It’s like he pretends to hear what I’m saying, acknowledges it, then does the exact opposite. For example, I will look him in the eye and say “pass me a spoon”, 2 seconds later he,ll respond “ok”  and pass me a fork. It sounds dumb but it enrages me because it’s constant.

Daughter: 8 years old. Was perfectly fine and for the last few months just breaks down in tears at any response other than “yes”/or any request to do something. Ask her to hang her coat up? She’ll start crying. Ask her to pick up her pencil? Waterworks.

Best friend: (of 20 years)constantly making bad (very financially and emotionally expensive) decisions, even repeating old errors. Tired or hearing about the constant drama and bullshit. Our relationship is completely fractured due to latest bad decisions. Only calls me when needs to pick my brain. Have no sympathy anymore.

Sister: lives with parents. My kids and I only see my parents twice a year. I called to annonce my dates for the summer (as I do every year) and she says to me that I cannot come because her (out of town) boyfriend will be there with his kids and so there’s no room for us. I am completely hurt and offended by this. This isn’t the first time this has happened.",20Jun2019,1
583,"For some background, I am moving. Financially speaking, I have to move almost 100 miles away from where I work because I can't afford living in DC. I will be moving to a Richmond, and I just so happened to get a job interview doing the same thing I am doing here in DC.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is where things get bad, and bad very quick.

&amp;#x200B;

When I interviewed with the employer, the said ""we need your supervisors contact information to start the process, and HR needs it"" was what she said. Being I am desperate financially, I sent away my bosses information without telling her I am looking for another job. She had an idea I was considering moving in with my GF, but we never had a follow up to this conversation. Now, it looks fucking horrible on my end because I now jeopardize losing my job, without having anything lined up.

&amp;#x200B;

I now know that if the employer I was interviewing with was serious about hiring me, they would have given me an offer without asking for my supervisors information. I already gave them 3 references, and I don't like my boss for a number of reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do next? This was a mistake on my end, but I need to figure out how to bounce back from this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I may end up being fired without having anything lined up.",20Jun2019,1

I took it  as a joke and played along, but then it got really annoying and even pushing me out of the friend circle got into a thing. They soon started writing 'lice' (Rice with and l instead of r) everywhere and telling yelling it at me while pulling their eyes back.

I had feelings for her for about 8 months and decided to ask her out. She, obviously, said no. Going into asking I thought that if she had said no, I would be able to get over her no problems. I have found out it isn't that easy.

Now it has only been about a month since being rejected and I can't get over her (we do still talk with one another over snap).

590,"Bit of a backstory for context. I've had some stuff go wrong in the last decade.  I used to be 100lbs, happy and successful, and I'm now 180lbs, unhappy and a failure.  Some of this is my fault, some of it isn't.  My wedding got cancelled when the guy I was desperately in love with decided I wasn't high class enough to marry (I am working class, but I have worked my ass off to get into top universities, and eventually got a doctorate). I then developed a very serious health problem, which I struggled to get diagnosed. I ended up having to give up a successful job as a result.  Then I was diagnosed infertile as a result of the round after round of treatment I had to have. I stupidly started to eat for comfort, and piled on 80lbs.  I look and feel unrecognisable. I don't have any family support due to growing up in a very violent and controlling household.  I now run my own business, but I'm very isolated in the daytime and I don't really enjoy it.

Despite having extensive counselling with a really good therapist who has been fantastic, I just can't find the enthusiasm for life that I once had. I did take antidepressants for a while but they honestly didn't help.  I am not anti-medication at all, but I strongly feel that the way I am living is wrong for me.  But I am terrified of change, because I feel like anything I invest in emotionally just gets taken away.  I don't know how to overcome this.

I've notice I try to make myself feel happier by doing things that are bad for me.  I'm really stuck in an unhealthy and unhappy rut. Please help me by telling me what healthy things I can do to feel like life is full and rewarding again.",20Jun2019,1
591,"Hi all
—
Just for a wee bit of background, I’ve been a bit of a social person in my School, starting up WhatsApp groups &amp; the lot for the students’ benefit. It’s also a way of making friends!
I’ve decided to venture down into the ‘Subreddit’ route now, as I’ve found a few students have a Reddit account.
I’m just asking whether you think it is a good idea, as I do not want to be breaking any social media rules for our place of education etc. I assume the best thing to do would to have moderation pretty damn tight.
What are our views on this, is there anything I should keep in mind? Should I do it at-all?
Thanks in advance.

592,"I’m 17 and working my first job at a local pizza joint in my town. It’s a high school/college job, so most people who work here (besides managers) are 15-20 yo. It’s not a hard job, but there’s a lot to learn so I made a few beginner mistakes when I first stared, but i’m slowly getting better. The general manager of my store isn’t too fond of me, though. She can be pretty cold to me. She has rolled her eyes at me when I’ve asked her for help. She never smiles at me when I try to talk to her. She has said oddly mean spirited things to me when I made mistakes. I don’t know if this is a normal thing in the working world, but it just sucks. There’s a few of my coworkers that she’s really nice to, though. She laughs and jokes around with other people, and I try to join in sometimes, but I feel like an “other”. I don’t really know what to do. It’s starting to make going to work uncomfortable. There’s been times where I’ve had to stop myself from crying in the middle of my shift.

He even let it slip that this is his age preference, but I don’t think he meant it in a way to make me feel bad.

He really does make me feel so special and I know he likes me and cares for me. I’m just a little shaken up that this would be his preference if he weren’t seeing me. Does anybody have any input on this, or am I being insecure?",20Jun2019,1

Now the broker is saying that the landlord will approve us as long as we provide pictures of our drivers licenses.  Is this normal?  I feel like they are asking for a lot of sensitive information, the type of things that someone could use for identity theft.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid though.

I said “Hangout” instead of “go-out” so I asked her, 
 
“Hey I’m getting kind of a weird vibe here, do you realize when I said “do you wanna hang out and go to a movie together” I ment like “Go out”.
And she said 
“Oh sorry I didn’t realize.” 

Do I responded “well I don’t mean to weird you out but...” 
(Expecting her to realize I want her to tell me if she actually wants to go out or not)

She says “why would I be weirded out?” 

(...what?)

So I respond with 
“Well you’re good friend just told you that he likes you.”

(Btw we flirt a lot and she gives off a pretty strong vibe that she at least thinks I’m cute)

And she says “why would I be weirded out? Lol.”

(I fucking hate lol so godamn much)

“Well I’m still wondering if you wanna go out?”

(And she changes the fucking subject to how she spilled her coffee on herself while she was driving earlier) 

So reddit people it’s been about twelve hours since the whole “why would I be weirded out?” Thing transpired and I need some ideas here

610,"*UPDATE*

I have reported her to my boss and I have used the HARASSMENT word (she sent me 20+ messages after I told her I didn't feel the same way). Outcome of the report:

\- She is not allowed to come back to our tuition centre as she expressed feelings for me. It is complicated to move her to another tutor.

\-Her employer is our client. So, we have sent the harassment report to her employer and she has been terminated (her employer was probably worried that we might sue them); and

\- I have been given a verbal warning. As per our policy, I was supposed to inform my boss as soon as she expressed her feelings.

* Would this warning be disclosed on a reference?
* Also, how should I react if I see this student anywhere? She has lost her job and she has been expelled from the tuition centre, due to the number of messages and her feelings for me. She must be broken. Shall I just ignore her?

&amp;#x200B;

*ORIGINAL POST*

I am a tutor (32M) at a private tuition centre.

A female student, aged 22, messaged me saying that she was very attracted to me. I told her that I didn't feel the same way and that it was not appropriate. She replied saying that she was falling in love with me and that she has never felt this way, even though she has been in relationships before. She also said that she would like to know more about me if I change mind.

Later, she messaged me again saying that she was very stressed and that she was not able to forget me. She said that she wasn't mature enough and that her behavior was childish. She was asking help to forget me. I asked her to stop contacting me and to get help from her family/friends.

However, she kept messaging me saying that she is in love with me and that she was thinking of me all the time. She said that she would keep loving me, without expecting anything from me. I told her that her behavior was obsessive and that it was becoming disturbing for me. She apologized. She said that she loved me a lot and she will not contact me anymore.

She hasn't contacted me since then.

Now i don't use offline video players nowadays bc all the stuff is mostly online. This app was used by me months ago on a rather boring night to watch adult films. So basically everyone is sitting in front of the TV and my phone spectacularly autoplays the last viewed adult film on the TV. My uncle panicks and tries to cover the TV.  I panic to switch off my phone. Someone quickly switches off the TV. Now everyone mostly laughs it off saying its ok you're an adult now. My uncle starts teasing me about it.

615,"
So, to make a long story a little less long, I never knew my father growing up. My amazing mom got pregnant at 18, decided it was her burden to bear (and didn’t want a 20-something washed up junkie to be my father), and raised me with the utmost grace. She rocks. He reached out twice after I was born, but it not much more than a “Hey” or “What’s up”. Not much by means of wanting to be involved as a father, if you ask me. 

I never questioned his existence because I have multiple father-figures in my life, and never felt the need for a “Dad”. 
Recently, my mom and I got on the topic of genetics. Out of plain curiosity, I asked if she knew my fathers name, so I could look him up online to see what I inherited from him. (I’ve been on a huge ancestry.com binge recently) She gave me his name, and I looked him up on Facebook. I definitely, by looks, was his child. I decided to message him to let him know I existed (he knew I did which was confirmed by my mom) and he responded with overwhelming emotion. I guess I was a little excited too, because I agreed to meet him that week for coffee. That’s where all this mess begins.

Leading up to the coffee meet up, he texted me incessantly. I figured he was just excited as well as a 40-something year old man that didn’t quite understand the courtesies or texting yet. 
We meet at the coffee shop, where he orders beer. No worries, a little weird considering it’s still fairly early in the day, but whatever. He’s also really, really dressed up and doused in cologne. Almost like he was getting ready for a date. I chalked it up to wanting to put his best foot forward. He tells me how successful he is as a DJ and how his band (which is currently on “hiatus”) is really well known and plays everywhere. Cool, okay, I’m in school for music! I try to talk about this but he doesn’t give me a chance to speak about myself. Whatever, maybe he’s nervous or something.
This behavior goes on all night, as he drags me to different bars where he gets increasingly inebriated. He keeps buying me drinks without asking me and making me feel uncomfortable about not drinking. As we’re (mainly him) drinking, he begins to tell me about 

1. How he once pulled a Government Wire (???) out of his scalp, but it disintegrated before anyone else could see it.
2. He saw Satan and his house turned upside down, all while Satan was inside it. 
3. He made a microwave explode by staring at it really hard. 

These were the most memorable “stories”. I finally convinced him to stop and to let me drive back to my car. He wouldn’t let me drive, insisting he wasn’t drunk (he was) and we got back to my car. Finally. He seemed to take a lot of “accidental” wrong turns and wouldn’t let me use GPS to help him. 

I really didn’t plan on going back out with him. He just wouldn’t stop texting me, though. He informed me I was his second child, and that the mother of the first one “also ran off with the baby”. 
This was a major red flag, but also made me feel seriously guilty. How could I ignore him and put him through all this again? So, I agreed to go back out with him as long as my fiancé was there with me. He took us to an empty bar he was “playing” at. I guess for him, “playing” means setting an iPod on shuffle at his DJ table and drinking/smoking for hours, non stop. I felt a little less uncomfortable with him, until his mom showed up. He was rude to her, making snarky comments at her, to which he remarked “it’s just how we are”. She didn’t seem to agree. 
We left, and I didn’t want to see him again. At all. 
He continues to text me all day, everyday. I start ignoring him. He informed me that he had made several social media accounts *years ago* to, quote, “keep tabs on me”. He says he used inconspicuous names so I didn’t “notice anything.”
I immediately put all my accounts on private and search for any weird people or names that I don’t know, and block them. He doesn’t say anything, but notices that I have him
soft-blocked on Facebook. I just say that it’s probably a bug. 

He seems to get the hint that I don’t want him involved as much, and stops texting as often. Then, just this week, he hits me with tons of messages. Every hour. I have to mute his notifications. Random pictures of himself, of cringe-facebook posts (he posts a **LOT** of anti LGBT, knowing I’m bi, and extreme right wing politics. He also likes to over share and get into wild arguments with others online), and messages complaining about how broke he is. 
Today he sent me a “dream” he had: he dreamed about a mutilated cat, and while he was messing with the cat, I called him to insult him and tell him I didn’t want him involved. 

I honestly do want to tell him that I don’t want him involved. I’m worried about the repercussions of doing so, though. I’m worried he’ll go off the deep end or will try to retaliate somehow. The guilt of cutting him off is already eating me inside and I haven’t even done it yet. 
What do I do? How do I deal with this? I’m stressed out beyond belief and feel like I’m losing my mind. Please help, and thank you for reading this far.",20Jun2019,5

618,"The whole situation is fucked up. There’s no proof to say he did it, but there’s also no solid proof he didn’t do it. It’s all based off of what he said/she said. I believe he didn’t do it. Maybe I’m biased, yes, but the girls accusing him made it too much of a game for it to be real. We’ll call the girls Alaina and Amanda to keep it less confusing, and we’ll call the man accused of this Jason. 

Basically, Alaina and Amanda got caught stealing alcohol from Jason’s house, my best friend’s house (we’ll call my friend Madelyn). Alaina and Amanda didn’t want to own up to the fact that they were stealing and drinking under age by their own choice, so they decided that they’d accuse Jason of giving them alcohol, and then touching them inappropriately. Madelyn’s older sister was with these girls during the night and the events that actually took place. None of the things that Alaina and Amanda are accusing Jason of was true. Alaina and Amanda were afraid to get caught drunk and high. So they thought, hey, let’s accuse Jason, Madelyn’s dad, of raping us that way we don’t get in trouble. Alaina and Amanda have a history of being snarks. 

Two years down the road, the trial was finally held. It was yesterday. It was the state against Jason. And now, Jason is in jail for something he didn’t do. For something no one will believe that he didn’t do. And now, Jason’s children and wife are left on their own. 

Jason has four daughters and a wife. The youngest is 8, the next 13-14, the next 17, and the last 19-20. Jason’s wife is going to have to support these children as well as the oldest child who lives with them but has a job. The two oldests have a job, but don’t get paid enough to support a family. 

Now, my best friend and her family are going through it. I don’t know what to do. I’m 17 and I don’t have a job. I don’t know how I can help them. It breaks my heart to see them like this. Madelyn won’t text me back or call me and I don’t blame her. She’s in a bad place right now. But fuck, man. What can I do to help? I mean what is there to say or do? Words won’t change this. Anything I do isn’t going to change this. What the hell am I supposed to do? I wanna help. I wanna make things better but that’s not something I can do easily. I mean, what can I do?

620,"Throwaway account just to protect my fathers identity. This has a lot to do with religion, too.

Somewhat long read TLDR at bottom.

Also I’m on mobile so sorry for format blah blah blah let’s get into it.

About 9 months ago my father was living just any other regular life. He was always a bit of a conspiracy theorist but never anything too crazy. We are pretty religious, and belonged to a relatively small and somewhat infamous church. It wasn’t a cult, just ha a couple strange beliefs.

Around that times 9 months ago, they released a pamphlet, talking about the end times and all that. Although he never was too active in the church, he became very obsessed with that pamphlet and studied it all day for about a week, until he had reread everything multiple times. I didn’t think too much of it at the time, and didn’t really think twice about it  until things started getting strange.

During the week or two that he became obsessed with that pamphlet, he started to become very obsessed with the church and taking some of their past claims in which they have since denied very seriously. He simultaneously became very interested in the Bible and began reading it from beginning to end. Then, more suddenly than ever, within the course of about 3 days he dropped the religion entirely claiming stuff he had found in the Bible contradicted the church and that couldn’t possibly be true. The evidence was pretty convincing, and so I stopped going or really believing in the church too. What I found very odd was when he would show me the reasons found in the Bible, there would be underlines and marks and quotes and notes and stars and a lot of marks he has made with his pen regarding various verses and such, like he was very into, and it was very much unlike him.

His beliefs only grew stranger from here. He began spending all day in his closet obsessing over the Bible and started claiming he received direct revelation from god, he writes very odd and strange passages claiming god told him to write them. Later he started claiming the church he originally left was in fact true, but later corrupted, going from hating the founder and all its beliefs with a passion, saying it was the devils church.

He recently started reading the Quran or basically the Muslim bible. (For clarification were Christian) he now says there is much truth it the Quran and now believes that the Old Testament laws of the Bible should never have been abolished ( for those of you who don’t really know them, they’re pretty insane such as stoning a woman if she cheats and such). He claims there is very food evidence that Jesus was never the Christ and is even saying either he or one of us are likely going to be the real messiah. He claims he is one of the biggest prophets of god and making many other crazy claims.

Also another thing I forgot to mention is whenever he shows me anything in scripture to back his claims, to me and my siblings they make no sense and we interpret them entirely differently. He claims the whole Bible is in parables and that he through god has been revealed the truth behind the words in the Bible for the first time ever.

He sits in his closet all day everyday studying the Bible and whatnot. What’s even weirder is he still runs a regular life, even though way more reclusive now, minus the religious stuff you never would guess he’s crazy.

I don’t know what to say, he has to either be going crazy or something big is happening?!? Idk, I’m just so confused and need others take on the situation. 

TLDR; my father in recent months has started to make crazy claims such as him likely being the messiah, Jesus wasn’t, the end is super near, and him being the first event to be revealed the real truth behind the Bible.",20Jun2019,0
621,"So for some back story: My family is currently staying with my uncle and his kids come over a lot. He had two sets of twins and they are all 7 and 10 I believe. However they have a bad habit of lying on others, and not just petty white lies, like lies that could start fights. He believes every one of their lies too, which I understand because they are his kids but at the same time though it gets ridiculous. It’s gotten to the point where he installed cameras on us just to make sure we aren’t being mean or harming them just is stupid because we’re around them almost all the time and we actually love them a lot but he doesn’t trust us. For example yesterday I made a frozen pizza for us because it was lunch time and I figured we were all pretty hungry. My mom and my uncles girlfriend were out running errands so I was babysitting. They had ate a little before that but I still decided to share so I made a pizza and split it between all 4 of us and left for work. When I got back he went on this rant telling me me that nothing in the freezer is mine and I didn’t buy anything therefore I can’t have a pizza to myself. I was confused but then I figured out they told him that not only did I not share that I also didn’t make them something to eat for lunch before I left for work and basically let them starve. When I asked why they told him that they said it was because they basically just wanted more pizza and was hungry. I know it doesn’t sound like a big deal but keep in mind this isn’t the only time they’ve done something like this. They told my uncle that my brother has pulled a knife out on them when he was just using it to make him a sandwich, they’ve also told him that my sister broke one of their tablets when actually it was one of them who left it on the floor for their baby sister to get ahold of. And it couldn’t have been her because she was at a friends house when it broke. 

Sorry if it’s a bit long but I wanted to give as much information as I could and at this point I don’t know what to do anymore and I can’t just up and move due to financial issues. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thank you!",20Jun2019,0

624,"I’ve been in this job for about a month and learned a lot so far by the way they ‘work’. First off, there’s a lot of people that work there that don’t like each other, (even the manager complained that another manager doesn’t like her) and by what I saw yesterday, I wonder ‘why’. My manager decided to give us a piece of paper each, we each had to write a ‘constructive criticism’ for one person that was in the meeting, so we can all ‘improve’ . First of all, I’ll take criticism from my managers, not my co workers. And of course one guy put me on blast saying he feels I don’t listen to him. He’s not lying tho, your not my manager. Is this healthy for a job to do? I thought it was really unnecessary. I’ve never been through something like that. This other guy got 2 criticisms from 2 people and looked pissed.",20Jun2019,0
625,"My best friend (23) and I (23) have been friends for over 14 years now and lately I feel like our friendship has become one-sided. A quick background on her, she lives at home is dependant on her parents (bills, school paid for, etc), works with her parents and has a somewhat a princess-like syndrome. My little brother recently passed away this year so I've been quite distant. When he passed she just disappeared, luckily I have many other friends who supported me. When I was ready to talk to people again, I approached her and said sorry for my distance and explained I wasn't myself (and still not myself). She simply said it was okay and she didn't talk to me because ""she's never experienced what I was going through"". She also stated she also couldn't find room to spend time with me because I'm always with my boyfriend. I work two jobs to support myself, pay for school and I see my boyfriend ONCE a week if I'm lucky. He always initiates and pushes me to do things especially when I go through my isolation phases. She's always been jealous of my boyfriend because he is always super supportive and amazing. She always seems to dislike my boyfriends until she gets something out of it herself (she's never had a healthy relationship). She has never even asked me to hangout once in the past few months. Since my brother passed she asked me to go partying twice, which I turned down and she was bitter about. I was working a 14 hour shift and felt too tired to attend for I was working another 7+ hours the next morning, plus I feel weird hanging with dudes I don't know who pay for everything.  It has always been me initiating and suggesting things. I also treat her a lot of times as a nice gesture, but it's never returned. 

Before my brother passed away I was planning on a trip to Korea. It's been put off for two years because of school and family issues. My father gifted me a trip to Thailand because I was severely depressed and to spend time together. We have not spent time together in over 10 years, also the first trip i've taken in 20 years.. I invited her to come but she had school, so my boyfriend came with us. She was a little bitter about that so she has been pressuring me into committing into the Korea trip. I told her let me go on the family trip first, come back and make some money for tuition, bills, etc and we will see from there. When I came back it seemed to be every week her asking me ""how's the money situation?"" and my response is always the same. "" I will know a month before the planned trip time (September) but no promises, if I were you I'd still go without me."" Every week she tries to pressure and lie to me about flights or hotels/airbnb running out and I simply tell her I don't even have the money yet. It got so annoying I told her book it since shes planning on going with or without me, I even helped her book the plane tickets and AirBnb. Every week she aggressively asks me about the money situation, no hello how are you or any conversation for the matter. No support or motivation, and she ghosts me and ends the conversation when I give the same answer. 

One of my friends told me she's been tweeting about me saying ""she's tired of waiting on people"" ""hates broke people"" and even recently ""I actually hope to go on this trip alone"". I don't have twitter and I find it all incredibly insulting and childish. If you want to go alone why do you keep pestering me every week? I know deep down she wants me to go but it's still ridiculous. Unlike her, I am completely self reliant with no support from my family whatsoever. She has over 20k saved up since she pinches every dollar, everything is paid for by her parents and they continue to throw money her way (including for this trip). I love her but I don't deserve this disrespect and am really getting nothing positive out of this friendship anymore. I really do want to go on this trip but it just seems like she's going to be controlling about it. I understand I most likely have let her walk all over me previously all these years in our friendship because I'm so easy going. She's very stubborn, when faced with any conflict becomes aggressive and worsens it. I've recently started to stay neutral to unreasonable negative people and try not to let things bother me. I just don't have the time or energy to dwell. I've been keeping space because I've tried to reach out and reconnect with her but she's been nothing but hostile. Her mother recently fell sick and seems to not have much time left. I've been checking on her but besides that I'm finding we have nothing to really talk about anymore. I'm working double shifts at two different jobs on top of checking and helping take care of my father; I'm exhausted. So every time I get that text I feel deeply saddened and stressed. I know if I confronted her she would take it the wrong way, I don't want to end the friendship either. I've always offered her so much love and support but I don't even have enough for myself right now because I'm being spread thin. 

Sorry for the long post, I guess I also needed to rant hear the perspective and advice from a neutral stranger. How do you deal with friends that you love dearly that you feel you're out-growing or not at the same page anymore? Thanks for taking the time to read my post.",20Jun2019,0
626,"Hi there,

I started with my company 9 months ago basically as a junior PM at a software company within their professional services division. In March, my boss went MIA on medical leave + I have taken over much of her work.

Well, boss came back &amp; put in their notice. Since it is just us 2 on the PMO team, I was offered Manager of PMO and I will hire on someone else to takeover my initial job. 

Currently @ $71,500 - no direct reports, pretty much doing everything my boss does except revenue. In her absence, my workload has been crazy, and expected to continue til i hire help.
* My boss - older, more experienced... is at 125k.
* they offered me 80k for the promotion

They offered me a 11-12% pay increase, for the following reasons:
* I am a bit junior + will involve some investment from the company
* I won't be taking on all of my bosses activities *immediately* [not until I have someone hired &amp; ramped up will i take on month end/ finance items]
* I would get a good title bump [Mgr of PMO]
* they said it is hard to get any large pay bump -- I think this is why people typically switch companies though - once they know your base pay, they know any jump is better than none; moving companies you have more leverage.

Knowing my boss makes 125k and me currently doing 85% of the same work + will do 100% of the same work, i guess i was expecting more than 80k.  
Obviously i'm not expecting 125k like my boss had, but they are still saving money even if i got 100k.

What do you think?
Is this a fair offer? What should I do? I did mention I was expecting a little bit more, but needed to research market rates, etc. so I wasn't ready to give a number. 
FYI I am meeting again with them in a few hours - please advise!",20Jun2019,0

628,"I'm about to loose it so I need some advice. My father and his long term girlfriend CONSTANTLY brag about her kids to me. Mainly they brag about her daughter and son-in-law. The son in law is a back up goalie for an NHL team. Yes, I said back up goalie, but you'd think he was Wayne Gretzky. Every time I am out in public, they make a point to talk to strangers and within 5 min they're telling people about the son in law. But even when it's just us, they go on and on about how amazing he is, how rich they are, etc. Just yesterday I was with them and one of the comments was ""Well it's (daughters) birthday soon, I wonder if (son in law) will be buying her a new SUV like he did last year"". Or they'll talk about the daughter/son in laws 4 year old son and his most recent birthday party where they spent $8k and had 300+ people there and brag that it took the kid 6 hours to open all of his presents. (Don't even get me started on how bad of parenting this is!! Can you imagine how this four year old is going to be as an adult?!?But it's not his fault if this is the gluttony, entitlement and expectations he was raised with!)

I absolutely can not stand it. It has NOTHING to do with jealousy, as I'm financially comfortable but more importantly I know money doesn't buy happiness. It drives me crazy because I think it's so unbelievably off-putting and rude and it's embarrassing when they say this to strangers. I've NEVER been one that's been impressed by anyone even remotely famous, and I don't understand why people think it's a big deal if they meet someone or know someone famous. Does that somehow make them a better person? I honestly don't get it! What do they think I'm going to say ""Som in law is the next coming of Christ! And you guys are the most important people in the world because you know him!!"" 

Uh!!!!!! It's so stupid!!

Besides, I am FAR more impressed and would rather meet an amazing doctor that cured some disease. To me, its a MUCH MUCH bigger deal to meet someone that has contributed to society like that, than someone with athletic abilities. 

So my question for Reddit is, how do I get my family to understand how rude and obnoxious this is? I've had conversations with my Dad about this in the past (more about his girlfriends actions and less about how he's a contributor as well) and at the time he acts like he agrees with me. But then as soon as I see both of them, it's right back to the constant bragging. How can I discuss this with him/them and get them to understand how rude and obnoxious it is? Literally every person that knows them that I've talked to has mentioned this to me. So they act this way with everyone, and everyone thinks it's disgusting and people actively avoid being around them. How can I explain this to them in a nice way but yet one they will understand?

And secondly, help me understand exactly what it is about this kind of behavior (anyone that does this kind of thing, not just my family) that's so disgusting. I can never really explain to other people why exactly it bothers me so much. It's the same feeling I get when I meet a stranger and they brag about themselves. I think its that it screams selfishness to me, but I'd love to hear if anyone has any other psychological insights on it.

Thanks everyone. I'm trying to address this before I snap and freak the f out on them :)",20Jun2019,0

632,"I'm a computer science major going into my third year of college in the fall. I've taken mostly CS classes so far and just a few gen eds. I've been enjoying computing less, and I have the fear/concern that I would be happy with a job in the field. The thing is that I understand it really well (3.9 GPA), so I wonder if it would be a waste/shame if I didn't continue. I definitely don't hate it, but I'm really not passionate about it like I was at the start of college. My plan was to continue on to get a masters in CS.

I've been thinking about what else I could do. I've always liked to help people and talk about what's bothering them. It just feels good to give emotional support I guess. Also, I think that learning about why we think the way we do is really cool. So that's why I'm considering psychology. The thing is that if I did that, I'd probably want to go all the way and get a masters and even probably maybe a doctorate. I've done research, and it seems that's almost necessary for a high paying psychology job (around what I could get with a CS degree). However, I don't know if I'd wanna be like 27 and still in college (I'll be 21 soon for reference). On the other hand, I could find myself at that age with a software developing job (or whatever) and be miserable, or at least unhappy.

This would set me back financially too. I really don't want to have any debt, but I could probably get a job and maybe some more scholarships. I know money doesn't make happiness, but you need money to live and whatnot. I feel like not having money can cause unhappiness though. I'm trying to figure out if having a job you're not super passionate about (but can tolerate and pays the bills) is okay as long as you have other hobbies and passions to make you happy.",20Jun2019,0
633," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Since I'm college-aged, everytime I bring this up to a doctor, they feel that I'm bullshitting and trying to get a study drug or something similar to abuse.

646,"Here's some advice for highschool,college,jobs,and life in general.

1. Sort out clothes the night before.
So this is pretty simple. Set out some clothes you're going to wear tomorrow. This eliminates the stress of frantically looking for clothes an hour before your school/job.

2.Say no to alcohol,drugs,smoking.
Dear people under 21, please don't drink, that's illegal and you'll get caught eventually. Please don't smoke if you're under 18, again illegal. And DO NOT do drugs. That crap will mess you up. 
Don't do drugs,don't drink alcohol,and don't smoke. Cause it may not affect you now, but it will later.

3.Save money at every paycheck.
Saving money is very, very important. I'd recommend saving 50-100$ per paycheck. It won't be much now, but if you save money for a long time, it builds up. This money can be used for things like: retirement, natural disasters, and other important things in life.

4.Keep your room/apartment/house clean.
Keeping your living space clean is important for your health and mood. Want clean dishes? Wash them! Have fun while doing it! You can listen music while cleaning,it makes everything so much better.

5.Go outside as much as possible, and bring bug spray.
Have a park in the area? Then go hiking, fishing, picnicking. If the park has a lake or pond? Go swimming! Unless you're near the coast, then just... Go to the beach. Watch the wildlife,catch some frogs! Just make sure to put on sunscreen and bug spray. And go soak up some sun!

6.Always wear a condom.
Always,ALWAYS wear a condom during sex. Do you not want an STD? Wear a condom! Don't want to pay 150$ a week for 18 years? Wear a condom! Condoms save money, and save your life. Always wear them unless
You know the person does not have a STD.

648,"Obviously nobody is a doctor but I am really baffled by what is happening to me and just wanted to get opinions/similar experiences.

Last Friday I woke up feeling nauseous and ended up having to leave work and threw up all over my apartment. I was (and still am) pretty sure it was food poisoning caused by a disgusting meat I ate Thursday night. The next morning the nausea was mostly gone but I had diarrhea about 60+ times Saturday and into Sunday. Then suddenly Monday and Tuesday I was randomly seeming constipated (like 1 really hard bowel movement) so I figured at least the food poisoning was over. Suddenly Wednesday (yesterday) I woke up and had diarrhea 6-8 times and had to cancel work for the day. I went to urgent care and they gave me antibiotics which I am now on. Anyways it’s now Thursday morning. Last night I became constipated again then this morning I woke up and had diarrhea.

I am wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything like this and what it could possibly be. I don’t get why it keeps switching between constipation and diarrhea and I haven’t felt too nauseous since the initial outburst last Friday. Just generally funky and fatigued (dehydrated from diarrhea doesn’t help). Can food poisoning last this long? I’m pretty sure the initial episode was food poisoning but now I’m wondering if something else has happened to my stomach. Hopefully the antibiotics work but I have my doubts since it’s already been this long.

Edit: also to the best of my knowledge I never had a fever and haven’t necessarily felt “sick” except for the extreme nausea on the first day so I don’t think it’s stomach flu.",20Jun2019,0

651,"I’ve been staying at an Airbnb and it hasn’t been going well. My host has been cleaning my room randomly, and I was getting uncomfortable with her touching my dirty clothes. 

I can admit that I am messy, but I don’t think that it is appropriate for her to go through my dirty clothes. 

When I say messy, I have only ACCIDENTALLY done 2 things that could possibly damage her property. I left closed makeup on the bed during the day, and she thought I was sleeping with the makeup in the bed and got upset. So I don’t see that as damaging as I moved it before I slept and only left it on the bed CLOSED during the day. 

I also left a wet towel on the bed because I used it to keep my pillow from getting wet with soaking wet hair. I see how that could have damaged the mattress, however my host later admitted that there is a plastic cover on the bed to protect from this. She also cited the fact that I left closed water bottles on the bed during the day which I think is BS because they’re closed and untouched.

Things that she also listed as possibly ruining her property:
1) me leaving “wet and bacteria filled clothes” on the floor because it will make her carpet smell. While I understand that in terms of underwear, I work 7-5 at a desk and only leave clothes on the floor if they are still fairly clean. They have never even smelled. I don’t sweat often seeing as I sit at a desk.
2) me shaking salt over food because some salt bounces and gets on the counter. I need to now shake salt over the sink.
3) leaving “a few crumbs” on two separate counters. I don’t even understand how she can tell whose crumbs are whose.
4) leaving water bottles on the bed while I’m at work (they are closed)

Instead of telling me these things she has just been criticizing me and cleaning up. I told her I don’t feel comfortable going into my room and she told me all of these problems with me. She told me that i am too messy and if I ever work in a corporate job this wouldn’t fly. 
1) she is a self employed artist that has never worked a structured day in her life and has never had a “corporate level” job.
2) I am studying to be a computer engineer and have an internship where I am very obviously not close to the messiest person here. News flash, in my line of work no one really cares what kind of “mess” you have, and it’s hard to make a mess at work anyways. I can’t have food or open drinks by computers anyways. When I work in labs I have to follow conduct so I don’t make a mess anyways.

So she 1) hasn’t been communicating her problems 2) has been criticizing me instead 3) has been encroaching on my privacy WHEN SHE SAID ORIGINALLY THAY SHED NEVER NEED TO GO INTO MY ROOM AND WOULDNT GO IN!!!!!! 4) told me she’s never needed a dirty clothes hamper for guests but bought one for me and is upset when I don’t use it. 

How can I even talk to her? She’s so convinced of her own ways and I think that 90% of this is completely bogus. She’s rude to me and I’m pissed",20Jun2019,0

One is someone I've been close friends with since we were babies, another is someone I've been close friends with for about 11 years now, and another for about 7 years. I have one other friend who I've been friends with for about 3-4 years. So that's 4. I have other people I'm friendly with, and would consider a  friend, but who I don't really talk to a whole lot. Even with  my closest friends, sometimes we will go awhile without seeing each other or talking but the bond is always there.  
I am really close to my family, and to my fiancé's family as well. 

It used to really bother me that I didn't have more friends, but now I just really appreciate the friends I do have. They're not perfect, but neither am I, and they're loyal and they're like family to me.

655,"So my bud and I work together and he lives about 10 min down the street. Sometimes during lunch, we go to his apartment and watch TV, play yugioh or chill. 

While we are there be might pop out some blueberries or throw me a cheesestick. Small snacks. Handful of berries or a couple of cheesesticks a week. His girlfriend isn't a big fan of our friendship mainly because we were single together,  he and I and we would go out and enjoy the single life. She thinks I'm a bad influence. Long story short, she came home one day and there were no cheese sticks. She asked him and he told her we occasionally have some and they he might throw me one every once in a while. She gets mad and tells him to tell me that if I  want to eat at their place, I need to chip in for groceries. I was shocked and upset. 


This is a guy who I've known since we were 7. I've done him tons of favors and he's done me plenty as well. We've never been that way with food and as a Mexican, my mom taught me that you never deny anyone food let alone a friend. We argued and he took her side saying that we are there often so even if it's just a snack or 2 it adds up. I retorted saying that it's a negligible amount of food, I don't eat meals and I only eat whatever he decides to toss at me as I'm sitting on the couch. I also stated that since its food, he shouldn't be meticulous with it. I would never tell him the same if the situations were reversed. I literally calculated the amount of food I was eating and it amounted to about 0.72 cents a week. I never just raided his fridge and cooked myself a meal or anything like that. Just snacks he'd toss at me without me asking.

661,"There are a lot of comments I’m seeing from men online that women past 30 have “hit the wall” ad they’re past the wall and no longer worth a serious relationship, apparently past that age they’re only worth a hit and quit.

How prevalant is this really with most men?

If my only chance of getting married is within the next year or maybe 2 years before I get too old for marriage then I think I’d settle down now. But it feels rushed and like I’m not ready, I’d just be getting married so that I don’t miss out on ever getting married.",20Jun2019,1

663,"20F, $15 an hour job. I would like to get my own place, maybe rent an apartment with a friend, be nearer to my job. My parents won’t let me, claiming that God wouldn’t want me to leave the covering of my father until I’m married. I would like to get married, but not just as a way to get out of the house! My bf and I most likely won’t get married until he’s out of college. He is home from college for the summer, and my parents are barely letting me see him. They said he can come to our house on Saturdays and do things with us if it’s a group setting. This is not really working out for him, since his work schedule is all over the place. When we asked them if we could be more flexible, they said, “It’s better than nothing, isn’t it?” Which is a nice way of saying, “Do it our way or we’ll keep you from seeing each other at all.” Little things like that are adding up: 100% of my time and location is controlled, I have to pay them rent (not much, but I think it’s odd to do that if I don’t also have the option to pay rent somewhere else), and my dad and I have always had a rough time getting along. I believe our relationship would be much healthier if we didn’t live together.

Ok, here are the cons: I would be leaving my little brother behind, so all the pressure at home that we used to share would all be piled onto him. My whole extended family would probably disown me for dissing my parents like that. (They know my dad is controlling, but I can just imagine the gossip getting out of hand.)

665,"So I moved into my apartment several months ago and my upstairs neighbors are loud. Part of it is that it's an old building with thin walls, and part of it is that they are just plain loud. 

I complained to management twice but politely. I said they are pretty loud but I don't want them to get in trouble or anything, I just want them to be informed that it is frustrating and I can hear all of it. 

Loud bass bumping, yelling, general loud noises. During the day and past quiet hours. 

Nothing came of either complaint and over the past couple of weeks they have been playing loud, bumping ""house music"" more and more often. 

I'm would get so frustrated that I would stand on the bed and knock on the ceiling with a book loud enough for them to hear. Not very polite I know, but I was hoping that it would make them tone it down without an actual confrontation.

Well anyway I get a call from managment saying that my upstairs neighbors called them because I'm banging on the ceiling and that I shouldn't be doing that and I should handle it with my neighbors or them.

I'm so embarrassed I could feel my face get red. I know it wasn't the best way to go about it I just thought it would help... 

I'm not even that mad about the neighbor loudness or anything I'm just super embarrassed of my behaviour and that the management guy (who is like my age) just had to call and scold me for acting like a kid. I have to see this dude to pay rent and I could tell that I'm already not super well liked.

M didn’t like that I talked to him and I didn’t so she got connected with him.

The next night was his last night there and we texted the whole night and it was great, we texted often then. I could tell that it was going bad because he kept asking me out and I kept saying that I was really in love with my boyfriend and didn’t want that, later on a few months after I met him we started to go out (after me and my bf broke up) and the whole time we were going out (23 hours lmaoo) he just kept asking and asking for my ass pictures and stuff like that but I kept saying no, he kept trying to guilt me by saying things like “I’m going out with you and all you do is send me this?” Well he broke up with me really quickly because ‘he loved me at first but when I sent him pictures he just didn’t feel the love’ is how he put it; I added him in June last year and he had found a girlfriend, that same night I said I still really liked him and wish he respected me to M, but she told him and he ghosted me so I just unadded him and went on.

675,"I hired a dog sitter in Virginia off of a site that connects dog owners to sitters. I needed someone who could stay with my dog the whole time I was on vacation in my house. My dog is a rescue and has severe separation anxiety and has finally been making progress on not panicking and destroying things. 

I met with several people and ended up with a girl who could stay the whole weekend but then have to go to work Monday and come back after. She also agreed to be available to stay Monday night in case of any emergency. I will add that I trusted her because she was in the military before and still did work in that branch of the military.

Ok so everything seemed ok while I was gone. Then as I was driving 11 hours home, I hit multiple wrecks and a horrible storm that had traffic at a crawl for hours. It kept pushing back the time I would get home so I let her know and said I would pay for the extra day. 

She then informs me that she now can't stay and has made other plans and has to leave before I get home. I remind her she agreed and she says she knows she did but doesn't consider this an emergency and can't stay past 12. I tell her that I need her to stay but can't stop her from leaving and tell her what to do with the keys when she goes. I go to tell her something else about 20min later (10pm at this point) and she says she already left ""because I told her to"". After a bit of argument she says she went back and will leave at 12.

After getting home I find out from neighbors that she did NOT stay for the weekend and was only in and out. They also have a video camera that shows when cars come and go. She also did not give my dog all of her medication. My walls and the dog gate are chewed to hell and she hid the wood pieces in the trash and lied about it.

I confront her about everything and she will only admit to going to the store for tampons once(there were all feminine products in both bathrooms) and not telling me. Also says it wasn't my business. She said you can't expect someone to work for so cheap. Then she threatened to sue me if I don't pay her what she charged as well as the extra I told her I would give her. She never asked for more than $75, but I said that I did not feel like that was enough for staying the whole weekend without leaving. I told her I was going to pay her more than her rate for that. I also offered to buy food and drinks for her stay, but she declined.

Now I feel that I should just pay her the $75 because even though she did not do what we agreed on, she did something and my dog is alive so I should probably just be grateful for that. Lesson learned not to trust someone just because they are working for the military. My husband thinks we should not pay her at all for not adhering to our agreement in multiple ways and causing our dog to lose all the progress we made with her separation anxiety..because she has.

A customer called in recently and during the call she announced the rep made her feel uncomfortable. She said he’d tried to kiss/hug her and every time he visits says things like “give us a cuddle” and she really doesn’t like it.

Now, it’s not unusual for reps to visit several times, as sometimes customers need help with the products after. And some reps even make good friends with our customers and just pop round for tea/coffee on occasion (when invited of course).

She is a single lady. He is 50-60 whilst she is about 70-80. From the conversation I would say they have met as least three times. But she made it clear she never wants to see him again.

I am just a customer service advisor. I take the calls and help as much as I can. Instead of going to the rep’s manager, I went to MY manager. I didn’t want to tell somebody who’s probably good friends with the rep. My manager asked me to write it all down for him and he would listen to the call himself.

The first thing I said to him was that I want him to take what I’m about to say seriously, and that just because she’s elderly it doesn’t make it less serious and he agreed.

Now... it’s basically in my manager’s hands. But I want to make sure the right thing is done here. I’m going to chase him up tomorrow and find out what is happening. However, I’m unsure what is a suitable response.

There have been occasions in the past where customers’ families have informed us their elderly relatives often accuse people of such behaviour. We speak to many people with dementia who are confused about what is happening.

But I’d hate to think this rep really is making elderly women feel uncomfortable and all I did was pass it on and forgot about it. What do you think my manager/company should do from here? I want to make sure I fight for the right outcome.",20Jun2019,1

678,"I thought when she moved out of her old house about a year ago to a ""fixer upper"" trailer this problem would go away. But when she moved we realized the place was decrepit. It sits on a piece of land that the landlord fit 3 other trailers on like sardines.  The rent was cheap but everything about it was sketchy and it only moved downhill from there.

I had been out of state at the time for a funeral and didn't get to really look at the place before she moved. But she had assured me the owner kept the rent cheap and would love for us to do work on it with the money they took off the rent. Now a year later they're in a legal battle, and she needs to move. I just feel so lost about what she could do. She lives paycheck to paycheck, and I've maxed out what I could to help her when things fell apart at the trailer. I just finished school and still am job searching so it has been hard to help my mom and maintain my own apartment. She is a Veteran and I know they have some aid programs so I've been looking at those. Other than that I feel like I'm chasing my tail. 

Anyone's insight into my problem or advice would be greatly appreciated",20Jun2019,1
680,"Hi, so first I'll do a little background

Edit: we've been together 3 years

At the beginning of my[20f] relationship my bf[21m] made the rule that he wouldnt talk to any girls if I didnt talk to boys (I know) and i was like okay cool 

Well throughout our relationship we've had minor problems with him and girls (never physically cheating or anything but still not good) despite him being the one that made our rule to begin with 

Fast forward to now and things have been going really well and we havent had any issues with him and other girls. Well, today he randomly told me someone invited him to this God club thing (hes super religious) and I was like ""oh okay who?"" And he said this girl (our age) that he met on the bus invited him and he took her number and made plans with her a few days ago, but he just told me about it right before he was suppose to go

I told him I was really upset that he took another girls phone number and made plans with her behind my back. He thinks its justified because I know NOW and because it's for something God related. I personally dont think that makes it right. 

He said he knew I'd be upset and thats why he kept it from me, so I was like, ""okay if you knew I would be upset dont you think you shouldn't do it in the first place??""

I told him if he would've messaged me when she first asked him to go and explained everything to me I would've been fine with it bc he was open and took my feelings into consideration but I'm upset bc it happened behind my back. 

We got into a big fight over this because I asked him not to go and he said I was being controlling and trying to ""act like his gate keeper"" he told me he has zero romantic interest in her and is literally going only for God BUT hes not understanding that I'm not worried he'll cheat I'm UPSET that he HID taking a girls number and making plans with her behind my back

He turned it on me saying that I'm being controlling and HE wouldnt do this to me and tried to make me feel guilty for my feelings and basically said "" I'm sorry I didnt tell you, but I'm not sorry that I'm going,"" then said ""I'm going and that's final if you dont like it you dont have to stay with me""

I'm really hurt by all of this and dont know what to do. I dont care of he has girl friends or anything I was just upset it was hid from me, then he turned it on me and basically told me to get over it or break up with him THEN still went. 

I'm sorry this is so long I'm just in shock about all of this 

Did I overreact?? I feel guilty now after the fight but I feel like that's exactly what he wanted to happen so he could do what he wants 

Tldr; 

My boyfriend took a girls number and made plans with her without telling me then when I was upset about it he fought with me, turned it on me, then told me hes going and if I dont like it to break up with me",20Jun2019,0
681,"Hey guys, I’ve never really talked about this with anybody else because it’s so hard to. I don’t know how to start this off so I’ll just try to get straight into it. I’ve a had a problem since I was a little child. I would simply watch a tv show, movie or see somebody in real life, (celebrity or not) and begin imitating them. To their clothes, to their personality and mannerisms, I would try to claim it as mine. This trails to characters such as superhero alter egos (Peter Parker, Tony Stark etc.) all the way to characters from shows like the walking dead or riverdale, to charismatic characters of any kind of media. If I find a character interesting in terms of personality I would do everything in my power to act like them and dress. I’ve been doing this for my WHOLE life as I remember and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t know who the hell I am. I can’t sit in the mirror and tell you my personality, barely. And I have trouble interacting with people. So I go to the media, consume it and act like somebody I’m not. I couldn’t talk to my family about this, so I figured I’d go to the redditors.

I guess I still have to play the waiting game?

 I emailed the man I interviewed with at TruGreen yesterday very early (between 7 and 9 am) because their was a deadline for my drug test/physical, so I informed him I had taken the tests and attached a scan of the medical records and the DoT License I received from the medical office I visited as evidence. No response. HireRight’s website had not been updated with my report at the time I sent the email.

I don’t know, I’m just really stressed about this. I’m broke as fuck, my roommate is a prick, my family isn’t helpful, and rent is due in two weeks.  I got a job with Amazon as a fallback but that doesn’t start until July 3rd, and y’all know how pay cycles go. I feel like I’m going to be living in my janky car if the roommate really wants to be petty about me being unable to pay $450 in rent and break the lease that has both of our names on it. 

I just have to wait, right? I don’t think the company has opened the report yet, but I want to email the interviewer for verification but I’m paranoid they’re ignoring me because they decided to not go with me for whatever reason (contingent offer of employment letter says “Nothing in this document serves to limit or alter the right to terminate at-will.”). I also DON’T want to email him because I don’t want to come off as annoying.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, seriously. I’m stressed the fuck out over here, actually went to the hospital because of the stress manifesting itself as intense migraines (all stress related they said, thank God).

I’d be willing to email someone the report .pdf so I can have a second pair of eyes go over it, if need be. Honestly don’t even know if this is the most appropriate subreddit.

686,"The title says it all. I have a therapist who encouraged me to start journaling and I kind of avoided it for a while, but then I gave it a shot and got into it. It started off as poetry and then evolved into a bunch of different things. I’ve written a personal letter to someone who treated me wrong and I explicitly went into detail about what happened, I write things down to mention in therapy, and I just write about my days, including things that make me frustrated or things that make me happy and many names are included. I work at the library and all of a sudden we got slammed with returns and checking out. When my time working the circ desk was over, I couldn’t find my journal and I think I might have accidentally put it in a stack of books when checking someone out. I have shit in there that is deeply personal and some of it my therapist doesn’t even know. This was my first time being extremely vulnerable and honest and now this shit happens. What if someone has it and they never realize it and it’s just with them forever? What if they dropped it in the parking lot and someone picked it up and has it? If someone found a journal within a stack of books they checked out at the library, do you think they’d make the connection that it came from the library? What if they’re reading it? What if they return it and tell someone about what’s written in there? What if they return it and one of my coworkers reads through it? (They’re all super sweet and I can’t imagine them doing that, but I’m still petrified) What if they read through it and for some fucked up reason they keep it? I don’t know which of these possibilities is the worst. My name isn’t in it but if they know it’s from the library there are only 13 of us and they can probably remember who checked them out. I’m just so uncomfortable with my journal being gone, possibly read, and possibly never returned. I just want it back and unread. This is going to make me so anxious and I haven’t had an urge to self-harm this badly for so long. I’m 556 days clean and I’m still thinking about this shit. Fuck fuck fuck.

So I ordered some books and I am ready to start learning, but when I even think about sitting down and studying I feel like I am gonna throw up, and my first thought is ""I can't do this"".

I’ve always wanted to try it out but where I lived before meant driving a fair way to any clubs, so having one down the road was awesome!

Then my grandad fell down stairs and the next few months were caring for him until he recovered. I did email the club and explain this, apologising and saying I’d be in touch.

Emailed them at the weekend and heard back from the same instructor saying they are themselves taking time out from the club due to personal reasons but copied in two other members to see if I can rejoin at the moment, which I thought was really nice.

I've been going through school while owning a media production company with my significant other.

Three big things has been kind of hard to manage. I'm tired all the time but I feel like I'm not doing anything.

Currently we film corporate videos and smaller music videos and basically any job we can get but we'd like to make documentaries and film. The whole situation feels very hopeless and we've already invested over 15k in equipment, business licenses, etc. But we're hardly making money from this because we've had to focus on school and our other jobs.

We need money to pay bills but I don't feel like I could quit school and not have a college degree. (That business knowledge seems helpful.) It's to the point where I don't even like thinking about media work sometimes and I just want to quit. We're just shelling out money for no return. It used to be my passion but lately it just seems like a daunting task. Not everybody can be a successful director and I feel like giving up.

My mother is also a complete cunt who is self-centred, controlling and believes she’s right in every situation.
My sister and cousins have molested me on numerous occasions so I split myself from outside my immediate family - nobody aside from the ones who did it know of what happened.
I was raped and molested in 2017 on two different occasions by an ex in an act of revenge for not being with him; not to mention I was manipulated at a constant and forced into other sexual acts with added emotional abuse at the two occasions I was speaking to him.
I am medically diagnosed with severe depression and schizoaffective disorder (look it up, hardly anybody knows of it) and due to my age my doctors think my hallucinations and etc are due to my ‘anxiety’ and it’s just a ‘teenager thing’.
I also have an awful case of emetephobia and it is slowly ruining my life.
/I want advice on how to continue living./ I don’t know how I can keep going on. I keep dissociating at a constant and even my boyfriend seems fed up of me being afraid of certain stuff due to my paranoia or emetophobia. I can’t keep living in fear. The only hobby I had was drawing, I brought a drawing tablet and all for it but I can’t find the motivation to keep drawing since I’m such a perfectionist that every drawing isn’t perfect enough for me to finish. Now I’ve finished school I have nothing to do and all I do is lay in bed and do absolutely nothing.
So, I made an account to ask for advice on how to keep going, how can I stay motivated? Because I don’t honestly think I can live on, they won’t hospitalise me again and I’m on the edge of suicide. My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me here and I can’t even believe he’s real sometimes and/or if he even wants me. So please, convince me that life is worth it because nobody is willing to help me out anymore.
I’ve got no friends/family that I can turn to and this is a cry for help.
Give me something that’ll motivate me, I beg of you because I have a planned suicide and if I keep in this slump I don’t think I can continue on and I don’t want to try and kill myself again because my past attempts I was “lucky” to get out of.
Please, Reddit.
I need somebody or something.
Thankyou",20Jun2019,1
711,"Hi. I’ve had a close friend group ever since I was in elementary school and I’m in college now. One of my close friends has been my friend for 12 years now.

In 2014 my mom died from cancer. It was so hard and I saw her deteriorate and I saw her dead body in her room and held her hand. 

At 13, I was very numb from it all until 15 I was sucked into a very manipulative, controlling relationship. I was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted. 

All the while my family was in shambles and everyone dealing with different mental illness.

I had such horrible PTSD after that relationship and it made me feel so crazy. I was hospitalized and for two years dealt with PTSD. I could barely get to school and I got into an awesome college and had to come home from there as well. Life has just been tough.

I finally found a great and knowledgeable therapist and a support group, and I’m now on medication. Since then, my relationships have changed a lot. I have changed a lot.

Now that I’m feeling so much better, I just totally feel like my friends don’t really get me or understand it. I mean obviously they haven’t been through it, but my friend who has been my friend for 12 years has been really judgemental and not understanding about my life right now. And I’m not sure what to do. 

PTSD makes you act in weird ways. Anyone with PTSD knows how frustrating this is, but being able to do certain things and being weirdly emotional and messing stuff up. But now I’m just not sure how to handle things.

It’s sad and my friend and I got into a fight because she’s just not understanding and is ignoring me. We have a friend group of 4 girls and hang out but I feel like I’m not sure how much I relate to them sometimes.

Anyone with PTSD also have trouble with this? Or trauma? My life has changed so much that even my interests are different.",20Jun2019,1
712,"The last couple of years I’ve been feeling like this more and more and I have periods of self loathing where I just feel lost but these feelings have been becoming more and more frequent especially over the last few months.

Long story short, I feel like I’ve done nothing with my life and with every second that goes by I feel like I’m wasting it. I’ve done so little I’m actually embarrassed to tell people about myself because I know it looks odd or would just make me come across boring. I live at home with my parents, who are very supportive so my home life is generally fine but I have no friends (cut my high school friends off as they were toxic and I couldn’t handle how shitty they made me feel and I haven’t made any solid friends since then through trust and not opening up, I just have acquaintances through work - even then we only really talk about work and menial things.

I don’t have a boyfriend and have never had one - mainly as I don’t socialise or open up to anyone, and I don’t go out to meet anyone as I have no friends to go with and I’m not the sort of person to go by myself. 

I hate the job I’m in and will be handing in my notice in the next few weeks anyway as it is making me ill (I suffer from GAD and the company is introducing new things which are making the job impossible for me to do), I don’t have a backup plan and I’m not sure of what to do next but staying is not an option. I already feel like a bum and I haven’t even left yet. I’m looking for other work already but I don’t even know what I really want so it feels like I’m just trying anything to avoid the feeling of being a layabout.

I just feel like in the last 22 years I’ve achieved nothing, all I want is to be in a happy relationship, have a job that I can tolerate, I just want to know where I’m going. I just want to be happy. I’m worrying about it constantly, going over and over all of this stuff in my head and cry myself to sleep, waking up in the night with headaches after having dreams about dying alone. I don’t know what to do. I feel stuck and like I’m in a constant cycle of misery and I don’t know how to even begin to get myself out of it.",20Jun2019,1
713,"Me and my ex boyfriend broke up last year in February and it ended pretty badly. We dated for a year and 4 months. Those last 4 months became pretty toxic due to his mental illnesses and continuous shitty actions. Let’s just put it like this, he became too toxic and I couldn’t bring myself to leave him. He broke up with me and I was completely heartbroken for a long time. He would try to get me back but I would deny him because I was so hurt by what he’d done. (There was a lot but too much to explain) Now in March, we started speaking again because I missed him and he missed me, but it felt kind of weird. I just felt like I was doing something wrong so I cut it off after two weeks. I was thinking about how dumb I’d look if I went back to him. Anyway, so now last week I was sad and looked at a picture of him. For the past week I can’t get him out of my head and how much I miss him. But then again I don’t miss him because of the shitty stuff??? Idk my emotions are al over the place and I’m not sure what to do.

About a couple months ago her homophobic mom found out about us and since then it hasn’t been the same. She has this image of me as a horrible person who influences her daughter.

716,"I pulled 4 years in the marines. After 4 years I sacrificed my career to take care of my MIL as she is not able to work. We were living with her and my sister in law splitting bills while this was going on I cosigned on an apartment for my brother in law (who I had previously believed to be trustworthy) who promptly trashed his apartment and ended getting both his and my credit with a 1300$ collections and that rapidly dropped my credit score. Shortly after my SIL moved out and after we left we started noticing that we were getting delinquent notices  in the mail from the bills she was in charge o(all of which were in MILs name). I tried my damndest to get ahead of it all but it all fell through and MIL moved in with her dad. I  tried several different apartments but was denied everytime due to my now low credit score. The only option we had was for my wife and kid to move in with her aunt 2 hours away and for my to move in with my uncle and start working on my credit. 
1 year later I paid off 1300$ credit to up my score and when it went up I realized we had a score high enough to get a VA loan. So I started that process and ended up dropping God knows how much money on various inspections for the house we decided on after being told by the loan company we could get it. 3 Fucking days before closing I get a phone call from the loan guy saying that the VA changed their requirement and unless I could get the paid off collections and an unpaid one from almost 6 years ago deleted from my credit score I was going to have to wait until the newest one was a year old to be eligible for the loan. I called both debt collectors and had absolutely no luck getting either one deleted. Now I am fucking broke I emptied what little I had been able to accrue into our savings to pay off the collections and for the house well and septic inspections and now I have the credit score for an apartment but no money for first and last. When I told my wife I couldn't stop either yelling or crying. I don't know what to do. After working for so long and not being able to see my family but on the weekends for so long just to have the apple dangled inches away from my face just to be ripped away.

720,I have been living with my best friend the past year in a condo that I own. He has his own bedroom and bathroom. We get along really well. He never signed a lease and I've never had problems with him paying rent. In August my girlfriend will be visiting for 3 months. She will be staying in my room and using my bathroom. I was thinking that I might lower my friend's rent temporarily to deal with the inconvenience of having a guest for three months but it's not really an inconvenience. She will be using the living room and kitchen but is very tidy and respectful. At the same time I think it might be worth telling him I'm reducing rent 100 bucks for the next few months just to assuage any potential awkwardness.

When I met with my public defender the first the he told me, was that all the city really wants is $$$, that's it. 

**Short version**: I did my 3 days of jail(orig.10 days), paid my fines for awhile w no job..received a warrant, got caught a year ago and have only gotten it down to $2,000. I originally got it down to about $2300, but my jail time of 4 days knocked it back up to 2700+. Now, it is currently at $2000, and I asked the judge about comm service and she said they don't do that(what is that about?). 

The small town I live only has government/corrections work, and all require a license. Mine is suspended, but the DMV told me I wasn't blocked from getting it back with a year of interlock device(no car), so I am trying my best on that part. But.. my job is seasonal and all the winter travelers have left, rite now I am struggling more than I was before because, you know, life.. 

Please can anyone recommend anything for me to help take care of all this, so I can move on and grow the fuck up a little.

722,"Three years ago I was raped by my middle school friend after meeting up with him again for the first time in a year. (I changed schools and got back in touch with him through a mutual friend). I don't want to go into what happened, but after it happened, I experienced the aftermath. I now suffer from severe PTSD which is often triggered by anything sexual. It's uncomfortable to admit, but I can become violent and have breakdowns. Sometimes I relive the entire experience. A year later I met my current boyfriend, and we've been together for almost two years. In the beginning of our relationship we were intimate like a normal couple. I trusted him and felt safe with him, and knew he was the person I wanted to have my first safe intimate experience with. But about six months ago we stopped. My rapist contacted me in December and restarted a vicious cycle that I thought I had recovered from. I haven't been able to have sex with my boyfriend in six months. When I said I wasn't comfortable having sex anymore, he was very supportive and understanding, and still is. But over the past few months, we've both been very unhappy and we've been having a lot of issues. Most of it stems from the fact that I have a lot of trouble being affectionate. It's starting to tear apart our relationship, and I'm afraid I'm going to lose him if I can't fix myself. I'm comfortable with him instigating the affection, because I've been able to heal myself in the way that I remind myself that I'm safe with him. However, I haven't been able to heal in a way that I'm able to instigate the affection. I've found a coping skill that allows him to be physical with me, but I haven't been able to find a way to be comfortable with being physical twords him. This is destroying my relationship, and I just need to find a way to recover. I don't know what advice anyone can offer, but I really need help right now. I'm homeschooled and I literally don't have any friends or family to talk to about this situation. I don't want to lose the love of my life all because of what that man did to me.

727,"  I’m 18 and I’ve struggled heavily with general and social anxiety since middle school or longer.  It got so bad I dropped out of high school at age 15. (later went back and got my GED tho woo) 
  
  A few months ago I finally started taking medication to help control my anxiety and depression. It seemed to be working a little but yesterday I had my dosage upped. I’ve told my doctors and therapist that my goal is to control my anxiety enough so that I can obtain and maintain a job, and then so I can save up to move out. 

  I have virtually no job experience. When I was 16 I had super cool neighbors who invited me to work with them as vendors at this huge festival in my town for the week! At first I was stoked. Cool music, cool people, and I could gain some experience. After the first couple days, I wanted to quit. It was incredibly fast paced, there were so many customers, and I felt incompetent. I constantly felt like I was doing a terrible job and I just wanted to hide away. Towards the end it got easier because I was becoming familiar and comfortable with everything. 

  The day after I turned 18, I started a real job at Walmart. I thought I’d do fine. I worked 7 hours and I quit. It was overwhelming and again, I felt stupid and incompetent. 

  Well fast forward to now, my mom hooked me up with a job at Subway if I want it! I really want and NEED to do it. My boyfriend moved back home to Texas recently and he wants to get a place with me there. So I need to seriously get some money up. 

  I’m really scared. My biggest fear is obviously being slow and incompetent. I’m terrified that I’m too stupid for the job and I’m going to mess things up. I know everyone makes mistakes at work but I can’t get past that fear. And of course there’s the part where if I mess up, customers might get annoyed with me. 

  I have a couple factors that are motivating me to “get out there” and get the job, like moving out, and the biggest one, getting the dog of my dreams, a chow chow. 

  Please help me feel more confident about this. Any tips or personal experiences of holding down a job while dealing with anxiety would be greatly appreciated.",20Jun2019,3

I, and many others, really didnt want to believe this, because, again, he was one of my favorite teachers and I really enjoyed his classes.

730,"About a month ago, I found my best friend during a suicide attempt. I don't really want to go into the details, but you can find a post about it in my post history. Fast forward to today, we have not been talking very much because she moved in with her parents (about 1.5 hours away) and she rarely answers her phone (although that is nothing new). A few times we made plans to meet up but she would cancel, even ones she instigated. Honestly, she's also done some really hurtful things since the incident that I can go into if anyone thinks that will help give perspective. I'm trying to ignore those things though because I know she is dealing with a lot, but it has gotten to the point where I don't think I'm able to be her friend if we don't talk about it (we haven't seen each other alone since before the incident, and she has not said anything about it to me other than that she is in therapy). 

This week she started dating a man who she met while in the psych unit at the hospital. I had met him briefly when I visited her at the hospital, but not enough to get much of an impression. Anyway, now that they're dating she wanted to double date (she is friends with my bf also), which I was not thrilled about because I still haven't spoken to her in a long time and this wasn't how I imagined talking again for the first time, and I don't like the idea of her dating someone who she met there. But, I decided it was better than nothing, so I decided to go through with it and invited them over for dinner and I could cook (partially cause I'm a good cook, partially cause I'm too broke to go out). 

Honestly my expectations were low, but I wanted it to go well so I pushed through. It went so much worse than I ever could have imagined. There were SO many red flags about her boyfriend and her recent behavior. A short list:

1. You should not date someone you went through in patient care with. Professionals specifically advise against it and it is obvious why. 
2. He is also seven years older than her, normally this wouldn't matter too much but within the context of his behavior and this relationship I think it says a lot.
3. She has identified as a lesbian for much longer than I have known her. She has never had an ounce of interest in men, and this is extremely out of character. Especially because, tbh this guy is NOT a catch (not attractive, immature, very rude).
4. He invited his friend over without any warning to my very small apartment right when we started eating. Apparently the friend was going to give him a ride home later (doesn't make sense because he is an adult who can take the bus or uber). He and his friend were rude, and openly insulted everyone. She said to me that I should ignore the things that they say because they don't mean it (referring to both personal insults and the racist, sexist slurs). 
5. They talked about being drunk a lot. A crazy amount. The last time I had spoken to my friend she said she was quitting drinking for her mental health, but her new bf seems to encourage her to get ""shitfaced"" (their word) a lot.
6. Her parents do not like him and do not know that they are dating. She is actively lying to them about seeing him, and she never lies to them so this is out of character especially with how out of her way she has to go to hide the fact that she is meeting up with him.
7. In less than a week they already said I love you. This relationship is very short but intense, which is very different from her previous ones. She also is acting out of character around him, and I don't really understand it. It's like she's an entirely different person. She also had sex with him and the condom broke and she didn't get plan B even though they went to the grocery store after, and I forced her to get it the next day because she was freaking out about getting pregnant (honestly though, how is getting plan B not your first thought?)

Ultimately, I want her to be happy and healthy. I just don't see it happening with this guy. She invited me to her parents house this weekend to hang out, which after the double date I do not want to do. But everyone I asked said I should go because I'm her closest friend and someone needs to be honest with her. I want to tell her about how she has been hurting me, and that her boyfriend is bad news, but I'm afraid with the distance between us that she would choose him over me. I don't know if I should, or if I should let her make this mistake without giving an opinion. I also don't want to make her issues about me at all, but she is being shitty towards me a lot and I don't know how to be her friend through this if it continues.

Any advice about how I should talk to her is welcome! This is the first time I've honestly felt so clueless about what the right thing to do is.",20Jun2019,1
731,So a little back ground information I’m a 21 year old male and I’m still living at home. I have a girlfriend and both of our past relationships were with controlling individuals who abused both of us both mentally sexually and physically.  Me and my gf both are working through some of the damages these people have caused and have made leaps and bounds in terms of healing. Now here is where the problem lies my mother is a controlling person not to much different than our past relationships. she does everything she can to have her thumb on me and blames me for it. I can’t even be out past 12 and I’m 21 years old and the only thing she pays for is my car (not really I pay the payment it’s just in her name) and the house that I grew up in.  She constantly tries to monopolize my time when I want to go see my gf and her family but it’s no issue if she is over at our house constantly. Last night we had a huge blow up over my gf because I want to be with her family more.

Anyway I am trying to think of a team name and am striking out, the city is Portland, Oregon. The current team name is the Oregon Ice - I can use Portland or Oregon as my 'city'.

If anyone is interested the game is called front office football, and its a really fun game if your more into the GM roles like myself.

Thanks in advance!",20Jun2019,1
739,"To start off, I'm in my third year of college. After being in relationships since I was 14, I've been single for around a year now, and it's been amazing. In the past year, I've also gotten medicated for ADHD, which changed my world; I'm now able to sit down and actually complete tasks. I'm an artist and a writer, and for the first time in my life, I've been able to sit down and focus solely on myself and my personal projects. I've got 4 creative art projects going on, and I'm teaching myself a language, working part-time, meditating, taking summer classes, and running every day. It's weird, but I've turned into a classic Type A personality, just always focused on my goals and being productive. 

The thing is, I'm isolating myself in order to pursue my ambitions. I'm very happy, unstressed, have high self-confidence, and have been extremely productive. But all of these things I do by myself. I couldn't really care less, though. In this state of mind, I could stay isolated for my entire life as long as I was being productive. I have no incentive to contact my friends and actually hang out with them. When I do, I'm just thinking about how I could be doing art in my room instead. It sucks; I have to FORCE myself to just grab lunch with a friend. I don't even feel lonely. I seriously am the happiest I've been in a long time. I've moved home for the summer, so I don't have to see anybody, and I've pretty much dropped off the face of the earth.

I need advice because I'm worried I can't keep this up. Is this lifestyle sustainable? How do I get myself to WANT to socialize? I feel like I don't even need people anymore. I'm super happy, but I feel like I'm not supposed to be! I'm supposed to *want* to hang out with my friends, go on dates, etc. But I'm much more content doing what I love, working on my projects. If anyone has experienced this and could give me some wisdom, I'd love it. Thank you for reading!",20Jun2019,2

741," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it also she sometimes look at my hair funny sometimes :/",20Jun2019,1

755,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place for me to post, so I apologize in advance if this is not it. Four years ago after living with my fiancé for a year, we lost our apartment due to poor financial planning on our part (young and stupid). We were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to set any money away. When it came time to renew the lease or move, we elected not to renew due to the fact that our apartment had been robbed during our stay and we felt unsafe. During this time, we agreed that I would move back in with my parents, and he would move back in with his and we would both stay until such a time we had enough money saved up. For clarity sake, lets call my fiancé Tim.  


Sometime into my stay at my parents house (sorry, time blends together now), my dad had a huge medical scare and for the longest time we had no idea what it was. It was a very frightening time. We thought he was going to die. He became completely bedridden and required assistance for the most basic things that we take for granted. Many hospital trips and doctors visits later, we found out that he had suffered two strokes and a heart attack. After discussion with Tim, we decided that I should stick around longer at my parents house to be my dads caregiver. Tim moved in later and has helped me with my father. He does everything he can to help my father, and honestly I don't know what we would have done without him.  


Unfortunately, my dad is a hard headed asshole and pretty much views everything as a challenge.He is constantly fighting or trying to cause arguments with Tim or he treats me and my mother like dirt. Constantly demanding and insulting us. My dad also likes to pick a person in the household, monopolize their time and make it so that they can't take care of themselves or do what they need to do. If another person steps in to try to help, he will be forceful as to who he wants to help him, and nothing will change his mind. He is narcissistic and believes the world only revolves around him and that he is the only person in the world who can have problems. 

Onto my mom. She has a terrible drinking problem, only being able to stay sober for maybe an hour after she gets home from work before getting blackout drunk, laying the responsibility of taking care of my dad on Tim and I. She has had a hard time coping with my fathers condition and other things she finds reasons to drink. When she is drunk, she is constantly disrespectful to myself and Tim. This disrespect has transferred to when she is sober and I am quite frankly sick of her drinking and her disrespect.  


In addition to taking care of my father and trying to help my mother, I've ended up having to take care of the house as well, including making sure the bills are paid on time, the house is clean, the grocery shopping is done and the pets are taken to the vet or the groomers when need be. They also constantly use my vehicle for doctors appointments because its the only one my dad can ride in comfortably and its pretty much the only one in working condition. They rarely if ever put money into my vehicle for their 4+ doctors appointments a week that are 30+ miles round trip.  


Tim worked as a contract worker for a school district while living here. His contract ended. My dad has for the last two months monopolized Tim's time so that he hasn't been able to find a job, and he wants to help my dad so he refuses to say no whenever asked for help. After constant fighting from my dad, and the blatant disrespect from my mother, he has become depressed and understandably reached his breaking point and wants to move out. I want to move out with him as I have had enough as well. Our ""help"" in this house has turned into blatant enabling of certain things and that needs to end.  


Here in lies the issue. During this period of time, I've also paying rent to my parents. I've pretty much been paying for the ""privilege"" of taking care of things here which has draining our savings. I'm pretty sure we could get into low income housing (at this point I would be content to sleep in a refrigerator box), but at the same time i'm deathly afraid to leave because everything at my parents house could come crashing down without me and Tim here to keep it stable. I do have two sisters, but they have been zero help. Both moved across town just to be able to say they can't make it to my parents house to help with anything. My older sister visits once a week to do laundry, completely avoids my dad and leaves as soon as she folds her last load. My younger sister only comes around once a week with her two kids, won't help my dad with anything but will sit and talk with him for maybe 10-15 minutes during her 4-5 hour visit.

758,"Alright, first post here. It's a long story, so bear with me, I'm sorry. 

For 2.5 years I lived with a girl, (strictly platonic,) let's call her Ashley. I thought we became great friends, until we weren't. While I was living with her, our downstairs neighbour, let's call her Karey (who is also my friend/coworker) had a roommate move in, let's call him Tim. Karey's known Tim forever, I've known him for a while, everyone gets along, happy-happy, joy-joy. 

Well, one day, Ashley and Tim start dating. We're all in our late twenties, early thirties, mind you. Not a big deal, but relationships can get serious. Tim falls hard for Ashley. Ashley's not feeling it as much. There's a big back story here, but this post will be long enough without it. The only thing Karey and I say is: **DON'T MAKE IT WEIRD FOR THE REST OF US IN THE HOUSE**. Of course, it got weird. 

The relationship crashed and burned, hard. Ashley blindsided Tim, at Christmas. It was heartbreaking to watch. She wasn't forthcoming about it either. It was a dragged out, brutal process, and my heart broke for Tim. But at the end of the day, if you aren't happy, you aren't happy. Buck up, say your piece, move on (easier said than done, but you know what I mean.) Tim tried to win her back, Ashley went back to dating girls. Tim was moved out of the house by now. Everything blew over eventually... or so I thought. 

In the summer, we had a backyard bonfire. Fun! Tim came, Ashley was supposed to be out of the house, drinks were poured. Great time. Ashley came home. Ashley flipped out. It sucked. It was awkward. She accused Tim of stalking her. Said she didn't feel safe. In other situations, I would have believed her. But I literally know Tim's schedule (same company as me) and the times she claimed he stalked her didn't line up. I literally LIVED with her, he was never hanging around. But I digress. I tried to distance myself from the situation. I was so sick of the drama, I hate drama. I was beginning to think less and less of Ashley. There was something shady, and ""victim-y"" about her. Every breakup, she's never wrong. Every disagreement, she's in the right. I've caught her in a few... mis-truths... not the truth, not a full blown lie. You get the idea?

Anyway, a YEAR after they broke up, we have the company Christmas party. I invite my friends, including Tim, Karey, and our good friend, Beth and her husband, over for a drink before hand. Tim's a no-show. Doesn't show to the party at all. After dinner is served, we're starting to get worried. It's snowing, driving is treacherous, etc. Late into the evening, Tim finally answers the calls. He's freaking out, super upset, and not coming. We're all blindsided, but can't do anything about it and continue our night. In the meantime, I've invited Ashley to my house for dinner once, and to my birthday party, casual get togethers. Everyone told me I was crazy for thinking she was a shady b\*tch, I tried to give her another chance. Maybe I was too quick to judge. She screwed me over when we moved. Maybe I was being too harsh... I don't know. I tried. 

Now, flash forward 7 months, to present day. To recap: Over a year and a half since the break up of Ashley and Tim. 7 months since the freak out by Tim over the Christmas party.  I've bought a house with my boyfriend. We're happy, things are good. I've got a cute ass puppy. I'm supposed to go to Karey's hometown for her 30th birthday, Beth is pregnant again. Summertime, sunshine. Good things all around. 

I get invited to Karey's birthday on Facebook, look at the invite list, Tim has unfriended me on Facebook. Petty, but hey, I don't know the story. Ask Karey about it... apparently Ashley said something when she dumped Tim. About me... something I said? **Wtf**? I was like, what the hell could have been said? I was busy defending Tim to Ashley, and avoiding Tim talk after that. What the hell could have been said? The next day, Karey comes clean.   


&gt;!Ashley told Tim, !&lt;

&gt;!that I told Ashley, !&lt;

&gt;!that Tim raped me at a festival !&lt;

&gt;!(that he was too fucked up to remember much of), !&lt;

&gt;!and that is why she dumped him. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. You read that right. Yes, it is **JUST AS FUCKED UP AS YOU THINK**, no, I did not type this in error. And double no, I have never hooked up or with, or gone even a smidgen further than a very platonic friendship with Tim. That is what Karey tells me Tim is upset about. I'm shocked, totally blindsided, a tornado of emotions. 

Now, rewind to the Christmas party meltdown. That's when Tim told Beth (and by extension, Karey, and Beth's husband), about this shit storm. Poor guy has been sitting on this for near a year. So, from then to present day, Beth, her husband, and Karey, have known what was said. They have known how this has made Tim feel. And they have not uttered a single word to me about it. Karey's excuse is that they didn't want to ""trigger"" me if something had happened. Beth's excuse is that she didn't want to be the middle man... both bullshit if you ask me. Karey also throws out that, ""maybe mochew22 and Tim DID hook up, and she's just embarrassed about it, and either lied, or Ashley spun the story.""

Fuck that. I considered both Karey and Beth two of my closest friends. Ashley was on that list at one point too. I believe in believing survivors, I believe in standing up for what is right. I believe in being truthful, even if it makes you look like a nitwit. Why the HELL would I LIE about something like this? What the actual fuck. And let's say, in an alternative universe, (and this is 100% not what happened), but what if it WAS true? No one checked on me. No one asked me about anything. 

So I've spent the last day or so crying on and off. Feeling sick to my stomach, and fantasizing about punching Ashley in the schnozz. I won't. She's a foot taller than me and beloved by a shocking amount of people. But I want to. I wrote a letter to Tim, being incredibly clear and concise; I never said that, I never would say that, you have never made me feel uncomfortable, or compromised my safety, etc. I wrote a letter to Beth and Karey, saying essentially the same thing. I've got a ton of feelings happening. I thought Ashley was a snake, but didn't think she'd stoop this low. That said, I really thought Beth and Karey would have my back, or at least talk to me... and it didn't happen. It didn't happen until I noticed Tim unfriended me on Facebook. 

Now, I'm posting to the Advice place on Reddit. My poor boyfriend is livid. He was super emotional yesterday, because apparently my taste in men is significantly superior to my taste in female friends, and he's the most amazing support and he knows how much this hurt me. 

These are my questions:

1) I don't plan on confronting Ashley, but should I?  
2) How the hell am I supposed to feel about Beth and Karey keeping this from me for 7 months? This part is almost the part that hurts me the most.  
3) How the hell do I move past this?  
4) And if all else fails, how the fuck do adults make friends? Apparently my friends kinda suck.

759,"So there is a woman I have had a crush on for a while. We have hung two or three times on our own to go eat and she knows I am interested in her.... I haven’t messaged her in a week now but usually it takes her at least 24 hours to respond. 

She had a boyfriend at one point and I got jealous and confessed my feelings for her out of I guess fear of losing her. She said she couldn’t return them, which was a bit vague but I didn’t press it cause I didn’t want to screw up her relationship.  

Anyway, I found her on a dating site the other day where she was listed as single. She disappeared a few days later. We went to go eat the other day, but no labels on the outing. 

What should I do? I am tried of waiting for one day responses and feeling like I am going nowhere. This has been going on for 3 years. I have been so frustrated that I told my mother about this whom I hate telling things like this... I am 28.  Idk what to do...

760,"My relationship with my best friend has always been great, but the last 2 months my best friend has been ignoring my messages often.

I've been talking to a girl for a little while now, and I am not sure what to do; she says she thinks she loves me, but doesn't really show it, nor does she really reply to my messages in a timely fashion (most of the time)

I do have feelings for her, but I am and have been apprehensive of getting back into meeting people; I tell her that she's beautiful and that I wish we were together, etc. and it seems as though my compliments fly right over her head and she doesn't really acknowledge them besides saying that she thinks she's unattractive &amp; ""fat"", which is not the case whatsoever in any way.

I am thinking I need to distance myself since I don't feel that the feelings are mutual, and I feel as though her and I are on different paths in life; I also feel that she doesn't truly love me (which is fine) since 1) she doesn't love herself, and 2) we've only been talking for about a month

I've tried to make it work, but it feels unnatural at this point and I am fighting between myself as I do want to talk, but at the same time I think it's better if I moved on

What should I do, or how should I do it? Should I just be straight up and honest?

764,"So I’ll try to make a long story short. I’m in my early 20’s and was planning a vacation with my family and GF where we all go to LA this summer. Early on in the planning of the vacation my mom brought up the idea of inviting some family friends along. I made it very clear that I wanted this to be a family vacation only and didn’t want the pressure of socializing with people I’m not extremely close with on vacation. I thought we were in  agreement and she told me they can’t come anyway because the husband couldn’t get the week off of work. After that we worked out the rest of details of the vacation and booked it. Then a few days ago my mom tells me that they in fact are coming on the trip but it’s by pure chance they happened to book a vacation on the same week in the same city (ya right). I was mad but she assured me they were staying at a different hotel and that I wouldn’t have to socialize with them if I didn’t want to. Fine, that I can put up with. Then yesterday the family friends contacted me asking if I can buy tickets to the baseball game I was planning on taking my family and gf to on the trip! After a little prodding I find out not only did my mom invite them on the trip (long before we booked it), she invited them to all the events we had planned on the trip! I was furious! My mom doesn’t see why I’m mad or why there is even an issue with this. She says I’m completely over reacting and is mad I’m making an issue of this. I only get 2 weeks for vacation a year and this was a vacation I had been planning for months! What do I do? And do I have a right to be mad?

768,"A few weeks ago, two of my closest friends hung out without me and it really bummed me out.

I don't have a lot of other buddies that I can hang out with, so I'm kind of caught - should I still ask them to hang out, or take the hint (that might not even exist) that they don't wanna hang around with me anymore.

If I keep up the friendship, or at least try to, am I being unfair to myself?

I'd really appreciate any advice, thank you :)",20Jun2019,1
769,"so here’s the deal: i have a friend from high school that started dating this girl in HS and they continued to date after. the relationship went on for 5 years, but honestly? the last half of the relationship was pretty bad. lots of untreated mental illness on both sides of the equation that manifested in ugly ways. i think it’s for the better that they now can work on themselves independently, honestly!

now back to my friend. he’s had mental issues for years that he would “put in his mental sandbox to play and stay put”, as he’d say. all his traumas were put away. he’s the king of repressing emotions. so take that, add in a girlfriend that depended on him for emotional stability and sapped his emotional energy, PLUS going into law school where they drilled into his mind “fuck the feelings only logic”, and we got a whole ass mess. he’s doing better, but he’s still got a lot to work on. 

so she broke it off with him. multiple reasons on both sides, both valid and stupid. it broke him. he like, literally decided to dedicate his life and life plan to her. so when she ended it, he was so lost. so like any friend, i would talk him through it to an extent, tell him what i thought and what he could do, all that jazz. it was fine when it was first happening! but now he calls every week to “check in” and talk about it. it’s been maybe 3 months since the breakup. at this point, i really feel more like a therapist than a friend. i am losing... SO much energy. he’s become so attached to me that he wants to fly ME out (like he offered to pay for a round trip plane ticket) and visit him while he’s doing some law program or something out in texas. then he also said that he wants to go on a “date” because “we both deserve being treated to a good time”. to me, it sounds almost like he just wants a surrogate girlfriend for a weekend. and i feel like he’s feeding off of my own loneliness and crave of romance. 

basically, i feel like he’s treating me like the girlfriend he wanted from his ex. he wanted her to care and give him attention, he wanted her to nurture him, he wanted reciprocation. which is fair! even during the relationship he would come to me to just have me hold him while he cried because she wouldn’t. but i am not his girlfriend! he is not my boyfriend! he cannot keep expecting me to pick up her slack! it’s not my job and it’s unfair to me! and i need to tell him that! i! need! boundaries!! but i also don’t want to cause him more emotional turmoil!!!

does it sound selfish? probably. but i’ve gone through enough bullshit to recognize when lines are being crossed. it’s one thing to be there as a friend. it’s another to rely on a friend as an emotional and romantic outlet. 

so uh....... anyone have any ideas on how to gently tell this emotionally unstable friend that i need space and he needs to find a healthier outlet? or anything else i can do to address the issue?",20Jun2019,3
770,"alright, this is gonna be a hard post to write but I need advice anyway, the story: I work for a summer school as a teacher and on the first day I noticed there was something off about this little girl. she would be bossy but then get really quiet and not say a word well, I has a inkling that she was being abused. (she has marks on her body but didn't want to tell us, she was always hungry and would ask for other peoples lunches, she was in the wrong grade for the class parents have to decide what grade they're in) she wouldn't sing and dance ever when the other groups where doing it she'd just stare at them and get teary eyes. ) the other teacher was talking to her and then ran to the bathroom crying so I went in there and turns out she has the same feeling as me and the little girl must've said something pointing to abuse. we told the person running the school and we called cps. so now I'm wondering if we did the right thing?",20Jun2019,1

777,"I am currently in an argument with a couple of my housemates over the rights to a sum of money that was left in our property account by the previous lease. 

Me and one other out of 11  people on the current lease have been in this house for two years (1 year contracts) while the other have been there for one. The argument is over  approximately 2 months worth of rent that was present in our account (for reasons I cannot figure out based on the ledger) prior to the new guys being put on the lease. Nobody from before claimed the money and I want to know if you guys think the money Belongs to just me and the other guy or everyone. 

My stance is that it belongs to the two of us but a couple of the 1 year guys don’t buy my reasoning and I realize that we are partial to bias here so I would like to know what you guys think. Multiple opinions would be appreciated",20Jun2019,1
779,"(18m) About 5 months ago I was the happiest and healthiest I had ever been in my life enjoying new hobbies in a very good relationship with the love of my life eating really well while also going to the gym regularly. But 5 months ago my whole life crumbled I found out that my girlfriend had cheated on me with my best friend and had all of her friends lie to me for months just to cover there relationship up but everything just went downhill from there. I got diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia after i reached out for help at my nearest hospital they have put me on an ssri and a medication called risperidone but it hasnt done much for me at all. I attempted to commit suicide with those pills but woke up the next super ill and it really just made everything worse. I have panic attacks almost daily and have started smoking cigs  to cope with it. My parents arent supportive and ive done almost everything on my own since i was 16. My biggest concern right now is i go days without eating and just drink water and i lost 10 pounds which doesnt sound like much but when your 145 pounds and 6ft tall then drop to 135 you can really see the difference (ribs) I have never done good in school and im not getting any credits this semester because i very rarely left my room for the past 4 months so im in a very bad spot with school. The only thing that has kept me from attempting again is my music i listen to (ruby and scrim)

780,"Different account cuz this is awkward and personal. 

So I’ve always had issues with my guts, IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which basically results in having to make several trips to the bathroom a day. I’m pretty paranoid and always feel really dirty afterword, even though I’m VERY thorough when wiping, so I just use the shower immediately after going. Full routine, this’ll take about 30-40 minutes, and I usually don’t spend a lot of time in the shower. Just enough to restore my faith in cleanliness.

I’m currently staying with my three siblings, all of whom live together, and all of whom are older than me. I was home alone when my gut started to bother me, so I made my way to my bathroom. Most of the issue is..... dispersed within the first 8ish minutes. Not gunna lie, I just wanted to take a break from the work I was doing because it was starting to get on my nerves, so I decided to goof around on my phone, watching YouTube and browsing reddit and stuff. 

My sister, who’s a cop (yeah, little important) gets home while I’m in the bathroom. 

I spend a tiny bit more time derping around on the web and start to wipe, it’s maybe been 15-25 minutes now. I finish up wiping and turn on the shower to warm up, I get in, cleanup, and get out. I didn’t get my hair wet or anything because I didn’t want to do a full shower, but I did my usual after-use-cleaning. 

I get out of the bathroom and my sister is standing there inquisitively (her bedroom door is on the wall next to the bathroom door). And starts to grill me on what I was doing. We haven’t lived in the same house for several years and so she wasn’t accustomed to my routine. 

So, me, being pissed off already by the aforementioned work, respond defensively because I don’t feel like taking any bullshit. 

My sister, who like I said is a cop, picks up on the defensiveness and thinks I’m lying

I come from a religious family who’s against things like sex and what not, so I figured out pretty quick that she was suggesting I was ^having ^a ^good ^ol ^time ^while ^on ^the ^shitter, ^if ^you ^get ^my ^drift.

Any how, she’s telling me I need to get help for an issue I don’t have. I don’t know how to get her off my case, because I honestly have no interest in things like masturbating. I’m what the internet knows as “asexual” - aka it just doesn’t appeal to me, and I have no drive to smash. 

TLDR: I spent a while in the bathroom and took a quick shower afterwards because I’m paranoid/germaphobic, now my religious sister thinks I was wanking off while on the porcelain throne and it’s making things really awkward

Anyways her suspicion is making things SUUUPER awkward and I don’t know how to defuse the false suspicion, any advice?",20Jun2019,1
781,"This manager, let’s call him Rick, has been with the company for over 7yrs, and also has a girlfriend of 6yrs. When I [21F] first got transferred to our current store near the end of 2017, he immediately tried to befriend me. I didn’t think much of it because he seemed friendly. We chatted here and there, joked, and had casual work manners.

There was a bowling outing outside of work that the entire department attended. This happened probably 4-5 months after I transferred. Everyone was having a blast, drinking alcohol, and dicking around. Rick didn’t take his eyes off me and tried to sneak in some “subtle” touches. Like, grazes and /long/ hand placements when talking. I kept my distance from him because I was getting a bad vibe. One moment as I was leaning against the bowling racks to eat my snacks, he stood and hovered over me. Rick got really close, which made me extremely uncomfortable so I moved away and went towards my friends.

Later that night, he ended up behind me, pressed his nose against my head and inhaled me as he pulled me in from my waist. I stood there frozen because this never happened to me before. I freaked out but didn’t want to make a scene because we were surrounded by friends/coworkers?? I told my girly friend when we left to head to this pie shop after bowling with whoever wanted to meet up. She didn’t say much about it. Only, “uhm ew wtf?” Keep in mind that they’re friends. They’ve been friends since elementary.

Rick, his “boys”, and a few others from bowling met us up at the pie shop. I was tipsy-intoxicated, but not fucked up. As we were all waiting in line to place our orders, I leaned against the partition that separates the line from the eating area. Rick made sure to stand VERY close to my left, which I brushed off because it was 2 in the morning so I was tired on top of being intoxicated. Keep note that I was wearing an oversized jacket, crop top, and high waisted leggings.

Rick slowly moved his hand under my jacket and started rubbing my back. I freaked out and froze. I thought to myself, “We are surrounded by our coworkers?? What are you doing?? What the fuck? Why are you uninvitedly touching me?!” He proceeded as my mouth was sealed shut from horror. He started to move his hand under my shirt, then in to my leggings. Rubbed and grabbed my hips and ass. I was terrified. He started to play with my underwear and that’s where I snapped out of it, freaked out, and grabbed his hand. He removed it and pretended like nothing happened. For the rest of the duration at the pie shop, I avoided him. I felt very empty. I cried at home after my friend drove me home.

The day after, I texted Rick expressing how angry and upset I am at him. Stating how everything he did made me uncomfortable and that I wish for him to stop talking to me because I hate him for doing that to me. He apologized with, “I’m sorry. I thought it was okay because you didn’t say anything when I did that or reacted, but when you grabbed my arm I knew I fucked up. I’m sorry. I understand that you hate me and don’t want to talk to me anymore. Just know that I’ll be here if you ever need me.” Okay, so you think it’s okay to VIOLATE and SEXUALLY HARASS SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING?? I was terrified!!?!?! Frozen and unable to speak.

We didn’t talk nor interact for several weeks, but he made it very apparent that he wasn’t happy about it. Our “friendship” slowly recovered through the months, but I kept my distance. I made it very clear that I still hate him for doing those things to me. Sadly, Rick continued to touch me, kiss my cheek, and inhale me at work. I continuously told him to stop. He didn’t care and thought it was funny when I’d immediately smack his hand away when he grabs my waist as he walked by. I have a boyfriend of almost two years, that Rick knows, but that doesn’t mean jack shit to him either.

Fast forward a few months, I decided to confide in him  (what a mistake that was) because I was stressed about work and my personal life. That’s when he tried to rape me. Before it led up to “it”, I kept moving away and avoiding him. Removing his hands from my body, pushing him away as he went in to kiss me. Nothing stopped. He’s a lot bigger than me, so I couldn’t compete. He partially forced my clothes off, but I fought back. I fought hard. He tried to force himself on me, and I cried. I didn’t want to see it nor touch it but I had to so it could stop. I pushed him away and rushed to put my clothes back on. He sat there like, “wtf?” Then he asked me if I was “okay”. I lied. 

I felt really broken and empty. I couldn’t process everything. I drove home screaming and bawling my eyes out. I felt defeated. I was angry, confused, in pain, my heart ached, and I didn’t know who I was anyone. I immediately went to shower. I constantly scrubbed myself but never felt “clean” no matter how hard I did.

To this day, which has been almost a year, it still hurts me. I cry every time I think about it. I scratch my skin every. Single. Time. It hurt me mentally and emotionally to no return. Only recently did I confide in a trusted manager that is like a father figure to me. He assisted with calling HR to start an investigation. 

I want justice. It’s unfair that I live with this every day while he goes about his with no care in the world. Everyone thinks he’s the “best person ever” at my work. The HR claim is still active, they did in-person interviews (with me first), and they said they’re going to determine what appropriate actions to take. I’m fairly certain they’re going to terminate him.

One of my close friends from work just told me yesterday (because I told her about all of that above) that he groped her several times before I ever transferred to the store, but she didn’t report it. I’m angry. He targeted other female employees. I only know of me and her, so I can only imagine if other females fell victim to him.

After saying all of the back story, I’m now going to ask the advice. I met his girlfriend before, she seems very sweet and lovely. I thought about telling her all of this because I find it unfair to have this hidden from her, especially when they’re thinking about marrying and buying a house together? I want to save her from staying with a sexual predator and rapist. Is it my place to? I don’t intend on using my personal accounts, but rather make a throwaway one to warn her. Rick is a serial liar so I know he’d lie if she asks why he no longer works at our store.",20Jun2019,1
782,"I’ll try to cover the basics here but I’m still quite shaken so bear with me. 

Yesterday morning I got a call from the hospital saying I needed to come see my mum. My mum lives in another state so I immediatley dropped everything, got on a plane and went straight to her. I was there within 5 hours. 
She was a fucking sight, her face looks like it’s been mushed into broken glass, she can’t hear out of one ear, her body is covered in really dark bruises, and the clothes she was wearing look like she just jumped into a pool of blood. 
My step dad is not the kind of guy I would have ever expected to do this. They’ve been together 13 years and he’s never shown a sign of this. What concerns me is that it wasn’t just a smack across the face or a push - he literally beat the crap out of her. 


So after this happened my mum managed to escape and run down the street to the neighbour and get help. Then my step dad pretended he was going to hang himself - I suspect because he knew he would be going to court and could use insanity in his favour. He has been in the process of sueing the police force he worked for due to PTSD, negligence etc.   He does have PTSD to a degree but I specifically remember times where he would act more crazy than he is while visiting the psychologist (weeing on his clothes the night before so he smelt, carrying his items in a grocery bag, fluffing up his hair and wearing dark makeup under his eyes) in order to maintain his lunacy. But back at home he was a normal father. 

My concerns now is that this guy is not just some hick that got drunk and bashed my mum. This guy has killed people, he knows the law, he knows how to dispose of a body and not get caught, he knows how to play the game. 

Right now he is still in hospital as he needs to be held on mental health reasons. We think it’s a good idea that he doesn’t know I am up here with mum. He has access to all her accounts so I’m paying for everything so he can’t track her. She’s in the process of changing all her passwords and stuff. 

Mum lives in a gated community - so these are the steps we are planning to take today. 
- tell security about domestic violence incident and block his access card from entering community (he can still access the community via a broken fence but not with a car)
- drive his car to the hospital with his clothes in it and leave his key with the reception so he doesn’t have a reason to come back 
- change locks on house

This seems like a feeble attempt at safety. I’m trying to convince mum she should fly home with me but she has a 20yo cat that she’s concerned her partner would likely kill. The cat can’t exactly travel or board as she’s a bit precious and on deaths door. 

Mum is also due to fly to Greece in a couple of weeks on holiday and the house will be empty and her partner knows this. I guess I will stay and look after the house but should I get a man to stay here with me? 


Are there other steps I should be taking? Any advice on how I can keep mamma safe? I have no idea what to do and I’m super overwhelmed.

786,"I [18M] have always had a paranoid childhood when it came to ghosts and demons. I used to watch a lot of horror films as a kid with my cousins so when I’d be at home (I am an only child) and my dad would be having a smoke outside, I would hide in my room with the lights on because I was always scared of there being a demon in the house. As I got older, the paranoia kinda faded away but I still hate being by myself in the dark. ANYWAYS, I went in a r/FearMe a few days ago and got scared, but I went through it again in ten daytime and just though “these are all shitty photoshopped or stage photos” BUT then later at night for the PAST 5 DAYS, I’ve been driving myself late at night after dropping off a friend to her house.

793,"(Background info I guess) My mother and father were never married and they had me at a young age. They broke up when I was 5 I think and their relationship with each other has been really bad. He took my mother to family court a lot over visitation rights/co-parenting and my mother never kept me from him nor said that he couldn’t see me. There’s only been one instance when she said he couldn’t but that’s because I was grounded and me being young, I would use my dad to escape the trouble I got into sometimes. Because of that, he would just take her to court, threaten to take her and etc.
My mother put him on child support and before, for the longest, it wasn’t through the court system so he was able to change the amount he could “afford”. Now it goes through the court system and it automatically takes from his check.

Now, since April, my mom, my little brother and I plus my little rabbit have been homeless because of our landlord sneaking into our apartment and then threatening my mother. My mom decided to leave as soon as that happened. We have Section 8 and where we live, landlords have been saying no/finding a way to say no as soon as we mention this. This is why we’re homeless and now we ran through our money.

I’m not sure if I should tell my father I’m homeless. I’m not sure what he could do for us. I’m not sure what he’d say. I’m not sure if he would even consider aiding us a bit more financially. I’m not sure if he would gossip to his family about our situation. I’m just not sure if he can even help because he always says he doesn’t have the money but his job pays him well.

She asked me if there was anything that he has said to me that may hurt or change their relationship, i told her no. The truth is he messages me out of the blue telling me how much he misses me and that he is in love with me. Also how gorgeous i am and other things that come with that.

798,"So I'm 15, I've been working at my job in a cafe for about five months. It's cash in hand, fairly casual, my boss swears, so do I. 

My dad was going to take me to a gig for one of my favourite bands on Friday. 

Nobody told me. Both my mum and my dad thought I knew about it (somehow). 

My boss texted me my hours on wednesday, and I'm working on friday. Big conflict. 

I told my parents I was working and they were confused and that's when they told me about the gig. I was upset, because they were telling me to tell my boss i needed to swap shifts. I was arguing back that i'd already told her I was good to work, and I have bad social anxiety which was limiting me from asking her to change shifts as in my head I've already made the commitment to working these hours, and asking to change would be entitled at such short notice. 

My mum said this was ridiculous and we left it at that. This was at seven in the evening. 

Now at eleven, I mentioned the idea of them getting me a t-shirt considering I can't go and she got frustrated with me because I didn't text my boss. 

I got annoyed because I feel like she's blaming me for this, when nobody told me, and she's making it seem like I don't want to go, when I do. 

They've done this before, quite recently, telling me we have a concert to go to at incredibly short notice, even though they are aware I work and often don't get my hours until the day before. 

Am I unreasonable for getting frustrated?",20Jun2019,1

802,"I want to own a bakery/cafe but it's not simply when I need money (a lot of it, to start).

I went to college because my parents wanted me to and said I can get a good job, work then start a bakery.

It wasn't that simple to do since I don't qualify for any financial aid even though I carried a 3.8 gpa in highschool and college. So college has to be paid in full and I have to pay for it. 

I finished community college a semester early in december 2017 and was hoping to go to the college of my dreams that was in a city 2 hours away. When I said I would have to pull out a loan, my mom didnt want me to. Which was impossible because I didn't have $20,000 in cash. I worked during college at Starbucks part time making $9/hr. 
My parents never discussed these things with me until literally at the last moment plus I was rushing to finish my associates and busy doing 7 classes.

I was really depressed I couldn't go to the college and also my dad got esophagus cancer that october. I didn't know what to do and considered joining the military to pay off my school but didn't really have my heart set on doing 4 years of military to get a college education that I was basically not happy working towards because it was making my life so much more stressful since it really sucks when you have awesome grades then juggle working and then you see the price tag that is extremely pricy.

I finally went to college to pursue my business bachelors degree this spring of 2019 and it was much cheaper, I live with my parents, paid $5k for school and also have a car I am paying off too.

I didn't enjoy business I realized. I'm not sure if college is for me but maybe I feel that way because of the hefty price and I would cry every now and then because I felt miserable and incomplete going to this college which was also very small and a lot of business students were talking about how the school screws their plans because there is not many classes available to register and finish within the 2 year timeframe and wanted to leave for the other public university we have even if it's twice as much.

I do want to do school but don't know what major I should pursue, business I didn't find helped me that much. I like to work and be doing something rather than spending hours sitting my ass going to classes, a 1 hour drive to get there and back, and not making any money because I can only work part time in school and then the added stress of how will I be able to pay for the next semester and such.

My parents still want me to go to school, understand I hated business as a major but expect me to still go and pursue another major I will enjoy. I enjoy history but again, wasting more time and money on something I am not set on. I want to work, save up money and start a side baking business and website, build clientele and my mom is supportive of it. She says I can start my side baking business but she just wants me to go to school and graduate. I wish it was that simple but I dont make enough to pay each semester in full and dont feel motivated to do all these steps for this education.

What exactly should I do? I want to work full time and do a job that pays better. I work for a restaurant and use to cook but instead mainly serve there now, and I want to work in a place where I can move up like how my cousin works with Chase and got promoted. I want to work there but just want some other ideas suggested to go about how I do things.

My parents are very very serious when they say that want me to go to school, If I say I don't want to then they will get upset and argue with me. Another thing about them is that I lack a lot of freedom. I always have never had much and was not allowed to do much when I wasn't an adult and still do as an adult and need permission for many things despite being 21!

They basically won't allow me to move out until I finish college is what they want for me to do. If I said I was moving out they will get very angry, yell at me, maybe not let me take my dog either (I don't want to leave him with them if I do move out). I love my boyfriend and he has always been supportive of my choices if I want to do school or not and likes that I know I want to own a bakery. My parents are very religious and said they would never speak to me if they found out i left and moved out to get an apartment with my boyfriend. In my religion its sinful to live with your bf/gf if you aren't married. They're hypocrits though because they did the exact thing (stepdad and my real mom) 🙄.

I honestly don't know how to handle my family, what job choice or educational choices to make, or what to do because I just know my main goal but don't know how to get there.

If I get any advice, wise words, similar scenarios. I would be interested. I have dealt with these issues ever since I finished community college back in december 2017 and my life has been constant worry since then.",20Jun2019,1

So, my sister is 31 and has been with her partner for 4 years. They’re not married however looking to move in together and settle down. My sister suffers from bad anxiety and up until now has been coping well with it and getting better.

She visited a psychic to try and connect with our mother who passed away 7 years ago. This psychic guessed things such as our mums middle name, place of birth, and my sister’s partner’s name (2 of which are not listed publicly anywhere) - my sister also did not speak during the psychic reading.
She then said that our mum told her, *”you’re unsure if you want to be with your partner however, during October-November, things will become crystal clear for you - I see a third person. And your partners mum will be devastated!”*

My sister now thinks that during this time frame her relationship with her partner will end and they will split up - they’ve had a few rough patches but had really come good recently!

How can I convince her that this is all crap and should not be listened to or believed? 
She’s thinking about it 24/7 and it’s really hurting her :(

I cant stand it anymore, so by text when she questioned why wasnt why being so attentive, etc. i told her by text: Im gonna break up with you
She continued to go on talking really depressed and sad, and then she said ""btw were not over, i promised to myself never to break up via text cuz thats repugnant"".

She then appeared to be pretty happy, made jokes and what not. Problem is, she changed ever so quickly really intesely, and im getting scared. Tomorrow i will come over to her house to talk to her, and ive already told her parents. 

She hinted at bringing a knife: ""if i bring a knife it wont be to threaten you or anything pff"".

816,"Need some advice on how to handle this.

I made friends with a female co-worker,  and my boss said at the time that I was to have no contact with her outside of work hours, we used to chat on messenger until the early hours and my work performance never deteriorated.  (there have been nearly 6k WA messages in 4 months!!),  there was no unwanted contact as sometimes she would contact me, or I would contact her.   Nothing regarding work was ever discussed in any detail,  it was just two friends who hit it off really well talking to each other,  but whatever,  we agreed to stop and for the the most part we did.  We still chatted,  but not as much as either of us wanted to instead keeping chat to in the work place.

&amp;#x200B;

After she finished (she was a temp), we got back into the old routine of talking until the early hours,  sometimes throughout the night and into the mornings when I was not at work.   Eventually we had a few meals together or staying in each other's spare rooms after we cooked for each other,  nothing serious,  not a date or any romantic feelings from either of us for various complicated reasons (was discussed and laughed about),  just two friends enjoying each others company and and talking about our families, lives, and everything that goes with life.   That was until recently. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was running errands in town and popped into the store I work in to pay me a surprise visit with lunch as she had done several times in the past,  however she did not know it was my day off and my boss was in.  That same evening,  I got a message saying that she had talked to my boss and was told not to hurt my feelings ,  it was an odd message *""She told me not to lead you on and hurt his feelings""*  Which is very strange as we both knew from early that neither of us are interested in anything like that, and we laughed it off as her being a busy-body. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since that day however, her messages have been one or two word's, or evening chats cut short where as they would be whole paragraphs, photos, and videos previously,  and she has not wanted to meet up for what had become our usual Tuesday night meal.  I know she has a lot going on her life,  nothing more than was before hand and nothing she would be uncomfortable telling me about as we know pretty much everything about each other and I had helped her out with some very sensitive issues, but when asked about that day she visited avoids the subject.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a loss as she wont talk about it,  and I know for a fact that my boss disliked the fact that we got on so well and is well known for gossiping.  I have no idea how to even ""repair"" the friendship.   Have tried giving her space by not speaking for a week and letting her make first contact, but it is almost like she has forgotten how close as friends we had become.  I don't want to approach my boss about this, as she already hates me and have caught her lying to my face about things in the past.

What happened is the following: We were in our kitchen with two men I have never seen before in my life. We were talking and they brought up experiencing gay sex. We were all open for experience. So they recommended that each two take a bath together and have sex along the way. I volunteered to go first and then I asked Joe if he'd like to come. He didn't mind. We went to the bathroom amd started taking our clothes off. Then Joe said, ""What are you waiting for?"" So I grabbed his neck and started kissing him passionately and he kissed back. We did that while feeling each other's asses. I then went down to him muscles and chest and abs, and then got back up to kiss him again. We kissed. And then Joe said, ""I thought we were supposed to be having sex and not only kissing."" So I kissed him one last time roughly and then went down to give him some pleasure.

823,"I bought my first house as an investment property about three months ago. It had been winterized and I got a plumber to come in and turn the water on and check for leaks. He found a few odds and ends, and told me that he didn't check the hot water lines because the water heater had a hole in it and he would need to replace it. One of the things he needed to replace was a leaky drain in an upstairs bathroom directly above the kitchen. 

He scheduled a day about a two months later to come fix everything. It happened to be the day before I left on a three week trip that I had been planning for almost a year. I didn't give it a second thought as he has worked on dozens of houses for my brother over the past ten years. He says he hooked up the new water heater, installed the new drain, checked to make sure all the faucets were working and then left. 

When I got back, the house smelled moldy. I went upstairs and found the bathroom floor and vanity damp. The kitchen underneath had clearly had a lot of water through it--the laminate countertop was buckled and the cabinets were ruined. Part of the plaster ceiling had come down and the walls were bubbly and or falling apart. There was mold everywhere. I assumed a pipe had burst and called the insurance company. We found the leak was the hot water line going to the bathroom faucet. It's a small plastic tube that goes into a metal fitting. It looked like it had been bent at the fitting, but when the water was turned back on it sprayed quite a lot and is presumed to be the source of all the water. The neighbor told me that a week after the plumber came he noticed water coming out of the side of the house and shut the water off at the street. So if the leak started when the plumber was there it ran for a week, then the house sat warm and unoccupied for two weeks before I found it.

The plumber is a honest older guy (think cute little grandpa) and he insists that there was no leaking or anything when he left. The catch is that the broken water line is right next to the drain he replaced. It looks as if he bumped the line or something when he replaced the drain. The insurance adjuster believes that it was his fault. Because it's an older house and the water sat for so long it's going to be a massive project. Most of the interior walls registered significant moisture and so did the hardwood floors. They have to do asbestos, lead paint and mold mitigation before they can even really get started. Then there's more mold mitigation, they have to dry out or replace the flooring and probably gut the significant majority of the interior walls. The adjuster gave a rough estimate of $80k. 

There's no way that I can afford proper mold mitigation on my own, because even if I did all the gutting and putting back myself, just ensuring that the mold is handled professionally is going to run tens of thousands of dollars. I'm unwilling to attempt mitigation myself because if I miss anything it could become a significant liability/ethical issue if a tenant or buyer gets sick, even aside from potential structural problems. 


On the other hand, this plumber is uninsured, and probably close to retirement age. I know him well enough to know that there's no way he can afford $80k. If the insurance company pays out 80k to me they will almost certainly try to get it back from him. It could completely ruin him and I'm not sure I can feel ok about passing on a bill I can't afford to him, especially because his working years are so few now anyways. And he may not even have done it--if the water line were broken when I bought the house, water would only have come out of it after the water heater filled. If he looked around and left before the tank filled, he may never have noticed the leak and he definitely wouldn't have caused it. I just don't know what to do--I want to keep him from ruination but I absolutely cannot pay for this restoration now or in the foreseeable future.",20Jun2019,2

I am pretty confused about what I should do. My first inclination is that I should transfer into my school’s mechanical engineering program mainly because I feel like mechanical engineering is more hands on and requires more problem solving.

I am also conflicted if I should pick up a minor along with my major as something to fall back on as a last resort.

   For background my father is a very religious person and tried to raise me as such. He is the choir director at his Catholic church and as such is very involved with the church, and has been for as long as I can remember before he even before he acquired his director job when I was around 8yrs old. He has always had a a temper, and it's was almost always an all day ordeal when he did flare up. I'll get into it a bit more but I feel it's worth noting that I myself am not religious for various reasons, however my father essentially taught me to hate church in the way he treated me and his job, and I feel he was the first step in me trying to push away from church. Additionally, my parents were never married. I was an oops baby at the beginning of college because my mother had low self esteem and caved in a few months into a relationship with my father. He allegedly had a hard time staying faithful and threw up a myriad of red flags including his temper and superiority complex as Mr. ""Always right no matter what"", and so eventually my Mom said fuck this, gathered me up and took off. She still however granted him partial custody as even though he wasn't a stellar father, he was still my father and she wanted me to have what she didn't (my biological maternal grandfather left before my mother was born, I didn't even knew he existed till I was 13) She tells me often that she regrets that but she was trying to do what she thought was ultimately best for me in the long run. 

       My first memory of my father I can recall is him dragging me away by the pressure point on my shoulder because my tired 2nd grade self saw people lining up for communion and I automatically lined up too, as school had just started again and I was only 10% there because church was early as fuck. From there it ranged from making me stay up till early hours of the morning doing chores I didn't finish because a kid can only manage so much on her own. Don't get me wrong, kids should contribute and do chores around the house. But I was a live in maid at this point, and then he would get angry and have a fit when my grades slipped because I didn't have time for homework or studying when I was too busy learning how to properly hang his dress shirts and fold his slacks. 

       Back to the church bit, part of his job as a choir director was to arrange and print out worship aids, which where multipage paper pamphlets with the music for the day on it. My father had this unfortunate habit of putting off the 200+ pamphlets that needed printing and stapling until a few days before, which sucked because I spent my nights with him stapling till my hands where raw and sore, but he did this for holidays as well. The first time I remember absolutely hating myself was Christmas morning, I was 10 years old. Before the sun had even risen, I wasn't sleeping or with my family. I was sitting alone, in a cold dark classroom already hurting from how many worship aids I had stapled while my dad was yelling at me that I wasn't stapling fast enough. And I cried. I hated everything, especially church and his stupid job in it. I was so tired. Because of this I learned to hate the holidays. The entire month leading up to Easter and Christmas was a perpetual anxiety attack every time I had to see him, because from the moment you woke up to the moment you feel asleep you were walking on paperthin ice. 
        
        Between his temper, his procrastination, and his need for me to be absolutely strong and perfect in every possible way for the sole reason of me being his one and only child and he had a reputation to uphold, I developed I lot of inferiority and stress issues. Had I not started dating my boyfriend now husband when I was 14, I firmly believe that I would have grown up to be a total mess (my mom fought tooth and nail for me to be able to date as in my dad's eyes I should only date man of his choosing at 17) I mean I'm not perfect now and I still struggle with stress, but my husband has helped me grow a backbone and develop a sense of self worth and self care. 

   There's a shit ton that happened in middle/high school that made my father and I's relationship worse, and my mom couldn't do much as he would just get angry and take it out on me. But the biggest one is when I was 15 I was sexually assaulted by a childhood friend. To avoid details it didn't get all the way, but it got terrifyingly close before I got away. The next day, as he is the one who picked me up, before even asking if I was okay or what happened the very first thing he asked me still bruised and hateful was ""Did you start it?"" From that moment I decided he would not be involved in my personal life if I could help it. I did not fuckin start it, but all that matters is who wouldn't stop it. He didn't even want me to contact the police?? The one time I really genuinely needed someone to protect me and he makes it feel like I'm at least partially at fault and that I'm being stupid.  He doesn't know I spent two years in correspondence with an attorney, several other girls this man had affected, and the court to pin him down and get him locked up(We did, get fucked Ayden)

    I can't remember the last time I told my father that I love him and actually meant it. I mean I do care about him, just in the way you do about a nice neighbor youve met a few times but was pretty cool to you. It eats at me that I don't love my dad but I just don't. How do you deal with it? 
I'm sorry for the uber  long post but this has been ridiculously cathartic. I need to know if I'm justified in having this kind of lifelong grudge about how I was raised or if I'm being stupid.

TL;DR I have a very distant emotional relationship with my father and I feel bad that I just don't love him, despite having a questionable childhood",20Jun2019,1

830,"Hi Reddit. I know this is gonna be long, I know it might not be worth the read, but spare scrolling past if you dont care, it just feels good to get this all off my chest. 
TLDR; I got drunk, we kissed, he got freaked out, I got drunk alone soon after, wouldn't stop texting him, and now I am blocked from everything and my only form of communication is a letter by mail. I want to send him one to tell him I was secrelty an alcoholic and this is why I acted the way I did, I'm now sober attending meetings and want him back in my life. I dont know if it's appropriate or not. 

It's been a week, but this is still eating me alive. I'm a 20F. I have a best friend who I'll call Jacob, 20M. This friend has been through a lot, moved from our small city of Speedway in Indiana to make it big in the car business, to Los Angeles, got robbed, hit by a car, his heart ripped out (I had no idea of any this until the night he came back and we were drunk. Otherwise I would've been on the first flight over there). This was his first night back after a hard, long 9 months of not having my Pokemoning-Buddy and we decided, fuck it, we are gonna get stoned and drunk out of our own brain cells. I thought I'd never see this guy again. I still called him every night to check up. This would turn into 7 hour calls about the good old days of crazy times in Indiana, these conversations never took a bad turn. Before he came back, I was dealing with alcoholism (professionally diagnosed). No one knew that but myself. That night, I went too far at a party with him. I had 2 fifths of nasty vodka, a little Sailor Jerry, continuous hits off of a bowl. I can't remember what I said to him, my last memory is him holding me and rubbing my back because I was crying, but apparently it led to the point where we made out, and he put my hand on his penis, but nothing went past that. That's the only recollection I have because it stuck in my mind, everything else is just a spinning floor and Joji songs being blasted, while my friends screamed over beer pong in the next room. We have never had sexual tension or romantic vibes, ever, in the 7 years of friendship between us. Of course I lost my shit, I had a boyfriend of 5 years to think about. What if I loved my best friend? I realize now I didnt, i was just drunk, sad, and found comfort in him. The day after, I hardly remember. We left our friends house and he had to drive my car home for me, because I was still drunk at 7am. I came home to an empty tank of gas. I'm assuming we took a drive around the city so I could sober up and we could plan what we were doing about this next, because I found like 5 receipts on my bank statements from 3 different cities in Indiana. We had plans to go to a graduation party the day after, these were set in stone for about a month. That day, I arrived, and I text him, and asked him to walk in with me (it was at his neighbors house). All of a sudden, he was a different person. He would've never got rude or snippy with me and suddenly it was, ""I cant be there all the time for you, you've got to grow up and just walk inside"". Weird to me, but I figured he was just hungover and irritable. He finally showed up to the party, and he text me that he needed space, I was freaking him out and smothering him, no one calls or texts him as much as I do and it was overwhelming, he wanted me to leave the party. This instantly broke my heart. I knew our friendship was ending. I have a tendency to freak out when people exit my life because I am terribly afraid of never seeing them again. I shut my mouth. Stop texting. Did what I could do best at the time, went home, finished off some Jager, cried my eyes out, and sent way too many desperate texts. He said this made him uncomfortable, it was strange, and it wasnt right to keep invading the space he needed. He begged me to stop so he wouldn't be drove to block me, but, I had no self control. Reading these messages sober I feel sick and like a freak. But in my drunk mind I was a sad little girl that needed a verbal hug from her stand-in big brother. He has me blocked on absolutely everything. You name it, I'm blocked. Google Hangouts, phone number, Discord, Xbox Live, Switch Online, Pokemon Go, Facebook, Instagram, the whole nine yards. I'm heartbroken. I got engaged amongst all this rubble (my fiance is fully aware of the situation and we talked it out in therapy), and the first thing I did was dial ""Jacob"" into my phone to call him. I knew if we were friends he would be so happy for me. He would be happy I attend meetings. He would be happy I admitted my problem to him if I did. I dont know how to ever mend our broken friendship. I have a letter written out and was going to mail it to his house, but i realize hes gonna think that's too far as well. I am lost and i wish someone had the answers of if he will be in my life again.",20Jun2019,1

832,"Hi reddit,
Not sure where to begin so I guess I’ll start off with a little about myself. I’m a 22 year old male, I’d say moderately attractive and in fair shape. I don’t workout but I’m not unhealthy either. I’ve had a lot happen in the last two years within my family but I wouldn’t necessarily use that to blame for my depressive state. I have a hard time opening up to others about my sexual activity (or lack thereof) considering I’m one of the last of my friends to lose my V Card. Hell, I have a hard time opening up to others about myself in general because my brain doesn’t translate very well to what I say. I have never been in a serious relationship and my anxiety only worsens as time goes on since I have zero experience with females. I’ve tried a few dating apps to no avail. I’ve met some great girls over the years and felt that there was some kind of connection but it never progressed. I try not to dwell on the past too much as it’s unhealthy and leads to nothing but negative thoughts. I have tried talking to close friends about my problems but it’s always the same answer (just talk to women and get laid, it’s that simple apparently). I have a very hard time stepping out of my comfort zone because I’ve never experienced any close intimacy or have ever had any drive.

Often times my first impression of somebody is negative before I have even given them a chance. I don’t start conversations with strangers and I DEFINITELY don’t approach any women that I may be attracted to. I’m a good person and all of my friends tell me how witty I am but it’s like I’m a totally different when I try and have a conversation with an attractive female. I feel awkward, and I know they notice it. I know that the only way I can break away from this social barrier is on my own but I’d appreciate some advice from anyone that has been in my situation, anything helps. Even if it’s just a little motivation or knowing that there are others who are currently in the same position as I am. Also, if anyone has any good books they’d like to suggest on this topic I’d love to hear it! And if you must be an asshole, please leave those to the dms. I’d like to keep the comment section clean as there are others who may relate to my post. Thanks!",20Jun2019,1

835,"(Background info I guess) My mother and father were never married and they had me at a young age. They broke up when I was 5 I think and their relationship with each other has been really bad. He took my mother to family court a lot over visitation rights/co-parenting and my mother never kept me from him nor said that he couldn’t see me. There’s only been one instance when she said he couldn’t but that’s because I was grounded and me being young, I would use my dad to escape the trouble I got into sometimes. Because of that, he would just take her to court, threaten to take her and etc.
My mother put him on child support and before, for the longest, it wasn’t through the court system so he was able to change the amount he could “afford”. Now it goes through the court system and it automatically takes from his check.

Now, since April, my mom, my little brother and I plus my little rabbit have been homeless because of our landlord sneaking into our apartment and then threatening my mother. My mom decided to leave as soon as that happened. We have Section 8 and where we live, landlords have been saying no/finding a way to say no as soon as we mention this. This is why we’re homeless and now we ran through our money.

I’m not sure if I should tell my father I’m homeless. I’m not sure what he could do for us. I’m not sure what he’d say. I’m not sure if he would even consider aiding us a bit more financially. I’m not sure if he would gossip to his family about our situation. I’m just not sure if he can even help because he always says he doesn’t have the money but his job pays him well.

837,"I decided to foster a couple of cats. First cat I fostered was great, so great that I actually want to adopted her.

The second cat is the problem. As soon as she got out of the box she was hobbling and she looked really ill. The organisation leader said that she was ‘recovering from an illness and a UTI and might have a sore throat too’.

We’ve only had her a couple of days but it was very clear to us that she was not okay so today we took her to the vets and the vet had diagnosed her with multiple tumours down her throat and suggested euthanasia. We were still shocked by this news but it made sense, she couldn’t eat solid food, her voice was rough and almost non existent and you could feel lumps on her throat.  

We contacted the organisation leader (this organisation is small and local) to tell them the news but to my surprise she told me that she just had to ‘live out the last of her days comfortably ’ hinting towards the notion of euthanasia was not on the table and that I look after the cat until it dies ‘naturally’ or she would give it to someone else to look after. I said that she has lumps in her throat that need to be treated and she said ‘some things are untreatable and the cat will live with it’

This cat was suffering and you could see on it’s face that it’s in so much pain and I don’t know what to do. The only way she would get euthanised is if we adopt her but the adoption fee and humane euthanasia would set us back at least $400 which is money we don’t have. 

I decided to call animal control and tell them that the organisation leader refuses to treat or euthanise her but they will only take action if I give the cat back to her and I know that she wouldn’t treat or euthanise the cat. I’m worried about giving the cat back to her as I won’t know what happens to her from the moment I hand her back. 

I’m unsure of what to do from here on, I kind of know that I should do the latter option but I would just like some opinions",20Jun2019,1
838,"Litlle bit of back story:
I have 3 roommates, my girlfriend one of my friends girlfriends and my best friends girlfriend. 

We were all looking for a change of loving situation and our price ranges and times matched up so my girlfriend and I moved in with my friend's girlfriend and my best friend's girlfriend hereon known as fgf and bfgf. My gf will be known as gf.

Fgf and bfgf already lived together and gf and I lived with another roommate. Bf and bfgf got a dog about 9 months ago, just a puppy but he's a bull terrier pitbull mix and very high energy, he has had some behavioral issues but from afar I was told they were working on it and it was getting better. Fgf was pretty much done. She didn't sign up to have her own dog she just was okay having a dog in the house and before we all moved in there was tension between fgf and bfgf because of the work allocation with the dog. Gf also has a pitbull that was very high maintenance as a puppy but is now 2 and very mellow, just needs love and basic care (walks and to be played with a few hours a day). 

Before we moved in we introduced the dogs to make sure it would be okay. They got along fine, there was a lot of humping from the puppy despite them both being fixed but we thought that would subside with time.

We moved in and it became clear that the puppy (barely a year old as of move in) was not being taken care of well and that's why his behaviors we're not changing. He is in his crate on average 22hours a day just being let out to eat in the backyard be played with a bit and goes right back in. Bfgf and bf both have full time jobs and I get it's hard but that's not okay. The humping had also turned into the puppy knowing on gf's dogs ear to the point of her helping when he bit hard or pulled on it. He bit anyone who tried to separate them. Because he was a little less than half her size we hoped he would stop when she told him no enough times but gf's dog was too well trained and did not fight back at all just wimpered and cried for help. 

They had been getting fed together and time to play together but bfgf was watching them one morning and they got into a bad fight. gf's dog was bloodied and has a few permanent scars. Bf/bfgfs dog has no marks because gf's dog did not fight back. We separated the dogs and their times out now. Gf's dog is out almost all day in my office with me having a good time and getting plenty of exercise every day. But if I don't let bfgf/bf's dog out his time in the crate is 22 hours a day at least. So I feel obligated to take time to do that for him so he doesn't go crazy.

I sat down with them and made an excercise schedule but bf has ignored it completely and isn't showing up. Bfgf is exhausted. Everyone in the house but her and I want the dog rehomed. I want what's best for the dog which is probably being rehomed but I don't know how not to end my friendships and tell them that. So I've been trying to take care of their dog as best I can, take care of gf's dog as best I can and have my life. It's not working.

We involved another friend they are paying to come take their dog to the dog park 2x a week but today he got into a fight at the dog park. Some because he isn't well trained and some because yesterday I didn't take him out because I didn't have time. No one walked him at all. Just 22 hours in the crate with food and bathroom breaks

It's not fair to my other roommates to fight against them on rehoming

It's not fair to me that I have to give up most of my day for not my dog

It's not going to be easy to hold onto a friendship that is important to me and tell him to get rid of his dog

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

i dated two boys between then and now.

apparently he went on a triple date in that time, told me it was nothing, but he changes the story.
he also hangs with girls who like him that he works with.
on top of that, he’s close with one of my female friends and he sees her much more than me.
we talk and she’s attached to him and tells me things like “ i haven’t seen archie in a few days, i just want to see archie, he makes everything better “. i’ve been her friend for 15 years and she prioritizes my boyfriend.
he had a thing for another girl whilst being with me, and claims they don’t talk anymore, but i’ve physically seen him text her. 
i’m the girl to change my feelings constantly.
i’m often off and on with boys and it’s not something that i want to feel, it’s absolutely terrible knowing that you’ll wake up and not know how you’ll feel about your loved ones the next day.

I can’t ever like him back because I just don’t like guys, and this girl, let’s call her Liz, won’t ever like me back because I’m pretty sure she’s straight. 

However, Liz told me a year ago she thinks she might be bi which is why i started to like her in the first place, and recently we’ve been getting super close and she would do and say things that are sus like cuddling with me at night when i sleepover and it’s fucked me up and only made me like her more.

847,"I've always had trouble with my memory, but recently when I realise how much I've forgotten I feel like I've woken up from sleeping. Like how when you wake up from sleeping you can't remember dreams. I can barely remember what I did a few days ago and everything else i can't remember. Of course I have a few prominent memories (most of them I can't remember when or where they happened) but that's it.

849,"  My husband and I have been together for nearly 6years, since I was 14 almost 15, and we've been inseparable. Even through nearly 3 years of long distance while he served in the military (I moved down to Texas with him for the last year of his contract shortly after graduating). 
 
I worry that I am overly dependent on him, but at the same time I don't really think so? I'm a very introverted person, to the point I don't really have my own friends, but that's completely by choice. I don't need people to be happy. Maintaining a friendship that is good and healthy for both parties is kind of tiring for me, and maybe it's because I haven't met that ""special bestie""? Either way, I get along flawlessly with his friends and they come and hang out from time to time which covers any social needs I may have. I am happy with just him and our several animals, especially our velcro German Shepherd. 

I feel different when I'm away from him at work, but not like I'm going to break down or I can't live without him. Just different. I'm not around the person who always makes me happy but I'll see him after work or this weekend so it's whatever. Of course the longer I go without seeing him, like when he went on a week vacation with his family out of state, I felt sad that he was gone and a little more nervous being on my own. But I was also happy that he was going out with his family and relaxing on a beach somewhere. He deserved that vacation more than anything, especially having just left a 48hrs/week warehouse job.

He can sometimes be the sole influence on whether its a good day or bad. He can turn around any bad day, but if he's in a bad place I'm going to be unhappy as well and do what I can to make him better. 

My Father is always saying I'm too dependant on him because he's about my only human contact aside from co-workers and family, but it's hard to tell what's real concern and what's him being spiteful that his daughter got married before he ever has and that her husband of choice doesn't let her deal with his controlling narcissistic bullshit. 

TL;Dr I choose to have no friends and socialize mostly just with my husband and his friends, I feel kinda sad when I'm away from him but not in a world ending kind of way, I just really enjoy being around him. I'm paranoid that maybe I currently am or am showing signs of becoming codependent, but the other part of me thinks that's mostly just what its like when your with the person who's best with you",20Jun2019,1
850,"I’m diagnosed with severe depression &amp; have regular doctor appointments every 6-8 weeks for medication management. I have a friend who has been diagnosed with bipolar depression &amp; when I mentioned I think I have it, she went off on me saying I don’t know what it’s like. At the time I thought maybe she’s right, Maybe I’m just depressed. But I have this same cycle I go through. One of my “highs” was a few months ago around the time Marie kondo was super popular. I threw away a lot of my stuff (most of it wasn’t useful) and I was going to the gym daily, eating healthy, I was all around having a “normal” daily life. Well I felt like this for probably a month or so and then I went downhill again. I got so bad I decided I needed to go back on an antidepressant because I felt no pleasure in anything but I was still getting out of bed and doing things, just felt miserable doing it. I got on medication and had a good two weeks or so of feeling genuinely happy. I described it to people as feeling normal for once. Well Father’s Day happened on Sunday &amp; it was my first fathers day without my dad being here. I was able to work that day though I broke down crying before &amp; after work multiple times. The next day I felt so empty. I went to work and before I even started working I had to tell my manager I didn’t feel well (working in food they send you home if you say you’re feeling sick) I went home &amp; stayed in bed the rest of the day. The Next few days I had work I found someone to cover my shifts &amp; Ive been in bed the last few days. I feel miserable. I can’t get up to do anything I’ve been eating once a day around 5pm when I finally get hungry to the point I need to eat. It sounds gross but I haven’t showered in days. 
I’ve never had this low of a “low” point in my depression. I don’t feel suicidal, I just feel empty. 

I really would like to find a way to get away and focus on my health and well-being but I don’t have the money for a vacation. I was looking into mental health retreats and recovery centers but my insurance isn’t covered at all the ones I looked at around me. I looked into psychiatric wards around me though my so called “family” already thinks I’m the fucked up one &amp; I’m scared of what they will think when they find out. I am 18, I live at home with my grandpa so I would have to explain where I’m going. I’ve thought of joining the military to get away but I’m not in the best shape. I’m trying to find something low cost like a volunteer thing around the country where you just pay for your travel fees, something like that where I can get away from everyone I know &amp; focus on myself and make a difference doing it.",20Jun2019,1

852,"A couple of months ago I thought I had majorly screwed up at work and it made my already pretty bad anxiety even worse. During one of these anxiety attacks I started applying for new jobs. I ended up being flown out by one company for an interview and was extended a verbal job offer this week. I had a nice chat with my potential new supervisor and he mentioned HR still needed to do background checks and education verification. This confused me because I didn't finish college and I don't hide this fact. This job doesn't require a degree otherwise I wouldn't have applied for it.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, I looked back over the application and I had, in fact, marked that I had graduated from college. I guess my panicked brain glossed over the question or I misread it or whatever, but I marked it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do. Several friends have told me to let HR do their thing and if they're that worried about it they'll contact me about it. Someone else told me to bring it to their attention beforehand, and another told me to withdraw from the position entirely. Not only do I love the job and company, it's only about two hours from my family, I currently live about 1,500 miles away and several family emergencies I couldn't get to last year is one of the reasons my anxiety was so bad (I am currently in intense therapy and taking medication).

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",20Jun2019,0

857,"A little backstory,  my two roommates and myself signed a lease in April 2018 through the end of April 2019, a whole two pager.  My landlord is very laid back and has a lot of properties, we literally pay rent via venmo.  I texted my landlord twice in April about reupping for another year.  The first text he responded and said he would get it to us.  After the second text he never responded and we continued paying him every month assuming we had no obligations.

Fast forward to last week I was offered a great job I did not see coming and accepted putting this living situation in a little conundrum.  I accepted to start on July 15th and plan to move into an apartment in mid August.  I notified my roommates on June 11th that I had accepted the job and planned to have all things out of the house by end of August.  They are currently pissed saying that my verbal to them that I had initially planned to stay another year is screwing them royally and think I owe it to them to pay rent through end of September/October maybe?

I feel I am totally in the right by giving them nearly 80-90 days on basically a month to month house but I I understand in a way that it sucks for them, but feel asking to pay that long is honestly childish and selfish.  Thoughts?",20Jun2019,2

His family seems to be breaking apart from what little I know of it, as it seems his father is leaving his mother.

He has a YouTube channel (no I’m not saying what it’s called) and posts videos that aren’t just cringy they are super painfully cringy. To the point of almost disillusion, there are two in particular that worry me, firstly is one that asks if anyone is there. It is about 8 1/2 minutes long, it has no sound and just has him hold his head in his hands for the duration, muttering something.

There are no likes and about 11 dislikes. With comments saying that there is no sound and that he just wasted their time. It turns out the reason there was no sound is because it was a live stream that NO ONE turn up to.

The one that sort of made me concerned is one of his latest where he is with his brother and they talk about how they are going to teach you how to make fu*king explosives, they seem to be referring to simple chemical flashes but they are both Uber creepy and one person commented “can you teach me how to make c4” the boy liked this post and comment something along the lines of sure thing!

861,"I rent a house with two colleagues. One has a dog, and I have two cats of my own. 

Way before moving in with these colleagues, my cat had a litter of kittens and I gave one to someone I knew in middle school who I talk to every few years. 

About 2 months ago he messaged me out of the blue to ask if I could watch his cats for a couple weeks. He'd been kicked out of his mother's house, where the cats we're residing, and was couch surfing. His mom was going to be doing home renovations. 

I said sure, if something happened and I needed my kitties to be watched for a little bit, I'd want someone to show me the same kindness. 

He dropped them of on May 12th with an almost empty bad of food and $10 for helping with ""more to come"". Their first bag of food cost $12 and I had to get it a few days later. Already I'm out two dollars. Whatever, I told myself, it's just for a few weeks. 

Now, they have to stay in this one room that we have because the dog we have is not cat friendly. They've recently clawed up the expensive bass amp that belongs to my roommates and are peeing on and staining the hardwood floor - nevermind constantly tracking litter everywhere and spilling their water, making a nice pasty white liquid that dries into white dust on everything. 

The cats eat a ton and are already almost done with their second bag of cat food - when I'm currently out over $15 including his initial $10. 

We're almost at 6 weeks and I've been messaging him almost every day and he keeps saying he has no ETA on the renovations and that he can't take them because he's couch surfing. He said he's ""looking into other options"" but nothing yet.

The poor cats meow constantly because I can't give them the attention that they deserve, and they've also been in the same small room for 6 weeks. 

What do I do? This guy is currently couch surfing and I don't think he makes a lot of money, so i can't ask him to reimburse the amp. Help please!",20Jun2019,3

868,"Hey!

How would one go about reaching out to ""celebs"" or such (regardless of popularity). I am well aware that some frequent reddit, some have twitter/instasham (and indeed do read it), but mostly it's not reliable on average. If I had to, I will pick out an example why (so hopefully it can better picture as to which type of contact I want): I was interested in reading an autobiography or somesuch of Peter Dinklage.

He is a person with *visible* difficulties, yet from the few videos I saw, he seems like he has a fine personality. A Keanu Reeves of dwarves, if you will, even tho I'm not into memeing. I am genuinely interested in **personal** struggles and how he overcame them, but not for any self-improvement but rather - it seems interesting and I'm curious. There are a couple of people that fit this bill, but among many fields there are plethora that pique my interest, and every once in a while I encounter one.

So, if one was interested in such a story from a person or entity (be it a business or otherwise), how should one approach the matter in trying to contact them about that? Keep in mind that I am no journalist, no writer, no psychologist, no fan, nor a rich person, and most definitely i am a nobody with zero connections.

With that said, how does an average Joe approach the person/entity in question or their representative? As you might expect, the more popular they are the harder it seems to get the correct contact information. Google is flooded with ""hire this hire that"" results, and while I don't expect an answer (well duh) I would still prefer my question to be filed correctly. Like an up-to-date site with a list of agents and emails that I missed, or something like that.

All in all, it's nothing grand nor nothing important. Some people or businesses (mostly indie tho) have a ton of interesting things to share so I'd like to, having read some of them, try to reach out and acquire more, or rather request/propose for some kind of exposition on the matter. So from person/business A thats unpopular and has barely any considerable traffic all the way to person/business Z with a huge following (like the actor in the example I gave), how would one correctly approach each and every one of them?
