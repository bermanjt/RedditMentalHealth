0,"Let me start by clarifying what I mean regarding my financial position. I'm 23 years old with a credit score falling below 600. I have accumulative debt of roughly $7,000 (rounding up given that some of these have been in a collections status for years). I also have several accounts that fell into a written-off status, so while I don't owe anything, they still sit on my credit report and affect my score. My oldest items were posted in 2016, so I would still have many years to go for them to fall off.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a great job with great benefits and am soon to receive a raise. This will put my annual salary at roughly $39,600.00. Regardless of that, because of my expenses and cost of living, I find that I am almost never in a position financially to start paying off my debts, and also find that they continue to increase. I have a few loans opened from loan companies that have me sitting at 150% APRs and higher. I also can't do anything to reduce the cost of my expenses overall, as they're either as cheap as I can get or things that I can't NOT pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken with my mom about these things, as most of them we can chalk up to stupid fuck-ups from my even earlier adulthood. She also has incredibly poor financial history and has filed bankruptcy several times in her life, and in doing so she recommends that that's what I do. Most places though recommend just paying it off if it all falls below $10,000. Part of me feels like the longer that I wait to decide, the more I'll regret it since I will have to wait to rebuild my credit. However the other part of me tells me that if I do it now, I'll regret it in case I have some huge medical emergency or something that I would ACTUALLY need to file bankruptcy for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ultimately feel like I don't have any other options here because these things will likely NEVER be paid off, but as I'm getting older, it becomes more and more difficult to try to better my life without having the good credit that I need to do so (renting a house, buying a car, credit cards, etc.). I really hope I can get some sound advice here, because I'm sick of sitting and doing NOTHING about it. ",16Mar2019,1
1,"I was jokingly saying to a couple of people in a large discord server about sending thigh pics if someone got me a knife. A couple moments later I get sent a dm and tells me to check my steam ACC. I soon realise that someone just gifted me this really beautiful butterfly knife in my steam inventory. I sent him thigh pics in the end. It wasn't anything too revealing it was just... Thighs, in thigh socks with a skirt. I'm also slightly below 18 (he's a year older than I am) so this isn't illegal by any chance is it?? I know for a fact I'm never sending nudes (since it's just so risky and dangerous) but legs and thighs don't seem too much, right? I just need some kind of reassurance that I'm not pushing myself to some path where I'll be selling my gender for free crap in games. I definitely know that if someone wants to give me something (especially an item that expensive) i have no problem sending thighs. Is this wrong? Im I giving other female gamers a bad rep by doing this? I love csgo, it's been my go to game for years so it's not like I just want to add onto my inventory just so I can showcase knives and skins but at the same time what I did felt really immoral yet I have absolutely no problem doing it again. 

Did what I do sound wrong? ",16Mar2019,1
2,"I’ve been a loner for the past 3 years. I had like 2 “friends” but we didn’t really chat a lot. Not to mention they’re online friends but I’ve known them since I was 14. I’m 21 now. I have no money, no car, no friends. Absolutely nothing. 

December I started dating this girl I met in November. We had so much in common. She was perfect and she pulled up when I thought all hope was lost. She was just different from the girls I’ve dated. She actually listened to me. She seemed just as into me as I was into her. I guess I was stupid for calling her my soulmate and wanting to spend the rest of my life with her but I swear it wasn’t the desperation talking. I’ve never felt such immense emotions for someone before. So you can probably imagine how distraught I was when she wanted to break up with me.

It’s only been a day and I can’t stop crying. It’s kinda relieving because I feel a bit human since i haven’t cried for a long time. But this shit hurts y’all. I can’t imagine living without her. She wants to be friends but anyone with a brain knows what that means. I visioned having a family and everything and now she just wants to be friends. I wasn’t being overbearing or anything like that. In fact I initially wanted to just be friends with her.  But I felt like I couldn’t let her slip away.  

Anyways, I feel like I’m going to do something very stupid. I can’t see life getting better from here. Im completely alone. Nobody to hang out with or vent to. Nobody will probably respond to this either. I just feel like utter shit. I just don’t want to hurt anymore. How do I move on?",16Mar2019,1
3,"In the past year i had 2 jobs that were filled with people who endlessly speculated on every small insignificant detail of another persons work ethic,  attitude, wardrobe, life style, be it interpersonal or celebrity gossip. The first job was in a kitchen, where the owner couldnt stop speculating on the cosby rape allegations, which was personally trigggering because i have been raped and attempted to take my rapist to court and was fully aware how tauntalizing and trumatic that process was to begin with. He would also go on and on about his sexual escapades when he was younger, including but not limited - to the time he penetrated a passed out woman who was so drunk she didnt even know what was going on. This guy went to highschool with my dad and grew up with my aunts and uncles, and to a degree glorofied my family so aside from not wanting to wine about how i was raped in fear the details would get back to my family i tried to keep my mouth shut. Its just not something i want them to know in detail about, as its a pain i stuggle to bear ill be dead before i make my family suffer that pain too. In addition to this, it was impossible not to get lost in my thoughts, and go back in time wishing i could bitch out my rapist, and his friends and family, in my own defense. And listening to this grown married man which children berate these woman and offer his ignorant speculations on rape victims and what not, made me awkward and nervous and eventually i was fired without any intervention or addressing the fact that, i was ""too slow."".

My next job was heavon sent. I was a mental health tech at a behavioral hospital and for the first time i actuallu felt like i found my place. Still insecure from the last job, i was neevous and insecure around administration and other authority figures, but i got raving reviews from patients week after week and i felt close to my co workers. The hospital became understaffed and one night a patient had to go to the hopsital for swollaowing stuff she shouldnt have. I had already worked 76 hours that week, and picked up a 4 hour shift to help a friend out on my day off. They were short as it was, so i agreed to spend a few more hours as their sitter at the hospital. When i returned the superviser for 3tlrd shift saod i couldnt go home. Not wanting to lose my job for walking out i didnt put up much of a fight. But i got put on a 1 on 1 which is qhere you have to be armslength away from the patient the entire shift. During the day, staff usually switches off taking turns every 2 hours, but nobody came to relieve me the entire night i sat in the dark an arms length away from the now sleeping patient. Nobody came to see what i needed when i stood at the door and tried to wave them down.About 15 minutes until the end of the shift, i fell asleep and the a.m. superviser caught me. I was immediately terminated.

I quickly was able to find the exact same job in a medical hospital on the psychiatric unit. Feeling greatful, blessed, and excited to learn more about being a tech and working in a hospital, i moved on with ambition and excitement. Unfortunately, what i didnt know, was that the unit had a closed in nurses station piled with miserable nurses. If they werent griping and talking shit about the patients for 8-12 hours, endlessly speculating on every tiny detail, ruminating what they felt - not what the thought in a proactive solution sense- but what they felt, biasedly about any given situation, then they were talking shit about the manager or the coworkers not on that shift. Its was exhausting. I couldnt trust anyoone. There were people who would continually ask if i needed any help, and i couldnt tell if they were genuine or had some alternative motive and ao my response was always visibly apprehensive and for whatever reason, being they were used to the conditions or normalized that negetive toxic behavior, i think it really confused them that i was so apprehensive and stand offish. Which didnt make things better. So i tried to reply upbeat, and thank ful, but politely decline the assistence. 


It was frustrating. One of the only seemingly pleasant coworkers was the youngest nurse, who always offered to help but when i accepted it she would become busy and one day i pointed out how she doesnt have to offer help if she has other things going on. After that thinga got worse. 

The duration of my employment there, i was pregnant. Toward my 3rd month i start having fainting spells, one time it happened in the nurses station in front of everyone and they wheeled me to the e.r. after that, i tried to sit down inbetween my 15 minute rounds (recording the patients where abouts and activity level/basically attendence every 15 minutee) sso that i wouldnt get dizzy. 

Well they took that as me not doing my job. 
One day i woke up, got in the shower, and apparently passed out when i got out of the shower, called in said i was running late, and i needed to finish getting ready.

They were all pissed at me. The only thing they had to do was collect vitals and they had students  that day blobbing around with nothing to do and a quarter number of patients we usually have. 

After i would pass out i would get horrible migrains. I wanted to call off but i was already feeling like i needed to prove myself because of everyones attitude towarda me, so i didnt. I wanted to try to get through the shift. Also, i was pregnant i was afraid of losing my job. 

When i got there the lights in the hallways made my migrain worse. I wanted to throw up. I asked the head nurse if i could talk to her, because i wasnt sure what to do, and she basically laughed at me, and gave me a direct ""no im workig"". I tried to talk to the staffing manager for the whole floor, not just our unit, and she said she would look into a floater, but id have to stay for the time being. After that i got worse, so inbetween my 15 minute rounds i went to the break room and turned the lights off because they were killing me. I had only had light sensitive dizzy zig zag migrains in middle school during puberty. Instead of coming in to see what was wrong with me the charge nurse came in and started yellig at me to do my job. Mind you she had not actively or passively talked to me about her expectations prior to this. And for the record, there wasnt a part of my job i hadnt done. Everything was clean, i was still assisting patients. All the patients who were out of bed were in the back office having group with the therapist when i took to the break rom to try and relieve this migrain.  I know, because i take their attendence every 15 minutes.  I came out, there was nothing to do but wait for the next 15 minutes. I looked at her and said what am i doing here, you have extra people doing my same job, i can barely open my eyes my head is pounding. 

She literally said ""you should just quit, you should just turn in your keys you obviously dont want to be here"", 
Still not giving me a second to defend myself or have any reasonable discourse. 

I was sick of crying before my shifts, yes.
I was sick of fainting and the dr not knowing why.
I was sick of everyone treating me like the enemy and for what?
I was sick of listening to endless ramblings full of harsh judgments, speculations, and constant negetivity, sure.
But i liked my job. 
I wanted to do my duties.
I did not want to be fainting, and coming in late, and throwing up, and having migrains. 

I turned in my keys. I wasnt going to play victim like i did at the last job. I wasnt going to wait till they fired me. And for her to day that, as my boss that day, infront of not just the other nurses, but also the dr. And the social workers was humiliating.

In the last couple weeks i had nurses asking me if i needed them to buy my baby.
Asking me how i was going to take care of my baby.
Asking questions they didnt care the answer to, 
Because the minute id respond they would turn around and look back at each other and start talking.

I never felt so ostricized in my life.

I dont want to talk to anyone about this bc it makes me feel like im playing the victim, 

And i dont want to be that person.

But since i left there i have this unnerving feeling that i am inherantly inadequate.
That everyone else thinks theres something wrong with me. That i drive everyone crazy.
That i am a joke. I am trash. Maybe i cant take care of this baby?

I cant get rid of their comments from my head. 
And im afraid the way they treated me, and each other, and the patients, 

Has infected me. 

I hate myself when i wake up.
You know i was really trying despite the bullshit.
My first day i walked in and they said i told people one of the nurses punched a patient. I didnt know any of the patients or the staffs name why the hell wpuld i say that? Why would anyone believe i said that?
Another day i walked in to fjnd out people suspected i was TRYING TO GET FIRED,
Only thing i was trying to do was shower and be on time and NOT LOSE MY JOB.

It just is really hurtful and i feel so stupid for letting it all bother me, the ignorant restruant owner, the inconsiderate termination, the uncalled for bullying and ostricizing.

Im really starting to hate myself for even trying to begin with. I want to give up on my dream job working with mental health. 
I dont even go to the grocery store anymore by myself, because im so afraid of people.

I feel like i dont know how to exist anymore. 
The more insecure i get, the wierder i become in social situations, and its becoming perpetual self sabotage and i cant slow it down or make it stop.

I dont know how to move on, or heal or not let this be my breaking point where i just give up.

5," So a few hours ago, I was showering, and there are times I might get masochistic tendencies, so I decided to put alot of shampoo, hand soap, aftershave and shaving cream inside my dickhole. I done it several times, for the aftershave and shaving cream part, I put alot more inside my dick, to the point where I feel stinging in the end of the dick, not in my testicles. Not that much to the point my dick is overflowing with all that hygiene products, but enough to feel as if 10,000 tiny hornets are stinging that skinny tube when I ejaculated. After I came back, I needed to urinate, but from my past experience, I knew this one is going to bad, and it was, especially when my urethra retracted and didn't allow my urine to flow out. I've held the bottom and top of my dick, desperate to take a heavenly piss. 2 hours later, coming back to the bathroom, done the same thing, still painful but successfully satisfied myself my urinating. I don't need to describe the experience, I'ma say that even with hella pain tolerance, you would still shed a tear from it. Now, I'm typing, wanting to pee again, this time, its abit more painful, I am not dealing with satan's fingernail ramming inside my urethra again without some tips. I just need to know how to release my cider from my inflamed/irritated urethra. Anything would help, and some of you guys experienced it, obviously since UTI/Urethritis exist, and the pain I have could belong to one of them. Please, my fucking bladder depends on you guys.

7,"Hello, everyone.

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this. I have never posted on reddit before, but I am willing to take any help I can get at this point.

I am a 22 year old, recent college grad. After graduating in December, I moved back to my hometown to reside with my parents. However, we recently lost our apartment and I am struggling internally. I do not have a stable place to live and I have not had one for most of my life. For the better part of my life, I have been in and out of shitty motels or worse and I am currently in a one room motel with my entire family. Our dynamic is extremely poor and the emotional abuse that me and my brother have to face is severe, especially because our father is EXTREMELY religious. My family's financial situation got bad when my father committed a crime when I was young and it led to a very unstable life after he got out of jail. Both of my parents have substance abuse issues and my mom has cancer at the moment. 

The list of personal problems I have goes on and on, but the real reason that I am listing my personal circumstances is because they are severely affecting my adulthood and my ability to grow into the person that I know I have the potential to be. I am trying desperately to turn my life around and be happy. Growing up, I have struggled so much with depression and anxiety and it is only getting worse. I want nothing more than to get out of where I am from and live my life wholeheartedly because all I know is sadness and misery.

At the end of February, I started a new job at a bank and it isn't that bad. Am I passionate about it? No. I'm more artistic than anything else. However, I have actually decided that I want to get into finance as it is stable, has lots of room for growth and honestly, it really is not that bad. I would love to do something like this and do theatre/music on the side, but I am struggling so much at work because of my anxiety. 

Today, my front end supervisor pulled me to the side because she was sensing attitude from me and, in her words, she ""doesn't do attitude"". This made me freak out internally because she is misinterpreting my anxiety for sass. I told her I apologize and that my stress is not directed at her and she said that basically, I need to stop being so hard on myself because I am making things too difficult by getting in my own way. All that did was depress me further because she doesn't understand how hard I really am trying and I don't know how to begin to explain it to her. I'm constantly freaking out because I don't have anything else to fall back on if this falls through. I can't just shut my anxiety off. I have been dealing with this since I was young. I went to counseling for it in college, but mental health services at my school were not that great and I cannot afford counseling right now. I have looked everywhere in my area for help, but I live in a small town and there are few options. I don't have insurance and I am trying to get it through my job which is ANOTHER reason why I am freaking out about the possibility of losing it. I'm scared to talk to my boss about my mental illnesses specifically because after I disclosed it at my last job, they didn't fire me necessarily but they gradually scheduled me less and less until I was not scheduled at all. Since middle school, I have struggled with depression and anxiety. I also don't want to give her my life story because I feel like that isn't her problem. I don't want to be shunned everyday at work like how my parents treat me every time I show any negative emotion.

I am terrified of losing this job. I'm terrified of not living up to my potential. I am really trying my best. This job is all I have and it is my only hope of moving out of my hometown and starting over. It took me months to even find a good job. I have no money and I want to move up and just be better and be happy. Please, I feel like I am never going to sense happiness.

I don't even really know what I am asking for. Reassurance? Advice? On anything concerning my current state?

I'll take anything. Thanks.",16Mar2019,1

11,"So my dad was diagnosed a little over a month ago following a psychotic break. He was hospitalized for a week and has been on meds since coming home. There were some nasty side effects and our home has just been...kind of really awful for awhile now. 

For the passed couple weeks though he’s seemed calmer and more consistently stable, but just now he came up to me and said “Knuc, I finally feel normal again. I haven’t been on any pharmaceutical meds in three weeks.”

Which, like...I’m so glad he’s feeling better, but it doesn’t just go away, right? I tried posting on r/bipolar when all of this first went down but I felt kind of like I was intruding since it’s not me with the illness. 

He’s been really irresponsible financially and that’s very concerning to me. We’re extremely low income and our stepmom is the main breadwinner. This has been so difficult for her and if he breaks again I’m worried she’s just going to leave. 

So I guess, my question: is it possible for him to reach a level of normalcy without meds? And how do we even convince him there’s a problem at all? He thinks he’s totally fine and he barely talks about the break. It’s all been so overwhelming and I’m out of the house as much as I possibly can because I can’t handle it.

One of the temps somehow found out the shooter had live streamed the shooting and had found a copy of the video. He whips out his phone with a big grin on his face to show us and places it in such a way it faces the whole table.

The temp decides that means he can then show it individually to those who want to watch, which is every 'man' in his vicinity. 

They are grinning, they are exclaiming in excitement and what seems like glee. They are discussing how this will bring a new breed of shooter in the future.

So yeah, I look like the shittiest person ever from the title right? Basically, my first ever job I was at for a year and a half. In that time, I worked often 50 hours a week, by myself at our busiest location, constantly got called in on my off days, and my paychecks which I obviously worked incredibly hard for were often short. It started taking a huge toll in my mental health as I often worked until 10PM then had to be up at 4 to be back at work by 5AM the next morning. Daily panic attacks were a norm for me. So I left.

Next job I got a month later. Ad said $10 and hour as a server and we all split tips. I got there and not only were there no servers, I was a cashier. Cashiers make no tips o obviously. Then they said on 7.25 an hour. However I was cool with that because I had yet to find out about not being a server and still figured a busy restaurant with tip pools and 7.25 an hour was pretty good. I found everything out and was at a loss.  I tried to stay and work but not only were they refusing to give me 40 hours a week, they lied to me about the starting wage and tips. Co workers refused to train me and would get irritated with my questions. Fuck them. I put in my two weeks. They got pissy and refused to schedule me for my final two weeks.

Find another job very quickly as I had lots of experience. This job I enjoy very much not making much money but I ignore it because I'm finally enjoying a job. Then I find out the shit news. They illegally take breaks out of checks even if you dont take one. They make you pay your tables bill if they dine and dash. Neither of which are legal. I put in my two weeks immediately. I sure as shit am not working and not getting paid for it and paying a 60$ bill because some dickheads refused to pay. Hell. THE fuck. No. Put in my two weeks.

So now, I have applications I'm filling out and hoping to get another job soon. I need advice on all this.

Am I a shitty, lazy person? If I am, is there anything I can do to change it? I there anything I can do ensure that my next job isn't shady as fuck?  I'm 19, I dont want to be the kind of person who hates hard work. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Mar2019,0

Anyway, here in the Netherlands you're only allowed to quit school if you're at the age of 18 or have a 'start qualification' (startkwalificatie). I'm currently 17 and a half, and you probably guessed it right, I'm going to drop out. I'm planning on doing a home course, Game Developer to be exact. Reason for the home course instead of going to a school is because I hate social environments. Everyone is so different from me, I just don't feel comfortable at all. Also, no schools here at the moment provide the Game Developer course, but it's also not available online so idk, I might do programming then. Either way, I'm afraid my lack of motivation will hurt me in being able to finish the course, heck, even get started with it.

All I do in my everyday life, ever since I got first PC which was like 6 years ago, is sit at my desk all day, play games, watch YouTube and Twitch, and that's it. Pathetic, I know. Personally, I'm perfectly fine with how I'm currently living, although I know it's terrible for my health, I'm fine with it. I'll probably die earlier than expected because of it, but whatever. And knowing that you need money to pay rent and the bills, means I need a job, and because I'm anti-social person, I'd like an online job, meaning I'll need some certification to show I'm capable to do a certain online job, which I don't have. And getting a regular job will be a big no thank you from me.

I think life is just not for me, I'm definitely being super negative here, but that's just the way I see it. Personally I wouldn't mind not waking up tomorrow morning, but for the sake of my mom and dad I force myself to keep on going, even if there's no end goal in sight, just walking through a thick fog not knowing where I'll end up...

Sorry for the messy post. I though I should just let out what's on my mind and what's bothering me. Also apologies for the messy English, I'm not a native English speaker, but I try my best!

I'm not expecting any of you to be able help me out here. All you friends are online and can't physically force me to get help or something. And I really can't push myself to do it myself either. But any support will be deeply appreciated, that would indeed be a nice change of pace :)",16Mar2019,1

24,"Growing up, I was never close to my sister and always argued and fought over the silliest things. It was only during college that we got super close. 

During that time, we both had our major ups and downs and we always supported one another through them. I had lots of hard times and my sister always helped me, and always bought me things, helped me with expenses when I was still in college and she started working, relationship and friend advice etc. I tried to give her advice d when she was having relationship issues, too. My sister also continued to do help me after college, especially with the life advice and occasional financial help, and I reciprocated by being a good sister always visiting for her, cooking and making occasionally, being there for her during and after her pregnancy, and being a good aunt to my niece playing with her, taking care of her, changing diapers and clothing and watching her while my sister slept. 

From my 2 years having graduated until now, I’ve been almost constantly visiting my sister and her husband every weekend, and now even though she’s much further, and I commute over an hour by public transport, I still attempt to visit her. 

However now, I’m just starting to get my life together after a long period of unemployment. I just got a new job that I’m starting soon, and really want to relax and rest before I start working. Lately, I’ve been feeling bored going to my sister and brother in law’s place and that it’s so far. So I’ve been spending more time in my city alone. Plus, ever since my sister got pregnant again, she’s been so hormonal and judgemental of my life choices and who I had out with, etc. She was always a hardline kinda person about me, very overprotective, and it’s starting to wear on me. 

My sister’s niece’s birthday party is tomorrow; and my sister is angry at me for not coming by today to begin with the prep. I told her I’m tired and will come by tomorrow, but my sister (who’s pregnant again) is like I’m sick and you won’t help me. I’m really starting to feel like her slave because even when I’m at her place she’s asks me to do stuff here and there like I’m sorry, but where’s your husband in all this? It’s like she wants me to take this place while he plays video games all the time and I’m tired of it. But I can’t be that person. Also, like my sister is becoming very clingy and needy and sometimes texts me “???” when I don’t respond for a few hours like I can’t be left alone. What’s the limit with all this? 

I need my breathing space from this all and don’t know how to ask for it. ",16Mar2019,1
26,"So I’m posting here as a last resort, I’ve talked to other friends and I don’t know what to do.

A little backstory: I met my friend, Lucy (not her real name), in preschool. She’s on the younger side of the grade, so most people are a year older than her. Now, we’re freshmen in high school, I’m 15 and she’s 14.

So Lucy has always been a nice, smart girl, does well in school and everyone likes her. Around 6th grade, she started dating a guy (we’ll call him Nick), and the relationship lasted for a couple months. It was 6th grade, so it wasn’t really serious, they just held hands in the hallway or whatever. This is when the problem really starts.

After that, she didn’t date any guys until maybe 2 months later, and from then on, she was never not dating someone. Her grades started going down, and her self-destructive habits started.

7th grade, she would only talk about guys, that’s all that was on her mind, she came out to me as bisexual (i don’t care, you do you). 8th grade, she dated a girl for a couple weeks until they had a nasty breakup. I only learned about the relationship from my other friend, Alexis, a couple weeks later, and Lucy never talked to me about it. This was weird, because we had been really good friends, and told each other everything.

8th grade was when Lucy really went downhill, around March, she tried alcohol (I didn’t know this until recently, so don’t lecture me on how I didn’t tell an adult.) Over the summer, she was constantly drunk, and at one party, she tried weed and had sex with a guy (keep in mind, at this point she’s 13.)

This year, she had a lot of trouble with depression and anxiety, and around January, she attempted suicide. She was out of school for 1 and 1/2 months on PHP (partial hospitalization.) She’s still constantly dating guys that are at least 2 years older than her, and I haven’t seen her single in a while. When I tried to tell her that what she’s doing is bad, she goes and complains to one of my friends, Jana, that I think I’m better than everyone else, and says she never really liked me.

I’m honestly really scared that she’ll kill herself or get trafficked. She doesn’t have any self preservation, constantly shows up to school drunk, and doesn’t do anything to fix her destructive tendencies.

What should I do??",16Mar2019,1

28,"My mom and dad have never really seemed that close, but they never argued as much as the stereotypical divorce-bound couple. Ever since a couple of years ago when I saw him texting another women (couldn't see what they were actually talking about), I've had a bad feeling about him. A couple of months ago I heard him talking in the basement to some woman through the computer saying ""does that feel good? Do you like that?"". I wasn't sure if it was a camgirl or a girlfriend or what but I tried to put it out of my mind. Now I've discovered that he has secret instagram and snapchat accounts and is talking to women on them. I still tried to put it out of my mind but finally i looked over at his phone today and saw him sending a kissing emoji in dms to one of these girls.

 I can't put this out of my mind and I have been so angry today. He's gone on business all of the time so he is probably cheating while he is away.

So currently we’re on vacation visiting her home country. Everytime she goes out to either visit fam or just be a tourist someplace she wants me to tag along even though other fam members are going, but I’ve been saying no. Today our entire fam decided to go to this tourist destination, I had a date planned so I said I didn’t wanna go. So she bursted out crying again. I’m so done with this. I ended up still not going so now she said I’ve ruined her vacation. 

So I guess, what’s your advice on how to handle this? I think I should move out the house when we get back home. But then I’m scared she’d blame it all on herself and then cause some health issues (which she does have).

31,"The person who I am talking about has been a friend of mine for over 10 years, and is one of my best friends. He's always been a little extreme in political and racial standpoints, but nothing too bad. At least, up until recently.

While I thought it to be common sense, terrorism is bad. Killing innocents is bad. Correct me if I am wrong here, but I think its pretty safe to make that claim.

Not to my friend (who I will call M).

In light of the mosque shootings in New Zealand, M got his hands on a video of the shooting that was taken by the suspect. We watched it together on a Discord call. What he did while the video was playing was terrible, atleast to me.

He was laughing. When the first guy at the door got shot in the head, and the shooter moved on through the rooms killing people huddled in corners, he was cracking jokes about it. He found it hysterical.

I make some jokes about this stuff too sometimes, but he was laughing his ass off. Not only that, but this was something that happened within a week, and was pretty gruesome.

I told him to calm down, and that it really wasn't that funny. M responded with:

""*Why? These people are subhuman. The want to destroy white civilization. All Muslims are radicals. This guy is doing the world a favor*."" This is basically word-for-word what M said.

I was kind of shocked. But it gets worse- he started reading the guy's ""manifesto"". He was posting snippets of it onto the Discord chat, and talking about how he agrees with what the guy was thinking. How we need to protect the white population from ""invaders"" and how important the 14 words were. (In case you didn't know, the fourteen words are ""**We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children"").** 

M has always been a bit of a xenophobe and a bit racist, but he was never this extreme. I mean, am I wrong to think that what M did was terrible? How it's awful to assume that the 49 people who died in these shootings deserved it, solely on the fact that they were Muslim? I don't think I'm overreacting here.

I started arguing with him, calling him out on his shit, but he just kept diving deeper and deeper. He started talking about how almost all Muslims practice sharia law, and that they think that everyone should be put under it. He said that Muslims want all Catholics dead, and that they think anyone that doesn't practice Islam should be executed.

I tried to reason with him, saying how that couldn't possibly be true, how nothing he was saying was adding up, but he refused to listen. He was too consumed in what he was saying to even look at another viewpoint. He wasn't acting like who I thought he was.

I was distraught. As I said, hes been a friend of mine for over 10 years. Am I in the right to try and convince him that what he's talking about is crazy? Am I even right with my conceptions of the Muslim people? I've done a lot of research on the topic, and have tried to convince him and reason with him with proof. But all he says is that my sources aren't credible, or how they are biased. I even managed to use one of the sources he gave me against him, but instead of accepting this he just deleted the source and said it was a wrong link. **What do I do to try and convince him that people don't deserve this? He's starting to seem more and more like a person who would commit a hate crime than a long time friend.**

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Long time friend started supporting the mosque shootings in New Zealand and has started to believe that Muslims want nothing but the destruction of Western civilization. Am I in the right to try and convince him otherwise? If so, how do I try and present him proof when all he says is that my sources are biased? I do not wan't to ruin our friendship, but I am not sure I can accept him if he supports these kind of things.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTE: I am a bit new to Reddit. I made an account around 8 months ago, but only started using it a lot recently. If there is a direct message system, please DM me if you think that M is right and I am wrong. I do not wan't to start any political arguments in the comments. I just want advice.***

32,"Hey everyone! I’m a 23 year-old college student who has been blessed with many great things in life.

- I have a supportive family
- I’m healthy, in shape
- I have good grades
- I have reliable transportation and live in a great area
- The list goes on and on...

The problem is: I can’t seem to appreciate it enough. I want to wake up and know how lucky I have it, but how can I start building up that mentality? It’s not as easy as it sounds, so I’m hoping someone may have some experience with this. With that said, I don’t act spoiled or anything - I feel that I’m a kind and genuine person but may need to grow on an internal level, if that makes any sense.",16Mar2019,2
33,"A good friend was in a bind and asked me to hire her for a contract job (with possibility to extend) at my company. It is a similar role to mine but not as senior. She was not really qualified but is a good friend and was desperate, so I helped her rewrite/heavily embellish/lie her resume and prepped her with questions (I was the person narrowing the final candidates for a final interview, so she was going to get to the final round).  She’s also a good talker and has charmed her way into jobs before. 

It was only later when she ended up getting the job that I found out that it pays a lot more than my role (think double)— likely because it’s a contract role. 

So now, while part of me feels like I did a good thing by helping a friend in a bind, the other part feels frustrated that someone so unqualified got this great opportunity/compensation( one that I absolutely enabled and made possible) — without really deserving it. I feel a little salty too because I’ve been working my butt off in this industry for a decade to get to this position while she got it so easy... and yes, I know I MADE IT HAPPEN to an extent but I can’t help but feel a little resentful. I feel upset that she put me in a position to vouch /sort of up sell her non existent qualifications. Am I being a bad friend? Is this rationale to feel this way?",16Mar2019,5

I told her we have a cat and she said “I fucking hate cats they always get in my shit and I’ll pound it if it gets near me.” She then asks which room I have and says she knows the downstairs one is the biggest and says she needs to take my room because she gets “fucking claustrophobic in small ass rooms.” 

She also has a toddler. All of her Facebook posts are extremely racist, homophobic, and allude to serious drug use. My lease is super strict and the apartment complex doesn’t care about residents. I don’t know what to do and I’m freaking out please help me!!!!!!! ",16Mar2019,6

62,"So I work at a help desk at a retail store. A man with his teenage son came up and asked if we could check him out. The interaction at this point was already weird as he being a little hostile and confusing about us checking him out as opposed to the cashier on duty.  He then was “jokingly” asking for a discount because he thought the store implied by having a sports section that there would be a ball pump and there was not. My associate gave him a discount on a basketball, and he was pretty satisfied. We were still joking about the word “imply” specifically. He then stated to me, laughing, that he was going to Wendy’s next and  hoped they had fries since they implied they did. And my response was that it seemed more accurate to add if they had watermelon or yogurt. I was genuinely just trying to name things off of the top of my head that Wendy’s wouldn’t have and that’s what I had for breakfast so that’s what I said without thinking. He chuckled and left. 

Associate and I discussed how weird the interaction was, and then he came back in about 15 minutes later. He asked me if I said something racist to his son, who was black, and I told him no sir. I immediately realized what I said could have been taken that way and apologized and tried to explain that I didn’t mean it in that way at all. He then got  super aggressive and started screaming and calling me every offensive name he could think of. My manager was there for this whole interaction and told him he had to leave the store. After that he started screaming at her for not getting onto me. The store manager happened to be nearby and heard the commotion and said we should just call the cops. So heard this and continued to scream while he walked towards the door pointing at me saying “Ive got your watermelon in check you just wait.” And I have anxiety and excused myself to the back of the store becaus ethis induces a panic attack. I’ve had three since the interaction just over an hour ago. 

I feel awful first of all that my thoughtless choice of words could have hurt the teenager’s feelings at all. Secondly, I have never experienced anything like this in my life and it scared me so bad. I’ve only started working at the service desk two days ago, but honestly I just want to quit because I’m scared this guy is going to come back with a gun or something because of how violent and angry he was. 

TL;DR guy at work was convinced I was being racist and made comments about how he’s got it coming for me basically. 

I’m scared and tempted to quit my new job and would like to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience and/or has any advice on what they would do in my situation. IF I do go back to work I definitely won’t engage with any customers aside from basic hello’s and transaction necessities.

69,"I’m in a training position and I was given an assignment on Monday with a very tight turnaround time (7 days). It was originally my boss’s assignment, and she had a month to do it, but she got too busy, and then a week before it was due, she gave it to me. With the full knowledge that I knew NOTHING about the subject.

Anyways, I thought the timing would be tight, but okay. But it’s not okay. I waited a couple of days to start working on it because I had so many other assignments I was juggling, and she gave me another one due on Wednesday, so I waited until Thursday to start on this one.

And it’s not enough time. For the record, even if I had started it the instant she gave the assignment to me, there is absolutely no way that I could have gotten it done in time. But my boss is still blaming me. She says I should have prioritized this assignment first, and that if I didn’t understand how to prioritize things, I should have brought all my assignments to her and asked which were the most important. She is only in the office 2 days a week, and she actively discourages her employees from coming to her with help on their assignments. 

I feel angry.  She reamed me out for not understanding how difficult an assignment was going to be, on a subject that she knows I have never worked on before. And she’s mad that I didn’t have the experience and self-awareness to know I was in over my head  (which she knew from the beginning) and how to prioritize things. And although I didn’t cry during the meeting, I cried later, and I feel that she is being incredibly unfair. 

The thing is, I can’t shake the feeling that she thinks I’m incompetent now, and that makes me very upset because I think the entire situation is due to poor management on her part. 

I would like to talk to her and remind her that I’m a recent graduate in a very technical field, with very limited experience, employed in a literal training position. I sometimes don’t have the experience to even know what questions to ask or to understand when I’m in over my head. She has a responsibility as my supervisor to train me, and be aware when she is setting me up for failure. I’m doing my best and working long hours and weekends, but she didn’t give me the tools I needed to succeed.  

Is this a really bad idea? ",16Mar2019,4
70,"So I'm in college, I've not even been here a year, and I recently moved out of my dorm into an apartment. For some reason my work ethic has just hit rock bottom. I used to work over 40 hours a week in highschool and I just can't seem to keep up with 32 hours and school. I only have 2 classes I have to show up in (the others are online) and I struggle to do that. I work in a government building doing IT (an internship) and I noticed quickly that there are no repercussions to people just calling off a lot. Unfortunately, I got into this habit and with nothing stopping me it's hard to break. When I was younger and not in school I worked a shitty farm job 56 hours a week. I just don't understand where my work ethic went. I feel overwhelmed even though I am doing so much less. 

How do I fix this? Even when I take a day off (like today when I have no classes) it just goes by so fast and I don't feel refreshed at all. Can anyone give my any advice to get myself back into the crazy work ethic I once had?

71,"Let me start saying that I live in the middle of nowhere, no houses or police around, just field and forest. We are just my parents (+50yo), my brother (11yo) and I (18F). I'm the oldest child and I tend to feel overly responsible for my family safety.

The thing is, we have been threatened to death. Several times. And have been stalked by those persons who did it (relatives we have problems with.) I have 0 faith in these people, they have literally trafficked with drugs, and tried to ""rob"" our house with knives, etc... fucking shady people. I cannot trust people after being raised watching how extended family I loved started to hate us and tried to hurt us in every possible way.

Because this we tend to be pretty wary. We got 2 security alarms in the house and the garden, cameras, motion sensor lights, windows bars, armored doors, knives hidden in all the rooms, etc...

I still feel pretty unsafe. The house has 3 floors, and I'm the only one sleeping in the middle one (the one with doors on the outside...) while my family sleeps in the 3rd floor. I feel so uneasy about this. My room has a huge large window straight to the field/garden and it creeps me out. I end up awake most of the nights kinda guarding the house because I can't relax. The idea of my family being hurt it's something I can't deal with.

Right now my father is away traveling and I heard some stuff falling in the garden (it was loud enough to wake up our cat) so I locked doors and grabbed my baseball bat. I don't know what was that and I'm so fucking anxious over it, specially since I'm the only one awake. I know it's probably nothing, but I won't sleep too much tonight. It wouldn't be the first time people tries to sneak up inside the house at night, and robs happen fairly often (failed robs few times a year, successful maybe one a year.)

75,"I had a best friend from high school. We were really close with one another, and I love him like my own brother. However, since we have grown up, we went to our own separate ways. Both of us are in a different college and we hardly contact one another. We would contact one another at least twice a year and that's enough to maintain our relationship. However, recently he has a new girlfriend. I was so happy when I received the news and I didn't think much of it, I was just so happy that he has someone whom he could share his life with. However, whenever I make plans for the both of us to catch up, he would hardly be able to make time for us. He would say that he's too busy. I must admit, he cancelled too many plans to the point that it got suspicious. But I just shrugged it off and gave him the benefit of the doubt.

One day, he had a quarrel with his girlfriend and he texted me for advice. I must admit I was surprised to see him text me and it gave me hope that we could interact with one another again. After I gave him my advice, he said he'll try it and hope that things would go well with his relationship. I was happy that we could get in touch, and I was hoping to receive an update from him whether or not my advice worked.

It worked. But he didn't tell me. I had to find it out myself by checking my IG story. I saw him going out with his girlfriend as they usually would do. It was at this point I texted him what he did wrong, that I felt betrayed to be 'used' only when necessary and told him to not forget his friends. I told him that I don't consider us as close friends anymore and as soon as he saw my text, he asked for my apology but I didn't reply him anything.

79,"Last night, I (female) was talking to one of my close friends about his girlfriend and I was making a point about how she has a really good body, and I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something along the lines of how that makes her likable and how I wish my body was like that so more people would like me. He took it as though I was trying to say that the only reason people like her is because she’s thin, saying stuff like “maybe cause she has a good personality, maybe more matters than her body.” Now in no shape or form did I mean to insinuate that that’s the only thing worthy about her, but I can understand how it came across that way and how he would get really angry and hurt about it. I apologized so many times and asked if he would let me explain it to him and he just said “I’m going to bed.” Today when I tried to call him, he declined my call immediately after one ring, so I texted him asking if he could please give me 5 minutes to explain and he said no. I apologized again, said it was a huge misunderstanding, and asked if he could tell me how much time he needed before we could talk again. He said no again. I stopped responding at that point cause I know it’s not gonna get me anywhere. I feel terrible about what I said, even though I didn’t mean it like that at all and I wish he would let me explain that. I don’t know what to do.

81,"I'm deeply conflicted and could use some objective opinions.

I recently graduated with a BA in English a little later in life than most people. Graduating was as much for the closure of finishing something as it was for the potential for gainful employment (despite no real career path). During school I worked as a barista and found I really liked the work. Magically and strangely I graduated university with negligible debt.

So just finished school, moved to a more metropolitan area, start job hunting. When I don't immediately get the first job ""in my field"", I applied at a coffee shop.  At the time it felt a little like fate. 

Apparently this hip/local/my-every-aesthetic coffee shop never has turnover. There are people who have been working there for 6+ years. And just that morning when I'd dropped off an application, unbeknownst to me they had put up a hiring message on IG. We interviewed and it seemed like it would be a great fit. 

Then, don't you know it, an employee asks for more hours and the position is no longer available. Alright, fine. Maybe not fate.

I apply to a few other cafes, scatter my resume across the web, spruce up my digital portfolio, and then finally trudge to the employment agency and get my first big kid job. As a paralegal. 

Between getting hired by the staffing agency for the firm and going in for my first day, the coffee shop calls me back. Position's back on the table (one of the baristas was going to trim bud in CA, dreamy). I decline because I'm motivated to try something new that requires me to wear more than jeans and tee shirts. 

Now most workdays I feel a little like a fool; alot like a phony. 

At the firm, the pay is good. Better than I've ever made but that's not a brag. 40 hours a week, set hours. Do you know how rare that is in food service? And if they choose to bring me on after the 3 month trial period the benefits are also generous. Adulting! The work though, my god. The work fucking sucks. Most of the time. 

Sitting at a chair for 4 hour stretches sandwiching a 30-min lunch, staring at two screens while trying to locate documents for one of the hundreds of clients who call in wanting an update on their case. Clients going through miserable times and me spouting vague legalize, having no idea what i'm doing. There's no genuine interaction between coworkers, something I'd been looking forward to. 

What it comes down to is I don't feel confident at the work I'm doing (duh, i just started) and it's frustrating that I don't feel like I'm keeping up or meeting my own standards. No one at work has actually given me negative feedback. But, it's just, without fun. The work is utterly joyless.

Then a couple weeks ago I got a call from another cafe I had applied to. The manager set aside my resume months back and when a position opened up he thought of me. In that moment, resolved to stick out the big kid job, I declined. It seemed smart to consider that at the new job maybe I was just uncomfortable learning something new. I was considering that perhaps work at a cafe only seemed appealing due to its familiarity.

Some days as a paralegal are okay. Other days I question if I have sustained some terrific brain injury without knowing that makes me  a blithering, worthless, idiot. I've come home and cried a couple times. The paycheck's pretty nice, I suppose. 

Today I got an email from another coffeeshop I'd applied to. They have a position open. Y'all, I'm really thinking about it. 

On one hand, if my objective is financial security I have alot of catching up to do. I'm in my mid-thirties and just getting started on a ""career path"". My partner, who moved here with me, has steady employment but doesn't make much, about as much as I do now as a paralegal. There's concern on my part with being able to pull my share. When he and I talked about it earlier he referred to the paralegal position as the better one, but he'll be supportive regardless. 

On the other, going back to a coffeeshop would mean moving around and talking to people. Cracking dumb jokes. The hours are more flexible and I could pursue some artistic endeavors. Aspirations include drawing and writing. I've been a contributing writer for a blog for the past 6 months, work I genuinely enjoy, but the money is pittance. And super irregular. 

Here's where I'm going to lose the both of you who've read all the way to here: I do kind of feel like the universe keeps putting barista positions in front of me. I'm not sure if it's a joke or a sign. A sign that I don't need to live life X-Y-Z and it's okay to take a pay cut if it means being happy and pursuing dreams. Maybe the universe is telling me to take a risk, put in some real work to my craft, and make it happen. Or maybe it's just time to grow up.

Or nah.

85,"Hello all,

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan. Growing up, math was always my best subject and I found it to always be more tolerable (for lack of better term) compared to other subjects and wanted to pursue it as my major. I spent two years at community college and ended up transferring here and am now in my first year here. They refused to take a lot of my credits which sucks but such is life, so I accepted the fact that—while I’m a junior in terms of credits—I will realistically graduate 2021 so I guess I call myself a sophomore.  This is important because it means I am already somewhat behind. 
Anyway, part of being a math major is obviously completely the calc sequence. I never took calc in high school since I took statistics instead, so this is my first time seeing this material which puts me at a little bit of a disadvantage compared to my classmates. 
Why I need advice is because this class, and the fear of failing this class, is driving me nuts. The way they do math here at uMich is that the exams are worth ~90% of your overall grade, and there’s three of them. I believe that I keep up good in class and understand the material just fine. I do good on homework’s and not so great but good enough on quizzes. But, I completely bombed the first exam. I got a D- post curve (roughly around a 45 before the curve). I keep having this fear that if I fail this class I will be set back so far that I’d have no choice but to leave here and maybe even stop school altogether (I know, dramatic). I’m so afraid of failing the class that I think my fear of failing is what is going to cause me to fail. I got so worked up and frightened for the first exam that it felt like I couldn’t concentrate at all and I just zoned out. I spent so much time trying to study that I just ended up wearing myself out mentally. I made tons of careless mistakes on the exam that made me really question if I even belong here at UM since it’s such a competitive school. My mom is worrying about me since it is really taking a noticeable toll on me and she says that it’s not the end of the world. The weird thing is I agree with her but I can’t get myself to just relax about it because I feel EVERYTHING is on the line to pass this class so I can stay somewhat caught up with my peers. I don’t know what to do and I’m not sure how to just not worry about this class and the final two exams but also be able to still prepare for them and set myself to pass at the very least. If I pass the class, I can take calc 2 and 3 respectively in the summer at my local CC which would be awesome. If I fail the class, I’d have to take calc 1 over again somewhere else because the calc 1 at my CC doesn’t transfer here and therefore I’d be even more behind.

86,"I’ve been trying hard to not get so mad about last minute things. I like to have my week planned out and have a schedule. Here is an example:
 I was recently let go from my job and could really use the mopey days following to spend with my BF, but he seems to have other plans. He was 100% to see me Sat/Sun but I later call him to tell him a plan for Saturday. He goes on telling me one of his BFFs invited him and another friend to a college party on Saturday and how he would rather go to that. It made me feel miserable. I trust him and care for him deeply but I’ve felt for even a while he’s been ditching me for his friends. (Similar things have happen like this before I lost my job. Its just now since I did, I’ve felt this one time hit me the most.)

What I’m trying to ask is there any advice to help me not feel so angry about something so small?",16Mar2019,0

88,"I was not that cool in high school. I got bullied sometimes. I never hit it off with the ladies. I never felt accepted. Once I got into university however, all of that changed. It was as if I had found myself. I made so many new friends, met so many women, and had so much free time. I graduated with a BS in math and now work full time for a respectable salary. I realize other people want what I have and I should be thankful, but I miss college so much.

89,"I made a throwaway for this very purpose. I am a 17 years old high school junior. My life has always been a mess. Since elementary, I was always unmotivated. I'd either play ROBLOX or hang out with friends all day rather than focusing on school. As such, my math grades in elementary suffered and I was placed in lower classes. Same deal in middle school I was a loser who goofed around and failed math and science. I had no ambitions, no dream, no hope for future. 10th grade, I woke up and took two honors classes (english and govt) and joined school clubs. However once more, I stopped giving a crap about science/math. I don't mean to brag but whenever I pay attention in either, I do exceptionally well. But I was a slacker. Had I tried harder in 10th, I could have been in advanced science/math this year as a junior. Speaking of which, I'm slipping back to my habits! I feel unmotivated once more and my GPA is rotting away. 

I wish I took life seriously. I wish I tried harder so I could be in more advanced classes. I wish I learned guitar earlier (had so much time to do so in elementary-middle school but all I wanted to do was to play games) There are a few things I'm doing right: I've made a rigorous prep schedule for the SAT, started guitar, and programming. But this will never change the years I've wasted. Meanwhile, my family and friends have surpassed me academically. 

I recently developed an interest in comp sci, but die to my lower class rigor (thanks to my shit work habits/zero motivation) I cannot major in this in any respectable school. This is on me. 

These days, I've lost the motivation to do anything. I can never forgive myself. My cousins are dentists, computer engineers, and doctors. My friends are going into good unis. What am I doing with my pathetic life?

Maybe she won't care about getting a cold sore but if I tell her she might be really grossed out and it could make it really awkward. If I don't tell her and we do kiss she could get a cold sore and be mad that I didn't tell her that I had a cold sore. My plan at the moment is to just not tell her and hope she doesn't notice the cold sore on my lip and also doesn't get a cold sore. Maybe I'm way overthinking this, it's just a cold sore.

I don’t know that much about it but Rojava is a political movement in Syria that focuses on these rights for people and the environment and he would be living in a big commune type of situation.

He’s a junior in college right now, and has already told his teachers that he’s leaving and he hasn’t gone to any classes. He’s been talking to people over the internet and he’s 100% determined that he IS doing this.

This really makes me nervous and I’ve tried to tell him that I don’t think it’s a good idea. I’m so worried he’s going to regret it and mess up his future, or even worse end up getting hurt or unable to come back eventually somehow.

He’s an adult and can make his own decisions and I know I can’t stop him, but I really like him and it just feels wrong sitting back and watching him leave everything in this life behind.

97,"Hey guys. So I’ll start with some background. 
When my boyfriend and I started dating, my family adored him. They thought he was so nice and the most considerate person. He’s done so much for me and I know he really cares about me. 

A few months ago before I moved out, my parents were mad that he stayed over late too often. They were being really controlling even though we are both adults. (My parents told me when I started college two and a half years ago that I could live with them until I was financially stable) before I started dating I told my parents that I would like to be treated more like an adult because they were always asking about my whereabouts. It got better, until I got into a serious relationship. We stayed up and watched different shows together on my tv in our second living room; apparently that pissed my control freak of a dad off to the point where he actually yelled at my boyfriend telling him that he was making me think I could stay up too late! After that, my boyfriend has not been at my house once. I moved out in January as planned, and he started nursing school.

I live with my sister and coworker in a large three bedroom apartment. I have the master bedroom because I said I would pay extra. My boyfriend has been staying with me because he started living with his dad who told him he should live with him so he wouldn’t have to pay rent during school. But his dad always puts more stress on him when he’s at home, trying to get him to do labor, like roofing and flooring, around the house. Anyway, I just was letting him stay with me so he had somewhere quiet to study. 
My sister gets really annoyed that he is there. Sometimes he’ll be there a few hours while I’m at work, studying or playing video games or whatever, which pisses her off. 

She told me last week that I need to tell him to not be around when I’m not home. Now he won’t speak to my sister either. I get that my family is not treating him very well. They’re always in everyone’s business and this bothers my boyfriend to no end. I just don’t know how to make this work because I love him so much, but I am very close to my family. 

My sister told me that she thinks he is just using me for a free place to live, that he’s using me, and she thinks he’s awful because he doesn’t want to be around my parents. Also because she saw a text from him to me that said he thought she was a cunt. I’m honestly pissed at him right now for being so mad at her. She said that it was her, or him, and that I had to choose. 

I’m really torn because I love him.  Advice? ",16Mar2019,2

105,"A bit of background - I was a normal looking kid but morphed into having an extremely ugly face around 14/15. After enduring years of severe bullying which led to self-harm and constant thoughts of suicide, as an adult (right now 36F) I have gone on to have multiple plastic surgery operations which has taken me from ""dog ugly"" to, ""ok looking"". 

The thing is, I still hate my appearance. I cry when I see photos of myself. Doing make-up is an ordeal because looking in the mirror triggers me to hurt myself. I slap, scratch and cut myself because I am so angry and disgusted by my reflection. The sense of disgust can send me into a rage where I repeatedly slap and punch myself in the face.

I have more surgery planned but I need to someday get to the point where I dont attack myself for how I look. 

I often see other plain looking people and I think to myself that I bet they don't have a breakdown and attack themselves every time they look in the mirror.

I have been self-harming becasue of hating my face since 15. I am now pretty much halfway through my life and I am afraid I will never be comfortable in my skin. I have a constant voice in my head telling me I am a piece of human garabage because of how I look.

I used to go to therapy but moaning to someone about how vile I think my face is really doesn't get me anywhere. I am afraid if this next surgery doesn't make me satisfied I'l get drunk and kill myself because I simply don't see myself living with this face much longer.

106,"I been trying to have a baby for a year and my husband has been 100% supportive but it’s now entering the time where if certain things don’t happen with my body I will have to go to a fertility clinic and they cost way to much.

(BACKGROUND)
I was married before and we tried for 7 years before going to a fertility clinic and it cost way to much.
I ended up getting pregnant from a friend who became our donor we did at home. We found out it was my xhusband who couldn’t have kids.


But now it’s me and my husband now doesn’t have any kids and I have my daughter from my first marriage where my x left my child and I with nothing and I let him off the hook so he wasn’t in our lives anymore he didn’t like I got pregnant with a girl.



So now I’m left completely broken feeling I can’t be 100% to my husband now to provide him a baby of his own.
He has been completely supportive and I love him with all my heart but I just feel I can’t.
It’s to the point where I’m not even having a period at all.

I feel he will leave me in the long run because I can’t give him a child.

Therefore I can not have anymore children. 
My doctor told me I only had a few tries to get pregnant otherwise she can not help me.

To add when I first met my husband now I got pregnant off the bat and ended in a horrible miscarriage and then I got pregnant again it lasted enough to tell everyone then I lost it. 
So I feel that was my last ever chance.



This man has been the best thing that has ever happened to me besides my daughter. I could not lose him
On top of all this his xs name and this other girl keeps popping up couple weeks ago he searched her up on Facebook and acted like he didn’t know she had a Facebook when he knew all along. Between his x and this chick who is a complete dick hopper , I feel I’m a replacement for his x and he has a crush on this adorable nerdy slut who works at the same place he did for many years he always talked about her and I knew more about her then I did his friends when we first met. With his x he never deleted they’re conversations or her old posts or conversations that had her in it.
I trusted him fully but now I seen all this I’m left alone. I no longer feel he’s my soulmate in some angles.




I’m broken and lost.
I have not one single friend in the world to talk to and I’m not sure where to go or what to do.
Any advice would help I don’t know if I even had a question. 
I just looked at this form and figured why not post anything.
I feel I’ve lost everything and I have no one.

After quite a few visits, he abruptly stopped coming.

110,"Hello all, thank you for taking the time to read this and know any and all advise will be greatly appreciated. I'm afraid this could be long, and I'll try to break it down well enough, so bare with me lol.

So.. since about November I, (24M) have been talking and hanging out off and on with this young woman (22F) and since about January we have gotten really close. Up until early February I lived 50 miles away from her, but due to several reasons I moved to the town she lives in. I also work in this town and commuted to and fro for four years. So the opportunity arouse to move in with a coworker in his apartment and I jumped at it. Since then.. of course we have definitely hung out alot more, and basically became a big part of each others lives.

She has a rough past with family issues and growing up fairly poor. So she never has had anything really stable in her life. I however, grew up completely different and have always had a stable life and good family. Due to her past I feel like she has alot of trust issues. She has told me that shes never been the type for clingy texting and not into the whole ""lovey dovey"" thing. I'm have always believed that I'm an understanding easy going kind of guy and had no problem with this whatsoever, because I feel the same way. I mean we both live our lives, and I just get where shes coming from. 

Recently tho we had a big fight and I feel like everything that shes told me contradicts itself, and ive never been more confused in my life. She was at her job one day and was really busy. So I wasnt constantly hounding her with texts. I was giving some time between them, but not being unreasonable about it. We still talked all day, but toward 6 PM the conversation kinda started to fizzle down to nothing. So I went out to eat by myself and texted her back around 8:30 PM once I got back to my apartment. She got off at 8 by the way. When I texted her, she was just really short and I knew something was up. I proceeded to ask her if everything was ok, and she responded that she was ""kinda upset it took me 2 hours to respond to her, and that it felt like i didnt care"". That part really hurt me because I have done everything in my power to be a gentleman with her. Have done things for her, bought her a few things, treated her so well, because I would love to have a relationship with her. And that was almost like her saying what I've been doing isn't good enough. It really hurt to say the least, but I kept my composure and tried to be calm and reasoning during the whole thing. I knew she was busy at work that day and chalked it up to stress on her part. (This was really our first ""argument"" we've ever had).

So after this arguement we both decided that it wasnt the night to talk about this and we could do it the next day. The next day I bought her a small gift as a peace offering. I told her I wasnt mad and would love to talk in person. She however, said she would like a day to think it all over. I agreed to this and went back to my apartment. 

The next day rolls around and we finally get to talk our argument over. It went well and no one got heated. She told me that it ""made her take a step back"" tho. That everything shes told me was true, but that she doesnt know if she can be everything that I want her to be right now. We both still want to be in each others lives. Shes been single for 4 years and says that shes used to being single, and that she couldnt promise me if we would be anything else. This of course bummed me out really bad, but I'm still happy that she still wants me to be in her life, and hang out with each other. 

So what I'm getting at... I was literally doing everything that shes asked out of me, but.. she got mad at me for it. I feel so confused and lost because everything shes told me seems to contradict itself. 

Basically I'm still going to be in her life for as long as I can bare. I'm just feeling pretty bummed out over the whole deal and looking for some reasoning on the matter from my fellow redditors. And maybe a pep talk lol.

116,"Context: all juniors have to do a large scale community service project. My team wanted to sell t-shirts and raise money. I paid for all of them, and we didn't make the money back. There's some tensions involving that, but we all agreed to be down $100 or so if it didn't work out, and I have the texts to prove it. 

The other two members of the group also started dating a few weeks ago, and have been talking shit behind my back both to friends and teachers. I also assume that they are the ones that keep reporting me to the office. I don't know exactly why she (it's mostly the girl with this drama) hates me, and I can't get people to fully explain, but I've gathered the following:

1) she's mad that I haven't done as much work in the group project (I have more hours than her boyfriend tho, and I crudely pointed this out to her. Might be part of why she's mad at me)
2) she's mad because I called her a bitch to her face (I was retaliating to everything she was doing to me. I should've taken the high ground, but I was worked up that she wanted to keep messing with me even though I just wanted to tie up loose ends and just drop it)

Potentially these, but they were kind of in the past:

3) she's mad because I wouldn't take her side in the past while we were friends (I defended a teacher instead of agreeing that a timed assignment was ""dumb."" It was a realistic essay prompt with the given 40 min time limit. She just hates that teacher, and I called her out on it)
4) she's mad that I did a group project without her (she was absent, teacher called for a group of 4, and I found other people. I didn't tell her until she asked me to share the doc the day after. She had a fit and cried/yelled until my teacher would let her do part of the project alone and still earn a 100 bc she didn't want to work with the leftover kids)

My office reports go as follows. Once for threatening to kill myself when I joked about killing myself over AP tests (a very common joke in our classes. It's uttered at least once every day, and some other girl even wrote her will as a joke). A second time when I was frustrated and talked about curb stomping the person who reported me (bc my mom freaked out at me and that just sucked). A third time for bullying, which is where I'll start.

I got called in for bullying the boy for money even though it was agreed upon, as stated earlier. I explained this to the principal, but he told me that it didn't matter because it was ""unacceptable for me to ask for money."" Granted, I didn't ask in a polite tone- I was more matter of fact, which could be interpreted as threatening? Either way, the boy had agreed, but said he couldn't get it to me until after spring break. I said that was totally fine, but went on to report me.

I kept wanting the principal to explain why it was unacceptable, but he just wanted me to admit that I was being a bully and agree to never do it again. I didn't let up though, so he was getting frustrated that I kept asking for explanations. I kept trying to explain my side too, since people have mostly only been hearing from those two. He ignored me, and eventually barred me from talking to them ever again and told me that I had to make my own presentation for the failed project- even though I had already made most of the original for the group. He then told me that if I opened my mouth again, I would face consequences.

However, when he heard that I wanted the money back to pay for a college class, he did offer to pay it in full. IDK what to make of that. 

Either way, I walked out crying and went to my physics teacher for the rest of the day. She went to talk to the principal herself afterschool, and she also told me to tell my mom to call him. I might have to stop pretending to be asleep to do that second part.

135,"For a little more context, I work in an office building that shares a kitchenette and ONE unisex bathroom, one toilet with three other tenants in the building. 

So, this is not a co-worker, and my boss didn't hire him.  

Anyway a few months ago we noticed he was continually using the bathroom and not flushing. Sometimes there's even pee on the base of the toilet, dripping on the floor. 

We know it's him because where my desk is positioned, I can see who comes in and out of the bathroom and whoever uses the bathroom after him has always reported he didn't flush. 

My co-worker and I made a sign and put it up saying something along the lines of, ""as this is a shared restroom, please make sure to flush the toilet and clean up after yourself."" 

We noticed he started flushing, so we thought we had won. 

Until this week. ALL this week. Anytime he'd go in, and someone went in after him, you walk in and just the stench of piss hits your nose...he puts the lid down, but doesn't flush. You open the lid and to your horror the darkest color piss you could imagine. 

I know it's easy to say ""just flush it!"" and I have before if I needed to go. But it's the principle that a grown ass man can't flush a G.D. toilet, knowing he shares it with several people. I don't care if you want to save water and you do it at your home. That's cool, we are in California where a drought is always on the horizon. But not in the workplace. 

So I don't know what to do. I mean, I suppose I could talk to the guy personally, but I don't know how that conversation would go. I could talk to my boss, but I don't know what he would be able to do about it...he doesn't own the building and he's not our employee. 

I suppose we could try another sign but I dunno. But this has got to stop because it's disgusting and nauseating and I shouldn't have to flush someone else's stinky piss every fucking day.

136,"**I really don't know what to do in my situation, and any advice will help.**

I am currently a freshman in a private high school. I am involved in band, which, of course, has all different grades involved. There are are few people in my school with developmental disorders (ADHD, ASD), learning disabilities, and genetic disorders. The school adjusts to what those certain students need in order to go to school with other people. There is one junior in band who has a developmental disorder. Everyone would greet him in the hallways, so I started doing the same with a smile, knowing that he was a sweet guy and saying ""hi"" to anyone could make their day.

For the first few months of school (around two), everything was going pretty smoothly. I don't know exactly when it started happening, but I noticed that the one junior boy would start staring at me from across the band room and in hallways. I brushed it off, thinking that it was normal, awkward, random eye contact that happened to everyone time to time. Later on, when fall sports began to have more serious games, our school pep band traveled to home games and played. When I would sit down next to acquaintances of mine and try to get to know them better, the junior guy would scoot closer to me. It got to a point when he would be right up against my side, sometimes even touching my leg. I would get extremely uneasy and try to move away, looking for an excuse to get up and do something. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt the guy's feelings. As time went on and he continued doing the same things, even waiting in the halls, trying to find some sort of way to discreetly follow me. At times, he would walk right beside me. More recently, he followed me into a band practice room and sat directly next to me at a piano, asking me questions and leaning over to whisper something in my ear. Again, it was *EXTREMELY* uncomfortable for me!

All of these things are still going on and I have no idea what to do. I have not told my parents. I've thought about it, trust me. It's not like I can just come home from school and say, ""I had a good lunch today. Oh, and also, I think a junior guy is stalking me because he looks at me all the time and makes me on edge whenever he's around me."" I'm not even sure what they could do about the situation, anyway. I've looked up 'how to deal with a stalker' but, as I've said before, he has a developmental disorder and I am not very sure how to go about telling him to stop making me uncomfortable without hurting him.

138,"Sorry if this doesn't make sense currently crying while writing this. I just need to vent and need some advice. My mom is crazy and my dad always takes her side. There's a lot of messed up shit my mom does (ex: pounding me on the head for not doing the dishes right) but I'm just talking about the recent stuff. About a week ago, I talked to parents about living in a dorm at least for a semester next year (I live 15 minutes away to the college I'm considering going to) I was also wiling to pay with my own money. I talked about how I'm not happy at home and feel like a prisoner in my own home.  (I'm not allowed to ride with my friends and I can't drive, I'm not allowed to sleepover at my friends house, and I have to go, against my wishes, to a religious class with a bunch of middle schoolers.) I was upset and was crying and instead of trying to imagine how I feel or at least listening to me my mom fucking laughs in my face basically implying my opinions are dumb and don't matter. A couple days later my mom took my phone for not doing the dishes, it was 6:00 and I was sleeping. I would've done the dishes at the end of the day or when I woke up. (I actually still don't have my phone, I'm posting this on my computer.) My parents get so mad when I don't do the dishes when they want too. I always tell them it will be done by the end of the day, but since their so controlling they want it done at their specific time. why? because they say so. Both my parents are equally strict but my mom is just downright mean. My dad respects me and is nice to me and I am in return. My mom is so mean to me and treats me like shit, but thinks I should still treat her with respect. This past week I've been avoiding my mom and I honestly would've been nicer to her if she apologized for basically calling my opinions a joke. Today, I said a sarcastic remark ""am I your maid?""  (in my defense every now and then she makes me do her laundry and fold her clothes) I was cooking food and she wanted me to bring it out to her. I agree I shouldn't have said that, but I was just so tired of her demanding respect from me but not giving any back. She told me to never say anything like that again and I went upstairs. A little while later my mom comes upstairs. I kid you not she grabs me, climbs on top of me and starts pounding on me and slapping me like a fucking maniac. She goes in my closet and gets a belt and hits me with it. Throughout all of this, I'm trying to tell her that beating people is not how you communicate, and I also say that she's crazy. If she's mad she should speak with her fucking mouth not her hands. And I'm asking her why I should be nice to her when she makes me feel miserable everyday. A few more beatings and she's spouting things like that's why you have no friends and other things that don't pertain to the situation. I tell her that if my dad had asked me to do something I would do it without complaining because he actually treats me like a human being and shows that he appreciates me. I'm such an independent person. I'm 16 I can cook, do the laundry, fold clothes, and I pay for my own things, like clothes. I know plenty of people who can't do this shit. I don't understand why I can't be treated with respect and like an adult. If money were out of the equation, I could totally live by myself. I'm tired of having to suppress my feelings.

Close enough that she opened up to me about her problems, bullying at school, her sisters terrible boyfriend, and tons of other stuff. By this time I felt really bad for her, and I tried to comfort her since she was really upset.

Then she told me that she had cut herself and would starve herself a lot. I'm not really good with emotions or comforting people so I wasn't really sure what to say, I made some awkward remark and cheesy line to try and cheer her up before logging off. 

Then for a while she seemed to get better, she acted cheerful all the time and didn't indicate at all that she was still upset. This could be do to my poor reaction earlier and her not wanting to damage our friendship. Unfortunately this didn't last, regularly and more recently I would find her playing really late at night, and she was back to talking about her problems and asking for any advice.

Today, I logged on and saw she was in game so I joined, to find she was playing with another friend.

144,"This past school year, my roommate has done many things that have been bothering me. I’ve been able to put up with most things, but she never takes ‘no’ as an answer.

The biggest issue right now is her telling me to join a fraternity. She joined one at the beginning of the school year, and I expressed curiosity for this other frat but have long since decided that don’t want to join any. She has asked me this past quarter that I should at least go to rush week to “check it out.” I said no because I would rather join other clubs or hobbies in my free time instead. But she brings it up more often now and acts as if I am going, sends me information about their spring rush, etc. As persuasion she says I can meet cute boys, make lots of friends, and have fun aka party!

Okay, well I told her what if I’m okay with not having those things at the moment or would rather look for them in other ways? She got upset when I said that but idk why.

The second thing is that when she doesn’t want to eat her food anymore she’ll try to get me to eat the leftovers. Honestly I don’t like eating other people’s foods in general because I personally find it unsanitary... I say ‘no’ but she asks at least 2 more times. A couple of times she’ll be upset and then throw away the food, but the other times she’ll get a tissue, put the food in it, and put it on my desk and tell me to eat it later then. So when she’s gone I throw it away somewhere else. I just get pissed because I’m not her trash can and idk why she won’t respect my boundaries.

My question is why someone would be so persistent in this way, and is there a way for me to draw a clear boundary even when I’ve already told her ‘no’ so clearly so many times?

146,"I work for the government, and I've been in my entry level position for over a year. I love my coworkers, but the management has been pretty shitty as long as I've been there. I've been very transparent with them about promoting, and even waited before applying so I wouldn't leave them in a tough spot.

My managers have good days and bad days, but one in particular likes to nitpick good workers. He recently promoted to a middle manager and has been on a power trip for the last 6 months. I would consider myself an excellent worker. I get all of my work done and then some. All of my coworkers have told me this and I've never had any major issues with any managers in my life (I'm 30) except now. He once had a formal discussion with me about being one minute late when I called my supervisor and told them there was an accident on the freeway and I'm typically a 10 minutes early person. There is basically no room to be human with this guy. You can do 100 amazing things and one really small imperfect thing, and he will focus on the imperfect thing and act like you do nothing. Plainly said, he's an asshole. 

I've been able to pretty much steer clear of this guy even though he annoys me on an almost daily basis. I told my managers I was accepted for a promotion in the same department but different office. Everyone seemed happy for me. My new manager at my new job told me that if my current managers needed to keep me a few extra days, then I could start later. I extended this offer to my managers and they said ""oh ya that would be good"" and never gave me a definite answer. Here is where the problems start.

On Tuesday, asshole manager scolded me in front of the whole office for leaving my desk to use the bathroom and not telling anyone. I've worked here over a year and have never been told I had to tell someone I was going to use the bathroom. So I nodded and took it. Two days later, I asked a supervisor if he knows if the asshole manager wanted to keep me a few extra days so I could tell my new managers when I was starting. I was told that the asshole manager had decided, without discussing with me, that he was going to request I do half days there and half days here until they could find a replacement. They could technically force this to happen since I'm in the same department, but I think he'd need some good justification and my new manager would have to agree. She did not offer this and I did not agree to that sort of arrangement as it would be difficult to learn my new job that way, and also overwhelming. I felt incredibly disrespected that he decided something about my life and my career without discussing it with me. I talked with my supervisor and he ended up sorting it out. Now today, I was pulled into a private room by two supervisors and they told me management thinks that I have ""checked out"" and have stopped doing my job properly. I asked for an example because I've actually been bending over backwards prepping a bunch of stuff so they won't t have to do it. The example I got was ""asshole manager asked you where a folder was, you told him to go find it."" which is a lie. He asked me where certain folders are kept, I told him the cabinet they are in and told him I'd find whatever he needed. According to him, I had an ""attitude"" issue because I didn't get up straight away and get him the folder without asking.

So this guy is clearly punishing me for leaving. During the meeting, the supervisors relayed that he basically said ""you should make sure you don't burn any bridges before leaving"" which sounded like a threat to me. I anticipated leaving this office on a good note, but now I feel like he's trying to start drama with me a week before I leave and I don't know what I'm supposed to do when he keeps disrespecting me and treating me like shit.

okay so my life has been kind of a whirlwind lately for many reasons, but I'll only address the ones in the title here.

so about two months ago, my mother decided to tell me (F19) that she was not my biological mother. she decided to tell me this when I mentioned I was taking a genetics class this spring. literally like ""oh btw speaking of genetics, you're not my biological daughter"". it really shocked me and she really did it in a horrible way and at a horrible time. I left for school soon after she told me and have not been able ask her any questions I have. for any wondering, my parents used a donor egg, and my dads sperm.

now, about a month ago, and a month after my mother told me this news about my birth, we found out she has stage three stomach cancer. she has been in the hospital since then, going through surgery and rehab. I won't go into detail.

the thing is, because of all of this, i feel so disconnected from my mom. shes still my mom, she raised me, but i cant help feel like i was lied to my whole life. I always made comments about my and her appearances and family history and stuff, and she never once told me that none of it actually affected me. that hurts a lot. and because shes been in the hospital, and is very weak and on a lot of meds, I cant really talk to her about any of this. I cant tell her how I feel, or ask her anything about my biological mom, or anything at all.

I'm just looking for advice on how to process all of this. I know most of you probably havent gone through the exact same thing, but even just advice on dealing with illness in a loved one, or understanding yourself when you find out you aren't related to your parent(s).

And as rule keeps his phone on silent and facedown.  Which always kinda bothers me. But I'm trusting and pretty secure. 
So fast forward to tonight.  He is sleeping and his phone keeps going off. 
NOPE  I don't snoop.  Even though I know his password.  
But I decide to check out dating sites.  I found him right off the bat. 
Didn't even try to hide his face, location or anything. 
I'm so done with him. Not matter the tale or version he gives me. ",16Mar2019,3
152,"My dad was in the RCMP so I'm hoping that that will make the judge or the lawyer or whoever it is think I'm biased towards the prosecution.  To be honest, I probably am.  Dad never has to do jury duty because of his past police service, so hopefully I won't have to do it either.  I was also thinking about wearing a MAGA hat to the selection hearing - that would probably make them not want to choose me, right?  Would there be any consequences?

I really don't want to do jury duty.  We're already short staffed at work, and my coworkers really rely on me.  It would also be a tedious and expensive waste of time.  I'm sure they've heard every sob story in the book, though.  ",16Mar2019,1
154,"So I've known that I've been feeling burnt out for nearly two weeks, but I thought I could make it through the end of my semester without something like this happening (I'm a full-time student with a part-time job). I passed out after my last class yesterday, around 9p, and woke up at 6p today. 

Upon waking I thought I was just groggy and dehydrated, and I was, but even after several glasses of water and a nice warm dinner, I'm still trembling and uncoordinated. I don't feel like I can start on my paper like this, but I'm also not tired enough to go back to sleep and ""reboot"", y'know? I don't even feel like a shower would help. I'm just really out of it and don't feel up to anything, not even just zoning out to Youtube videos, which requires zero energy. Just typing this post is draining as hell.

This paper I've mentioned is really important, it's essentially my final, with a minimum of five pages expected plus a glossary of terms used. I could normally slam out five pages in two hours, but not without an outline, and not when I'm feeling sick. Do I email the professor asking for an extension? Shower and try to push through it? Take something to sleep and nap for a few hours to let my body start over? 

Any advice would be appreciated, particularly from those who've been in situations like this. Thanks so much!",16Mar2019,1

160,"I live with my mom because I take care of my sister while she is busy. 

From morning to night, it seems that all she wants to talk about is her boyfriend and the inner-workings of their relationship, including what they do and what they plan to do, as well as all of the stories he tells her about his family.

That is all that is on her mind and I am unable to talk to her about anything else. I end up having to convince her to talk about her boyfriend because if I don't try to bring anything up, she'll interpret it as me not caring about her.

Some days I can listen, some days, I can't. I never feel really fully engaged because I feel like I become trapped in the conversation rather than it being willing out of being polite. If I show any sign of disinterest or boredom, it's like I have heavily offended her and she doesn't feel like talking anymore, and she becomes distant and hurt. When I try to walk away, she continues to talk to me even though I am clearly trying to leave the conversation.

I have a lot of my own problems that I think about on a daily basis. These problems burden me heavily throughout the day and I am essentially forced to keep it in because I don't think it really matters to my mom. I have told her about my tremendous mental issues and she just thinks I should read a book and get over it. It feels incredibly dismissive and sad that I can't confide any serious problems with the most important person in my life at the moment. I can't even describe how I feel without her thinking that I'm just overreacting.

I love my mom so, so, so much, but I can't help but feel incredibly drained whenever she talks about her boyfriend. It also feels like me and my sister are less illustrious to her now, and her main priority is figuring out whether her boyfriend is worthy of her love. This is not the first time I have felt this neglect, and I am tired of it. The worst part is that I can't help but feel like a piece of shit son for not being able to deal with her problems because I am busy with my own.

163,"(Because I like a bit of privacy I had to word things a bit weirdly to avoid disclosing information like my age or grade)


Ok so around December 2018 during class I was called down to the councillor’s office. This was unusual because there was no real reason for me to be called down in the first place. A bit of backstory beforehand I have pretty average grades (or at least I think I do) I have the normal struggle with math and I’m doing awful in Spanish. This however does not mean I’m not good at academics it just means that I spend to much time playing on my phone and watching Netflix instead of studying. Back to the main part of the story, I got to the office and opened the councillor’s room. The first thing she did was reassure me that I was not in trouble and the next conversation goes as he following: 

Councillor: I’ve come to the understanding that you have First Nation heritage is that correct?

Me: Yes

Councillor: Have you signed up for the program?

Me: Um no what’s the program?
(Also I’d like to add another side note to make my reaction a little clearer, in my elementary school we had a program for kids that had First Nation heritage to learn about the culture and do activities like beading)

Councillor: Recent research has shown that people with First Nations heritage tend to struggle in their studies more and this program assists you to keep track of your study goals
*She then types on the computer and brings up my report card*

Councillor: Hmmm I see you seem to be struggling a bit it Spanish why is that?

Me: It’s a little difficult because I’m in a Spanish class a grade above my own
(A little more context is that when I was a grade 8 I was put into a grade 9 beginners Spanish class because my schedule was full and couldn’t fit a regular French 8 class)

The rest of the conversation is pretty fuzzy to me and I don’t want to make up anything because I want honest opinions on if I’m overthinking the situation or not. To sum it up we went over different goals for the future to improve studies and I was to come back on a Friday to quickly see if I can get signed up for some sort of extra curricular activity like sports or art lessons. I was pretty compliant as I didn’t really actually know what was going on and to begin with the amount of First Nations heritage I have is probably less than 1/4(probably even more) The Christmas break started with us getting a new councillor so I did not see that lady again, and the encounter became a bit of a joke in between me and my friends. However the reason I bring this up is because yesterday (March 14th) I was called down once again this time it was far more uncomfortable, it went like this:(I’ll be calling this councillor  “C2” because it’s councillor #2)
*I walk in*

C2: *In a very loud voice* Don’t worry you aren’t in trouble this is about your heritage!

*I sort of awkwardly smiled*

The conversation went almost exactly the same as the previous except for a few changes, 

1) I found out through this session that the previous councillor made notes about me and it was on some sort of file(which is slightly concerning)

2) I’m certain she thought I wasn’t smart as she over explained everything and would speak slower and louder as if she thought I wouldn’t understand otherwise

3) I was informed that apparently i am now supposed to come over every 3 months to have similar discussions. This doesn’t sit well for me because I never signed up for this program I was sort of just put in it, and it felt uncomfortable for someone I’ve never met to pull up my grades and have me talk about it while possibly having thoughts that I’m not smart because of something that isn’t backed up by any research that I could find over the internet. I’m posting this mostly for a second opinion as I’m not quite sure how to handle the situation or if it’s just me overthinking a small issue.

164,"A few weeks ago I got accepted into my dream college, I was so proud of myself and incredibly excited for the future, but that all came crashing down today.

This college is relatively expensive and my family can’t really afford it, I never expected my parents to pay my way through but I did expect my dad would work with me to figure out student loans. Today we got into an argument and flat out said he wouldn’t pay a dime of my tuition or co-sign my student loans, and I don’t know what to do anymore. The last 4 years he’s been discouraging me from applying anywhere because my grades haven’t been the best and it would be a waste of money to spend on application fees, but he called me an idiot for only applying to one school (which had no application fee which is why I actually applied) and explodes when I point this out.

I’m open to community college, but where I live has a really high cost of living you simply can’t afford with a minimum wage job, I’d live at home but I can’t keep seeing him every day. I feel trapped, so what should I do?

Side note: My older brother who my dad has always treated better than me got his tuition payed for, actually had a college fund set up and they didn’t bother doing that for me, So I’m a little annoyed that he’s not even willing to discuss it with me.

TLDR: dad refuses to pay for or even co-sign a student loan for college, calls me an idiot for applying to one school despite discouraging me, I don’t know what to do with my future now.",16Mar2019,2
165,"I recently started a new job in a new city. The company works on high profile events around the world, and there were many other applicants for the job, so when I got an offer I was ecstatic, and picked up and moved right away.

Three months in and I feel like I've hardly improved at my work, I can't get all of my tasks done during the day and often work on them at home (without logging hours). What's more is that I feel anxious every time I go in, and on nights and weekends I can't relax and turn my brain off and not think about work. The office is only a few people, and while everyone is nice enough, I never know where I stand with anyone.

We are given an incredible amount to do every day. Our office is a new office in a larger company, and it seems like we're dumped on with tasks from the other two main offices. The CEO is...eccentric. He requires all costs and purchases and notes from meetings and even things like when employees land at an airport for a business trip to be reported directly to his email...yet if we send too many emails to him at once or don't spell things out to him like a three year old, he gets angry and you then have to spend the next hour rewriting it up to his standards.

Our office boss is more sane, yet has constantly changing expectations. He recently called me on a Saturday telling me I had to send a confirmation email to the CEO. I tried as hard as I could to follow my bosses directions to write it, and showed him the email before I sent it and he then approved it. But when the CEO read it he got angry at us because we had previously sent him an email with similar information and it was confusing.

My boss then was annoyed at me on Monday for not alerting him that we had already confirmed certain parts of the email, but the thing is...I was only two months in at the time. He's the boss, so I was just trying to follow his instructions.

My coworker who is in charge of training me is kind of...unapproachable. I know it's a hard task to train people constantly (there's one other new person as well), but she looks irritated when I ask her questions, or when she gives me a task and I need more instructions, tells me basically I should know that already. This has all resulted in my being afraid of my coworkers, which then makes me second guess all of my work, which then leads to me making more mistakes and getting into more trouble.

I know all new jobs have growing pains, I know I could be working harder to improve, and I know being in a new city causes stress on its own. But I just feel like a job should not be causing me this much stress. I've cried multiple times when I get home from work. I'm not a perfect worker, but I'm smart and I'm easy to get along with.

I'm disappointed that what seemed like my dream job is turning out to be hell. I feel like I'd be giving up a great opportunity if I quit...but I don't know how I can last here. I look at my coworkers who have been here for a while and they look even more stressed. Also I just moved to a new place and now have an apartment lease to deal with.

Long story short, I have a knee-jerk reaction to anything to say ‘what do you mean’ and my mom took it in a way where I was giving attitude and she decided to mock me back telling me I’m disrespectful etc. I was having a bad day and I was fed up so I just said bye and hung up the phone (not the best response I know). However it’s not the first time this has happened, I’ve tried speaking to her and she just ignores me and tells me over and over she can do what she wants because she’s my mom.

170,"I will try to be short.
My boyfriend and I came to the conclusion that I am a lot more emotionally intense in the relationship since I am working actively for a future together. He on the other hand really feels strongly for me (this I know) but does not actively do so cuz he sees a future per say. He says that his approach to any relationship so far, including ours, has always been to grow and live in the present. And even if he feels strongly for me, he can't seem to match my intensity cuz my approach is for the future and it is pretty evident each day. He feels like he falls short and he isn't doing right by me. He feels I am putting up with a lot of his random insensitive remarks or occasional aloofness just for an uncertain future. He also said that sometimes he is warm and welcoming of my intensity in the relationship (which I see so evidently) but sometimes he is too aware and he feels like pulling away. 
Hence, he called it off yesterday.

When he is expressive, he is everything I want. I don't know if he knows that he gives out the vibe of a completely committed / in love person.  I feel like he doesn't know how good he is. Yes, it is true that there are periods when he is aloof. And now he verbally put it across that he doesnt feel as much I feel on a daily basis. So there is that to deal with. 
I want to reach out and tell him not to give up on the relationship just because both him and I don't know what lies in the future. We are each other's best friends and we really don't have anyone else who each of us connects to like we do.

""(I don't want to give her name), How can I say what I want to say? Well, I'm just going to say it plainly. I'm madly in love with you. Before in 2016, I saw you as a great friend and running partner. But I see you more than that now. You're the woman of my dreams. You're the one I want. If my love were an ocean, there would be no more land. If my love were a desert, you would see only sand. If my love were a star–late at night, only light. And if my love could grow wings, I’d be soaring in flight. My love for you is perfectly described in the song ""Perfect"" by Ed Sheeran. I hope you have these feelings for me too. It's fine if you don't and I understand. I'm fat, kinda ugly, and I play Fortnite. But I wanted to let you know how I feel and to get these feeling off my chest. If you maybe want to be together, I always feel lightheaded. But I know long-distance relationships don't work out. But I'm telling you this because I'm moving away for the last time (I'm 95% sure). You're funny, a talented dancer, and a beautiful person. I guess you can say I'm asking you to be my girlfriend. I want to be your man. But if you don't want to, that's completely fine. If I can tho, I'd at least like to stay in touch with you. Because you are a really good friend and an amazing person to talk to. 💖 ""

It is really sketchy but he doesn't do anything, just stand there smoking or watching YouTube loudly. I always have my blinds down one day, I didn't during a night and as soon as I looked up to the window I heard someone walk away (I couldn't see outside because it was dark). I even noticed him against the wall even in weather where it was -14F outside. I am not in my apartment most of the day due to work so I notice him during evenings. Sometimes during late nights.

I never took it seriously but I feel really fucking concerned after what went down in NZ. What should I do? Should I report to Police? I don't have any evidence that he has done anything bad. I checked the corner for any cameras or microphones if he planted anything but I don't see anything...

176,"I go to a public high school and here, many of the Honors and AP students all tend to be in the same clique. I wouldn't say I completely relate to them, and I think I'm friends with them simply by convenience just because they lead all of the clubs I'm in and take all the classes I have. I've always been annoyed by how badly they treat non-AP students and believe they're better than everyone, while simultaneously controlling every other club within our campus - leading to a disparity between the two groups. 

Well, it's only gotten worse now that college acceptances are coming around - with one of my classmates (also a teammate for a competiton) has been comparing my scores to everyone else's and how low they are, alongside just hovering over me whenever I'm studying and embarrassing me when I'm trying to teach a lesson to underclassmen by bringing in more information than necessary for said lesson (confusing my underclassmen and uprooting my whole lesson). 

Today I'm upset at them because I have been very upset about getting rejected from 5/6 colleges, and they continue to egg on how easy it is for them to get in. 

My coach says I snap back at them, and really I always feel like I have to hold myself back from yelling at one of them for how much of an asshole he is. My other teammates contribute, but really he shouldn't be saying how much he did better than me in his freshmen year than I in my senior year. 

It's not like I don't try and my GPA dropped my junior year due to a bad home life, and he knows this too so really at this point I think he's just trying to fuck with me.

 I have my competiton this Monday but really, I just don't want to study anymore just because he's made me feel like crap and now I'm stuck with only one choice of a school.

My biggest issue is mental health, I have HORRIBLE social anxiety, I cant be without my phone because ""what if I have a neuro episode and get hurt"" etc Im scared of failure and judgment. the docs put me on all kinds of meds causing bad symptoms, I wont get into much detail but I became violent on a med and almost killed someone and went to jail(very out of character) once I got off the med I was fine and stopped being violent and hallucinating daily, now I have more anxiety like ""what if I go crazy again and it wasn't the meds?""

So, I'm into the fourth semester of a physics bachelor, in Germany. This would generally be a good position, except that the teachers, course layout and study plan are an abomination. I would love nothing more than to get a formal, good education in physics, but this program is absolute bollocks, the education quality is laughably bad and the guy in charge of the whole show doesn't seem to mind.

It would be easy to say 'oh, just change your major', and I've considered engineering, but my parents have told me that I have about two more years before my college fund runs out, not enough to change, and they've implied that I'm not getting their financial help for a master's degree if I wish to pursue one. 

Just to add fuel to the fire, every other day I feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack because I'm not generating my own income. Ever since I reached 18, I've felt this strong urge that I wish to have a stable income, and now it's almost deafening. I have this strong urge to want to start working and become financially independent, but I can't see myself getting there any time soon. A bachelor's in physics is basically only good for getting into a master's, for which I'm gonna have to either pay out of pocket somehow, or get a scholarship. My grades are embarrassing too, and I've had to drop German just so I can get on top of the regular classes, which has caused me anxiety to no end. My need to enter the workforce soon seems to be far from being met.

I've struggled with depressive slumps and anxiety, but gladly none of it seems to be clinical. I've also gone into performance enhancing drugs to try and deal with my academic situation. They're a great boost, not gonna lie, but I also fear them because they make me feel great, and I see addiction potential there, but they give me hope to deal with my dumpster fire of an academic situation.

TL;DR: I'm a bad student in a bad bachelor's, and I wish to enter the workforce ASAP, but I don't have any credentials to start working.",16Mar2019,1

194,"Okay this is a bit of a serious post, but here goes.

I'm currently in eighth grade, and I go to an all girl's school). In my class, there's a girl I'll call Kayla. I don't consider myself friends with Kayla necessarily, she's fun to hang out with but we're not really friends, you know? She's like a normal weight-- not especially skinny or fit but not chubby, a good balance. I consider her pretty attractive.

She's starving herself.

Kayla barely eats. Most of the girls in my class have told her again and again that it's terrible for her and that she should stop because she could DIE, but she won't listen. She genuinely believes it's fine, and encourages others to do it as well as a ""diet"" (not in a malicious way, she honest to god thinks that it is perfectly healthy way to get skinny). And I've noticed a disturbing trend, a few other girls have started doing it. Not a lot, but one or two at least.

Now I'm one of those people that are just naturally skinny no matter what they eat, so I really don't know what it's like to be unhappy with my body. I can't relate to whatever struggles she's going through. Everything my classmates and I have said to Kayla about the many risks and serious consequences of starving herself seem to just go through one ear and out the other, as have the many reinforcements how how beautiful and amazing she is, and how she doesn't need to be super skinny to be pretty.

Anyone who has dealt with problems in body image before, can you give me some advice on how to get through to her? I'm really scared she might seriously hurt herself if she continues doing this.",16Mar2019,1

199,"First post ever and on mobile  (not happy) 

Backstory 
So I am a boy and I am 5,4 178 pounds I'm not very big so I am a target for bullying. I'm not particularly popular more infamous for an incident at my school the popular kids weren't seen as the in the wrong and no happy ending.


Finally I'll start 
So it was a normal day living in my last day being a  little kinda nerdy kid who everyone picked on for being new and small and not interested in any of the girls around me.
I was sitting next to a kid let's call him Jason. Jason was cool he was a year bellow me and I remember us having a good time talking on the bus. Jason didn't show up I was alone the popular boys there were a lot of them 2 important but it was at least 5 or 4 of them(no b.s. I didn't fight all of them I wouldn't live to tell this). so my hairline was fucked up the popular boys were pickingbut I was use to it that day my barber became an acholic. Yeah I laughed at it to then one kid let's call him jayden. Jayden got to into it he was calling me incestuous and that I'll end up with a cousin or something cause no girl would want me. But ok i guess not that bad right hell no. By the way we were the seats behind the bus driver. Jayden said i couldn't beat him in a fight making me kind of scared it was random. Jayden then said him and his friends would gang bang  (sexualy) and kill me out of nowhere. I was upset about this like wtf it was funny now it's weird even for me. And not only that they were a year older and much bigger than me (4.11 118lbs at the  time 2 years ago) they were all at least 5.6 or even 6.2 very scary but I'm not a punk I was tryna roast them by myself (not winning) the bus driver tells me to watch my mouth because I  said fuck. Which would be understandable but he let these kids threaten to gang bang me much bigger kids. I tell him to shut the hell up that's why your old add got dropped from the army cause you don't care about your job just about looking good for someone (no one liked this bus driver). So one of the kids from before tells me to have some respect for this asshole bus driver so I stupidly hut the tallest kid (it looks worse for me hold on) he can easily pick me up they could gang bang me now if they wanted to he slams me into my seat now shit hits the fucking fan I go into some type of frenzy (possible ptsd not sure) triggered by pain it's kinda fuzzy I don't exactly remember what happened here but I had witnesses to fill me in neutral parties of corse. Witnesses described my eyes as a dark pink and tears grunts screaming coming from everywhere I ripped his shirt in half and bit his neck until he bled he threw me to the floor( who won he got more hits and slammed me multiple times but I sped up a little). The bus driver grabbed me i attacked him brutally (I don't remember this at all witnesses eyes) he called for an of duty officer he threw me off the bus on the ground closing  the door . The officer grabbed me  next (extra gory not for weak stomachs) he turned me around to handcuff me (illegally I was twelve they lied and said I was thirteen so they wouldn't get sued. I bit his nipple  area causing blood to get on his T shirt and in my mouth so I spat at him  (sorry police officer you were cool and didn't know or deserve this bull shit on your day off). I wrote an apology letter I still feel guilty but three hours of them calling back up ended at 5 officers and a grandma to stop a twelve year old. My childhood friend had calmed me down I wasn't aggressive just cold,shaking and afraid she got one of popular kids younger brother to run to my house getting my dad she stayed the whole time. I was  crying let me go let me go. I was still twelve I  didn't know what was going to happen I knew I wasn't evil or made out for this. My dad came and got me I wrote my side the principal said he was proud of me and don't worry about the kid but he said i would be punished for the officer (two month suspension later).  I'm back everyone thinks I went to jail or was a psychopath murder happy monster. I wasn't I literally take care of disabled puppies and even try to parent my cousins who don't have good parents I even carried an injured toddler to his mother I even stopped a suicide attempt. All disregarded by my classmates they avoided me they didn't know what happened on there they think I want to hurt them they worship the popular kids like gods. And treat me like a demon a cult summoned. They wanted me in their gangs me helping them bully others (declined all of them) they treated me like a monster and now I think maybe their right...",16Mar2019,0

201,"Hi all, 19 year old female here. This is a long story and is very late at night, or rather, very early in the morning. I’ll try my best to make this coherent and at least somewhat intelligent. 

I work at a concessions company for a couple of sports parks. There are several stands with 70+ employees, and no one really ever works with the same group of people every time. It is not uncommon to go several months without working with some employees at all. 

About 7 months ago, in August 2018, I worked with a boy (17M) for the first time. We clicked instantly. Before I’d learned really anything about him, we had this kind of connection that I’ve never had with anyone, and it was a strange experience for me. I did not date at all until I was 18, out of personal choice. I’m a very independent individual when it comes to relationships. I’ve never needed one to validate my self worth or feel complete. I have always been happy being by myself, and it was very unusual for me to experience anything like this with anyone. I generally tend to stay away from people and minimize social contact, so I don’t consider myself a normal teenager by any definition. I’m also a parent-pleaser. I hate doing anything they would disapprove of, and I always try to make responsible, trustworthy decisions. I don’t sneak out, I make straight a’s, etc etc. 

However, after my first date with this boy not long after we met, my sister asked me in front of my parents if he smoked weed. He used to, and being the good (idiotic) daughter that I am, I told them this because I have a deeply rooted fear of lying to them. “Honesty is the best policy!” Right? 

So of course being the good parents that they are, they tell me to stop seeing him. So, that’s what I do. I was pretty devastated, and I moped around for a few days. I was made to feel guilty for my sadness by my mom, who told me things such as, “did you honestly think we’d be okay with you dating someone who does stuff like that?” “Why do you even like him?” Etc. 

To combat my sadness, I turn to the first distractions I can think of, Tinder and Bumble. From September to January of this year, I went on countless dates, got into a couple of short relationships, and was just generally not doing anything very well for myself.  
I had, during this time, not spoken or had much contact with the boy at all, except for the few times we worked together. I never lost my attraction to him, and I knew this is why I couldn’t move on. Every time I would see him I would become sad, and realized how much I missed him and wanted him in my life. This is odd behavior for me, because I’m generally not like this about anyone, and relationships have never held a high importance in my life. 

In late December, I mention how unsatisfactory this dating life has become, and she asks me if there’s anyone at all I’m interested in. I tell her that this boy is the only one I’ve liked for several months. In a disapproving way, she tells me she still disapproves of him, but I can date him if I really want to because “she can’t tell me what to do” because of my age and the fact I’m an “adult.” So, I text him and find out he has a girlfriend. I was deeply saddened by this, but there is nothing I can do. 

Come February of this year, we begin to talk more and develop more of a connection. He has broken up with his girlfriend. We develop a friend group at work, so we are seeing a lot more of each other. I am no longer on tinder and bumble, but I start falling hard for him again very quickly.  My parents (mostly mom) notice this, and make their disappoint and disapproval very clear. So since I try to be a good daughter, A couple of weeks ago I met up with him for coffee to explain to him the situation and why we cannot be together. However, we both realize the emptiness and difficulty we faced during our time apart, and the incredibly strong feelings we have for one another, despite even really knowing each other for that long. Since then, we are pretty much in a relationship that I’ve kept from my parents. We don’t go on dates or anything and I don’t sneak out to meet him places. We see each other at work and mostly hang out there, and hang out for a little while in the parking lot after we get out. 

However, because I am a horrible liar and I carry guilt like a sandwich board, they figure out tonight that we are something more. They tell me I cannot date him because he is coming in between myself and them. They say he is manipulative and a “con artist” and “pothead” although he doesn’t do it anymore. They also say he is too young, although I am only a year and 6 months older than him. I am a freshman in college, and he is a senior in high school. They tell me that they can do this because I live in their house, and it’s their rules. They pay for my living expenses so I have no control over such things, and I’m not an adult. 

This boy is one of the most sweetest, pure hearted people I’ve ever met. Out of all the boys who I’ve met, I actually like him. He mirrors my values and morals, we think so similarly on things. Everyone except for my family loves him. He’s a hard worker and he’s generous. I care for him deeply, and it brings me great joy to be around him. Probably more than anyone I’ve met. 

Maybe I’m just an irrational teenager who can’t see what’s best for me, but I just don’t know how to help my situation. I know the right thing to do is to stop seeing him and suck it up, but I know I’m just going to be so sad and lost again. I never rely on other people for my happiness, but it’s almost like a part of me is gone when he’s absent from my life. I don’t want to sneak around, because I don’t want to do that to my parents and I can’t carry this guilt. 

The only option I want is for me to be with him, and for my family to be okay with it and see how happy he makes me. They have their own view of him, however, and I don’t know if trying to talk to them is going to make things any better. They hold so much control over my life now because of our financial situation. I was told today during this discussion that the only reason I have the savings I do is because they pay for my college and my car insurance, and although I don’t understand how this is related, it was an argument nonetheless. 
I just don’t know you guys. I know what’s best for my relationship with my parents but I don’t see how it can lead to me being any happier. I spent the first 18 years of my life staying at home 24/7 and pleasing them. I just want to date the only person I want to be with. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated, and any personal similar stories anyone would like to share as well.

I wanted that sweet “to work is to solve problems” experience, and I honestly do think everyone should experience retail at least once in their life. But god damn am I the wrong person to experience it, and boy do i  embarrass myself. 

These past two weeks I have:
- knocked a rack of cooked bacon all over the floor and rendered it unusable
- slipped into an empty plastic tub while walking towards the register and made a huge noise. And then I proceeded to drop it and watch as it cartwheeled across the entirety of the kitchen floor making the same level of noise
- been discreetly given a heads up by my Good Samaritan coworker that everyone could see my underwear when I squatted to grab something
- spent at least 5 minutes trying to do basic arithmetic when someone asked for change
- said “have a good night” while it was bright as hell and most definitely day and profusely mumbled a correction at least 50 times
- cut off a customer while they were talking because I was so focused on the right thing to say and profusely mumbled an apology at least 50 times
- and. So. Much. More. That I have erased from my memory to protect myself. 

The worst part about it: I want to quit so bad but I’m too anxious about a confrontation with my boss.
I just spend the entirety of my time thinking about how I will have to show up at work later this week. And then I will have smile through a panic attack as my mind makes me wonder how embarrassing it would be if I made my manager call an ambulance for me because I thought I was dying. 

Also I’m allergic to the gloves and soap they have. they give me hives and I have never had an anaphylactic reaction but I ALWAYS manage to convince myself that those gloves are certain death. 

So the day I muster the courage tell my boss I don’t think this job is such a good fit, he says to me right before: “I ordered some special gloves for you. They’re kind of expensive so only YOU can use them. They’ll be here in THREE weeks”

HOW DO I SAY I AM QUITTING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS ORDERED SPECIAL GLOVES FOR ME EXPECTING THAT I WILL WORK HERE FOR LONG ENOUGH TO NEED SPECIAL GLOVES? 

It’s been three weeks. Where are my special gloves? Can I leave now? Boss I think I’m dying. ",16Mar2019,1
204,"When I was 16 I went to a house party with a couple of seniors from my school. I had known one of them for over a year and would sit with him at lunch. I got pretty wasted I did six shots then my friend and two of his friends said to come back to their house. They said it was going to be fun. When I got there they told me to get undressed, I did. 


I was really confused they tried to take photos of me but I told them to stop. They gave me a beer then told me to suck their dicks I did no one else was there I didn’t know what to do. Then they penetrated me I bleed . They finished. It feels really blurry to remember the next day. 



The next day they tell all their friends and their friends say I’m disgusting, ugly, stupid, a bitch and gross. They made posts about me online
This was six years ago and I still think it’s my fault. I said yes to having sex with them right away they said. I had never really gotten that drunk before. 



They said no one will ever want to date me. One of the guys would continue to hookup with me for years. I did it because I felt lonely, became an outcast, and thought I was ugly. He would say I’m annoying, that he wants me for sex and nothing more. I don’t think anyone will like me


Am I slut? Will no guy want me? Am I gross? Why did this happen?

209,"So I moved into an apartment complex with my partner in December. This is my first time living out of my parents home and I admittedly didn’t know much about the complex before we moved in because it was a quite hasty move. We’ve been experiencing the following issues since moving in and I need advice on how to handle them. 
There are always used condoms in the parking lot that are never cleaned up and I’m fairly certain I saw a used needle too. Our walls are pretty thin and we hear people screaming, fighting, and playing loud music at all times of the night. It’s common for us to wake up at 3am from someone repeatedly ringing our door buzzer to let them into the building. 
The most pressing issue is that the people beneath us smoke inside their unit and my clothes are starting to smell like cigarette and the air by our vents always smells like smoke now. I am afraid of getting charges for smoke damage and also afraid that breathing this in could be bad for my health or the people could potentially start a fire. I’ve witnessed people walk in while smoking before. 
The staff is incredibly rude with other issues so I don’t know how to get this resolved. After doing more googling I found that there was a murder of an infant here last year and a murder suicide the year before that. All that to say I’m nervous to speak to the other tenants directly to ask them to be quiet or stop smoking. I really need advice on how to handle this. Thanks! ",16Mar2019,2

Not sure what I should do. I'm sure I'm not liable for the wood (if it get stolen) but it is inconvenient that's it's taking up space on my driveway. Also if some person claims it there's no way for me to verify it's there. There's also the possibility my HOA is going to fine me for some unruly equipment out in the open 'rule'.

Plus in the worst case what if the lumber company decides not to take it back or cant I'm stuck having to deal with having to get rid of this.

What should I do?",16Mar2019,1
211,So me and this girl have been dating for about a year and a half now and her parents like me we had a good relationship between us everything was great. But one night she went over to her friends house and they snuck out and came to my house and we didn’t do anything all we did was talk and this happened last weekend and I didn’t think much of it until now. My girlfriends friends parents went through her phone and found out that they snuck out and came to my house. And now my girlfriends parents know and no longer want me being around her saying I’m a bad influence on her even though this is the only bad thing that I have done since meeting her and her parents. How do I gain their trust back? How am I suppose to be with her if I’m not allowed to be around her outside of school? ,16Mar2019,1

215,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

As you probably would have all heard, yesterday New Zealand experienced a devastating terrorist attack claiming the lives of 49 innocent people practicing their faith. Like millions of others this has greatly affected me, and my anxiety is worse than usual. 

I work in a store alone, in a very public space, and cannot imagine returning to work as usual and being by myself for many hours at a time so soon after this event. I expressed this to my boss and that I didn't feel comfortable going to work the day after the shooting (when it was still unknown to the public what exactly had happened and if everyone had been caught). Work insisted that I provide a medical certificate to show I have actually been affected and that I'm unable to work, I mean how ridiculous is that?!? 49 people were just murdered minutes away from my job, no wonder I feel unable to work!!

&amp;#x200B;

I feel they will not give me any more time than the single day I've had off today and yet the mere thought of operating and closing the store alone fills me with dread. I feel guilty 'quitting' as I haven't been in this job long, and although I only need to be in it for a short amount of time (for other reasons), I feel like I'm letting myself down by leaving two months early. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it is reasonable to leave? I am very conflicted about this entire situation and need time to get my head straight/let the dust settle after this attack on my city yet my job will not give me that; It's either push on or leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for any help, and my thoughts are with every person and community across the world affected by this horrific crime against humanity.

221,"Now, I’m asking this because different people have told me different things. I don’t know what to do about it, whether to approach him or just ignore it completely. 

So, last weekend I was sleeping at my best friends house, let’s call him Jesse. My other best friend, let’s call her Katie, was there was well. Jessie had a couple other people over, and these two other guys, let’s call the main one Kyle. I didn’t know Kyle and his friend, but I really thought they were cool guys, fun to hang out with, and I thought Kyle was pretty cute. Anyways, Kyle was flirting with me all night, but I was hardly responding. Too tired, just not in the mood, ya know? 

Fast forward to about 3am. We’re all pretty drunk, but Katie and I are the most drunk right? So, we all head to bed. All of us were sleeping in one room just to give you an idea of what was going on. I’m sitting in a recliner, and Kyle is sitting in a recliner on the opposite side of the room. 

After being in the room for about 30 minutes, Katie texts me. She says “Kyle thinks you’re cute, and he wants to sit with you.” So after a lot of reluctance, drunk me decides it’s cool. He says he just wants to talk, get to know each other, blah blah blah. (Yes, I know that wasn’t the intent but I was clearly inebriated) So, we go sit in the corner of the room on some beanbag chair. We just hang out for a little, and I eventually start falling asleep. Well, Kyle kisses my cheek. But I’m exhausted, so I just brush it off and fall asleep. Maybe 5 minutes later, I wake up, and realize that he had put my hand down his pants. Now, I know what you’re thinking “well duh that’s not right” but, here’s where it gets confusing. I didn’t move my hand away. I didn’t say stop or anything. Just let it all happen. After he finished he fell asleep, and I left the room. But  I just felt so weird and off that I called someone to pick me up and went home at 5am. He then followed me downstairs (I wasn’t alone at this point), and asked me for a blowjob. I said no, told him I was tired, didn’t feel well, and had to go home. He spent the whole time I was waiting for my ride trying to convince me. 

I’m not the type of person to do things like that with strangers,even under the influence,so after it I had a full blown panic attack and I was just so uncomfortable. I think that had more to do with the alcohol, though. 

I’m just really unsure of what to make of this whole situation and I wanted to hear what other people had to say. Did he do something wrong? Should I speak to him about it? Speak to our mutual friends? 

Background info - I’m 17, he’s 21. (Yikes)And he knew exactly how old I was, we had this whole discussion about how I “seem older”. His age is partly why I’m reluctant  to speak up because I don’t want to ruin this guys life. Plus my parents are both pastors and very sweet people, I’m also terrified of how they’d react, especially since I had been drinking. And a sexual assault lawsuit wouldn’t make them look good :(  (it’s fucked up i know) ",16Mar2019,2
222,"Back on Valentine's day my friend had dinner with a guy and posted about how good of a day it was on her social media and changed her profile pic and her phone background (all the normal stuff).

She said ""don't call him my bf. I haven't told anyone and I don't want you to say anything but he forced me to have sex on Valentine's day and I haven't talked to him in weeks. He didn't use a condom and I had to use a plan B pill"". She went into more detail but it's unnecessary for this post. 
Anyway, she's not one to lie about something like that but I don't know if she would've gone to such lengths for people to know how good of a time she had if something so awful happened.

227,"So, I live in a dorm with a open room that me and one other share. Which is fine day to day. I don’t really know my roommate that well, we hardly talk. I tried to make friends and hang out with her the beginning of us moving in, but she never reciprocate back. So I gave up on that. And so, the problem starts with my boyfriend. When we first started dating, I asked her if it was okay if I can have my bf over, and she was completely fine with it. She just wants a heads up. So, I tried my best with that, she starts having people over without letting me know. And I’m just irritated that I need to warn her, but it’s fine for her to bring whoever at any time with no warning. But who cares, I ask if he can spend the night one night, and she says she wouldn’t be comfortable with it. Which I completely understand, just due to the open floor plan and that might invade on her privacy. No sleepovers, that’s fine. But now she has a problem with him being over at the dorm in general. Her reason was being she felt uncomfortable, and we were displaying too much pda. But like, me and him don’t even kiss each other when she’s home. We will hug. But like I try to not be too much when she’s home to be considerate. It’s a bit unrealistic to not have him over at all, because I pay the same amount for this place and reserve that right to have over who I please with consideration of her. But like kind of bullshit that she can have people over, and I can’t have my one person over.

228,"If you want to skip to the actual question I’m asking please skip to the part name “the present”

So I’ll give you all a bit of the backstory. My friend was dating a girl for 2 and a half years, and he was all of her firsts, both sexual wise and relationship wise. They were deeply in love but she started to grow more controlling, forcing him to stop talking to other girls, claiming he was hiding stuff and trying to force him to stop talking to me - his best friend. 

He wasn’t happy with the relationship and was planning to breakup with her, and while he was planning - and very importantly before he had broken up with her - he started making advances toward the girlfriends friend. He never cheated, both of them knew it wouldn’t be good, but he went on dates and stuff. From here the current girlfriend, who we’ll call A, started to realise something was going on and started getting ridiculously controlling, going into his snap, stalking him on snapmaps and constantly asking what he was doing etc. 

They obviously broke up, which was a good thing but then the real shit started to go down. 

“THE PRESENT”

Aight so after my friend broke up with his girlfriend, who we’re calling A, he started to date the ex’s friend, who we’ll call B, however it was in secret, they didn’t want to tell girl A. Now it’s important to note that girls friend group broke down entirely, with only one person remaining as a friend for girl A. 

So after they broke up A continued to text my friend, would routinely call him, ask him where he is, what he is doing and who he’s with. The issue however was that whenever my friend said hey we’re broken up can you stop, she’d say she’s suicidal or say something that set off alarms. 
So for two and a half months now he’s been dealing with a girl who’s not only crazy, but ridiculously abusive. She calls him the worst person in the world, a dick, a cheater, a liar etc etc. She’s even reached out to a girl I was attempting to date, calling her a whore and a bitch because she was talking to my friend. 

Ultimately I just want to know, how should I handle the situation and is there anything my friend should do, keeping in mind there is a potential threat of self harm.

her initials

her birth date

her birth date in roman numerals

233,"Okay so pretty much to start you guys off with some context, this guy has been in my classes since last semester. I take two classes every semester so he was in both of them last term and this time he's only in one of them. He didn't talk to me a lot of the time last semester minus some clarifications about something he didn't know how to do for the formatting of an essay and then also complimenting my new glasses (he noticed it) and sweater, watch, etc. He would greet other people in class that he knew and chat with them or just say hello and whatnot. So I didn't think anything suspicious was happening or whatever because he's just being friendly. He seems like he's overall friendly towards people. Last day of class rolls around, we talk a lot more than we did throughout the semester and he asks if I need a drive but the whole time I've been carpooling with this girl and two other classmates so I kindly decline and tell him that I hope he has a nice Christmas break. 

Fast forward to this term and he starts talking to me a lot more than usual. First day of class I see he's in my class and I just wave and smile. When we get a 10 min break during class he taps me and asks how break (meaning Christmas break) was and I tell him it was okay and vice versa. The next couple of weeks he sits by me (minus that one time he didn't during the 2nd or 3rd week of class) and he even says he was lonely or something. I'm like alright cool... I don't mind. Talks to me during class and I see at the corner of my eye he is staring at me while I'm not looking at him. I turn to see him and we make eye contact for a good few seconds before he looks away. Still doesn't think of anything. Randomly talks about my sweater and what color it is despite we should be listening to the lecture lol. Remembers something I told him last semester and asks me about it. That same day after class I go and ask the prof something to clarify for next week and I see him lingering in the hallway when I'm leaving the classroom so I say bye to him and he offers me a ride. I hesitate at first but then I ask if he doesn't mind and he's fine by it. 

I feel like this is too long now so I'm just going to include other parts I guess. He mentions about another student in class who I used to carpool with last semester and I tell him that she lives in the area but she still has to take a bus home though. Offers me a ride again, but didn't offer her one(?) so far it seems like I'm the only one he's offered and yeah it's basically just us, once a week in his car lol. 

We talk about hobbies, other life stuff, jobs, school, etc. whatever comes to his mind and whatever I can think of but I'm not going to lie I'm guilty of not asking many questions because I'm too burned out from classes. He also said he's kind of shy (has to do with what profession he wants) Oh also I forgot to mention that classes end super late and I live far away so it takes about 2-3hrs away by transportation (I have to take 3 different types of transportation) so that could also be another factor as to why he'd drive me(??) I don't know but I don't want to think about it too much. All I'm saying is I just want some advice because he's really funny and nice and I would like to be his friend and hang out wit him outside of classes and campus in general. As of now I only see him as a classmate/acquaintance and not really a friend. I hope this doesn't sound harsh but we don't even talk outside of class and I asked for his number so I could send him something I wanted to show him since I had to rush. We don't text or anything and yeah... I just feel like at this point in time, I don't feel comfortable just having him drive me (even though I'm super grateful) I just don't want him to think I'm a freeloader and especially if we have classes next semester I don't want him to avoid me because he'll think all I want is someone to drive me. 

Note: I did give him some chocolate and a thank you note for driving me though because I really wanted to give him something in return for the driving he's done. 

I'm probably overthinking this situation per usual. Any advice would be helpful... if I do go and become friends with him would bringing up the topic of ""are we friends?"" while he's driving me be weird? This situation has been messing with me so I'm just curious as to what others think. Sorry for this long post! Thank you for reading it, if you finished the whole thing! :^) ",16Mar2019,1

Since December, about 9 of my friends from home &amp; I have been planning a trip, including buying tickets for a festival, Airbnb &amp; transportation. I’m pretty excited about this festival so I told my closest friends in college what I had planned for spring break!

My close friend from college was planning on going to the same festival with some of our other friends from college, but everyone else’s plans fell through. She still wanted to go &amp; now she keeps dropping hints that she wants to be invited into my group. She keeps talking about how sad she is that she can’t go, how she might buy a ticket &amp; just go alone because she has nobody to go with, how she’s so jealous of me being able to go, etc. When I hear this, I just change the subject.

I just have had everything planned with my hometown friends &amp; this friend of mine is one of my best friends (actually my sorority big) but she does tend to lack some social skills. For instance, if she hears about a party for someone she knows, even if she wasn’t invited, she has no problem showing up because ‘she’s cool with them’. She is also very loud &amp; can sometimes make a situation awkward, a bunch of us were smoking &amp; she started insulting this girl from a different sorority who is dating this guy she likes, IN FRONT OF HER SORORITY SISTERS.

242,"Hey all, I'm looking for advice on my mental health. I know y'all arnt therapists but more importantly, y'all dont charge. I'm hoping to get some fresh takes on my situation and I guess I'll start with some background. 

I [m20] wake up every day fearing what is coming and dreadfully hopeless, this doesn't stop. Even when I have nothing but good things to look forward too, I just seem incapable of happiness. I'm constantly anxious and this manifests itself physically in habitual jaw-clenching and other ticks. Mentally, I'm a wreck and it's gotten to the point where I'm essentially constantly arguing with myself in my head. Analyze, analyze, analyze. I cant look at anything in life without a steam of doubt, self-deprecation, and naysaying. Hell, even writing this post is taking forever(the title has changed multiple times). In the past this analysis was constructive and was a net positive in my life but recently its gotten to the point where I cant make simple decisions. If that wasn't scary enough some thoughts are so intrusive in nature they stop my daily functions entirely. It hurts.

I've been treated for depression, anxiety, adhd and PTSD and I'm ashamed. These labels make me feel weak. I know they shouldn't be seen that way but I cant help but feel like a failure when I come up short due to these ilnesses. They feel like excuses for poor performance.

I'm doing fulltime school, working partime and most importantly, trying to be the best husband I can be. Ive been married to the most amazing and compassionate woman to ever live (100% factual statement) for 2 1/2 years. In a sea of uncertainty, she is my life vest. I just worry that I'm not enough for her in my comprimised state.

I want to stop thinking.
I want to be happy.
For her.

I applied to an internship position in December and received a rejection in February but just received a notification on LinkedIn about a repost/reopening for the same position. 

Unfortunately this isn’t the first time this has happened. Any idea what’s up? Should I reapply or is this a common hiring practice when they are unenthusiastic about an applicant pool?

245,"me (17f) and my friend (18f) have been friends since grade 7. she copied me a lot in grade 7-8, if i started liking a band she’d like them, if i got obsessed with a certain topic she’d like it too (even tho she said she hated it before) and she even started copying my slight lisp. it didn’t bother me that much except my mother pointed it out and it seemed to annoy her more than me lol, anyways through grade 9-11 she stopped for a bit and she went through a goth phase. now she’s copying me again by loving pink, vintage shopping and now even obsesses over my special interest in true crime, she also started copying my laugh/high voice!! and it makes me feel like she’s ripping my personality away from me?? idk, it’s just kinda.. it makes me insecure i guess, cuz i wanna be my own person and she’s not letting me. she’s my only friend, and i love her (we get along really well hence our 6 year friendship).

252,"I'm fifteen, and going to turn sixteen in exactly two months. I'm a Christian(Baptist, but the Liberal Western kind), and so are my parents and family. So from a young age I was put into a private school(not an expensive one) and it was honestly a phenomenal school, the curriculum was top-notch, and you were also raised with Christians values(meaning I was raised from a young age to respect authority, my peers, and always love your neighbor). The school was the kind that didn't discriminate, so even when gay marriage was legalized, the school and it's teachers, didn't complain, or even talk about it, just in case some people are concerned about indoctrination, and other stereotypes, and generalizations. So for a little background, just to add some clarity to why, I left the school, and my situation in general. My father is honestly a soldier, in every sense of the word except literally(almost signed up for the Marines, but he was drunk lol) he was abused by his father, BADLY, not sexually, as far as I know. But, one time his dad took a metal wire, and just thrashed his back, over and over, about 40 times(just for losing a fight to a much bigger kid). Obviously, he had problems when he got out of high school, so he went to college, dropped out, and then just worked. When he finally met my mother, who did finish college and is a Baccalaureate. My dad managed to marry her(he obviously did believe in premarital sex, but wasn't a virgin, considering he was exposed to that world VERY quickly) and he goes back to college and gets his degree. All the while paying 200$ in tution at this school(if you couldn't tell my parents REALLY love and care about me). 

       Anyway, this new pastor(who doubled as the principal) comes in, and just switched everything off our head. He raises the tution up to 800$, as well as makes the curriculum online(which made it a significantly better curriculum) and my dad was still an intern, and my mother a nurse, so there was absolutely no way we could pay for it. So I get to go my 7th grade year, but then it would be over. The Pastor is really understanding of our situation(at the time we were almost in poverty, and qualified for food stamps) so he let us in for almost a free year. So long story short, I drop out, and we decide to do homeschooling, with this program's curriculum online. It works pretty well, but I'm unsure if it will actually benefit me, I really want to get into a university, rather than a college, to make my parents proud, since they have already sacrificed and given me so much, but we are at the bottom end of Middle Class(my dad got an awesome job at 45$ an hour) it's unlikely they will be able to pay for it. So I'm trying to go for a scholarship, but I'm fairly certain that since I'm schooled at home(even though it is online, and done with accredited teachers)  I will have to settle for a community college(not that it's a bad thing). I have also considered going for public school, and then trying for university, but I'm unsure if that's such a good idea.




TLDR: I'm going to turn sixteen soon, and would like some advice from people who may have been in my situation, and managed to overcome it. I have concluded my options are:

1. Go to public school, and adapt where needed.

2. Apply for financial aid, and hope to be granted it.

3. Apply for classes at the community college when I turn 16.

4. Hope that some universities may look past my homeschooling.

For further clarity my grades in this curriculum if that helps(it allows you to look it up):

The curriculum uses a 10 point default scale.

World Geography: 95.78%

Integrated Physics and Chemistry: 93.89% 

Algebra 1: 92.96% 

World History: 94.29%

English and Drama: 96.66%

Theology: 98.66%

Mathematics: 97.56%

    I know these grades are good, but I'm also just a freshman(year 9 for anyone outside of America), and have heard of many scholarship programs rejecting grades much higher than mine(as well as much older students obviously) because the students were homeschooled. I'm also aware that I can't submit freshman grades, but figured that it wouldn't hurt, as a baseline for my potential junior(year 11) and senior(year 12) grades. I also don't intend to use these grades as a ""flex"" I just wanted some insight into what you may think is best for me, and to help you analyze my situation to the best of your ability. I have also heard that volunteer work, would help universities notice me, but don't know for sure if that's true. Thanks for putting time out of your day to help me, or just read this, I'm also sorry if I come off as overly apologetic, or naive.",16Mar2019,1
253,"Hi, my ex and I broke up three months ago and we had a pretty nasty breakup. We both got really nasty towards each other but we were still basically together. We were on and off. I did really crazy things but he still talks to me. He did really crazy things too and here I am still talking to him. We’d fight all the time. We haven’t really talked since the end of February and the whole month of February was like little to no communication 

But point is:
He messaged me last Wednesday and he was just saying that he missed my personality and he still really likes it, he wishes things were better, and he was sending me nudes. He told me he wanted to be friends and I told him I wasn’t sure if I could talk to him and he got mad at that. He was saying things like I don’t know why I reached out to you. I don’t know why I got mad at that. And so I just kept talking to him but then I found out he started talking to some girl at the same time he reached out to me. They were already saying “I love you” to each other less than 5 days of talking! I met with her and told her all the toxic things he’s done to me because I don’t want someone else having to go through the same thing but she is still in love with him. She asked him to be exclusive and he said yes. So, later that day I FaceTimed him while he had told her he went to the gym. We talked and he said he liked someone but is going to tell her he doesn’t want to be exclusive and yada yada. I asked him has anyone made you as happy as I did and he said “no, or else I’d be dating them” and I sent her a video of him saying that! He even showed me his dick during the phone call!!! But someone called him out for being manipulative because he knew I still liked him and he was playing us both like fools. So, he cut us both off and said he couldn’t talk to us anymore. The next day I called him and we talked and I told him he didn’t like this girl because he wouldn’t have done what he did and he said that him and her talked about everything and it made him actually like her and want something. And I got mad/sad at that and just threw in the towel. I told him he was right and that we shouldn’t talk anymore and we left it at that. He slid up on my Snapchat story today saying “copying memes” and it made me really mad and frustrated. Because it was just an unnecessary message. I got drunk and kept telling him he likes me but won’t admit and he just said that he doesn’t. But after everything we’ve been through and have done to each other. I really don’t know why he wants to talk to me. I don’t know what he wants. I’m confused and think I’m being crazy and reading way too into the lines. ",16Mar2019,0
254,"Now hear me out with this one.

I turned 18 last month and my parents are a nightmare. One minute they are acknowledging that I can do what I want now within reason without their permission. Yet the next minute they are trying to guilt me into things that I've wanted to break away from a while.

One thing I've wanted to stop doing for the majority of my life is seeing my mum's dad, who has had dementia my entire life. Now I understand that from my mum's perspective it is her dad and that's fair enough. But to me, there's never been a person still inside of him. He never speaks, I literally travel 40 minutes to sit on my Nintendo switch in the corner, cause he doesn't do anything at all, and half the time is asleep the entire time we are there. In my entire life, I've never known him as a 'person', more of a shell.

The other annoying part is that with college and work all day on a Sunday, Saturday is my only free day. So I'll wake up late, and they'll decide to tell me we are going then.

I've just told my mum that I'm gonna have to be a dick later and not go, so then they start shouting at me cause I got a £50 cheque from him for my 18th,saying he gave it me. No he didn't, he earnt the money when he was right, but he has no ability to write a cheque now, or even be aware of his money.

256,"I had a best friend from high school. We were really close with one another, and I love him like my own brother. However, since we have grown up, we went to our own separate ways. Both of us are in a different college and we hardly contact one another. We would contact one another at least twice a year and that's enough to maintain our relationship. However, recently he has a new girlfriend. I was so happy when I received the news and I didn't think much of it, I was just so happy that he has someone whom he could share his life with. However, whenever I make plans for the both of us to catch up, he would hardly be able to make time for us. He would say that he's too busy. I must admit, he cancelled too many plans to the point that it got suspicious. But I just shrugged it off and gave him the benefit of the doubt.

One day, he had a quarrel with his girlfriend and he texted me for advice. I was surprised to see him text me and it gave me hope that we could interact with one another again. After I gave him my advice, he said he'll try it and hope that things would go well with his relationship. I was happy that we could get in touch, and I was hoping to receive an update from him whether or not my advice worked.

It worked. But he didn't tell me. I had to find it out myself by checking my IG story. I saw him going out with his girlfriend as they usually would do. It was at this point I texted him what he did wrong, that I felt betrayed to be 'used' only when necessary and told him to not forget his friends. I told him that I don't consider us as close friends anymore and as soon as he saw my text, he asked for my apology but I didn't reply him anything.

It has been 2 weeks now since his last texted me for an apology. Since he's active on IG, I only see him going out with his girlfriend. No signs of remorse. Did I overreacted? Am I too naive? Was it stupid of me to even have a circle of 'best friends'? I thought having best friends are what normal people do, but in the end I got hurt by it",16Mar2019,1

I don’t have many friends but the two I do have, have past history with my family because of me. Today I’m going to ask for advice to help me go to a skating rink with the male one. Jake and I have been friends for like 2 years. We’ve dated twice. We’ve decided we’re better off as friends. My mother and my father are divorced, my dad is Arabian and my mother is Mexican. My dad is perhaps the strictest parent that you’ll ever meet. I’m not allowed to talk to males of any kind. I have to get at least A-‘s in every class and I can’t wear shorts. My past “reLaTioNshIpS” with Jake have only ever lasted, at the longest, a week. My dads “ways” have rubbed off on my mother over the 17 yrs they were married and last time I asked to go somewhere alone with a guy, she got kinda upset. Since she doesn’t know this guys parents, and the fact that he’s a guy, and the fact that I’ve made mistakes and harmed myself because of the idiot in the past, all adds up to her hatred for him. The thing is, I’ve not left my house to hang out with friends in literal months. I’d like to be able to go to a skating rink with my best friend and not have to lie. I’ve gotten into quite a bit of trouble with my parents because I hung out at Jakes house a couple times after school.

Not really sure what kind of response I’m after-May just somewhere to vent this out,maybe just somewhere I don’t need to act like my family is functional and normal. My brother is a horrible human being. He is tall and big and used to use his strength to intimidate and hurt me when I lived at home. He used to threaten to kill me on a daily basis, this started when he was 13 and was the cause of me moving out because my parents didn’t take him seriously. My sister died when I was 14 (I’m 22, he was 7 and has expressed no remorse for people’s pain and suffering since before this) and I have experienced a lot of trauma from not only this, but my lack of family support. He has been diagnosed as having anti social personality disorder-like that of a sociopath but due to his age unable to diagnose as sociopath.  The future years to come saw him in youth detention for threats/assault, he accused my parents of physical abuse to authorities so he could move into a protected home, he sold my mothers wedding and engagement rings for weed and for fun, he regularly assaulted people and stole items and clothes from shops multiple times a day. At one point my whole family had a restraining order against him. I made a promise to myself that I would never spend a night in my parents house with him there. Unfortunately a few months ago I had no choice, and I overheard a disgusting phone call where he was talking to someone about how he was going to violently rape and assault a girl. I told my parents and they once again didn’t take him seriously (he is 17 soon and often an excuse for his behaviour). Today my mum called me because she received a video and a message from a random girl. The text states the girl was worried for her friend who is dating my brother, as he regularly beats him up. In the video he is apparently locking his girlfriend in a room threatening to rape her. The police have already been to the house and since finding out my mum ‘didn’t know what to do’ I had to tell her to call the police. I feel so disgusting and angry and I’m just so done with people psycho analysing ‘he’s hurting from his sisters death’ when he has been like this since before she was sick. I’m angry at my parents for never believing or supporting what I have told them about him and I also hurt for them and the pain and confusion they have suffered in life.

I wouldn't even be that jealous but it is the fact that she does not seem like the type of person to send a nude like she is very very insecure she won't even take a picture of her face.

I had this old friend group of mine all of last year(2018-December 2019) that consisted of 4 people including me, they are all older than me (4 years apart is the youngest, 7 the oldest) I'm currently 17. Last year I was with one of them as a couple and they were all pretty emotionally abusive towards me, they'd come to me with all of their problems but if I were to come to them with mine they would tell me i was bothering them with my problems and they dont want to hear it, i came to them for help because i was super suicidal one night and they decided to instead have a conversation with me they wanted to yell and get mad at me during a normal conversation and it ruined everything for me so i attempted to end my life. I was in the hospital, none of them checked on me, none came to see me, one called me to call me names like ""idiot"" ""stupid"" ""moron"" because of what i did. After that they refused to make time to see me but spent time with eachother all of the time, i eventually confronted them about it and instead of getting support or included back they all attacked me seperatly with words and since then I've blocked them on social media. Somehow though they keep showing up EVERYWHERE. It first started out with a mutual friend posting pictures of them all together, to twitch telling me that they were live streaming, to it autohosting them, to emailing me about it, and as of recently somehow ending up in a videogame with my ex with over 5,000 players online with only 12 slots in a game!

I really tried so many other ideas before coming here as all of those options are currently exhausted and my situation is pretty real and urgent at the moment. 

I am completely in a very steep hole financially from the hits I've been taking that honestly culminate from 2016 up until now, from when I was fully unemployed from 2016-2018.

What has led to my current predicament is that I am have officially been temporarily disabled from my current job since February 2019 up until April. The doctor has officially diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, and honestly, it’s been a multitude of other health concerns including Ulcerative Colitis or IBS..

My short term disability benefits are too low at $170/week, which has not been disbursed to me yet, is much too low for me to afford the cost of my expenses as a low middle income employee. Unfortunately this has led to an incredible rupture in the flow of my expenses being that I am currently unable to work due to being currently disabled. My cell phone has been suspended since January 12, my mother has been facing a trial and dealing with legal fees since 2017, and also with my grandfathers sudden health decline, these prior expenses have totally exhausted even my own work accruals.

I currently have to try to raise $2,100 because the amount i'd need would help contribute towards the amount of rent that I’m currently already late (and being pressured to have a full payment by the 15th of this month - which was yesterday now.. : /) on and trying my best not to deal with any issue as I work on my plans to not be in this circumstance ever again, with some true support if possible. Also cover expenses to help get my phone service back on and finalize my plans to move out of New York and move to a second family home that has been available for me to reside at in PA.

I really understand that this might seem delusional and that the ask is big, but I’m all out of options and I’ve come to my final option yet. Lord knows we are all going through things quietly right now, and it’s taken me much to actually share this with you all, because I try to struggle in silence and I can admit I’m pretty private, but right now, I can’t afford to do so and I prayerfully ask for your help and support.

Please prayerfully understand, this is not something that I’m embellishing on or implying non truths about, nor am I trying to come at this wrongly, but I could truly appreciate the prayers and any help if possible towards that goal amount. 

If you can help, or have any advice please PM me. I did also create a gofundme.

268,"So I been homeschooled my entire life and I don’t know basically anything. 

Now my mom said when I was younger she would try to sit down with me and do homework but I would always run away and just wouldn’t do it now I’m 15 and I feel like a idiot I don’t know math, science, algebra or anything a 9th grader would know.


And the thing that makes me mad the most is that I could just Learn this stuff my sister and brother are trying so hard to get me to homework I just don’t have any passion for it

And it’s not like I’m not a passionate person I mean asked me about superheroes or video games I could go on for hours about that but stuff like math and arithmetic I just don’t care and I don’t know why. I have passion just not where it needs to be

So can anyone help me on how to get passion for homework and school

Now I’m on the road to slow recovery discovering new ways to have fun in life, but now I keep comparing my happiness to all the mean people back then who ruined my life in the first place. It just irritates me how karma doesn’t seem to exist, and how all this happiness was already happening to them while they bullied me and made me hate my life.

270," Hey, this is a little life story kind of writing, so be alerted. I have been a cool person every now on then in every place I've been to. It's because I don't talk much about senseless stuff, even if it is not so I look smart, snobbish and distanced. I think this makes people not wanting to get in contact with me. Sometimes I think, I do not care what other people do or think because I love being lonely and usually get uncomfortable spending lots of time with others. However, sometimes I think maybe I consider that way because of the conditions I am in right now. Maybe this lifestyle has occurred not because I wanted but because I am not wanted. Recently I was on instagram checking some profiles of the people I know from my childhood, high school and college and I realised that I am the only one who has only 150 people to follow and to be followed by. I do not care how many people follow me but it seemed as a sign of how we do in social terms.

After that, I again started to think whether my will is the reason that I am lonely and not social, or is it because how do I look, act, talk that I do not have many friends.

So basically I’ve been watching this tv show for about 2 years now and I’m in LOVE with it I even run a fan account  dedicated to it, but after starting that fan account i realize how toxic this fandom is 

I mean I get mean comments because of who I ship (even though who I ship is canon) one of the main actresses gets hate comments all the time someone even started a petition to get her off the show just so terrible, 

And now when I watch it I don’t feel the same love for it anymore

273,"I’m not sure if this is the place to go to but here I am. 
I wouldn’t say that my parents were abnormally strict with me as a kid, but I feel like the way my dad treated me was, well... a bit over the top?

He always placed an emphasis on math when I was in school, insisting that I do my best in this subject. 
Every day he would ask whether I did my math homework and whether I had a test coming up so he could know whether to print out 200 pages of math exercises for me to do. I spent most of my vacations doing math. I remember having mental breakdowns whenever I got a grade lower than 80 (out of 100), to the point I was afraid of coming home because I knew my dad would yell at me (that was when I was 6-11 years old). My most prominent memory from these ages is me sitting in my room doing math homework, and my dad came in just as I was taking a little break- he started yelling at me like a madman and even told me that if I don’t do my homework I’ll regret being born.
His attitude towards this softened during middle school and high school, but his former treatment left me hating anything to do with math, and afraid of failing exams. Am I exaggerating or was I treated too harshly?

278,"ok so it's gotten to the point where I'm getting quite unhappy with my job,to the point where it's almost making me depressed.

I've been here for 5 years. the environment is toxic so are the managers I know that can be seen as a personal opinion but everyone else that works there feels exactly the same as me.

the answer is obvious right? just send out resumes while you are working so you have an income while you are looking. but here's the kicker for me (personally).
I've struggled all my life to learn new skills and be consistent with what I do. a month ago I was diagnosed with adhd which explains alot about my struggles etc. I've told work about this and they seem to understand like they are more or less turning a blind eye to my mess ups because they know I can't help it most of the time,late everyday,careless mistakes. not to say I don't own up to genuine mistakes i do know right from wrong but sometimes I don't realise I'm doing the wrong until I'm pulled up on it.

the job pays well for a simple job, but it's so repetitive and boring,management are terrible, and everyone complains all the time about how bad it is to work there. (I'm a warehouse order picker) if that helps? but yeah I don't see management making a bit effort after all the years from complaints from staff it's still the same crap.

so I guess it's fear that keeps me there but I feel my mental health deteriorating,  I've tried to.adapt but I can't. I know it all comes down to me.

but again good money, kind of understanding managers that I feel in another workplace they wouldn't tolerate my troubles. so anything you can offer? even if its just a favourite quote of yours?

282,"I seriously need some help. I had this old friend group of mine all of last year(2018-December 2019) that consisted of 4 people including me, they are all older than me (4 years apart is the youngest, 7 the oldest) I'm currently 17. Last year I was with one of them as a couple and they were all pretty emotionally abusive towards me, they'd come to me with all of their problems but if I were to come to them with mine they would tell me i was bothering them with my problems and they dont want to hear it, i came to them for help because i was super suicidal one night and they decided to instead have a conversation with me they wanted to yell and get mad at me during a normal conversation and it ruined everything for me so i attempted to end my life. I was in the hospital, none of them checked on me, none came to see me, one called me to call me names like ""idiot"" ""stupid"" ""moron"" because of what i did. After that they refused to make time to see me but spent time with eachother all of the time, i eventually confronted them about it and instead of getting support or included back they all attacked me seperatly with words and since then I've blocked them on social media. Somehow though they keep showing up EVERYWHERE. It first started out with a mutual friend posting pictures of them all together, to twitch telling me that they were live streaming, to it autohosting them, to emailing me about it, and as of recently somehow ending up in a videogame with my ex with over 5,000 players online with only 12 slots in a game! Like what are the odds of that? It put me in a really bad mood, nearly to the point where i just needed to be left alone completely. I then get a message from one of the other friends accusing me of stalking my ex online and that im being creepy and that me and her were completely over for no reason what so ever, how am I supposed to handle all of this? It just keeps happening bringing me back to an extremely dark place and it won't stop.",16Mar2019,1
283," 

First time posting here so I'll try to keep it brief, not sure if this is the right place.

So about 3 weeks ago we had a pretty devastating fire on the farm. Burned down the shearing shed / workshop and our truck which was parked out front. We lost a lot of equipment, tools, power tools, petrol pumps, generator, chainsaws, etc. My wife also had a fair bit stored in the shed that had a lot of sentimental value.

So we're both pretty flattened by this, and my mother comes back to visit. We're raking and sifting through the debris seeing what we can save when she asks me the question. She says that she's been thinking about how the fire could have started and there's only three possibilites in her mind. 1 That it was an electrical fault. Pretty old wooden building with 40 year old wiring and circuit box. Possible but she says she doesnt think so. 2. That I flicked a cigarette in through the slats in the sheep pens. Not likely because when it started I was over 1km away digging a trench with our tractor and my wife was inside with the baby. So that leaves 3. Did my wife start the fire? Logical conclusion and all that. Maybe we'd had an argument?

I'm just gobsmacked, couldn't believe that she'd ask me something like that. Just shook my head and walked away, but it seriously bummed me out and my wife could tell that something was wrong and I ended up telling her. She was pretty upset about it, said that my mother had basically implied that she was an arsonist. Confronted my mother about it and the best she ended up with was that my mother was sorry she took it that way.

I feel that my mother was way out of line and at the very least should have given a sincere apology. It's still bothering us a week later.

Are we right to be upset over this? I'm insulted that she could even contemplate that my wife was capable of something like that.

Now my mother is coming back to visit again and asks if we're over it and probably expects things to just be normal, however my wifes still upset about it, and never having got an apology doubts that they'll ever be friendly again.",16Mar2019,2

I have this friend who gets really heated over a certain kind of jokes, even if they aren't referring to them. They overreact, and then it just drives more for the ""funny"" reaction. I'm actually quite concerned for this person. They've started leaving the group chats and then being sassy about it. Often, the next day they forget about it, but I'm still concerned, as my other friends are making the same kinda excuses I see in these kinds of people like ""we do this to everyone"" which isn't really true, and ""stop overreacting"", which doesn't help. I've been in this sort of situation before, and I know those comments often aren't true, and when the person in question decides to say it isn't true, the excuses get stupider and worse.

I know that I do feel emotions, have thoughts, and have memories as I say things coherently, act out feelings (despite not feeling anything), and recall facts I learned in the past (without even realizing).

And the worse thing is that my mind is getting foggier and foggier everyday, like life is become more nonexistent everyday.

I have had a traumatizing past, which ultimately resulted in my having frequent violent thoughts (regarding me getting severely hurt). At first, I thought that my change in my brain might be a result of my past (as I used to be very conscious and able to remember, think, and feel emotions). However, my memory issues have gotten so bad that I'm worried that there actually might be something physically wrong with my brain (I can't remember going on vacations with my family, can't remember if I ate, can't remember where I am, don't miss my friends or family despite not seeing them for a while, don't react when I should, etc...).

My professor has left me in a difficult position. We are supposed to use python in the class for pytorch and tensorflow and a gpu server. From day 1 my computer refused to install them and I can't connect to the server thanks to my crappy campus housing wifi. After going back and forth with him up to the due date, he said he would allow me to use another language.

The second assignment went pretty well with this situation. However we're on the third assignment and he's suddenly changed his mind. He's said he wants me to do it like everyone else. He originally said he'd provide me with a computer, but it turns out he won't be able to even ask for it until monday, and even then he's not sure they'll actually give me one. He wants me to partition my pc and install linux on one side in case he doesnt get one (not sure how this would fix the wifi issue tho).

I definitely am not happy with doing that to my pc but it doesn't matter because my pc is also in a repair shop right now. Long story short, it will take a while since they are ordering parts. I have my pick between a shitty 5+ year old laptop, my dads laptop (i refuse to partition), or buying a brand new laptop.

303,"So, this is kind of weird and I don't know what to do. In November of last year I made a friend at work. We got pretty close real quick, had a lot in common etc. One day a friend of his died, which made things kind of weird of course, since we hadn't been friends for that long I didnt know how to respond but tried to be there for him as much as I could, saying stuff like he can always call me/come over etc.

In December was the last time I saw him. I remember him specifically saying 'I'm happy that I met you' and things like 'dont forget about me' stuff like that. He even got a little worried when I said I was going on a roadtrip because he thought I wasn't going to return and we wouldn't meet again. Then in January I threw a party, he said he was coming. In the end he didn't, he told me he couldn't come because one of his friends overdosed on acid, and he had to take him to the hospital. Fair of course! But again a very crazy situation which I didn't know how to respond to. (I know all these stories are true BTW)

Since that last text, I tried to talk to him one last time. He replied he had gone through a lot lately, and wasn't in the mood for meeting up. I can understand all that crazy stuff can really mess you up for a while, and said so to him. 'ill wait for you, take your time' I said.

This was in January, and I haven't talked to him since. I don't really know what to do with this situation,  I'm really bad at this kind of stuff. Did he forget about me? Should I text him? Should I drop it? Is it weird to text somebody you've only met a few months back if you haven't talked in two months? I really don't know what to do. It's been on my mind a lot because it feels so 'unfinished' to me? I wouldn't mind if he doesnt want to see me again but somehow I just need to know where we stand!

304,"So me and my friend get to share a kitchen with a few more people. Now, this semester two new girls came and were assigned to our kitchen. Before they came we had huge problems with two other guys who refused to clean after themselves. It only got worse when the two girls came.  These four somewhat united. The kitchen is so disgusting, we don’t even want to make coffee anymore let alone cook! They started eating our food and shamelessly leave the packaging either on the tables, counters or even in our shelves! I talked to them in the beginning, politely asking them to clean after themselves, but it feels like they intentionally keep the kitchen nasty. There’s trash everywhere, the sinks are full of dirty dishes and rotting food, the counters and the table are covered in used dishes, open can foods, and even cigarette ash in one of the dishes. We’ve written notes, only to get passive aggressive replies. We are done with it. We talked to the managers of our dorm (it’s a private dorm) and they can’t do anything about it. This morning, we went to the kitchen and it was in perhaps the most disgusting state I’ve ever seen it be. 
We can’t and won’t take this anymore. We are that close from waiting for them to have dinner and just emptying the trash cans on them and their food. It’s the end of the semester so we can’t change kitchens. And these people are exchange students so they won’t be here next year, thankfully.

306,"It’s funny how when you’re learning foreign language, you immediately pick up their curse words. 

When i was young, I used to swear a lot in both my native language and English. As I got older however, I learned how it is inappropriate to use such phrases and how they just make me look pathetic, rather than a looking like a strong figure i wanted to be seen as. I slowly stopped swearing in Korean. Never swearing in front of my parents also helped because i always had a subconscious restraint of what i should and should not say.

English, on the other hand, I only use it to communicate with my friends and browse websites. Putting swear words here and there made me sound funny and I had never felt the necessity to pull back. But now I want to change that. I want to be funny and kind without saying fucks and shits every minutes. But it seems like no matter how hard I try I slip whenever I’m less careful. Is it too late to change this habit? Can anyone give me an advice on how to stop cursing?

309,"So, there's a little backstory.

When i went to university, i was determined i would be a psychologist one day. I was never the brightest kid, and i really struggled at first. Throughout my 4 years in my bachelors, i managed to scrape my grades from 45-50% to getting a 1st Class Honours degree. Things were looking great by the time i graduated; I was doing voluntary research with my thesis supervisor, i had just been accepted to do a Masters in Research for a specialised field of psychology at a different university.

Things took a downturn at my MSc, it was so disorganised and many of the lecturers were a little supercilious, they were just so hard to talk to as a result... I attended during some of the largest university strikes in my country, which meant that a lot of my lectures eventually got cancelled with no rescheduling. I was stressed all the time due to not knowing how to do some of my assignments, alone in a new city and without any real guidance. I was trying really hard, I tried being class representative and i got through my first semester. Second semester came round, and it wasn't much better. I became very depressed and eventually just stopped going to university... Fell into a really bad habit of staying in bed, stopped trying and eventually had a breakdown on the phone to my parents. I have a wonderful family and my parents told me i could drop out and move back home to get better. I left the university, and was given a certificate with distinction due to the credits i had.

It's almost a year since i did this, im a lot better mentally. But i've only worked crappy jobs, and i really just want to move on. I've tried applying to grad schemes, but none want me. I've gotten through to interview phases for some of them, but yeah. We live very remotely in the countryside, and i don't drive. I feel so trapped, i can't even volunteer because im relying so much on other people to take me places. 

What would you do in my situation? I can't find a good job, I feel so trapped and unable to do anything. The only work ive had is seasonal, and my next seasonal job (same as last time before season ended) is coming up again. I hate the idea that im back there, i thought id have found something by now. When i was signing on (since christmas) my job coach said i had an excellent cv. I don't get why im so unemployable. I do not want to go back into psychology, i just can't put myself through it again. I've completely lost the passion i had for it.

I even looked at teacher training, but i dont have the maths qualification for it... (I have the level below what they want, despite all the statistics ive done).",16Mar2019,1
310,I’m trying to be as unbiased in this post as possible. I quit various jobs because I hated them and hated the fact I could use that time to improve myself. I am trying to reflect completely on this post so bare with me.  I want to do so much more with my life and not compromise my time by working for someone else. I’ve told this to my father but he gotten mad and told me I was lazy and unproductive that I’ve gotten old (21) and have nothing to show for my efforts. I tried getting a job in a field I’m interested in here in my town but to no luck. In simple words: I don’t want no man over me. I want to craft my skills and work for myself and do what I truly love. I am able to spend hours at the gym or spend hours on my computer and that truly makes me happy. I am disciplined and consistent when it comes to those things. Does this make me lazy for not wanting to work jobs I absolutely despise? Does it make me lazy for thinking that trading my time to be at a place I don’t want to be for 10 hours a day all for $100 make me lazy? Maybe I am entitled... I don’t know.

Poor family, no time and money for college so I started to work immediately after highschool in a carwash, then went to army and after that started to work with my brother in one print shop. Salary was 160 euros, for month ofc. :) After one year we both went to Russia to work for 3 months within that one print shop, like sister company. Then once we came back, I started to learn Norwegian language, course lasted for one year. And since I like to explore and to do something more, I started to apply for jobs in Norway. However, I do not own an EU passport, so i would always came with obsticles because of that. I had an  job offer from friend in Denmark, I went there with one way ticket  and 300e, however, job didn't came up .Something happened in the meantime. I now have a fiancee, and she is amazing, she supports me but she is not so adventurous and  she is very modest and wants to be in this country, mostly because of hers family. They are struggling, as everybody in this country except politicans and business people who are succesfull because of those politicians and because of those workers since they do not have other options but to work for miserable salaries. I went to Norway last year and I had an job interview for printshop. Everything was great except my work permit, they needed somebody immediately and for work permit you have to wait for 2 months minimum. So they hired some local guy without experience and that was it. I came back here and since I'm a good worker, I always have a job, but Serbia is country full of people who wants to scam you, I'm exhausted dealing with them. My friend and ex-colleague went to Norway to one company that I was in job negotations with, and he did get the job immediately, he has an EU passport. I did for him an CV, almost set a job appointment and I'm happy for him and he is sad because of me. Now I'm looking for Germany so my fiancee and I could be closer to Serbia but waiting period for work visa again and employer not willing to wait for you for several months. I had a job offer for Qatar, cruise ship, Malaysia, China but I sad no to that because it is too far, not for me, but for her. I love her and she is the one but she is aware that I'm going to be unhappy if we stay here and I'm aware that she is going to be unhappy if we go somewhere, if it happens.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with it, but she recently got a boyfriend, and I got a glimpse of her pictures and they were all pretty sexual. I also saw her getting defensive over girls that liked pictures of her and her boyfriend on her account, commenting stuff like “bitch unlike this right now.” I guess I’m a bit upset, she literally had no reason to block me and lash out on me like that.

314,"Let me start my life story since i was a kid, i was smart and inteligent, i was a good kid and never did something bad. My parents used to always fight and shout, they fought each other, they fought with my grandmother and so on. They would always make little things look like huge problems. I used to suffer a lot and i used to cry all night alone in the room and in the morning i would put my happy face to make things look normal and try to fix things. I moved away from my parents when i was 14 for better education ( that was an excuse because i just wanted to run away), I finished high school with good grade and till i was 19 i had to do everything on my own, like laundry, cooking and stuff. I used to cry and the only person who told me that things were gonna be better was myself, basically i was alone. When i was 19 my parents came to my city and we lived together, i started studying civil engineering and i finished my 1st year. In the next 3 years something broke and i never attended classes or went to university. I just would go around meeting people and eating food and basically wasting my time and 3 years. During this time my mom had 2 bad surgeries removing cancer and of course i suffered. They were home and the fights and shouting never stopped so i used to go out a lot. Now im 23 and soon im gonna be 24 in summer, i have lied to my parents and everyone and they think im on my last years of getting my msc degree and i have spent all my parents money. I wanna turn my life around because its going downhill. If i continue my studies im gonna be like 27-28 when im completely done with my education and im afraid of being late. Im afraid of being 27-28 still living with parents ( i cant move away because a part time job wont allow me to afford it and studies are full time), having debts, just finished education and probably just got a decent job. Im scared of losing every loved person i have becaue i have lied to them. Im even scared if i will makes it since i have been so lazy till now.

I’ve been transferred to different stores, been promoted, and learned about the business, but I’ve been stuck in a rut for the last 3 years. It’s affected my mood. I have insomnia, depression, and I go into work every day full of dread. No one listens to me. I want to dump my keys on my manager’s desk, tell him I quit and leave.

Labor cuts and poor upper management has left my growth stagnant. There’s less help every night and my manager has shown no movement on fixing the problem even though he has the power to do so. I’m asked to do more, the more he cuts, or we lose people while not hiring, and I find myself doing tasks that part-time teenagers were responsible doing a few years ago. The night customers have noticed these cuts as well, and despite me communicating their complaints about departments closing early, long checkout lines and no one on the store floor from 4-11 except for me, nothing has changed. 

I’m on a sinking ship.
And I’m ready to get off. Today I start applying to other jobs. But I haven’t had a real interview since I was 14. I’ve read some tips online, but I feel like I’ll sabotage myself by saying too much. How do I give short, concise answers that’ll get me a job?

It took me a while to put my finger on it but I realized today that she is a toxic person because: 1) She has literally ignored me and ostracized me for 7 years. 2) She is extremely critical and thinks only negative of me. 3) Only blames me for our falling out, never apologizes or takes responsibility for hurting me (even when I'm bawling because of her). 4) Due to the aforementioned reasons, I always feel like crap around her.

My family doesn't have a good understanding of mental illness or bullying and they don't think my sister has done anything wrong (they say she's just young and she'll grow out of it). They don't understand the excruciating emotional pain I've felt at times and the constant resentment I feel. Due to their essential enabling of my bully sister, I feel extremely alone and even resentful of my entire family for not supporting me or standing up for me.

1) Is it possible that a toxic person like herself can be ""fixed"" if I went to therapy with her? If not, what boundaries should I set with her and my family?

I also, at the same time, had double pneumonia. My family was told I probably would not survive. I did, but not without sustaining permanent kidney and other damages...of which no one made me aware for almost 3 years.) In 2016 I was hospitalized with an extremely low wbc count. I was released with no diagnosis. The most recent health issue I was diagnosed with is a thyroid tumor and a parathyroid tumor. I also have ongoing issues with inflammation of my joints and bodywide pain. My bloodwork is always not right but never lines up with any particular diagnosis.

I’ve had three relationships since then, including my current. Sometimes I do freak out during intimacy, but I can usually calm down eventually and be comforted. It didn’t happen too often.

I will admit I have some fairly rough kinks; one of them, shockingly, being a rape kink. I do not enjoy being raped. I enjoy rape roleplay. I had this before I was actually raped. I’m into some light BDSM as well. I decided to tell my current boyfriend this.

We were in bed, and I was undressed. He began to initiate sex a few times, and I said no. He became aggressive quickly, though he is aggressive in general during sex. I remember him touching me while I kicked and squirmed, saying, “I know you’re into me continuing when you say stop”, and I realized he actually thought I was into it. Last I remember he was on top of me, and then it just becomes an out of body blur of my thoughts racing about what to do or not to do.

I told him later that I really didn’t want it; he became severely upset and apologized profusely. He decided we will only have vanilla sex because he’s terrified of hurting me again.

335,"I’m a college student who lives about an hour away from my parents. My dad was incredibly emotionally abusive for the majority of my life. My mom was the enabler and became the abuser and the abused too. I was the main target for a very long time. There’s a long list of things they have said and done. It has scarred me and I went through a lot of therapy to overcome the trauma they put me through, the memories that suddenly resurfaced, and the effects it had on me at my current age. I’m on the right meds for the mental illnesses I developed and I’m feeling much better. I had to come down to my parents house yesterday to come and see my best friend and also retrieve a letter with money from my grandad at my parents house. Every time I come visit them I feel like a stranger I felt very uncomfortable and rigid coming into the house. I brought my boyfriend with me to help me feel a bit more comfortable and my parents put on the act they usually do whenever I have someone with me. They are nice to my boyfriend but they aren’t nice to me. My dad was still the condescending asshole he usually is. I told him the problems that needed to be fixed with my car because he bought me an old car from craigslist that has a lot of issues. I told him I had to put on new windshield wipers and he looked at them and laughed because I had put him on a bit incorrectly. He put in little jabs here and there and didn’t listen when I told him that my boyfriend and I needed to get going because the sun was going to go down and I don’t like driving at night. When I said goodbye to my mom she acted really cold towards me and my dad asked me why I look so tired but I was fed up. Every time I leave their house I feel very depressed and stressed out and my parents wonder why I never visit them. Recently, it was my grandfather‘s birthday and they did something horrible where they told him that I never visit them. My grandfather is very important to me and about a year or two his wife died and he is all alone. He is a great father and a very loving grandfather that I cherish. My aunt decided to cut him off a year or two ago because of something he said about my mom. It made my aunt feel like he favors my mom over her. It was something misconstrued and now he’s all alone in England and very depressed. So for my parents to say that I never visit them, my grandfather probably thinks that I’m doing the same to my parents as my aunt did to him. Since it was his birthday, I didn’t want to tell him the truth of how my parents treated me. My parents constantly gaslight me and it makes me wonder if I was just being too sensitive. It makes me question if they actually did anything wrong. I don’t know what to think. My head is all scrambled up. I want to cut them off. They deny everything and they don’t change. Even before I stopped visiting them they treated me like shit. I just feel sad. I wish I had a loving family. I consider my long term best friend as my sister and her family as mine.

He plays with other kids while he’s there, but he watches everything I do. He sometimes joins the bodyweight warm ups in my classes for fun. Our studio is like a big family and he is close to a lot of my clients and their families. 

I help with my clients’ nutrition, and eat healthy myself. He has also picked up on this and asks for healthy foods himself. There is a good balance though. We eat ice cream and fast food occasionally. I meal prep for him and always add mini cupcakes or donuts to his whole foods. 

Lately, he has been making comments about needing to work out or having a chubby belly. He is tall for his age and no where close to being overweight. I try to counter this by telling him we workout to be strong and that he is a super healthy boy. I try to be a positive influence and don’t make negative comments about my own body. I’m not what else to do. I’m just afraid he is developing body imagine issues because our lives are entrenched in fitness and nutrition. Any advice on how to keep these experiences positive for him would be greatly beneficial. 

Thanks. ",16Mar2019,8
339,"I (24F) want to have my 25th bday party, just so I have a nice memory when I think about it in 20+ years in future. But there are a few BUTs:   
\* I have a few friends, whom I meet one by one, they know each other but they aren't friends. And I have some people from college who I consider friends and I have a great long time boyfriend who's friends I could also invite. All together about 15.   
\* I am not a social butterfly, I am talkative when chatting peacefully with one person but I'm not good at being in the center of attention. I'm more of a listener. Which makes me difficult to throw a party where everybody's probably waiting for me to conduct it.   
\* My bday is in the beginning of summer, which mean that the weather could be OK or get chilly in the evening to hang outside. So I don't know where I should do it.   
\* I'd like my party to be organic, not too organized, but I'm afraid of throwing an awkward silent get-together (because of the variety of semi-familiar people I invited).   


Any ideas what could be the ice-breakers or places that everyone will feel chill and fun?",16Mar2019,1
340,"I met this guy about 3 weeks ago and we had a great connection. We have been hanging out almost every day since and I like him a lot. Here's the thing. He has told me that his longest relationship was only 6 months and that he's never had strong feelings for someone. He said he always starts liking someone and then ends up not liking them after a short while. I told him that seemed worrisome to me because I'm not interested in commiting to him if there's an expiry date. I also just broke up with someone a week before I met him. I have no feelings for my recent ex boyfriend and I would not consider this guy a rebound. However, I have so many people telling me that it would be best for me to be single for a while since I haven't really been single in a few years. That's fine and I get it, but last night he said some very reassuring things to me. He said I'm not like anyone he's ever met, that I'm very interesting and that he really, really likes me. He said he stopped talking to all the girls he was talking to when he met me. He asked me to be his girlfriend, when I said I'd think about it he seemed a little upset but said he understood. He also said he wouldn't hookup with anyone even though we aren't exclusive.

354,"**TL;DR:** Alcoholic and volatile brother-in-law may be coming to stay with my wife and I for a while to sober up and get back on his feet.  I've never lived with an addict before.  What should I expect and how can I mitigate the risks he may pose to my possessions and safety?

Here's the story: my wife and I have been together for 9 years.  I love her and her family unconditionally, and I would do just about anything for them.  I've known her brother (let's call him B) for equally long, though, and while I think he's a good guy at his core, he's kind of rough around the edges.  Multiple DUIs, frequent suicidal mass texts, and currently working on his second divorce.

He's never been violent, but he's starting to approach that line, and that's part of the reason he's in his current predicament.  My wife's sister (let's call her S) who is a very responsible adult has 4 kids and is a stay-at-home mom who has also been graciously babysitting B's 3-year-old daughter while he and his wife both work.  However, S's oldest son was just diagnosed with brain cancer at 7 years old, and she and her family have obviously been very preoccupied.  We're all trying to help out the best we can, financially and otherwise.  B has always been less financially stable than some of the others in his family so hasn't been able to contribute so much, but no one holds that against him.  However, he and his wife became angry when S told him that she would no longer be able to babysit his kid.

This is where things kind of started to snowball.  S becomes (very understandably) offended when B's first reaction to his nephew having brain cancer is essentially, ""how dare you not continue to babysit my child for free?""  They argue back and forth and the wedge between them deepens.  

B has had intermittent issues with alcohol in the past but has been quite clean for a while, really since he had his daughter about 3 years ago.  That ends, and the old B returns: mass texts to the entire family at 2am about how no one looks out for him, how he's never had a family, a picture of a gun and a 5th of vodka in the passenger seat of his car, etc. This used to happen about 1-2 times a year, and are more just cries for help than anything.  He's never actually attempted suicide or tried to hurt anyone, and knowing him I have a very low suspicion he ever would.  That said, we always take them very seriously and have called 911 before.  We've all reached out to try to help him but he doesn't think he has a problem.

Things get worse.  B's neighbor sees him drunk at home alone with his 3-year-old daughter.  He forgot her outside in the back yard and passed out on the couch.  The neighbor comes and gets her, takes care of her for the day, and calls CPS. Nothing comes of it, except making B spiral further into insanity.  Everything comes to a head when he shows up at S's house (an hour away) drunk with a baseball bat at 1am yelling threats.  Cops get called and he spends the night in the drunk tank, but no charges get pressed.

That was about 2 months ago now, and he hasn't lashed out or made any violent threats since then.  His wife is still obviously concerned though and divorce is probably in his future.  He lost a good and long-standing job and is struggling to make ends meet.  But he and my wife have been texting more frequently and it seems like he's making a concerted effort to stay away from booze.

So this morning my wife wakes up to a 1am text from B essentially asking to stay with us until he sobers up and gets his life in order.  He doesn't think he can do that in his current environment (his wife has her own issues) and feels like he needs a change of scenery.

Sooooooo...

We talked a little about it this morning before we both went to work, and agreed to offer him a place to stay with many heavy caveats.  We would run it like an Oxford house, i.e. he must get a job, pay his share of mortgage and utilities, do chores, attend AA or an equivalent 12-step program, get psychiatric help, no visitors, no alcohol in the house, and one fuck up means out.  We have no kids but we do have some valuable things around the house which I would hide while he stays here.  We'd get a lock for the master bedroom door.  I don't own firearms.

I do know what it's like to be burned by a friend struggling with addiction.  I've had things stolen from me, an apartment broken into, car taken and wrecked, and I do not want that to happen again.  It's a miserable feeling.  But I also love B.  As horrible as the above story paints him, I think the bad boy persona he puts on is flimsy.  He's really a good guy at heart, but he struggles with looking past his own perceived needs, and I think feels the need to play the part of the family black sheep.  I work with addicts professionally as well, and this may be the family bias talking, but I think he's far from irredeemable.  I think with the right support and environment he can get back on the wagon and live a good, productive life.

That said, I've never had an addict live under my roof, and I'm hoping someone with experience can give me some pearls and pitfalls when it comes to this tricky situation.  I really appreciate it.",16Mar2019,1

359,"TLDR: IT guy harasses women of the office and is up so some shady stuff on an admin account named after his sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello fellow reddit chaps. I made a throw away because i don't want to get Mr. Mercedes's or something. 

I have been doing yard work for a man who owns a company in one of the busiest areas of the state. I never really knew much about this guys operation, but i just met him and he needed some trees trimmed, stucco fixed, and other things. The man flips homes on the side of his first business of being a head honcho. 

Two weeks ago he asks me to get his phone fixed and i went into his office and ran through the issues and gave him a solution. (the phone was not unlocked by the carrier) told him to bring it back if he can't figure it out after that. Dr. Yang puts his hands on my shoulder and says,"" hmm you look like you good wit computers. Dat's what Bill said"".

&amp;#x200B;

Bill is a life long friend that i knew from diapers and is a retired engineer. (who flips houses with Dr. Yang.) 

&amp;#x200B;

So I go over to Dr. Yang's home yesterday to do yard work. we walk around his house, encounter some deer through the mountain terrain, but he gives me an idea of what he wants and a list of tasks. THEN, proceeds to tell me about how his entire month of Feb database for all of his appointments has been erased. I use to run a 24 hour operation with a server and ask him a few common questions. like do you have on site back ups, do they back themselves up every day? how do you manage the data?.... keep it simple.

Dr. Yang's eyes widen like a deer in the headlights. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stop prying and just say, ""well that shit is bummer man if you want me to come over and help with the Data entry i can""

&amp;#x200B;

He obliges. Seemed relieved to have me stop by his busy chiropractors office to help him. I get a call from a front office lady and directions to show up at 9 the next morn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pulling in is kinda hard because of how many cars drive this route in the morning but i get out. 

&amp;#x200B;

On my way in i see a weird guy, blonde fuzzy hair, sweat pants and and a beard. he makes some weird eye movements and stuff. Like looking down and away then around. I brush it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Opening the front door two nice front desk girls greet me. They take me back to a computer in an empty office and show me how to input the data.  We are laughing and giggling a lot. They are married but they seem like super happy to see me and that is cool! I like friendly easy people to work with it makes life easier. Thank you ladies. 

&amp;#x200B;

The door opens and from my perspective i cannot see who enters. They both go quiet and look at each other. Our great times evaporate like rubbing alcohol in a windstorm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its the homie from outside that looked like he just rolled out of bed after fourteen hours of raiding blackwing lair. He is the IT guy. He is super awkward and makes ZERO eye contact with anybody. Spends about 5 minutes in the back by himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

IT Zombie walks to front where ladies are now working. The Data entry is easy and i am able to be left alone after said 5 minutes. I kinda think the girls forgot what they were doing and they went to the desks like children waiting for punishment. ""You girls were the problem the virus infected your two computers through the encrypted network"". They both sat quietly as he walks one more time to the back and grabs computer tower from main office. ""The doctor's computer had been logged on by my sister and that is how the virus spread. one of you girls remotes into this computer and did this"".

&amp;#x200B;

Tech bro shifts CPU tower under other arm. ""I have to take Dr. Yang's computer, and will be on vacation next week. I will fix your network then."" leaves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit through my Data entry mouth shut. Front desk women are silent for a while, then we go back to normal. Having a great time in the office. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask them a few questions amid our work day and they reveal to me that this guy is the only person with admin privileges. It takes months to update programs. When ever things go wrong he makes them call him over and over and beg to get the shit fixed. He rides in on a high horse and fixes it, randomly because he just vanishes for long periods of time. Like weeks radio science. then bang 5 mins of work everything great and im out. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I do not know does this sound shady? I am about to go meet with the doctor and i want to know what to say. Do i keep it cool and just slowly build my case. I would not like to have my hands on or be associated with computers or servers that contain potential illegal smut.

any ideas would be great.

375," So recently I noticed how much time a day I was spending watching videos and thinking about engineering. Be it rocket, jet or car engines, transistors or stuff I find it all really interesting.
 I have been thinking pretty seriously about this and I picture myself really happy with an engineering job, having previously found much joy in everything like tinkering around the house, designing stuff and finding solutions.
 And whilist I enjoy maths, due to some circumstances I have never reached the level I would have liked. In late june I will have the highschool graduation test in my country, that decides pretty much what college you can attend.
 Most of these highschool years I have been barely passing maths, and every time I started taking private hours, a couple sessions sent me from failing to almost nailing every test, so I think I have the potential.

I wanted to start math courses again but my teacher cancelled me 2 weeks in a row, and I am wondering if there are any good places I can learn highschool level maths.


TLDR: Any good sites to learn maths?

376,"I had been on a job hunt and found one I was incredibly interested in (a higher managerial role in a company I had previously worked for and loved), showed and told my girlfriend all about it, as you do. I applied, and was unsuccessful after being told the position was already filled. I continue my job search and find another that was suitable but not quite as good as the previous opportunity.

Fast forward a month, and my girlfriend wanted to move and change jobs to the same town that I live in. She tells me the position I wanted had been re-advertised, but I thought it was probably too late to re-apply as I had not long started my new job. A few days later she asks me if I would be annoyed if she applied for it, I told her honestly and said that I would be, because I wanted that job, I previously worked there, my old colleagues were still my very good friends etc. It turns out she had already applied for it before asking me if I would be annoyed (snakey).

She's since had interviews and has essentially been told she has the job.

Is my annoyance/anger justified?

377,"Sorry it’s long tl:dr at the bottom

They began their relationship not so long ago but convinced it was the real thing. They moved in together with their children (one each) from past relationships just after about three or four months together. She became pregnant a month after and she is over the moon happy. The guy seemed to be this great man, always attentive, charming and kind to everyone, especially her female friends. 

Two weekends ago I went dancing to a pretty dodgy place, the kind of place where “respectable people” don’t go (I was there with a friend because we were way underdressed to go elsewhere and we just wanted more drinks and music at 2am). En fin, I ran into him at about 3am but didn’t think much about it because aside from his day job he’s a DJ. His face transformed when he saw me, I immediately realized something was wrong. I asked him if he was there to play a set, but he said no, he began buying us drinks whenever he was around until he disappeared. I tried to put it out of my mind but it was very heartbreaking to see an Instagram post of her and the two children at home on that same Saturday night, while he was out. 

Two days ago I met with my friend whom we had gone dancing to this place, and she confirmed she met the actual girl he was dating on the side. I had left shortly after running into him but she stayed and she saw him with said girl holding hands and kissing. Later she learned that said girl is close friends with one of her friends, and ended up getting together last weekend. This girl confirmed to my friend they have been dating for a while now but asked not to tell anyone because his girlfriend is pregnant. 

I feel terrible. I don’t know how to tell my friend or if I should at all. I wish I never knew. I don’t want to cause her pain or sorrow, specially with her being pregnant. I confided in our mutual girl friends (3 out of a group of 7) and we are at a loss. Should we speak to him instead? My heart is broken for my friend. I need advice please.

I never do this, but after about the 6th hour I was honestly concerned for her wellbeing and checked snap maps. She'd been offline for that whole time. So what though, her phone was dead maybe. I was just happy she was okay, but after that I couldn't stop myself from checking every now and then. She stays offline for 3-4 hours at a time routinely. She'll be offline for hours, come online for a few minutes, and then go offline again for hours. We hardly even have conversations anymore. I'm really concerned, I really trust her, but this looks bad. Messaging her doesn't seem to affect how quickly she comes back on line which makes me think she isn't getting the notifications cause she's on a different account.

I don't know snapchat that well. Could I be misinterpreting this? How can I find out if i'm right? (I really really hope I'm wrong.) I read I can block her and then search for friends by contacts and her second account could pop up, but that's a bit too suspicious.

379,"This is a big, annoying problem for me. I've always been self-conscious and insecure, and though I've gotten better at taking risks and not being afraid to embarass myself a little, I still find I sit a lot on what people say. Someone might make a joke at my expense that everyone else laughs at, or call out a thing that I did which makes me feel embarrassed. Being looked down on or belittled, possibly losing the respect of people who cared about me, these things stress me.

I've seen a lot of advice that boils down to ""just don't care"", ""remember that none of this matters in the future"", ""people aren't thinking about you as often as you might assume"". But as much as I try to keep those things in mind I just cannot shake my bothered feelings. That thing someone said will be in my head for the rest of the day as I overthink it and sit on it and try to wrap my mind around how it made me feel. I end up addressing it by trying to pull for people's sympathies, then I don't want to talk to the associated person.

Is there some kind of ""formula"" for people like me, or a ""method"" that lets them easily brush off remarks directed towards them or at their expense, so I can stop overthinking and squash my embarrassed feelings right away?",16Mar2019,2

383,"I currently live in a townhouse style college apt with the other guys, to give some background me and roommate 1 have been friends for years and came into this apt not knowing our other two roommates. Roommate 2 lived in this apt last year and roommate 3 moved in the same time as us this year. Roommates 2 and 3 also have known each other for most of their lives. We have a 3 story apt, 2 beds up stairs and 2 beds downstairs and the main floor has the kitchen and living room. My bedroom is upstairs above the living room (important). I have been having some small but growing problems with roommate 3. And knowing those problems me and my friend roommate 2 already signed a lease for next year at the same apt complex but for a two bedroom apt instead of staying here. Our current lease doesn’t end until July and then our new lease will start the next day. 

So this all started about 3 months ago, I wanted to get a cat, I’d thought about it for awhile and I feel like am just starting to financially healthy enough to own a pet. And to be honest I just wanted a close companion, since I missed my parents dogs. I made sure to talk to everyone multiple times about it and make sure we were all on the same page. I asked all three roommates multiple times if they were 100% ok with getting a cat because it’s a big deal and it’s not something that I’m just gonna give back once I get it. Turns out roommate 2 wanted one as well and had been thinking about it for some time also. Everyone said they were 100% in and ok with it. So a couple days later I went to the local shelter and got 2 young cats. Well, I bring them home, and roommate 3 freaks out. He complained about his friends being allergic and his family being allergic, and he went as far as saying he himself may be allergic. I got the cats the first week in November which is close to finals week. Nothing really big happened for some time except whenever I let my cat downstairs roommate 3 was always a huge ass to him. He wanted to smoke weed in his face and he’d complain about him getting scratched and yadda yadda, I’ve had tigger for almost 6 months now and he’s never scratched me unless In play time.   Finals week comes and goes and everyone goes home for Christmas break. About a week or two in roommate 3 sends a text to our group chat stating how he “feels so much better now that he is home and felt really crappy at our apt and thinks it might be the cats”. Now I’m a very easy going non confrontational person. But that pissed me off because I know he only feels better because he’s done with classes and exams. We had the cats for close to a month before then and he never complained once, which if he really was allergic he would have known within a couple days. So I work with him and say I will leave tigger in my room for most of the day (which has turned into 24/7). Roommate 2 just got rid of his cat all together after that, he said it had nothing to do with roommate 3 but I have my doubts. Jump forward about a month middle to late January. Roommate 3 is in a frat and our campus is a “dry” campus, and his frat wasn’t allowed to throw party’s this year for some reason, so, roommate 3 has been throwing party’s at our apt. Me and roommate 1 had fun at some earlier in the year but we don’t much care for them anymore at this point and don’t want to deal with them. But we let him have one and we decided to just stay in our rooms. Well, the party got big time out of hand people were upstairs running into our bedroom doors trying to get in to go to the bathroom, like running start hockey check the door. Roommate 1 let some of them in but I didn’t.  After that party we decide that’s enough and we don’t want anymore. So the next morning while WE clean up our apt after the party we didn’t even go to. We told roommate 3 we don’t want anymore and he kept saying ok, ok, ok, then he goes well ok but I want to throw one more big one in April for me and roommate 2s birthday (within the same week). We say we’ll talk about it later in the future but we’d rather not have one. Nothing really happens for about another month. I wasn’t home but roommate 1 was hanging out in the living room with 2 and 3 and some of there friends in the living room, and he told me he started a Facebook page for the party in April  even after knowing we don’t super want to have it. He didn’t say anything then. Nothing else has happened up until about 3 weeks ago just before college spring break. I just got a full time job in January doing exactly what I want at a young up and coming local start up, basically a dream come true. And roommate 3 has been really big into smoking blunts in the living room (those that don’t know a blunt is a cannabis filled cigar). And all the smoke from those blunts goes straight up into my room, but my nose is so used to it since they smoke weed in our living room all the time I didn’t notice until I was visiting my GF, she hugs me when I first see her and tells me I reek of tobacco. I get home from my weekend visit and my nose forgot the smell of our apt and I walked in and it was like a brick wall of weed and tobacco, my room was even worse. I sent a text to our group because no one was home and say I’d really appreciate if they don’t smoke blunts up stairs anymore they can smoke them in their rooms or smoke their bong in he living room, the blunts smoke was going straight into my room and soaking into my clothes, and I’m not about to be that guy that smells like tobacco, especially at work. Roommate 3 responds and says “Ugh ok but we haven’t even smoked one in like 3 days” I just said thanks even though I wanted to say more to that back handed comment.  Move forward a week or two and they just get back from spring break and I get home from work around 6, and roommate 3 and our neighbor are smoking a blunt in our living room. I think ok it’s just one they haven’t seen each other in a while I’ll let it slide I don’t want to make a big deal with outside people there. Then last night I was sitting downstairs with everyone and he invited two frat brothers over and they smoke a blunt, he didn’t even acknowledge me or ask me if I was ok with it, and I’m not confrontational enough to stop him, I felt like I was in a weird situation in front of two people I’ve never met, so regretfully I didn’t say anything. Fuck that was longer then I wanted it to be. 

Where I’m looking for advice, I have been thinking about transferring into a new apt for some time, I haven’t really talked to my complex about it but I know it’s possible. I just don’t know how to go about it because I know we aren’t allowed to smoke in our apts, which I’m ok with smoking and do it myself just not to the degree roommate 3 does and I didn’t want the blunts, so I’m torn with dealing with this for the next 4 months or spending however much time it’ll take to transfer and telling them about the smoking (All 3 of us smoked in our apt and the only person I’m ok throwing under the bus is roommate 3).  Sorry for the length but that’s pretty much it.

384,"Hello all, I am a freshman in college and Im seriously lost in finding myself with my clothing style, I'm doing something wrong. Ive always liked to dress what I thought was ""nice"" ... i.e button down shirt, well fitting jeans (no distressing) or chinos and a pair of nice casual sneakers or boat shoes.

I go to a local state school in CT (Northeast). A roommate of mine who is from Mexico (born and raised) told me nicely that I dress ""too white"", that's why I feel like I stand out like a sore thumb and don't get attention. My school is largely not white, mainly African American and Hispanic. I feel like a nerd and a dork by the way I dress compared to my fellow college attendees. Most if not all of the men at my college wear ""swagged outfits"" like supreme camo t-shirts, chains, earrings, distressed jeans and jordans. The look is definitely streetwear.

I (M23) live with 3 guys (20, 20, 21) and we are all very close. We tell each other just about everything that goes on in our lives. Also, within the group, they often refer to me as the dad because I am a bit older and often give life advice. This will be important.  

I was hanging out with 2 of the guys, Curls and Smiles, talking about relationships when I brought up how I thought that cheaters were scumbags. Surprisingly, both of them were taken aback by this and Curls questioned me. This confused me because he had been cheated on and we had discussed how emotionally damaging and terrible it was. When I brought this up to him, he kind of quietly agreed and we moved on from the topic. 

A few days later, my other friend, Yellow Light (YL), comes home very upset and was too choked up to talk. He and his girlfriend had broken up.  

later, I was studying with smiles and YL. I overheard them laughing about YL and a girl. I asked them what was going on and they just started laughing and gave cheeky answers. YL then proceeds to tell me that there is something that he has been meaning to talk to me about but that he was waiting because ""I would react differently than Curls and Smiles.” He asked me what I thought was going on and judging by what they were saying I could deduct that he had cheated on his now ex with this girl. His face told me I was right, and he said we would talk that night when we weren’t in a public. 

He told me everything. He explained that he had been putting off telling me because he knew how I felt about it and was worried about how I would react. Further, he told me that Curls and Smiles had told him about what I said about cheaters which made him even more worried. He then asked for my honest opinion so I told him that I don’t think that he is a scumbag but that I was disappointed in him and that I knew he was better than that. He agreed and told me that he felt bad and that was part of the reason he didn’t tell me yet. We also talked about the other girl and I told him that I felt it would be best if he waited to do anything further with her out of respect and decency for his ex, who he dated for around 4 years. He agreed and we moved on.

It should be noted that I preluded our conversation with 1) my opinion ultimately is not that important, and it is up to him to do what he feels is best, and 2) I would love him no matter what and that I don’t want him to be afraid to tell me things because I would never think less of him.  

That night Curls and Smiles kept making comments about YL and this new girl and a continued relationship. He reacted in a way that suggested they weren’t wrong. Now, if that is the decision he makes then that is on him, and while I may not agree, it would not alter my love for him. However, it seems as though if there is a continued relationship between them then he is hiding it from me. Which is his choice, he owes me no explanation, but I’m hurt that he wouldn’t talk to me. 

Should I be more hesitant in voicing my moral concerns when my friends bring up these types of issues? And, if YL is continuing a relationship with this new girl, should I just be quiet about it even though I feel like it’s a really indecent thing to do to his ex? 

I do not want there to be a disconnect in any of these relationships because they feel like they can’t tell me things due to the way I would react. But I find it important to call my close friends out on their bullshit so that they can be better people, because that what I would want.  

TL;DR I called cheaters scumbags when talking with 2 good friends, not knowing that our other good friend had just cheated. This led him to worry about telling me about the situation and makes me wonder if I am too harsh in my moral convictions when dealing with them.

Is that a good or bad thing? I admit I was silly and caused some of the arguments, but the interesting part is we are talking again and it’s almost like I’m meeting her for the first time, nothing but good vibes.

Recently, we mutually apologized, I help her with depression saying she’s beautiful and should be happy, I let her borrow my vape which her eyes lit up, we hugged, and I complimented her which she returned. She also offered to smoke me out/get me stoned.

So some pretty good vibes lately but I’m just confused why we keep talking to each other after arguing. Is there something between us?

404,"I have created an alternate account for this, as my friend follows me on reddit. My friend, we'll refer to as ""B"", has severe depression. I met B 2 years ago, and we've been best friends since. 3 months after I met her, she told me she has depression and has to go to therapy (normal therapist for stuff like this, as far as I know). About 6 months ago, she started to get better. 2 months ago, she started cutting herself. She would have panic attacks on discord calls, and actually once purposefully burned herself on call. Starting 1 month ago, she's started to get worse. B now has to go to intensive therapy at the local hospital. Since September 2018, she's been suicidal, and only in January of this year has her parents taken more action. Her prescription drugs for her depression got switched, and she said that helped. But now, her meds have to be put in a lockbox so she doesn't overdose, and whenever her parents are gone, she sometimes cuts. She told me that she does it to de-stress, and that sometimes she thinks her parents don't give her enough attention so she does it for attention. I've tried everything I can (at least, I hope) and have even texted her mom once or twice if I knew she was cutting on call. I want to help so badly, and she misses class now 3 days a week for the last period for therapy. She is also afraid her parents will get mad at her if she tells them more. A day ago, she rummaged through her dad's lockbox for something to cut herself with (they almost completely baby proofed the house of cutting materials) and he called her out, but B wouldn't admit it. Today she texted me she was getting a panic attack, and she sliced herself with a pushpin. What do I do? How do I help?",16Mar2019,4
405,"Hello all, I’d like to start this out by saying I love my parents very much and I appreciate all that they’ve done for me. Buckle in for this weird story that is my life lol

So I’m 24, I live with my parents while I work, but I recently quit school for a number of reasons lol. My parents don’t really have normal, stable jobs, my dad got fired from his job a couple of years ago and my mom quit her job a couple years ago too. My dad does eBay full time and my mom does uber/lyft full time. They’ve been trying for a couple years to start their own spice/food business based after my grandpa (rip). So granted it’s not a lot of income, so my brother and I help out with the bills.

The thing with my parents is that... they don’t like us being lazy lol, they don’t like us going for an amount of time without working on something. They don’t like us just coming home from work and doing nothing which I get. But I’m kind of getting annoyed when they comment that “I’m young and that I shouldn’t be tired”. And it’s mostly my mom that I have problems with nowadays. She says I don’t dress like a “normal 24 year old should dress”, so she said she wants to start dressing me, she doesn’t like my haircuts one time she said I looked like a skinhead? I had the same bank account with her  until I turned 21 and then I realized it was weird at that age and went to a different bank. We also are all under the same phone plan under her name lol. Not to mention I have to let her know what I’m doing and where I’m at after 10.

The MAIN reason I’m posting about this is because now, I guess she’s fed up with my financial situation right now, yknow the standard credit card bills and a couple debts, so she got mad and demanded my bank information and login info. Now she’s going to be keeping an eye out on what I spend my money on, and on top of it, she expects $500 a month so we can all open a new bank account together and share one card lol. In fact, she’s so fed up, her and my dad are writing up a CONTRACT on what they expect of me and my brother from now on because they “can’t leave it up to us anymore” if we don’t fulfill this contract for the “two years” we owe them a fine of $5000, that’s the kicker

I don’t really know what to do? My parents are very family oriented and it’s hard to get a say in about anything without her making it about my dad, or just downsizing the problem, or just write it off as me giving “attitude”. I think at 24 this is more than unnecessary lol, and I don’t think my life is in that bad of shape, I could be a lot less worse. I could have a kid, I could be in jail, I could be addicted to drugs, etc. I don’t want to sound like an ungrateful brat, but idk I just wanted some advice on what is the right move to make here. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did I know it’s a lot.

I'll be a little behind because of the year and a half I spent in Computer Science, but I'm ready to work hard and catch up. I'm taking summer courses and looking for some sort of internship.

So, about that. I was offered a lab assistant position by a prominent PhD scientist at my school, and I was supposed to meet him for the first time yesterday to discuss that. However, I also had a final exam a couple hours later that day, and due to prior events it was imperative that I did well on that final (which, for the record, I'm pretty sure I aced, but that's beside the point). I was in panic mode studying for that final, and I had turned off my phone which is where I had set reminders to go to the meeting. My whole brain was focused on that final and I completely forgot to meet the professor. 

I realized it this morning as I woke up and looked at the date. Saturday. The day after I was supposed to meet him. I feel like absolute shit, and like I just threw away an important opportunity. I emailed him basically saying that I apologize, explaining the final but acknowledging that it's not an excuse, apologizing for wasting his time and understanding that this reflects very poorly on my reliability, and saying that I still want the position if he will still consider me for it.

416,"One of my oldest and closest friends is in a financially and emotionally abusive relationship. He and I currently no longer live in the same city.

I'll give more details for those who want them after my question.

TL;DR-My friend's girlfriend is isolating him more and more and now has blocked my number on his phone. Please help me figure out how to approach this.

He and I had a conversation two days ago regarding this relationship. I brought up some concerns that he confirmed, and he  brought up some concerns of his own that I wasn't aware of.

Today, I called him just to chat about some geeky interests we share to discover that my phone number had been blocked. What I'm certain happened is that he brought up some of this stuff with her and mentioned me, then she got on his phone and blocked me. There are other things that have gone on in our communication that support this. Like Facebook messages that are clearly not his way of writing, suspicious non-responses to texts that I had a gut feeling a while ago were being deleted before he saw them, etc. As I write this, she is trying to pass herself off as him in a Facebook Messenger conversation. It's taking all my self-control not to say ""You're really not good at this [her name].""

So here's where I need advice.
I need to figure out the best way to get a phone call to him, and the best approach in talking to him in what could be a one shot at talking about this. We've been friends for almost 20 years, so we have mutual close friends, and they will clearly be the bridge here and part of addressing this, I just don't know the best strategy. I don't want to fly by the seat of my pants and get her more suspicious and cut him off from more people.

Please help. I am intensely worried about him. The degree of control she is exerting and isolation she is imposing seems to be increasing at a pretty fast clip, and I'm scared of where this could go.

Further details for those who want them-

One of the issues that makes this harder to address is that the two of them very recently (in the last month) moved to her hometown (her decision). So there is no one there that he knows that could physically go meet him.

He has never been diagnosed, but he has a lot of the signs of someone with Asperger's. I say that to give a more thorough picture of him. There's a lot of social cues he doesn't get at first. In addition to that, he has a lot of issues around self-worth that leave him very vulnerable this kind of thing. Two of his greatest driving fears are of not. being liked by people generally, and never having someone really love him (in other words, one of the factors here that he has owned up to is his fear that he'll never find another relationship).

Last fall, he moved in with her and a number of her friends. Long story short, they collectively abused his fear of being disliked to the tune of $15,000 in three months, as well as using him as a free babysitter.

She has declared that she is adopting the baby of her pregnant friend (who followed her to moving back to her hometown). Leaving aside all the other things that are crazy about this piece (like the fact that she just now realized adoption is a legal process and you can't just have someone hand you their child), she has pretty much left my friend out of all conversations about it and she just tells him what she declares is going to happen. Even in a relationship that wasn't otherwise abusive, this would be a giant red flag for a whole host of reasons.

I appreciate any an all input. Thank you.

417,"I have social anxiety, depression and CPTSD from a bad childhood. I'm 29. Lately I have been thinking how mundane life is. I've been working a minimum wage job in a care home for several years. I have a degree in a subject I'll never use. My lack of confidence from an abusive childhood keeps me in this same job. 

I have a lovely boyfriend but lately my sexual attraction to him is just dwindling. It might be depression, but we haven't had sex for a month now. I feel so guilty every time we go asleep rather than have sex. It is difficult as well because we only see eachother on weekends as we don't live in the same town.

Lately I've just been wishing and dreaming.  I wish I had done a different degree. I wish I had learnt languages instead. I curse my anxiety so much. Lately I have been thinking about going to Korea to teach English. I mean it's all just a pipe dream. 

The reality of my life will be moving in with my boyfriend and having an easy, typical life. Due to my mental health I'll probably end up working in low skill jobs all my life. I'll go to work then come home and watch a movie with my boyfriend, eat dinner and play video games. Rinse and repeat.

I miss feeling sexually desired. And I miss desiring my boyfriend. He is getting a receding hairline at such a young age. I go to the gym and look after myself, but he doesn't care what he eats. It sounds sad but I can't help but imagine a life in Korea. The people are nice, and good looking. I find myself more attracted to foreign people than white people. So many white men don't take care of themselves. 

I just don't want a boring life like this. I feel so stuck.

419,"Lately I've been feeling a little lost, but let me tell you where I am.

I honestly have a great life. I'm 30(m), I'm a pretty good-looking guy, I have my shit together. I live in Indiana, I have a 3000 square foot house, a 2016 vehicle that is paid off, I have around 58k in retirement, I have 50k in savings, no debt, pretty much no worries.

My brother moved in with me about a year ago after his wife left him, and we have a fantastic relationship. I have a very solid group of friends, but I think I'm about to get left behind.

All my friends are engaged, or married. One is expecting a child in a couple of months. I've always had a girlfriend in streaks. Until the last year or so I've only really wanted to be in a committed relationship that would potentially last the rest of my life. I never really put much effort in my previous relationships, and it seems like the girl always worshipped the ground I walked on. Since I've been dating it actually putting effort in it seems like no one wants to commit, or gets turned off by the fact that I actually want to be with them. It's weird. Also at 30 it doesn't seem like there's much potential for anyone that I would actually want to be in a long-term relationship with (at least in the area I live in). I feel like everyone that's good is already taken.I definitely don't want to date someone that has a kid with someone else, but being realistic I feel like that's about 70% of the dating pool at my age.

I have a bit of social anxiety now, and I used to be a really confident person. After college I started work in the IT field, so that was the end of meeting new women. It's so hard to meet people these days. I was dating a girl that I met online recently and it was going fantastic. On our third date she got a DUI and very shortly after that we stopped talking because she can't come to my house due to losing her license, and I'm severely allergic to cats so I really couldn't go to her house for more than a couple of hours at a time.

I think I want to move, but where would I even move? In the back of my mind I'm asking what will change? I'm super close with my parents, and honestly I think they would be crushed if I moved away. This is my biggest deterrent.

God I want to live near the ocean, I would love to learn how to surf. I would love to go scuba diving whenever I want. The weather in Indiana sucks, and I feel like there's nothing really to do here except to get drunk and play video games.

I feel like I'm doing everything right, but at the same time I feel like I'm doing something very wrong. After writing this down it sounds like an early midlife crisis, but I have no ambition to go buy a Corvette just yet.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

420,"This is long and I apologize. But I'm kinda at a crossroads in my life, and I want to just be honest with people even if it will mean I am cutting down on who is in my life, particularly since I've already been hiding the fact that I'm afraid to be homeless due to my situation and that's been stressful enough. 

The problem is, I don't know how to be honest, because I'm scared of communicating with people and making things worse in case being honest is would cause more problems, and because I've been too scared to contact people regularly, so I'm worried it will come off as I am just communicating with them for attention when I really just want to openly be myself around them and to give some explanation for why I am so scared to open up or engage with them fully. I'm so scared to talk to people that I just shut down and outwardly, it probably appears that I'm not interested or not engaged in their lives or don't care, when I'm really just panicking all the time.

Most of my life, I've hidden and covered the fact that my parents have been horrible to me emotionally and otherwise. They were economically supportive with caveats so they could control me, and in public and to other people they are very kind and no one would think they did anything, but behind closed doors they basically destroyed me, and while what I went through was in no way comparable to worse levels of abuse, for me personally I just couldn't handle it anymore. So I left, and pretended we left on amicable terms. My parents lie to themselves and others so often they basically gaslit themselves into thinking everything was fine, so that kinda made leaving easier. 

But I also never told anyone about what they've done except like... 3 best friends and 2 of their parents and 1 professor, mainly because I have no proof and I didn't want to talk about my private life and because I was scared that being honest would lead to escalation from my parents and I didn't want to cause issues rocking the boat in the family or hurting their reputation or because my friends parents are friends with my parents or just don't see certain behaviors as abuse. And I'm still working on financial stability, and finances are the one thing tying me to my parents since I can't fully afford to live on my own despite having an apartment, but I'm willing to do what I have to to fully get out and I can't keep drawing this out or pretending things are going to magically get better.

But I want to be honest with my extended family that I do not want to be around my parents without them telling me I owe it to them to be around or to get over it or attempts at reconciliation. I do not feel safe and I need to work on myself to become healthy again. And I don't want to assume that is the way they are going to be, but since I only really see them at my parents house for holidays, I don't see how to escape a really painful and awkward situation for everyone even if I visit them individually because they are close to my parents and my parents do a lot for our extended family. I'm scared of hurting people or rocking the boat, but I need to be honest with the people I love for my own sake and out of respect for them.

TLDR: I think I'm trans (and before this I have identified as lesbian), and while that isn't the focus, my family doesn't really know because my parents implied people wouldn't treat me the same, and even if they won't, I'd rather just be honest and know that I won't be accepted. More importantly, before this I've escaped an abusive situation with my parents that wasn't overt, but I don't know how to tell my family that's why I don't want to come to any gatherings with my parents and why I've withdrawn from them. I have no issues being honest with my family about my identity and if they hate me for that, that's just life. But I don't want them to think I hate my parents. I just don't feel safe around them.

Otherwise, I really want to reconnect with old friends and their families and just talk to them more and be involved in their lives, but I'm so withdrawn and scared that I only ever seem to reach out to some people when I'm desperate for advice and I feel selfish and bad at maintaining positive relationships.

I'm also just scared to be honest because what if my parents are getting better? Like, I know they haven't been really bad lately, but I know for a fact that it's because I ran and because I'm not giving them the opportunity, and I know the moment I get hoovered back in, nothing will have changed.

The other issue is timing. I'm still trying to get my own insurance and to get ownership of my car and personal documents (social security card, birth certificate, phone plan, and medical and car insurance), and I don't want to do this if it means it will impede my ability to get those things so I can fully escape, particularly since I can't really afford this stuff right now and I might be homeless if I can't get diagnosed with whatever is wrong with me or hold a job, but I really think being fully escaped from my abusive parents control will cut off a lot of my stress.

So what kind of plan should I implement? When should I be honest with my family? How do I get out fully when financially I'm still struggling?

I also guess I'm writing all this because I've been scared to be honest with myself. I thought if i just kept my head down and pretended everything is fine, I could move on and fake it until it was true enough. But that hasn't worked, and it is really mentally taxing when it means I'm still somehow thinking I deserved this, that I'm wrong, when I know logically I was just mentally terrorized and physically threatened for years, but I'm scared to admit that coming clean means I might burn bridges and have to accept that my parents will never be safe for me, even if they promise to change. I guess part of me likes to pretend I have a safety net and doesn't want to cut contact because it might mean everyone except the people who already know won't abandon me... but logistically, I really don't have that.

What should I do?",16Mar2019,1

a few weeks ago, I went to my first psytrance party where I ran into many of my friends, including my best friend.
I just came out of psych ward a few days before, so stupid me decided it was a good idea to drink WAY TOO MUCH and take drugs. 

When I met a friend of mine, she had a guy friend with her who I was kind of into; I was really drunk, so I don't remember much. But we made out and I later found out he had a girlfriend. 

So I can't even recall this, but apparently, I ran into my best friend in the middle of it all and told him, while laughing, that I just made out with a guy who had a girlfriend. He then proceeded to tell me (the day after) that he saw me continuing to make out with that guy even though I knew he had a girlfriend. 

I can't remember doing it and I am really ashamed because sober me wouldn't ever do that. Anyway, my best friend told me that he thought my behaviour was disgusting and his moral values couldn't let him be close friends with me after doing that, and that he lost a lot of respect for me as a person. I told him it was a huge drunk mistake and I wouldn't do it again, I also didn't ever contact the guy (he left his number etc) but he didn't answer to this anymore - we haven't talked in two weeks and I hate myself for doing it. 

I don't want to lose him as a friend - have you got any ideas on how I can make it up to him? I know I can't change what happened, but it's really breaking my heart.

Thanks in advance!",16Mar2019,0
425,Two weeks ago my dog passed away while sleeping(she was a 9 year old purebred boxer). I’m a sophomore now and she was with us when I was in 3rd grade when we got her and she was the best dog ever. A few years before she died my brother made some stupid choices and was locked up. He loves this dog more than anything else in the world. The problem is that my family is arguing over if we should tell him while he is in prison or if we should wait for him to get out and then tell him (he has one month until he gets out. Should we tell him or wait till he gets out?,16Mar2019,1
427,He's the type of person that would absolutely love the content from r/Dankmemes and other's like that. I've been telling him for months now that he needs to make the push and follow subreddits and actually get involved. But he's still too lazy and hasn't gotten any further than making an account. I've even told him the subreddits he'd enjoy. To make matters worse he gets his memes from Instagram. Any advice on how to motivate someone like that?,16Mar2019,2

432,"So, my boyfriend and I (both 21) began renting a house last summer and were thrilled as we have been wanting to live with each other (by ourselves). Neither of us wanted roommates. However, back in September, my boyfriends best friend from childhood was kicked out of his house by his parents (for reasons relating to his sexuality). Given it was a shitty situation, my boyfriend and I allowed him to stay at our place (which is a 2 hour drive from where his friend did live). This all happened with the intentions of him staying 2 months MAX, as I really did not want another roommate. The problem is, it has now been 7 months since he moved in, and he has not contributed a cent to live here. No rent money, no gas or electric money, and (most frustrating to me) has not ever contributed anything to groceries. Now, my boyfriend and I work our asses off with school and jobs to afford to live, and this guy has just not done shit. After 2 months, he went to a temp agency (which I think he should have done day one). But nothing ever worked out. So he has no job and just sits in his room playing video games (on the internet WE pay for) eating the food (that WE pay for) and literally does not do shit. And keep in mind, it has been 7 MONTHS. 

He just won’t leave. He doesn’t have a cent to his name, no drivers license, nothing. He has nowhere else to go. He keeps telling us “well my step dad doesn’t want me coming back home so my mom is trying to figure something out” and has been saying “she’s going to try to pick me up next weekend” for the last 2 months. And it just seems that every weekend that rolls around he says “She’s still trying to figure it out”. 

I just genuinely don’t know what to do. My overall question is how do you kick someone out who has no place to go?

433,"From my friend's POV:

So i've been dating this girl long distance for about 3 months now, she lives in Thailand and a couple days after we met we started dating. We've had numerous problems ranging from her randomly accusing me of cheating and getting upset over me not sending her a coconut first (yes this actually happened). She's been toxic throughout the relationship and has tried to leave over the smallest things, saying that we'd be better off as friends. She's also a tad bit mean with her words sometimes by telling me to, ""be a man"" or ""i'm glad I don't have to be stuck with you"" (when going thru one of our previous breakups), ""You were a terrible boyfriend but maybe better as a friend"". She's also been controlling of what apps I use and when i'm on instagram, if I were to say I was about to go to sleep and she sees me on instagram she'd get super upset. There have been instances where she has called me out of my name, but i've never done the same to her.

Now, i've been there for her whenever she's feeling some kind of way, even when she's being toxic to me I always apologize first, tell her how much she means to me. Hell she even got mad at me because she thought I didn't remember our anniversary when in fact she didn't at all. I call her and read to her sometimes when she asks, I sing for her even though it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I try to be as good as possible but I'm not perfect. She constantly does the same things like always turning things around to be my fault, distancing herself from me, blocking me, she even said she already had another guy when we broke up for a short period of time and admitted she went to him when she was ""crying her eyes out"". Here's just a list of things that have happened:

\- She's said that I always let her down and she doesn't expect anything from me

\- She felt that she was unimportant and told me to find another girl because I simply didn't send her a coconut first?????

\- I didn't leave messages for her when she woke up and she immediately accused me of cheating and being bored of her.

\- She tried to say that her other boyfriends ""went through bad things with her"" and at least tried to make me feel better

\- She got mad at me for missing her message while washing the dishes since I checked instagram out of habit. And when I asked what the problem was and if she was suspicious and she said, ""What do you expect when your don't reply to your message but be on instagram instead"".

\- When i got in trouble for schoolwork and wouldn't be able to talk as much she ""took a break from me""

\- And when we were still together but just got into a fight she changed her bio on ig to: ""Not taken but I won't date anyone lmao""

\- And when I missed her message again she said, ""If you want me gone just tell me so I can fuck off, I hope other girls treat you as good as I do""

\- She said that no girl will love me as much as she does

\- She was going to treat me more coldly over the coconut situation.

\- She made me delete the app we met on even though I had friends on there I wanted to talk to, even when I brought it up to her in an actual conversation instead of doing it behind her back she said she would leave

\- When I asked her what she thought of me before she just said, ""You're kind""

\- When i showed her a picture of a new jacket the first things she said was, ""How many girls have seen this?"" and ""Don't you cheat on me"".

\- She said she would send pictures of herself to other dudes and that they would get more pictures than I did over the coconut situation.

\- She's blocked me before over a fight

\- She said it feels like ""it's gone"" over the coconut thing, I assume she means the relationship.

\- She was going to block me for 2 days over the coconut thing

\- She refuses to put her baby niece in a car seat, endangering her life

\- And I just don't feel like this is gonna last and i'll be honest i've been wanting to get out before. It's just toxic. each time I've tried to do so she guilt trips me to come back

I work for the state that I live in processing food stamp applications and as you can imagine there are a lot of rules and guidelines. 


I started processing my own applications in January after a two week training class in December.  

Looking for advice for two reasons: 

1. How to handle approaching my supervisor about the lack of direction/coaching/teaching,

2. Whether to stick the job out or go ahead and look for another job. 


My supervisor has been pretty hands off in regards of what she expects from me and how I’m doing but then gets angry/upset when I make mistakes. When I first approached her about feeling like I was left to my own devices, we created a standing appointment for me to come and ask questions, but that’s slacked off. 

Thursday, my supervisor had a conversation with the lead in the room about me, my workload, and how she wants the lead in the room to work with me to get me to be a better worker and nothing to me. Also sent an email to a coworker to inform him that I would no longer be assisting him with something I had been doing since before my training in December, but hasn’t talked to me directly about this. And I’m frustrated. So I’m curious how to approach her without coming off as rude or disrespectful. 

I also feel like I’m not picking this job well, but I don’t know if it’s because I’m still new and can’t work independently right now or if it’s the job and it’s something that’s not holding my interest. Not sure if i should give it more time (I am on probation for a year, and I’m about 6 months into it now) or just cut my losses and start looking for other jobs. ",16Mar2019,1

My parents were both in their early 20s and I was born with some complications and needed surgeries, so it was a traumatizing experience on its own. On top of that, my dad was addicted to heroin and almost everyone on my moms side hated him. When I was about 5 he decided that I would be better off without him, so he cut all ties. Almost 11 years later, the Christmas before I turned 16, he called my mom. He was clean for 6 years and hoped I was ready to meet my father for a second time.

I'm turning 24 in May and am just feeling very lost as to what I should do next. I live in the Toronto, Canada area for some context.

Currently, I have about $1500 in credit card debt, which I realize is not that much, but I'm currently working full time at just above minimum wage so my income is only about $1700 per month after taxes and such. My current job is a contract position until July, so I'm looking to make a decision on what to do next before my contract is up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting in May, if I do not apply to return to school in the fall full time, I will have to start paying back my student loans. My total loan amount right now is about $12,000 so I've calculated my payments to be around $170 per month. These aren't exact numbers but they're close enough to get an idea of my situation. After all my monthly costs, my income is going to be around $1200 before any payments  I make towards my credit card. I have a few different options, but cannot decide what I should do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1a: Apply to go back to university, commit to another 2-3 years of part-time work and studying, finish my university degree. The degree would be IT related if that helps. If I finish my degree I plan for it to be something that will be worth it, and I've always been passionate about computers since I was a kid. It's taken me a while to decide what I want to study but I finally know the answer to that. It's the best balance between something I like and something that will pay well.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1b: Apply to a polytechnic college program and finish some type of 2 year IT related diploma. This is similar to option 1a but just different in terms of what type of program I would be taking.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Keep my job after July and become full time permanent, giving me benefits as well as a slight raise most likely. Possibly pick up a second, part time job to help me pay down both my credit card and student loans, as well as save some money. What I hate about this option is that the $12,000 I spent on school is pretty much wasted, though the company I work at may have some good opportunities in other departments (like IT) if I stick around as they're growing fairly quickly and they like me.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Go to college for one year for a pre-apprenticeship trade program (likely electrician as it's the only trade I could see myself doing), and then apply for an apprenticeship and go that route. What I like about this option is it kills two birds with one stone in that I can apply for OSAP and not have to start paying my student loans back, and I still get something out of the money I spent on school in the end, while only having to go to school for one year before starting work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to get some type of advice from someone who has been in a similar situation and figured it out, or even just anyone with more life experience than me, because honestly in this moment I just feel kind of lost. I've tried asking family/friends, but I feel like they're all really biased in their own way and I'm getting 10 different answers.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Credit card debt, student loan debt that I have to pay in May if I don't enroll in school for September. Do I go back to school and finish so that my money isn't wasted or do I stay at my current job full time and try to pursue opportunities from within the company while getting a second job in the meantime to help with money? Third possible option is to go to trade school so that I don't have to pay my loan for another year while also starting work earlier than with a university degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry once again for the lengthy post and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and offer some guidance.

480,"I wont go into full details, but my best friend (24f) has an abusive husband (26m) and two kids (4m)(6monthf)

When she met him she was all the way across the country from her home and me. They met. He purposed to her less than 2 weeks later and so she decided to stay there. She found out she was pregnant the month after they met and then they eloped. 

Since then her life hasnt been great. He was actually in jail for most of the pregnancy with the second kid. He cheats on her. Manipulates her. Has a disgusting criminal background. She wont admit to me if he physically abuses her. But verbally and mentally he does. She ended up getting badly depressed and he took the car on purpose (knew about her intake appt in advanced and that morning), to stop her from being able to get anti depressants. Hes literally trying to break her down and I'm afraid one day hes going to try to hurt/kill her. 

His best friend told her that he doesnt want to be with her anymore but he wont let her leave because she will take his kids back home and he wont have a say because of his criminal record. So shes just in the way now. 

So heres the issue:
Shes back up by her home state. Shes 3 hours away from me. She was planning on just visiting. Hes still across the country as hes not allowed to leave his state. So she finally had a breakdown telling me on facetime last night how horrible he treats her. Its unbareable for me to listen to. 

Im trying to convince her to stay up here with the kids and never look back but then we face the reality that she has no money, no car, no job, no home, 2 kids. 

I love her so much I'd take her and her kids in a heart beat. But the fact is i rent a 2 bedroom for me, my husband, and my son so its not really an option. My landlord qould freak out.  I considered taking out a large loan but I cant do that either and I dont have any savings to help. 

I know i could help her get a job and i could even watch her kids while she gets daycare vouchers set up. but thats the best i can do. 

Her father is the only parent she was close to and he passed away about 9 years ago. Im hoping either her sister or cousin (whos like a brother) figure out a way to help. 

I just dont know what else i can do. I'm going to try to look into emergency services for her but I'm not sure how to get her a place to stay or a car or anything. ",16Mar2019,1
481,"Throughout the years something unexplainable has been haunting my soul and its been causing periodic times of sadness that may or may not be related to me. Just typing this is causing me great stress even though I have no recollection of any events happening. The issue is in regards to two molestations that may be connected, though I have zero actual evidence to support it.

The first molestation is in regards to a long ago best friend that I had as a child. It became made aware to me many years later, from a girl who was in and out of both me and my best friends lives, (she was both of our girlfriends at different times) that he was molested by someone close. I was in complete shock, it hit me like a ton of bricks even more so was the fact that she kept asking me if I was molested as well, I had zero knowledge of any of this happening. I swore up and down that nothing ever happened to me and she couldn't believe me. I was not given any other information from her out of respect as she said it wouldn't be right by my old best friend to reveal that kind of information to me.

The next possible molestation is in regards to my brother. My brother has had a rocky life, he has struggled with drugs and alcohol over the years and it didn't become aware to me why until he had a mental breakdown one night. I sat with him for hours just holding him as he cried. A lot of his talk was incoherent but the thing that stood out to me most was that he kept saying ""I was just trying to protect you"" over and over again. When I confronted my mom about something that may have happened to my brother she said he would talk to me about it when he was ready. 

My brother also had friends with my best friend's older brother (their middle child, they had three boys, I was best friends with their youngest) around the same times as me, that's the only connection I can make between these two really bizarre accounts that somehow seem related to me that I have no memory of. My biggest gut feeling that these molestations are connected it is that both me and my brother spent a lot of time with this family throughout our childhood so for me this family seems to be the key to this disgusting mystery.

Now I don't want to jump to conclusions, coincidences do happen and like I said I actually have zero evidence on my own part that these things happened but the fact that I am somehow a victim or bystander to these crimes even though I have no memory is tearing me apart. Its been well over 10 years since this information was brought to me and I know good and well whoever committed these crimes is still out there living his or her happy little life and it fucking sucks that no justice has come of it. I think that's what fires me up most I can't stand this sort of thing and if nothing was brought to the law WHY???

So, should I finally get to the bottom of this and dig up this old nasty skeleton possibly even get the law involved or should I just keep the waters still and forget this ever happened?

482,"My ex as well as his best friend are both nursing students. His best friend is pretty much self-employed and takes care of a 40-something year old man with down's syndrome. He confided in my ex that his patient was misbehaving (eg. defecating all over the floor and giggling about it) so he started hitting him as a form of physical discipline, and it's apparently been effective in improving his behavior. My ex wasn't actually supposed to tell anybody but he told me. After we had broken up due to his cheating, I found his best friend on a dating app and we chatted for a bit. I asked him if he still hits his patient with DS and he got pretty defensive. He said he hasn't laid a finger on him in over a year and he was battling his own mental health issues at the time, and he has made up to his patient multiple times. However, I think he's lying about how long ago it was because when my ex had told me about this (only a few months ago) he said it was something happening in the present. 

His best friend got pretty angry that my ex had opened his mouth about this, and suddenly I'm being bombarded with angry text messages and calls from my ex calling me ''petty'' and ''pathetic'' for trying to instigate drama between him and his best friend. He even threatened retaliation. I didn't respond to him and I immediately cut ties with his best friend.

483,"If you need context:

(TLDR: During one of our break-ups last summer, before I got mentally well, I became suicidal after a break-up with the partner who my parents never really approved of. They know I visited him to look at houses last month. Now, how do I tell them their oldest is moving across the country with a man they may not be comfortable with?)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 30. I moved out of my parents' house when I graduated with my MA three years ago. Around the time I moved out I met my partner. Our first two years were tumultuous. He's a 38 yo vet, with untreated mental illness. When we met, I had undiagnosed and untreated  generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Though we have always been in love, we let our insecurities and emotional ignorance get in the way. We went through a series of bad break ups, and last summer when it happened, I became suicidal to the point where--for the first time--my whole family became involved (they hadn't been emotionally involved with me since middle school, when I wanted to escape, not by suicide, but by running away, fantasizing about runaway shelters; they took me to the youth pastor so he could lay hands on me \*shudder\*). 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've been through therapy, I'm now perfectly medicated and, for the last 5 months, my partner has been in his home state of Ohio, getting a life started for us. We haven't fought in months, we can finally communicate like pros, and we are helping, instead of hurting each other. When this semester ends, I am going to move over there to join him. I am excited and I am so ready to be with him. My little brother is going to miss me--we've always been best friends. My little sister is proud of me and wants to see that moving away from ""home,"" out of state, is possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I've told everyone except my parents. My family is tribal. They are hostile toward outsiders and they don't forgive easily when they think one of their own has been hurt. Even before last summer, my parents we wary of my partner because he is 8 years older than me, married once before, and of a different ethnicity. Once we got back together after last summer, they were a bit disappointing and concerned--rightly so. But, my parents are where I inherited my emotional stupidity, so they don't talk to me about it. My dad asked if my visit to OH last month was to look at houses, and then never mentioned it again. But I'm leaving in three months, and even if it hurts and scares them, they need to know. Is there a better way of telling them than the band-aid method? Do I owe them piece of mind that I am making the right decision for me?",16Mar2019,1

488,"I'm pretty sure this is the right sub. I don't believe it fits askdocs. If anyone knows a better sub then by all means tell me cause I need help lol. 

So after ten years of doing softball, I decided to not do it this year and instead do track. We never really did workouts in softball. But track we do, and it's fucking difficult. I always thought I was a good runner until I joined. Btw I'm in sprinters/jumpers, I don't do long distance. 

Practice started last Tuesday. Would've been Monday but we had off school. Last week practice was mostly all inside, this week it was all outside on the track. It got a lot more difficult this week. 

So my first problem started Monday. We were doing timed 100s. At about fifty meters in my quads/thighs started hurting so so bad. I had to slow down. I could barely walk/jog and it hurt to bend at my knees. I took a break from the next activity we did (100s in 18 seconds with two minutes recovery. I did about 9 where everyone else did 18) to roll out and stretch to see if it would go away. It did kind of go away but it was still there. This entire week I noticed as SOON as I start running full speed, the pain comes back. One of my coaches said that it probably isn't ACTUAL pain, just soreness from being pushed so much, a knot, or a cramp. At that time it was only in the middle of my thigh. 

I missed practice Tuesday. Since I did I had to do four (supposed to do five but I did good so he lowered it) 200s by 38seconds with two minutes recovery. It was so fucking hard. Oh my god I didn't think it was going to be that hard. On my last one I can't even believe I finished. My legs had the most intense burning pain I've ever felt. I could barely fucking breath! I couldn't even take a sip of water. I sat down and my legs were pins and needles and I felt like I couldn't stand back up. My legs were literally jelly. We did a 7 minute slow jog cool down after that and I BARELY could even do the slowest fucking jog. 

Anyways I'm rambling. So to my point, is this normal? Is it okay that I felt like that? Will I always feel like this? How do I get better? How do I just not fucking feel like that? It's just so hard. Coaches said that the first two weeks are the worst. But I was never expecting this. He said how I felt was normal, and he'd never push me to do things he doesn't think I can do. I don't really even know exactly what I'm looking for here. I just really want advice. 

Also! Any good but cheap running sneakers/cleats?

492,"I have been best friends with this girl my whole life and she’s incredibly important to me.

However, in the past 5 months or so, she has been acting kinda different towards me. When we hung out, she ignored some of the things i said or didn’t really care and started calling me stupid and stuff like that. I’ve usually not cared about this kind of behaviour. She has been (jokingly?) insulting me in front of her other friends has well when i was present too. 

She was in a bad place in her life and always talked to me about it and i always supported her the best i could, even booking some therapist appointments and she wanted me to join her. This was about 2 months ago.

I think this negativity started when i got a crush at the start of the school year and started hanging out with him more and talking about him or stuff. I asked multiple times if she was jealous and she said not really. I tried making time for her as well and never cancelled our plans because of my crush. Now i know she was bothered by it as she once said i ”wasn’t the same anymore since my crush” and i don’t really know what she meant by that.

Then she got into a relationship with one of my close friends and i am incredibly happy for her. She started hanging out with her almost every day and almost never with me but that was fine i guess. She even told me that it would be this way but she believed she could balance it out when their relationship would start ”cooling” and i respected that.

One day we were talking and she said that she doesn’t enjoy my company as much as she used to anymore. I was hurt by this as i didn’t see how i had changed but appreciated her honesty very much. I asked if there was a specific reason but she couldn’t think of any. She reassured me that i would still be her best friend and stuff. 

There have been days where everything was just like the old times. We laughed so much, it was amazing. It has been where it had been just the two of us. I told her my worries and she hugged and supported me and i honestly felt like anything hadn’t changed. That happened like 3 months ago but there have been days like i described after that. At first she seems annoyed that i’m there but then she starts to cool down.

When we last hung out, she told me all about her new relationship and i gladly listened. She mentioned her partner, let’s call her Anna, all the time. Like in every sentence. She mentioned multiple times how much fun they had. When we all three hang out, she just calls for Anna all the time and pretty much ignores me. Well, i understand, but it does feel kinda bad at times. But yeah, when i made sure she got to tell all she wanted, i was about to tell something about my crush and she just straight out refused to listen to me. That didn’t feel that good.

I know she has been jealous of me before but just like some surface stuff, like my grades, friends etc and have tried to be mindful of that. Idk if that’s connected or not.

How can i deal with all of this? Losing her just seems like such a weird and horrible idea. Sorry if any of this is hard to follow, i’ll gladly answer your questions.

Tl;dr: when we hang out, my best friend just seems kinda bothered and annoyed by me. She is fine with all of her other friends though. She has gotten in a relationship and isn’t making the time for anyone else anymore.

So I don’t even see this fucking email until 30 minutes after he would have already arrived. And so not only did probably half the class leave instead of waiting for him to arrive 30 minutes late bc they didn’t know,I’m also NOT THERE!!!! AND ITS MY FAULT

I replied the email and told him that I’m so sorry and I was busy blah blah blah which is useless bc it’s too little too late and the class probably didn’t even end up waiting for him to get there.

How can I even show my face in that class again",16Mar2019,0
497,"A little backstory. I’m going back to college for my 2nd bachelors. Currently two jobs, part time. I graduated with my first bachelor in 2014, worked for a couple years, and found that there’s no room for advancement, so I decided to go back for my current 2nd bachelors. I’m married and my wife recently lost her job. 

My 2nd job is in a hospital, when I started, I saw a lot of doctors of Asian descent (I’m Asian myself). My wife and I were going to get a house, but since she got laid off we couldn’t. 

I feel lost since my life is going no where. I do plan to go to grad school after receiving my 2nd Bacholers in December 2020, I want to do my masters part time, and work full time when time comes.  I interviewed for an internship yesterday , and Im not sure if I’ll even get it. It’s a leadership position. I guess for me it’s about being able to provide for my wife and our future.  I’m a hard worker and I’ve held positions that will benefit me, but somehow my career seems to be on a standstill. 

Both my siblings, younger, are in medical school, and I’m not. They’re both very smart. I feel I’m not good enough, I can’t stop comparing to others of my age, and looking at how successful they are. I keep thinking and I drank myself to sleep last night, and I guess I’m depressed. Not sure what to do. Just a rant here, thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated. ",16Mar2019,2

500,"I've been battling depression for a couple of years now, maybe even more than that even before I was diagnosed. I've always gotten into these stages where I find that I never think it's worth doing anything good for myself. However, recently, I've made simple strides that I could have never imagined. These things include exercising, working on a website, learning a new language, being open with people around me, getting a new job, keeping my room clean and so on. When I think about these things, I think, ""It's cool that I did this."" But immediately, I can't really continue praising myself because I compare my life to the rate of others' improvement and growth.

An example would be exercising and cleaning my room. I may be losing weight and keeping my room clean, but man. It took me years to start doing this, but everyone around me has succeeded in way less of time and seem to just shine so brightly. The rate of progress I see in others that are doing the same thing versus mine is so wide that it can be somewhat discouraging. It isn't that I hate the world around me. In fact, I'm proud of everyone who's making great strides...except for myself. It makes it difficult for me to know if I actually accomplished something tangible, even if people tell me I have. On paper, I have, but in my heart, I feel like I accomplished nothing.

How do I tell myself I'm doing a good job, and what kinds of things to you tell yourself to hype yourself up when you feel so shitty?

TL;DR: I don't know how to encourage and praise myself.",16Mar2019,1
501,"**SOME BACKGROUND:**

My mother is 75 y/o and lives in a city in the US while I live abroad. She is divorced, anti-social, paranoid of other people's intentions, and happy to be alone. She has no family other than me. We don't have a relationship out-of-love (I've never felt any love from her in my life) but rather a relationship out-of-duty. Her health is fine however her mental state is atypical, and she has been cleared by a psychologist. For example:

1. She appears to be homeless (and technically is, I will go into that). She needs dentures and chooses not to get them. She wears oversized ""sweat-wear"" style clothes and rarely changes them. Though clean, she looks the opposite and appears disheveled. She wears knock-off Crocs that are tearing at the seams.
2. She is a serious under-spender. She has roughly $150k in savings and income from social security + alimony of roughly $2,300/month. She does whatever she can to not spend a dime. If she needs something she'll buy whatever is the cheapest. Ramen noodles from the Dollar store, a 99 cent shirt from Wal-Mart, etc. I'm sure she's been eating at homeless shelters. She plays desperate old lady with poor English with the mechanics and they service her car for free.
3. She is a hoarder or not, I'm not sure. She will take whatever free stuff she can (taco packets, napkins, paper plates, creamers, etc) and store them in her room. She will then ask me to take them in bulk to people such as my father or friends. I attribute this to the fact that she grew up as a poor immigrant in an occupied city devastated by War World 2 in a country that wasn't great to immigrants.
4. She is very independent and has an extreme distrust of others: from police officers trying to help her to social workers looking out for her wellbeing to doctors trying to ensure she gets the care she needs. She does not let hotel staff in her room. Her English is terrible which contributes to her self-imposed isolation and distrust of others. She is paranoid that people will listen to her phone calls, thus refuses to use the phone. Who knew that she would be right with the Patriot Act, Big Tech companies seeking our data, etc. She won't even share information about her family (my family) with me. 

**RECENT HISTORY:**

We had a falling out roughly 15 years ago and separated our ways. I focused on my career, moved abroad, and lost any means of being able to locate her. During this time, my father (her ex-husband) convinced her to sell the house she was living in and move into an apartment it the same city where he resides. She was unhappy in this apartment and went off the grid. Over the past 8 years, I've made attempts to find her though somewhat half-assed as I wasn't sure what I wanted. Perhaps to make sure she knew how to get ahold of me if she needed to. People have seen her living in her car or working in a fast-food restaurant, however I was never able to find her. 

Last year, I received a call from my father that she was in the hospital (they had been searching for weeks to find her next-of-kin). She was found lying on the ground by a stranger, she was in pain from a kidney infection that started as an untreated urinary infection, and an ambulance was called to bring her in. She would not give any information to the hospital and they were unable to release her as they feared she was living on the streets. Upon visiting the hospital, they would only release her if I agreed to take over Guardianship to make decisions on her behalf (they cleared her physically and mentally).

**SITUATION:**

With guardianship in hand, I checked her into a hotel that she chose and established a really good extended rate with the hotel (easily below her monthly income). The hotel has a free daily cooked breakfast and lunch, and my mother thinks I'm paying as I feared if she knew I was using her funds (she knows I'm her guardian) she would go back on the streets. I  should mention she doesn't even know how much money she has. I was able to track down a bunch of IRA accounts that she was being penalised on until I could convert them with the banks.

She is NOT willing to move into a rental apartment/home, nor will she consider an independent senior residence. I've tried everything to get her to consider this as well as other options (buying a home/condo/mobile home, moving back to her country of birth, moving to my country of residence, etc), and she will not budge. I tried to take her to a senior residence home once and she threw a raging fit (her approach to get what she wants) and would not get out of the car. 

It has now been seven months and she is still living in this hotel and happy. Her car is parked right outside, she has free meals, she has cable TV, and she is in the heart of the neighbourhood she trusts and knows. And there are NO people around...she is in her personal heaven.

I feel the only option is to support her choice to live in this hotel or have her institutionalised which would devastate her and lead to an early death. I have chosen the former as I don't view her as an immediate harm to herself nor to others. However this does concern me for many reasons:

* I can only make it here quarterly as I live so far away and there is no way to contact her as she will not answer the phone nor call me
* I'm left to the hotel staff to monitor her (as opposed to an independent residence), however this is not their responsibility nor can I depend on this
* She didn't care for that infection mentioned earlier (due to her issue with underspending even though she is on Medicare) and I am unsure she will react properly to another medical condition. She's refused to go to the doctor with me for a check-up recently nor would she go to a dentist with me.
* This just LOOKS bad. I worry that I'm not doing my job has her guardian properly and that my decision to support her wishes is detrimental to her. I fear this will lead to a a sedentary lifestyle that will only amplify itself with time.

**HELP:**

Other than my wonderful partner, I'm being second-guessed by EVERYONE that I've discussed this with, however with no reasonable suggestions from others other than to fool her into a different decision. Though I am deceiving her with the payment of the hotel (to keep her off the streets), she is extremely clever and I just can't trick her into moving into a senior residence or apartment. I feel it's ageist to assume an older person can be easily fooled.

At this point, I feel I'm in a binary situation, supper her decision to stay in this hotel indefinitely or institutionalise her (not even sure this is an option as the hospital, a social worker, and myself all believe she is not a harm to herself nor others). I'm not seeking an affirmation here from the Reddit community, but rather some advice. Perhaps there are other opportunities I've missed. Or maybe some small quick wins. I dunno.

The good news is that I'm growing trust with her day-by-day albeit the hotel payment untruth.

Thanks in advance

505,"So, I really don’t know what to do or where to even begin. Let me rewind a couple years, but beware this post may be a little long. I need serious advice also, please no hate. 

2016, I graduated high school, and it was an amazing accomplishment. My family isn’t filled with very many high school diplomas, and my eye had been on college for years. I bounced around a lot of home from not coming from a very safe home, but those aren’t the specifics we need. At 18 I was living with a very distant family member I had only met once before. I moved in the summer before my senior year began (2015) and they were decently nice, my family has a lot of recovered users so most of them just aren’t right in the head, so yes there were a lot of red flags, but it was better to live there than in a group home. Well, my plan was to leave at 18 for University. My senior year I got a part time job at a pizza parlor, and really focused on every aspect on leaving for college. Well, my 18th birthday is after college start dates, and the family member ended up sabotaging the situation (long story and again not important to the advice I need) so I instead attended community college online and stayed in their home. Up until I was about 19 years sold I met this Boy, A. He was a mutual friend of a really good friend of mine and we began chatting when I would hang out. I wasn’t allowed out besides work and school, my family member was very strict. I was hardly even allowed to go to the store by myself at 18(and I was a great kid, but again, besides the point. At the time, our mutual friend was really helping me through a hard time and extended her hand to help me leave the home I was in because she knew of the circumstances. Luckily during my senior year, I was able to save a lot of money from working. She didn’t start charging me rent until I was 18 so I still had a savings, as well as working as it was realistic that if I worked hard enough I could manage to get my own place soon. So, she helped me move in and I rented out the living room from her, but A also lived in the same apartment complex and was over a lot. We got to know each other over the next couple months, right into summer of 2017 and we began dating. Our mutual friend was deciding to have her boyfriend move in with her and my time was running out to find a place, I had continued saving over the next couple months also but nothing around the area was coming up that I could afford, so A offered to let me move in, he lived with a couple and they rented a 2 bedroom apartment together. At the time, I had no other option. I had no family to go to. I had only been in the town for about a year and a half and my best friend was continuing with her life. So, I took the offer. His family loves me and everything had been great, so at the time it was an ok idea. The first month living together was great. We became best friends. But let me give a little back story on A. We are the same age, he was working at a grocery store in town making pretty ok money when we met. He has type 1 diabetes &amp; is manic depressive/social anxiety combo. He’s a great guy, who’s just come from a bit of a bit environment who’s heart had been broken by a girl he loved for years and he let it destroy him. So, back to moving in now. About 2 more months go by. Still an online college student, both of us are still working but he begins to show me his episodes, naturally just by living together. They were extreme. I mean, bad. Major manic depression. And just as things started unraveling, I became pregnant. It was an accident, and yes we were very safe, but it happened. The news sent him overboard and the over amount of stress sent my pregnancy into complete hell. I was sick 24/7 and was doctor recommended to take a break from work, until further notice. Due to my savings, and him continuing to work we decided we could get through it and he began to come along. At first, he wasn’t interested at all and began suggesting adoption, but as someone who bounced around the foster home, I hardly disagreed and said if he didn’t want to be in the baby’s life that’s fine, but I’m not doing that. So, as I said he began to slowly come around at least enough to work and continue to let me stay with him. With my savings and him continuing to work, we got by for about another 2 months about I was about 4 months pregnant and sicker than the beginning. My whole pregnancy ended up being bed rested. But, at this time A’s episodes were getting worse, even worse beyond the worse. Almost killing him self, running and screaming outside at midnight because he was depressed. I was able to at this time calm him down but they still lasted about 3 hours. He never has ever physically hit me, but he started to leave some bruises on me during the episodes but quickly shook it off. His episodes became worse and worse and he quit his job one day and came home and said he couldn’t do it anymore. I did my best to try to figure everything out. Doing side jobs, taking in recycles, everything to get us by for about 1 more month but we lost the apartment, along with the couple because they couldn’t afford the place on their own. So the landlord gave us a deal to end our contact because we literally couldn’t live there and A’s parents let us move in with them. At this time, I was about 5 months pregnant and sicker than a dog. I did as much as I could still around the house and they still liked me very much. The house though, is very dysfunctional. Alcoholic cheating dad, they both have dead end jobs his mom is an ex addict and has struggled a couple times since we’ve lived here. They fight constantly and honestly shows why A is the way he is. Well, at 5 months pregnant, A’s stepfather got in my face because he was very drunk, and pushed me and I had a major anxiety attack about life. I realized I couldn’t raise a baby in this house and I totally freaked out. I didn’t want my son to grow up in the same house A did and become that same way. A refused to work, just stay in bed and continue having worse episodes, every time a little more bruises added each time. But, I always shook it off. Due to my panic attack I did a lot of research and started to lean towards an open adoption, privately. A was of course open to the idea but honestly I was just trying to find the best option for my son. He meant so much to me and I hadn’t even met him yet. So, I spent about a month just researching, skimming, and began talking to a few families who fit my criteria on a few different very safe sites. Fast forward about a month. I’m about 6 months now, I had been chatting with an amazing couple and they ware very well off in life and just took my heart. A also agreed about the couple and they agreed to fly out and meet us. They also love in the US, but quite a few states away. We met and they were lovely people. Now I’m about 7 months, A’s episodes continued getting worse but for the adoption process needed to get on medication and have a written approval to prove he was stable enough to do an adoption. He did this and the medication slowly began to help but the episodes came on still really bad. So, we continued our process with the adoption, and A continued to not want to work. After a hard labor and a hard process of signing my son away(the adoption is super open. I was still able to have skin to skin and they made sure I was able to bond with him. They really are an amazing couple, which is the only reason I was ok with the whole situation.) So, to this day, my son is 10 months old. He’s beautiful. I text with his momma almost on a daily basis, she sends pictures always, and we skype a lot. 

But, this what what I need to go into a little more detail with, again I’m so sorry this is so long. 

During our relationship, there have been many times I’ve been there for him. Through his episodes, his doctors appointments both for diabetes and mentally. I am as supportive as possible. To this day, he still won’t work. He still has severe episodes and we still live in his parents house. The small town we live in has close to nothing, but there are options. After my 6 weeks of healing from giving birth in May 2018, I began a temporary job in June 2018 and worked until December. During that time, I began paying his parents a little rent, started paying back fees on the apartment we owed, and invested in a fixer upper car. January 2019 I am jobless, but have been searching since then but have had no luck. But, that’s not the point. A’s episodes are scary bad. He isn’t the same person when he’s in that mind set. He’s called me the wort upon worst names, I’ve had black eyes, but like I’ve said, he’s never physically raised his hand to me. Hes my best friend and I really care for him, I do my best to support him financially and emotionally. In many of our fights, he’s packed my bags, or thrown all my belonging outside, broke my phone, and kicked me out, but always lets me back in after 10 minutes. So, here I am. 2 years into our relationship. Stuck. I’m doing my best to continue with our life because I’m tired of struggling. I want us to succeed together and he’s straight out told me he has no motivation. Other times, he’ll tell me we can get through anything. But things are just so bad. I don’t know. He just had an episode a few days ago and it’s just been hell. Police were called, he was very violent. My bruises have recovered. But my heart is just so broken and I can’t fix it anymore. I just breaks more every time and these last few days have just really hit me in the face. He has tried to take his life in front of me so many times and I know if I go, he’s just kill himself. He’s told me so many times. So what do I do?

I stopped taking classes because I just became so depressed. I have new goals for myself as I turned 20 and am almost 21. I want to try to go to some kind of culinary school, that’s my dream. 

I literally feel like I’m stuck. If I leave, he will literally crumble, I’ll be homeless, phone less(he broke mine), and broke. I don’t know if I can keep doing this. I just really need some help. 

The friends I did have told me while I was pregnant that they weren’t happy with how he treated me, so I don’t have any friends anymore but I’ve just been so stuck the whole time. 

I’ve been contemplating a midnight escape because I’m a coward and I can’t break his heart but I can’t leave him or I don’t know what to do. ",16Mar2019,1

509,"As a single, 22F graduating from college, things are going pretty nice. I have a job lined up after my school is over, I'm planning a trip to Japan in May (solo trip!) and I'm proud of myself of making it through engineering. 

The thing is, life feels incredibly lonely and i can't seem to put a finger on *why*. I've read that the reason it may be hard for people to be single is because they're not comfortable being with themselves, and truly loving themselves. My self love can be way better than I am now ( I recently gained weight which I'm a bit hard on myself for), I think I'm unattractive and I find it hard to believe there's someone I'll meet who will actually love me for who I am and not put me through things that previous guys have put me through, such as emotional abuse (fat-shaming, for one), taking ages to respond to my messages, being flaky as hell, and just being so indifferent and careless to getting to know me as a person. 

I'm getting serious anxiety going back to work as I still have to live at home for the time being. The thought of doing work, spending my evenings and weekends at home because my parents would rather I stay home, is really stressful. My parents are super strict and it's incredibly hard to go out and and enjoy a night out without a million messages and phone calls demanding to know where I am. Moving out is important and I really want to, so I thought getting a job in a different city would be my ticket out to start fresh. But my luck hasn't been so great (I can't even keep count of how many jobs I've been rejected from), and my hope is running out really quickly.  

So my question is, what are some things I can do to make sure that I'm feeling alright? I don't feel ready to enter a relationship because my relationship with myself isn't in a good place right now. Without that foundation of being alright with myself, I can't find something meaningful with someone else even if a prince charming comes along. School has me tightly wound for the time being. But at the same time, I'm not alright with being single. It's complicated.

We have very little contact with my grandfather on my Dad's side, as he cheated on my grandmother (who never got over it and was depressed for the remaining 40 so years of her life).

He is LOADED like, money is no object, I have a mansion loaded. My whole family had accepted that we would never see any of that money as he'd likely die first and his new wife is a major bitch and would get all the money which will eventually go to her children. I don't believe anyone is owed inheritance, so as far as I'm concerned that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we barely speak to his man, and it seems to be pretty mutual, they sent out a Christmas letter stating that their eldest grandchildren both just turned 20, but my younger sister and cousin were both only 18, ergo they forgot they existed.

Anyway, I'm an artist, and I've started to have some success. Rich people can smell the prestige and investment opportunity, so he comes out of the woodwork, and we have a dinner with him. Him and his wife are incredibly rude, and tell my sister it's ""nice to meet her."" We had spent a lot of time with them as children.... Now I have just been accepted to do my Masters in London, and I'm struggling to figure out how in the heck I'm gonna pay for it. My current plan is to take out a personal loan and declare bankruptcy or some other whacky hi-jinx . Do you think there is anyway I can convince my rich grandfather to help me pay for it? I was planning on contacting him and asking to stay with him and really turn on the charm... or perhaps just emailing him to tell him the great news and dropping some sort of hints?? Idk, It's frustrating knowing that kind of money is nothing to him, and it would change my life, but also I think it's kind of scummy what I am thinking of doing.

513,"Issue: I have a German Shepherd/ husky mix, Zelda, and a border collie/ lab mix, Buddy, that play really well together until I get involved and start throwing a ball around.  
Info on situation: Zelda is primarily my dog while Buddy is my dads. Dogs show great signs of healthy playing when its just the two of them playing together, they play bow, chase each other around, no major acts of aggression. But when we start playing fetch, Buddy chases the ball and gets protective of it while its in play which seems to get Zelda riled up making both dogs seem to get more aggressive. I don't know if Zelda is getting jealous even tho if it were just the two of us she would have no interest in chasing a ball or playing fetch.

 Haven't launch any of my game. But I am working on games for companies. Lately, I'm losing interest in making a game or even coding. I go to work spend time come back home and so on the next day again. I have tasks assigned I know I can finish it quickly but not motivate enough even when I encounter some bugs knows how to solve it but dunno when I am starting to code I get confused or overwhelmed with different ideas. 
Still, get praise for doing good work. It's like I'm fooling office staff and fooling myself. 
On weekdays I make plans for a weekend jam, and when the weekend comes, I'm not able to do a thing. Its been months like that, haven't learned anything new or created anything. I am just making plans which not work out. 

As for a self-project, I started solo projects didn't work out got stuck. So eventually at my workplace, I found people who also want to do a project outside from work, so I start doing it with them created prototypes and final a project but then block, artist of our group is not free, so it's in cold storage. Now I think whatever I do I can't seem to complete any of my projects. I come up idea open unity and then nothing, in mind it works, but when I start working on it, it doesn't look good enough.

So no coding at the office and no coding at home and it's so frustrating losing time like this. I don't know if its the right place to ask this. But dunno what to do. I need to make games, but I'm not motivated enough. ",16Mar2019,2
520," 

The past two months have seen me in a lot of places that no one ever hopes to be in and that I certainly never thought I would be in. I am writing this because I honestly feel that there is not a single person I know that I can talk to without being judged, so if I am to be judged I suppose it's better done by internet strangers than my peers. From the title, you may have assumed that I will account being sexually assaulted here, however in this narrative I am the 'respondent' in a Title IX process.

I will obscure as many identifying details as I can, but I feel the fullest possible picture will only better inform readers in their advice. I am a male attending a small American college where sexual assault and the college's response has been a hot issue since before #metoo. In January of this year, I began to feel that R, the man I had been seeing for over a year at that point, no longer cared for me. (I'm gay, this was a homosexual relationship.)

Over the course of the relationship our sex life took on a dom/sub relationship, with me being the dom. This was facilitated over several months by a series of conversations, setting boundaries, education ourselves, and generally sharing loving and intimate moments. After sex, we would usually talk about the experience, what we liked, and what we could do next time. We found what worked best for us was for me to use my hands and mouth to make him cum while dirty talking to him, often while he was bound, and then for me to penetrate or get oral from him, all while being dominant.

On a night in early February, we had dinner at his dorm and I told him that I didn't feel valued in our relationship anymore. We had been an unexpected pair from the start. We shared practically no mutual friends, clubs, or academic interests, however we had usually found enough time to spend with each other. R's response was disappointing and he did not see anything he could have been doing differently. I told him that we would keep trying.

That night, we had sex in the format I described. I made R cum and asked, as I always do, if he would then like to be penetrated. He said yes. I asked if he wanted to use his mouth on me, and he said yes again. In a way consistent with how had acted in previous sexual situations, I proceeded to have rough sex with him. While behind him, I noticed that he did not seem responsive. I stopped and asked if everything was all right, and he said I should keep going. When I finished, he was silent, so I held him in bed. After a few minutes he told me that he felt violated by what we had just done. I apologized and asked what happened. He told me that he didn't want to talk about it. We lay together for some time.

Eventually, he asked me if I wanted to go a party one of his friends was having that evening. I told him that he should go if he wanted, but I wanted to stay home. He dressed and left for the party, and I went back to my dorm. Before I went to bed I texted him good night and good morning when I woke up, both to no response. I felt awful at this point. Finally, in the afternoon, he texted me that he needed 'some space.' I said I wanted to make things right and that we could talk when he was ready. Though it was not fair to him, I also felt miserable that the issues in our relationship I had brought up at dinner were going to continue. I started to think about how I could break up with him.

I was under great duress after a day of no contact and regret what I did next. I sent R an email breaking up with him and outlining the reasons why. I also made a vague apology for that night. R sent me some understandably upset Facebook messages a few hours later calling me immature for sending and email and saying that I had sexually assaulted him. I already regretted the email and told him so, and also asked him that he not use the term 'sexual assault.' He apologized that I had been unhappy in the relationship but would continue to call it assault. He said that he would tell me a time when he was ready to talk in person.

Remarkably, the days following that exchange my quality of life improved drastically. I felt happy, more relaxed, and more energetic than the entire previous month. One week after our message exchange, R told me that he was ready to talk. In our conversation I apologized for how I had made him feel and that I never wanted to hurt him. He was hurt, obviously, and said some very unkind things about me. I let him. He told me that the sex was something he needed to deal with personally. I was relieved that he was not going to say anything publicly or to the administration. I left and could tell that he was dissatisfied by how he had gotten so much more emotional than I did. I was sincerely sorry that he was hurt, but stood by my decision to break up as quickly as possible.

A month passes and we go on with our separate lives. There is no contact between us.

This week, as we are approaching finals, I receive an email from our campus Title IX Coordinator (whom I have met a few times in various contexts, it's a small college) requesting a meeting. This is the first stage in any complaint process. I met with her that day and she explained that R had filed a complaint early that week (a month after no contact) and requested that I meet with the Coordinator. I gave her a less sexually detailed version of the story above, but did tell her about the dom/sub dynamic and that I had pursued active consent for everything I did. The Coordinator told me that R wanted a mutual No Contact Order (NCO) that would bar either of us from contacting the other in any way or visiting each other's dorms (relatively small and little reason to go there anyway) under discipline from the college. I agreed and it was put into effect immediately until R graduates in the spring (I am a year younger).

From here R could still continue with the complaint process, which would include hearings, a report by the Title IX Investigator, and have sanctions decided on me by a board of students and faculty. Knowing him, I doubt he will pursue this, though I am uncertain why he bothered with the NCO seeing as we had no contact without it. Among our respective social circles, it does not seem like R has said anything to anyone.

I am just so torn up by what to do now. Anything? I need to talk about this, however I am so afraid of people making decisions as soon as they hear that I am the 'respondent' party. I want to go back into counselling but I leave for Spring Break in less than a week and need to focus on my final exams. So, do I talk to my parents? What do I say? Any help (or reality check) would be great.",16Mar2019,2
521,"14 F, pretty tall (5 feet 8 inches) 170 lbs.

I love my body which is pretty rare for teenagers. I'm curvy and have been a vegetarian for the past 3 years. I only do very light exercise when I am high on energy, just for fun (like dancing or running around like a little kid with friends).

However, when I talk to my parents about my health concerns (for example: joint problems which have been an ongoing issue, and my dad has pretty severe arthritis) my mom justifies it with my weight. She will say things like, ""well I bet if you lost 10 pounds it wouldn't be a problem"" or ""it's because you're not eating healthy. We need to cut out ice cream anyway."" After she said these things, I found out the reason my ankles would have sharp pain immediately after starting running was because I was not stretching enough beforehand.

I wish my mom would stop associating my health problems, with my weight. I worked hard to love the body I am in, so how can I ask her to stop without making her feel like I am attacking her? I personally believe [this](https://twitter.com/jalsaeng_gin/status/1106738828549730305?s=21) is pretty healthy despite what my mom thinks (love her to death though!)

524,"I am not good with conflict. I fact most of the time it causes me to break down in tears. 

Unfortunately my father is the exact opposite and will burst out in anger, screaming and shouting at the slightest provocation, this in general lowers my quality of life, living alone with him. 

I’m 21, in full time work and recently been accepted into university, which I’m greatly looking forward to as I’ll be living in student accommodation and will be away from family conflict. However right now I’m living at home, I previously lived alone but that only lasted for a month as my dad called me repeatedly asking me to move back home, on one occasion crying, which I did despite feeling he was only after my money since he has a tendency to borrow from me. 

The situation happening right now as of writing this is that he spent the entire day borderline bullying me, he thinks of himself as a bit of a womaniser and decided to bring one of his floozies home. Blaming me for all of his messes around the house to try and save face and seem cleaner than he actually is. But not only blaming, but raising his voice at me and forcing me to clean them. Throughout the day I had to endure various hurtful comments plus their excessive drinking (which he knows I’m absolutely terrified of being around people once they have had alcohol) 

The final straw was when out of all the food in the house he decided to eat the one thing from the fridge I asked him not to eat as I planned to later. He promised to replace it so I decided to leave it. Hours pass, store is about to close and he still hasn’t even got up off of the sofa. So, admittedly in a stop I get my wallet and my keys and start walking towards the door. Realising he has no intention to go himself I’ll just get a replacement. As I’m opening the door he calls for me. He asks me where I’m going and I do admittedly rather passively aggressively answer “going to the store, to get the food you said you would”. He ignores my tone and asks me to get him things too since I’m going. To which I respond with a firm no, and swiftly walk out the door. After everything he has done to upset me today specifically, plus the fact he said he would go to replace what he took without my permission I was frustrated and wasn’t going to do anything for him.

I go to the shop, I get what I want and return. The second I walk back through the door all hell breaks loose as he starts screaming and shouting at me that I’m ungrateful, selfish and various other expletives demanding that I go back to get him what he wants. I refuse. He gets louder. I go to my room and lock the door behind me, he goes quiet for a while before he storms up to my door, banging shouting that I will go or he will kick me out. I stay quiet. Not saying anything. He does this repeatedly. Banging, going away being silent for a while before returning and banging some more with additional threats of kicking me out. 

I’m not really sure what to do in this situation, I want to stand my grounds. I don’t want to let him treat me this way. But whenever I do things quickly escalate to this. How do I try to diffuse this situation, how do I talk to him without him exploding. How do I talk to him? At this point I’m not even sure I can. Whenever I try to I just choke up unable to speak out of fear how he will react, any suggestions as to how I should proceed would be appreciated ",16Mar2019,1

Ive always wanted to go to a four year college. I applied to about 7-8 and got accepted to all of them. I fell in love with one in particular and then realized I’d be going 100k in debt. I’m realizing I’m looking at 80k+ in debt for all except one of them. I now have no idea what to do because my family is very poor and the careers I want aren’t the most high earning. Not only would I be unhappy going to a state school, but I’d feel sort of like a disappointment to my family, who think because I got straight As I belong at Harvard or something (I obviously don’t). My only remaining option, I think, is just a public university, but it’s in a bad location and obviously isn’t as cheap as a state school but better than the private universities I applied to.

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my mother and step-brother alone

I don't have a job and I'm a full time college student

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is one of those squealers. 15, plays CSGO, rust, fortnite and the lot. He screams and shouts a lot. Mostly late at night.

Me and my mother, whenever we ask him to be quiet, are met with incredibly bad racist, homophobic (to me) and just outright nasty words from him, although the most common is just a simple 'fuck off'.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes my mom angry and they almost always have an all-out brawl.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother refuses to actually punish him though. I've suggested removing his subscription to crunchy roll, removing his computer etc

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my brother today and he claims that he feels like his privacy is being invaded whenever we come to scold him for shouting

My mother had apparently been sat outside his room listening to us. She slammed her way in and started screeching about how it's her house and she can come in whenever she likes.

&amp;#x200B;

They fought, obviously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went downstairs and when the two separated my mom came down. I tried explaining that me and my brother were just talking about everything and that her coming in and doing the exact thing he said upsetted him had completely destroyed that chance of having a civil conversation.

I don't know what to do.

He keeps becoming increasingly more violent, to a point where I'm scared of it becoming physical, and she refuses to punish him for it outside of yelling.

538,"Hey everyone! I'm a highschool student from Egypt. As you may know, the colleges here aren't top-tier, at all. They're not all awful, but they're definitely not the best. I'm following the British IGCSE system. Originally, my plan was to go to a university in the Netherlands, UK or Canada, some of the places wheree IGCSE is accepted.

Now onto my problem:

My father is a businessman, he owns some companies here. That means that after university, I won't really be struggling for work, as I am eitherway going to be working with him. He thinks that I should rethink going abroad for college because of the following reasons:

- I don't need a top-tier degree to put in my CV to look for work

- I would come back to Egypt after uni, I might get adapted to the culture of whichever country I'll be staying in and this might mean I wouldn't be able to deal with people here (Thing is, people here are less civilized and might do a lot of unorthodox stuff for a bit of money, or whatever, dealing with them is a skill)

- From his experience, kids of businessmen didn't run their parents' companies well after they returned back to Egypt, because they were accustomed to the culture outside of Egypt

- I'm the eldest of my siblings, the budget I'll get is the same my siblings will get. I can spent a large percentage of it on college, but that would mean I'd have to face not being able to spend it on an investment, or others. (Note that this budget will include a house, car, my education and possibly a future investment)

- The colleges here are much cheaper than they are abroad

- I can do a masters degree if I want to, after I finish my bachelor's here, I'd have a better view of how life works and I'd have a plan.

Here are the reasons I want to go abroad for uni:

- I want to feel more independent and try having a bit of weight on my shoulders

- I want a better learning experience

- I'm more passionate about the degree I'll be taking than my father's companies, I feel like I'd be able to expand onto my goals faster if I took a proper bachelor's experience

- Me getting a bachelors abroad doesn't mean I can't also do my masters abroad

- I feel like going abroad for a couple of years (Engineering degrees are 3-4 years) wouldn't affect me THAT much, and I'll be able to deal with both people here and people abroad.


So, what do you guys recommend? Should I spent the extra cash on going abroad for a much better education that I'm not guaranteed to benefit from?",16Mar2019,0
539,"I took my dog (Great Dane) for a walk after work and bumped into an acquaintance of mine walking her dog (Rottie). Our dogs play with eachother pretty frequently, and we have never had issues. He was always a good dog, hyperactive and friendly, but not on this day. This time he seemed to be pretty agitated, when we came close. He started growling when my dog and I came up to say hi and began barking more aggressively when I came up to speak to the owner. We both agreed maybe today isn't a good day and I began walking away.
Stupidly on my part, I turned around, held my dog back and put out my hand for my acquaintances dog to sniff, thinking maybe he'll calm down if he picks up my scent.

He didn't.

I made it worse.

He lunged and bit my wrist, puncturing just under the heel of my palm on my pinky side. The owner quickly held him back apologizing profusely asking if I was ok and nearly got bit herself.
She explained that this is the first time it has ever happened, he's never acted this aggressive before. I made sure to check if he was up to date on vaccinations, he is.
Because I am very familiar with the owner and the dog, seeing them usually a few times a week, and knowing that he's never been this way with myself or my dog. As well as this being in part of my stupidity in reaching my arm out towards him, I told her I wouldn't report the bite.
I went home with blood dripping down my hand, washed up the wound and went to the doctors to ask their opinion on if I needed stitches. When asked what happened I told them I tripped and fell while walking outside, but wasn't sure what I landed on. I'm up to date on my tetanus shot. So they cleaned up the wound, gave me two stitches and sent me on my way.

It's been a couple days, and now in hind sight I'm not sure if what I did was right. I still don't want to report the owner and the dog, I blame myself of the bite as he's usually a good boy. But I don't know if by not doing so if I put myself at risk for anything.
Wondering if I could get some tips on what to do, anything to properly take care of the incision to prevent any infection, and if there's something I can do to maybe say to an MD that yes it was a bite, but not say from who (given the type of dog I especially don't want him do be put down because of me)

540,"This year will be 6 years for us. When we met, she was this vibrant, creative, affectionate girl. So ridiculously beautiful and fun and empathetic. We made each other laugh all the time and she supported my art. She used to make me cute little things.

About a year and a half in, she told me she used to struggle with depression and that it was coming back a bit. I told her I understood, I've always struggled with anxiety and depression, I get it. What she didn't tell me at the time was that she suffered years of emotional and mental abuse from her mother and that she'd been suicidal since she was 11. I never would have guessed in those first couple of years.

Fast forward to today, things are grim. I was laid off and can't find work, she's no longer able to work due to her mental state and we've been living with my parents for a while together in a very small room. She doesn't have friends or go out without me. My family is loving but also pretty dysfunctional, which is triggering for her. She's made attempts on her own life multiple times, each time I've caught her and stopped it before anything got bad. I've taken her to the hospital two or three times, but did basically nothing for her and sent her home the same night each time. I got her into therapy like 3 years ago and she's had a really good therapist. Her psychiatrists have all been awful, though, not listening to her and being very judgemental. She's finally just starting EMDR which will hopefully help her PTSD symptoms. 

She only gets worse and worse. She's so crazy sensitive to anything. This morning, for example, she woke up in a good mood but then saw my sister making waffles for my parents. She can't eat gluten, so she felt left out and has been sobbing in the bedroom all day. She's in tears almost every day. She's constantly irritable and complains about everything all the time. Between all of that, I have to walk on eggshells constantly and watch every word I say, my tone, etc. because she's very easily upset and then it becomes a whole thing.

I have been everything to her for a few years now. She won't go out without me, she needs me to make phone calls and send emails for her, I have to act as a middle man between her and my family because there's always problems, I have to choose between her and my family often. 

We've been to therapy together, I've been in and out of therapy myself, I have taken her to so many specialists and doctors of all kinds, I have supported us financially, she went back to school for a while but couldn't finish. We've tried everything and she just keeps getting worse. I can't afford to get her out of my parents' house right now and she can't even work part time to pay for a room. The affordable/assisted living situation is impossible to use where we live because there's a major housing crisis in our area. She has no friends to live with and her family is abusive and in another state. 

I am sick all the time with heartburn from the stress. I am constantly stressed out and I feel like I'm always putting out fires. I am dreading going downstairs to check on her because I am so emotionally exhausted and I just don't want to get sucked into that negative, dark cloud again, but I know I have to because if I don't she might die or something. It's so much pressure. 

I love her. I really do. I love her so much and I miss the woman she was when we met so badly. But I am so exhausted. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, but I'm trapped because I am her *everything*. There's no where else for her to go. I don't know that I want to break up, I just want this to stop being horrible. She's been a drain on my mental energy and mental health for years and I feel like I've lost sight of who I am and what I love/what makes me happy. I'm so miserable.

recently, around a week ago i went on a trip to hawaii with my soccer team for a soccer tournament. it was really fun and i enjoyed all of it. one thing that really stuck out to me and is bugging me to this day was this girl i met on it. 

i'll give u the background of how we met.

so pretty much a couple of guys on my team we're trying to hook up with the girls soccer team in the tournament. they were chatting a lot of them up. one day though they were in the hot tub and were talking to girls right below our room. one of my friends in the room tell us that they're hitting on them and us, being teenage guys(17), immediately rush over and steal their spotlight away from them. we start small talk to these girls until most of my friends leave and it's just me and this one girl. i start talking to this one girl, let's say her name is rachel, and have the most awkwardest convo ever. but in the end i get her snap and that's that. we start snapping that day and night and turns out that she's really a cool person. she becomes the spotlight of my trip since that. we snap constantly and i have the most fun of the trip, and i didn't even realize until now that i had forgot my thoughts about my ex, which i suffered depression from after my break up with her. she really was everything at the time. the next day she invites me to hang out and go to the beach w her friends, i invite one of my friends and it goes out well. they both leave a bit later and it's just her and I talking for about 4 hours. i've never had such a immersive and deep talk w someone i've just met. the next night we hang out also but i had to end quick it's after her curfew, i kiss her and give her a gift(because she gave me one the night before) and then that's the end of us. i haven't seen her since, we just snap semi-often. 

she lives about 5 hours away from where I live so it would be really hard to constantly see her. she also has a boyfriend, but she claims that she is going to break up w him soon. but it's just i haven't felt this way in so long and i've been in the dating scene but had to reject because they weren't the right one, and it pisses me off how the right one comes but it's just not right. i just truely feel in love though but idk whether to think logically and move on or pursue something that is hard to get.

tldr; met a girl on a trip, we flirted, got together really well, i feel like i'm in love, i don't know if she feels the same(if she thinks that it's a one time thing), she lives 5 hours away. what do i do?

542,"So a few years ago me and this girl started talking. We were never really texting or going somewhere together (even as a group) but we talked a bit almost every morning at school because we came there at the same time.

We didn't really progress further from that while i must say that almost everytime we talked we had a great time. The thing is i never saw her more than a friend. That means i never touched her i didn't flirt, none of that shit. After some time i started to get a feeling she wanted more. I started backing off a bit like sitting a bit further trying to get other people into our convo or speak with someone else. But we still talked like before i was just a bit more reserved.

In this time (period of 2-4 months) we had several parties or roadtrips. Once at a party she tried to dance with me but man she was straight up grinding so i backed out almost immediately. Then one time she rested her head on my shoulder when she sat down next to me and i also backed out. And some more things like this happened but i never showed an interest and fled.

That is when i started to feel uncomfortable around her. I started to avoid her and talk as little as possible but was still nice if we did talk. Then she tried to get me alone to talk about it several times but i always got away because i couldn't stand how uncomfortable that would be. Also the  end result would still be ""ok we'll still be friends"" but i didn't want that at that Point anymore. I was borderline disgusted how she forced all of this.

Now after 6 months of not talking and maybe greeting each other twice in that period she sends me a throwback snap. I just ""seen"" it because i don't want to talk and that clearly shows that. 3 days later she sends a snap why i seened her snap and i seen that again.


Am i the crazy one here or is she just being a pushy person who doesn't want to back down.


(P.s. i know that the best thing would be is to tell her how i feel but i really don't want to tell her to fuck off and i feel that is the only way she would understand it)

544,"I’m an 18 year old male college student and I live in a residency with other students. When I got here in October I became good friends with the girl who lives in the room right next to mine. Ever since then I’ve been developing feelings for her that have been getting stronger and stronger. She’s cute, funny, smart, kind, etc.

There are two problems;

1) She has a boyfriend. They’ve been together for about 6 months. She’s never seemed very enthusiastic when she talks about him but obviously I can’t make assumptions about their relationship. 

2) Im pretty sure she’d never consider me more than a friend, regardless of whether she finds me attractive or not.

I know, the answer seems obvious, get over it. The problem is I see her multiple times every day because of our living situation so I can’t just ignore her or distance myself from her because she’d definitely know something is up. And if I told her the reason it would make things awkward, especially because, like I said, we see each other every day. 

So, I can’t tell her, and at the same time, I can’t distance myself from her; it’s a living hell. I don’t know what to do anymore, it’s driving me mad.

And I know myself, I know that if I don’t forget about her in some way I’ll never get over her, so waiting it out won’t work.

I really want to tell her, even if the outcome will most likely be negative; I can’t keep pretending like everything is fine.

3+ hours round trip on average on a very country but paved well road. But to be fair Not all highway. Virginia is the area so the snow factor is to be considered through the winter.

The breakdown of a day....Leaving at 6:15 am to arrive to work by 8 am. Leaving at 6 pm ideally without any interruptions out the door. Home by 7:45 pm. This is 9 80 schedule leaving me off every other Friday.

I have never commuted like this before. I have commuted 50 mins but was single and no children. I have a 50:50 agreement with my ex allowing me to see my daughter several times a week. Long story short no matter what, I would turn into a every other weekend dad if I were to take this job. Being my ex and daughter live a hour away in the other direction making it impossible for any other agreement then just taking her the Every other Friday off and that stated weekend. I really really don’t like this part

Car wear and tear math formulas have been considered and I’m not worried about the gas nor break down of the vehicle. More worried about the physical and mental health on my body of commuting 3+ hours a day. Plus cutting my kid out of my life by so much. She just turned 4 years old.

The question I pose am I being stubborn to not take this ? I’m scared I’m looking through rose colored glasses as lay offs and job searches leave me feeling desperate. This type of money is insane in the best way but there’s no relocating of my ex and daughter.

Some supporting facts:
- I've been receiving proof that these people are running me down at everything I do, but being nice as pie to my face. 

- I know I couldn't confront them because they will turn it around on me, and why it is my fault.

- I guess I could let the cannonballs fly and never have to see them again, but this would hurt me more than it hurts them, I'm simply not that kind of person, unless I have to be.

560,"Just wanted to get some more opinions because I’m at a loss rn. 

I asked my friend for help getting a job close to home, let’s call the employer O. A week later, someone affiliated with my university reaches out that he is under pressure to fill jobs at his affiliates and that anyone interested should in their resume. Having not heard back from O, I send in my resume to this guy, let’s call him J. 

J sends my resume out to these affiliates. Here’s where I make 2 mistakes he calls me out on aggressively through email. I ask for a phone interview instead of in person from one, and miss a call and they are unable to leave a voicemail for another. J seems pissed. 

Going in, I never new that this was as serious a job search as J is implying it to be. I also had no idea I would not get a choice where I could send my resume to, though I guess I should’ve. The problem is, O has finally gotten back to me with an offer. Working with O would be my ideal job and is much closer to my home. Any of J’s affiliates, while also good jobs, have more grueling hours and are farther away. If I had to though, it would not be impossible to get to J’s jobs and I don’t think I would be miserable there. However, O remains my top choice. 

I’ve already stalled setting up interviews with all of J’s affiliates except one which I couldn’t escape. I also asked J directly if we could meet in person for the first time to discuss. He redirected me to make an appointment on his website. We’re meeting early next week. 

I guess my question is, is there any scenario where J will not quite literally try to kill me if I even mention O and their offer. At this point, all J knows about me is that I am troublesome and have been unprofessional. I have not taken his job prep course, but I don’t think he would view that as any sort of valid excuse in this case. J does not know anything about the job with O. How likely is it that J will only react negatively if I bring up O? If bringing them up will only bring me trouble, I would rather (sadly) decline my dream job at O and continue through the interview process and try to get placed and appease J. 2 students who have had marginal interactions with J think I should bring it up and lay all my cards out. My parents believe I should not, as they are (rightly) worried that I could piss off J to the point where any future interactions with his field could jeopardize my success there.  I wouldn’t deal with J directly in the future, but of course he has colleagues I would have to deal with. 

TL;DR Should I try to reason and get my dream job, or decline and work on mending the fence with J?

I won’t bore you with the details but basically I got a concussion and my grandmother lost her hearing in one ear from the airbag and broke some ribs. But the thing that scars me was that the woman in the car that hit us was pregnant and she was not wearing a seatbelt.

Back in high school senior year, had a crush on this one girl. Winter formal was coming up and I arrived with a bundle of flowers in front of everyone (guess I had bigger balls back then, I wouldnt do shit like that now). She accepted.

We exchanged numbers and talked, but she didnt seem too interested. Same at the winter formal. I wasnt getting the hint. The winter formal photographer was a guy that didn't like me. I was on the yearbook crew but they didnt know that.

A week later we get the pictures in. The only ones missing are the ones of me and my date. I assume the dude deleted them. I took a selfie of us at the formal, so I used that and put it into the yearbook.

Months later,  she invites me to a movie night at the school and I go. I ask to prom and she kindly rejects, saying shes just going as a group. I go to prom with the group.

Now graduating, my best friend is venting to me about how that one dude (formal photographer) cheated on her. I vent to her about the winter formal pictures thing.

She reveals ""what? He didn't delete the pictures, she asked him to. She told everyone she only went with you because she felt bad for you. We assumed you'd eventually get the hint she wasn't interested, we didnt want to hurt your feelings by telling you""

So I deleted the pic I posted on instagram of us and was kinda depressed. I felt bad for the girl that went with me because she's now forever in our senior yearbook in a picture with me. I thought I was putting it in to spite the photographer, but only immortalized a cringey moment for her. She felt bad for me and sacrificed her own self image to make me feel better.

It's been 3-4 years now. Should I apologize to her for putting her through that entire embarassing school year? Apologize for making things awkward? I've got a fiancé now, I just feel bad and am going through kind of a reflection of how Ive acted with people in the past.

569,"TLDR: I live with my parents but I pay rent and portions of bills. My mom unlocks my locked door whenever she wants when I tell her not to but she calls disrespectful.


Hi,

So I’m 21, Hispanic, and a male recently I got a nice IT job at a big tech company so I make a decent amount of money. When I got this job and shared voluntarily the info about my job including salary, they asked if I could start paying my fair share of rent, light bill, water bill, and internet bill. I agreed because I wanna help my parents out and it doesn’t cut much into my income. So everything was cool for a couple of months, I still did my usual chores of walking the dog, taking out the trash, cleaning my room, changing the security camera battery’s, and helping when needed. But as my job got my stressful and heavy I began kind of foregoing my daily cleaning my room so instead I would just clean my room whenever I had the chance/energy. Which meant usually weekends or like once during the work week. 

My mom began to notice and would clean my room for me which was super nice of her but then she started complaining and calling me lazy after a couple of times. So I told her that she can stop doing it because I don’t really appreciate being called lazy for missing one chore. So she still kinda did it sometimes but I would remind her to stop and yet she still would complain. On the day KH3 came out I had work late and I was rushing to pick up my physical copy from Best Buy, I’ve been waiting for a while for that game to come out so as soon as I got done walking my dog and taking out the trash. I started playing my game. I locked my door cause I wanted to enjoy it by myself but then my mom started knocking saying “have you cleaned your room yet? It looks messy!!!!” And I said “No not yet I’ll do it in a second”. My mom gets mad at this so she leaves and comes back with some keys and opens my door and starts trying to push me out to clean my room. I got really annoyed and I said “Mom, you can’t do that even if you’re my mom that’s no not right. “ and she said “WHAT ARE YOU THE BOSS?!? THIS ISNT YOUR HOUSE” and I responded with “but I pay rent and bills and do my other chores. This is really disrespectful” and she laughed at me.


I told her to not do it again but last night when I got home from work and just wanted to lay down and chill my mom did the same thing. This time I got up and told her to get out. She yelled at me for being disrespectful and told me to find my own place if I don’t like it. I reminded her again I pay rent and bills but she didn’t care. I grabbed the keys to my room from my moms pockets and she started freaking out. Trying to rip open my grip and telling me to give them to her. I said no and she started trying to hit me and when I wasn’t giving up she started to cry and tell everyone in the house. I told her “Mom, you don’t respect me as your oldest son huh?” And she said “YOU DONT RESPECT ME AS YOUR MOTHER! YOU COME HOME LATE! YOU GO OUT AND DRINK WITH YOUR FRIENDS WHENEVER YOU WANT! YOU BRING OVER &lt;girlfriend name&gt; WITHOUT TELLING US. YOURE THE DISRESPECTFUL ONE!!!!”  Then she locked her self in my parents room.

It's a birthday gift for my best friend. We're really close but we don't usually exchange gifts (which is the *best* imo..) but last year she got me a really sweet present, and now her birthday is rolling around so I want to send her something nice.

The bracelet is a small, delicate piece, and I want to get it engraved. I just need opinions on what to get written on it... I'm not sure what's usual in this situation? I'm thinking either:

her initials

her birth date

her birth date in roman numerals

or ""bff"" which is what we affectionately refer to each other as.

I've also thought about doing her initials (or birthday) on the front, then ""bff"" on the back, maybe with a heart? But I'm not sure if that's weird, or if the combination is weird? I could also get ""bff"" on the front and her initials/bday on the back.

Fear of freezing up during tests made me overstudy for the tests, fear of failing an audition made me practice until I was confident, etc. During my high school career, sometimes I’d think I had anxiety, but I’d always end up dismissing it.

Ever since the end of junior year/start of senior year though, so for the last year almost, these things have become exacerbated. A lot more stressors entered my life, such as a larger class load, college applications, maintaining my achievements in extracurriculars, and drama with people/guys (this stressor was relatively new, and should matter the least, but for some reason felt like it caused the most overthinking) I feel as though, even if there’s really nothing to worry about, my brain will always find something to worry about, no matter how small it is, and blow it out of proportion, and thus be perpetually worrying. I’ll overthink small things and come to absurd conclusions (typical example - someone doesn’t answer a text, I freak out that I’ve done something terribly wrong, or that they hate me, and in some cases start apologizing). I experience other symptoms as well, but I don’t *think* I have panic attacks. I have moments where I feel like I’m panicking though, and experience external symptoms.

Now, sometimes, it feels as though the “fear” sometimes gets to a certain level that it acts as an inhibitor instead of a motivator. I, also, in the recent months, have had trouble getting sleep, even when I *try* to go to bed at a reasonable time. I get anxious/nervous, at some point in time, over something or the other, on a daily or almost-daily basis. Some friends have told me to seek help when I’ve told them stuff in more detail, but I still don’t know whether I’m overthinking/overanalyzing the issue, or somehow exaggerating to others without knowing it. I’m also not sure if I should, or how to, approach my parents about this. I’m really scared because I don’t know what to say and I’m not sure how they’d react. I don’t even know if I need help, or if I should just try to fix it on my own. Thoughts? Is this a serious problem? Do I need outside help?",16Mar2019,1
576,"hi! im a 20 year old girl and i finally downloaded tinder and im having a lot of fun with it. i just got my own apartment and i'm excited for all the freedom this gives me! 

unfortunately, my building pretty much consists of older people, like 40+ that are all gossipy types. its fine usually, since i just keep to myself, but the two times ive brought a guy back for a hookup so far have been really awkward because of my neighbors/front door security guard.

how do i navigate this embarrassment/not have everyone in the building think i'm some sort of slut? and if that's inevitable, how do i take it in stride? or am i just overreacting and its more likely that nobody really cares about what i do.

any input would be appreciated! thanks!",16Mar2019,2

578,"So, I’m in Rhode Island and just opened my grill to find the entire thing is filled with leaves and other “nest material” and an adult squirrel jumps out. 

After recovering from the minor heart attack associated with that jump scare, I found theres at least two and probably more little baby squirrels inside. 
I “know” these squirrels. They hang out back and weve been peaceable to each other. I also have no desire to have these babies die but it’s chilly here and still winter. 
For now the grill top is open and the parent squirrel is in a near by tree. I can see the grill from inside but for the last 15 mins or so no one has come to retrieve the younglings. 

I’d really prefer if they didnt die but I also do not want the nest to stay. Aside from the fact I have some tasty steak tips marinating and my belly has the rumblies, I am moving at the end of the month and want my grill back. 
I have a box and probably one bedsheet or bathroom towel I can sacrifice. I also have latex gloves so I can handle them without getting my scent on them, hopefully. 

What can I do to save the little critters AND have my cake, er, steak too?!

And, NO, I will not be cooking them for all the A holes out there.

582,"This is in Florida. 

I’m unsure of whether or not (though I know they are felony counts) this sort of crime is as serious as other fraud type charges. 

All counts are third degree felony’s. 

For the first couple months they only had 10 counts of the fake ID listed under their name, but I just looked again and see they now have 35 counts.

Each of the 35 counts specifically say “knowingly possess a blank, forged, stolen, fictitious, counterfeit, or unlawfully issued drivers license” 

In addition to the 35 counts, there is one count of third degree Grand theft auto (from the same arrest). 

They were also found with ID making machines, and other credit cards (in other people’s names), but I don’t see charges for those (yet?).

From what I gather they already had 3 third degree felony charges from 2 years ago with similar charges: A fake driver’s license (this persons picture on the license but another person’s name), forged check matching the name on the driver’s license, and credit card belonging to someone else (also matching the license). They had originally received probation and a fine from those charges, nothing more.

From what I can see, they got re-arrested about one month after the first plea was made (where they only received probation for the three third degree felony charges).

They’re currently bonded out of jail for this second arrest. 

I’m curious if the original 3 charges have been reinstated, the court records don’t show the probation sentence any more, but rather a new date for a “Status hearing”.

I would think that 35 third degree felony counts for the fraudulent IDs, plus the third degree grand theft count, (possibly) coupled with the original charges would mean this person might face some serious jail time.

Is it likely this person will see a long term jail/prison sentence for these crimes? ",16Mar2019,1

Okay, so here’s what’s up. I don’t exactly know how to put this stuff into words or how to clearly explain it but I’m trying my best so please bare with me. 

I have always struggled with some level of anxiety. It always made it hard for me to be at school, go to the grocery store, be involved in extra curriculars  etc. it was always there, but I was pretty decent at managing it and not letting it effect my actions too much. 
I’m 22- about to be 23 in April. I moved into my grandparents house when I was 17 and maybe a year or so earlier is when the anxiety really shot up. I had gone to the same school my entire life so school was definitely not an issue since I knew so many people for so long. Going out started becoming an issue. I could go out with my close friends, but as soon as unknown people got involved it was just all over for me. I started hermitting myself and I only would leave the house to go to work and then I’d come home and go to bed. A couple weeks before I turned 21 I finally talked to my doctor and got prescribed the generic to Zoloft. Oh my gosh what a difference it made. Every day things were easy and I could do stuff alone without panicking or shutting down. Unfortunately, extreme crowds and unknown strangers still effect me in such a way that I almost can’t breathe or think around them. I don’t know what to do. My best friend and boyfriend has been trying to get me to play dungeons and dragons with him. ( I love this game. It’s super fun ) The only issue is that we don’t have enough friends to have a solid circle so we’ve been trying to play with strangers. I always shut down because I don’t know these people. I don’t want to say anything wrong or make myself look stupid so I clam up and everyone thinks I’m just miserable and rude. But really I’m just having a panic attack in my head. 
I want to be able to play this game with my SO as it’s a really fun thing for him, but he always feels like I don’t enjoy myself and that we shouldn’t play anymore.

592,"18M here. Had death anxiety since I was about 8. Started smoking a year ago, and aside from my very first time I never really scared myself. 

However, the other day I smoked a joint to myself(in an amount that I haven't smoked in a while) after not smoking for a while and started thinking about ageing and dying, and about my parents dying, and I FREAKED myself out. Worse than I ever have before as far as death anxiety goes. It was new weed from someone we rarely get from.

The next day, death was still on my mind and I had a bad nervousness. I tried smoking a few more times almost everyday, but it hasn't helped with mood much at all. In some cases it's getting worse because I've tried smoking the same stuff again and I start having anxiety attacks. I'm always tired now but I can only sleep at night 5 hours at a time.

605,"So, I'm almost 30 and I've bounced around jobs a lot. I was really happy when I taught art to kids after school but it was part time/seasonal and just wouldn't make ends meet.

I've had so many jobs more recently that just....really really didn't go well. I also am afraid that I have some form of aspergers, because things sometimes got really strange and I don't think it was normal for people to have as many issues as I did with jobs/people.

I have a really hard time just talking/chatting with people and I felt like I was disliked by a lot of people at this one grocery store job, I kept it for 6 months. One guy told me I was hard to work with, it crushed me. I would feel tons and tons of stress from pretty constant interactions with people, like I just never felt like I had stuff ready to say. I also would get terrible tension headaches by the end of some nights and my whole body would be in pain.

I left that one for one I thought would be better, but it was worse. To be fair, a lot of the people who I worked with were kind of ""punk"" and unprofessional and difficult to get along with, and I totally couldn't click with anyone. I held onto it for 6 months but it became absolute Hell, I got REALLY weird and literally kind of didn't talk and felt like an absolute freak. I couldn't look myself in the eyes in the mirror during that time, I remember having to leave work sobbing one day and just drove to somewhere and called the suicide hotline. I could never keep up with the conversation going on and I don't know why.

Then I worked a more retail-y job and actually did alright with that one, I just showed up, did the work, and would go home. I never talked to people during my lunch breaks and didn't really grow close to anyone during that time, but I could make it through the shifts ok.

I worked abroad, twice, and loved the income and job stability but grew so stressed with the culture shock/work stuff/not having a good apartment that I just didn't want to do it for long and came back. 

Then, I got a restaurant job at a smaller place, but it wrecked my confidence. I would mix things up so much, and had a terrible boss (I know it wasn't just me who couldn't get along with him), and my co-workers would comment that I was kind of slow at things. I left crying once because of how awful my boss was being to me. I quit it after 3 months, I just couldn't take feeling so bad about myself all the time. 

Soooo...now I'm jobless. I'm considering going back to school in a health-related career that actually has a good job outlook, but my history of difficulties with people is holding me back. I have to get onto an actual career-path NOW. I don't have confidence in myself that I can go into something where I have to work with people. I also don't know if I have the mind to be on a computer all the time (like, coding). I have to find a new job asap but I feel so broken inside, like I absolutely have not been able to put myself out there and start over and my money is almost running out. I don't know what to do.

607,"Hi, my wife and I have been slowly drifting apart for roughly a year. It’s my fault, 

We both suffer from depression, she is medicated, and says she just feels numb to everything. This predates my depression which started after I took a job in construction that I hated on minimum wage. I haven’t told anybody, but I think she and some of my close friends might suspect.  I didn’t want to tell her because it would put more of a strain on her. And I haven’t told anybody else because I’m not good at discussing feelings.  

She got a job in a care home for people with learning difficulties, which is very stressful because of the service users, and the staff are horrible to her. 

She got a rescue dog one day, which was great to begin with. Eventually I felt it distanced us because he would kill the mood and stop us from having sex as regularly.  I came home one day, when my wife was working a late shift, to find he’d gone through the trash, it was everywhere. I lost my temper and attempted to discipline the dog, but I left bruises on him. I regret it every day. 

She has lost some respect for me, which I understand. Since then she has slowly showed less and less love for me, less and less physical contact.  

A month ago, I quit my job to do a full time online IT course. Since then I’ve felt so much better in terms of my depression.  I feel like a different person, a person that wouldn’t hit a dog. However, I’ve gotten paranoid that she’s cheating on me. As the symptoms are there. Almost no sex drive, no physical contact, always on her phone, on snap chat.  I tried to put it out of my mind, and give her as much affection as I can. But nothing changes. 

This year we were going to move to the city. To give the dog a better life and improve our chances of finding a decent place, we re-homed the dog to somewhere he could still go for a run etc. We were both crying as the dog left. 

The day after we have a discussion and agree that our relationship isn’t working. We decide to break up. But she can’t move out for like 20 days, so I say she can stay here till then. In the mean time, we’re getting along better than we did while together. I had doubts about separating. But I didn’t voice them. 

Today, 16 days into separation, she tells me she’s slept with someone that she works with since we separated, and she wants us to give it another go. 

I have no idea what to do. My friend has told me to try and work it out. I know it wasn’t cheating because we ‘separated’ but it really hurt me and now I’m totally head-fucked.  If we stay together, she says we’re going to try marriage counselling. 

Thanks for reading the essay.

608,"I am female in my mid 20s and when I was growing up my mother would force me to cuddle with her naked. It went on from my earliest memories to when I was about 9 or 10. 

She would force me to take off my clothes and get into her bed. If I refused to take off my clothes she would put her hands under and rub my body, eventually taking my clothes off. 

If I refused to cuddle or didn't want to or I had something else to do, she would say ""I am your mother!"", or ""you can do that stuff later"", or ""but I'll freeze here without you"". And me she would guilt me until I came to her and she would pull me into her bed. I remember being late for school because she wouldn't let me go. She even called me in sick a couple times to keep me longer.

She would put my hand between her legs to ""warm them up"".

As I got older I would tell her it made me uncomfortable and I didn't like it. She would cry and beg me and say ""but I am your mother!"". Like that somehow means that it can't still make me uncomfortable. She would call me cruel and say that all mothers do this with their kids, and that I was weird for not liking it. It would make me feel dirty.

When i got old enough that she couldn't pull me into her bed it stopped. After, she would use it to guilt me into agreeing with her ""we dont cuddle anymore so you have to let me do X""

The advice I'm looking for. Is this normal? Do all mothers do this? She didn't do it to my older siblings. Am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable and dirty?",16Mar2019,333
609,"21F. A glass or two of wine won’t kill me, but anything other than that seems to do me in. I become exhausted after very little alcohol, and more.

For example, I was out with a girlfriend and ordered a margarita with my dinner. I drank less than half of it, and my cheeks became embarrassingly flushed, and I didn’t feel great afterward. Another time, I went to a New Year’s Eve party, and had two glasses of sangria that were about half-full, and a touch of sparkling champagne. The next morning, I was extremely nauseated and convinced I was going to vomit, in addition to having a pounding heartbeat that wouldn’t slow.

I make sure to eat with alcohol, but for some reason it doesn’t seem to agree with me in general. Am I just a lightweight, or am I possibly allergic?",16Mar2019,1

611,"I've been wanting to move out of my mom and stepdads place for a while but I have one problem. I have a loud quaker parrot as a pet. My mom got the family this parrot for Christmas several years ago when we could not own a dog where we were staying. Turns out parrots are loud. I was the only one who cared for him and gives him attention. This has only been worsened since we moved and now have 3 dogs. (Though at least the parrot likes one of the dogs) The biggest example is When we eat our meals we cover the parrots cage or move him to an alternate location because he screams loudly when people are eating. This is reasonable, but what is not is that they will leave him covered for hours after we are done eating because they don't like any noise he makes that is not talking.

I do really need to move out of the house, maybe not this second, but it has quickly become more unbearable living their. However I live in CT, working for my grandfather and am being trained to take over a part of his business. I've hard committed and do not want to back out now. CT is pretty expensive to live in and I can just get by without a roommate but would rather have one, and I would need a cheaper apartment that would end up having people on the other side of the walls and I am worried I would just be kicked out from my parrots squawking (Which I am unsure of, but highly suspect that he does when no one is home). And to top it all of I have just learned that possession of a Quaker is most likely illegal in CT. I can't find up to date stuff on it and I have seen a site that says they are only restricted while some say they are outright illegal to own. I think my mom knew this when acquiring the bird as I learned that she had him shipped to Massachusetts and drove up to get him, which sounds about right for her. she's not really a criminal but she is not a rule follower.

What I found was much more then doodles. My brother has told me that he has had hallucinations before but I didn’t think anything of it since he only brought it up once late on night. In his notebook I found drawings labeled “what I see” with disturbing demon-like pictures of people and creatures with descriptions of each. I know these could just be creepy drawings but they seemed much more darker then that. These looked like they were from the corners of people’s minds. So that was the first unsettling thing I discovered. With my naive curiosity, I continued looking through the sketchbook. There were a few other unsettling things but nothing worth note until near the end I found a literal kill list with initials of people. I believe I know who some are but not all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

In my school we have something called SDR (Stop, Drop, and Read) basically you go into class with another teacher and you sit down and read for 30 minutes every day, also it is  the time for test retakes and catch up lessons. 

My SDR teacher was a man I'll call Mr. Gill (name changed) Mr. Gill was a 60 some aged white hair balding teacher who has taught at the school for 20+ years and he teaches Science. 

People have always referred to him as the ""cool"" teacher at the start of every class he would play a song and have us guess the name, if you guessed it right he would name you ""cop"" basically you would get a clipboard with everyone's name on it and if they did something bad you could ""tag"" them basically write a little thing next to their name and they would lose one point on the gradebook (basically so he wouldn't have to monitor his class).  Also, every Friday he would tell us a story, for the last 10 minutes of class, he had over 150 stories (the # was probably closer to 200) 

His class was arranged by 4 rows of desks that go 4 columns back the desks were designed to fit 2 people and had 2 stools placed behind them.

Now for the real meat of the story, it started in January of this year, he said we could change our seats to any where we want I chose a seat in the back of the class diagonal from the door. Another guy let's call MK1 (mischievous kid 1)  ran by and sat next to me, now I only shared one class with MK1 but I knew his name and I thought he was cool. The desk next to us has two other ""cool kids"" MK2 and MK3. The first thing MK1 said was ""hey OP"" and then pulled out his phone placed it behind his book and started surfing Instagram. I kinda chuckled at first, but then I noticed that MK2 and MK3 were also playing on their phones behind their books. Not only did they did Instagram, he also played phone games like Bitlife and Texas hold em. 

I started resenting Mr. Gill for his negligence, any teacher with 4 braincells would realize that the kids who have been reading the same page for 3 months straight are on their phones. 

The real cherry on top was when we entered his class and had 10 or so other kids who weren't in my SDR class doing test retakes, all of his desks were full so he had his test retakers do their tests standing next to the counters or on their floors. 2 of them, TR1 and TR2 (test retaker 1 and 2) were at the back of the line waiting for the teacher to hand him their tests the convo goes:

&amp;#x200B;

TR1: \*quietly\* get off the phone

MK1: Shh

TR1: Don't worry I do the same

TR2: I used to do that but now I sit in the front \[of my SDR class\] 

&amp;#x200B;

When Mr. Gill handed them their tests they did them on the floor behind the back row (where MK1,2,3 and I were sitting)

they started DMing each other on instagram, TR1 took pictures of the test and sent them to MK1 and MK1 googled the answers and sent them back to TR1. I couldn't believe my eyes the entire time Mr. Gill was just sitting and his dammned laptop now giving a flying frick about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get my classmates in trouble? The teacher? should I go to the district and complain? or should i keep my thoughts to myself?

617,"I'm looking for advice about a classmate who has expressed some violent interests to me recently. I think I need to alert the police but I'm not sure how to keep myself protected.

There is a lot of background but it's relevant, I promise. Hang with me.

I(30F) met this classmate (45M) at mortuary school. He is going through a difficult divorce. He moved to my city right before school started, and he and his ex were going to start a new chapter here. She is in my city as well but they split about two weeks into the term. I felt bad for him because he didn't have any friends here and I know what it's like to be in a new place and not know anyone. So we would go out for drinks with my boyfriend, our classmates, or sometimes just us.

After a while, he began expressing some suicidal ideations at really awkward times to myself and another of our classmates (20F). For example, he would describe insanely detailed plans of how he was going to carry it out. He also would mention that he was off of his antidepressants. I wasn't sure what to do and didn't want to talk behind his back but his comments worried me, and it made me a little angry that this fully grown man was trying to put these deep, disturbing issues on my 20F friend, let alone on me. It began to be that I dreaded being alone with him because he would just talk about how much he wanted to kill himself. 

So I sent him an email that said I recognized he was reaching out for help and I heard him, but that he had assigned me a role in his life I did not consent to. I told him that he needed to be on his meds and that he needed to call his doctor in his hometown for a prescription or a referral. I also sent him the suicide prevention hotline and told him that he needed to find a therapist immediately. I told him that I take conversations like that seriously, and I will confront people seriously about them. He responded with a sincere ""thank you,"" said he would get help, and those conversations stopped. I asked a few times if he had found a therapist yet, and he said he was feeling better, so I dropped it. He seemed better.

It's 2-3 months later now. My classmates and I are all in school and going through a heavy course load while trying to find jobs in our field. Basically, we're all under a lot of stress. Recently all he talks about is trying to online date and how long it's been since he got laid. He's an awkward guy but we all share this niche interest in anatomy, and we rely on each other a lot to get things off of our chest that we experience in the embalming lab. We can't really talk about some things with people who aren't morticians or studying to be morticians because it's disrespectful to the decedent and, honestly, people don't want to know if they're not in school trying to know.

He brought something up to me and my 20F friend a few days ago that really creeped me out and I haven't been able to shake it. He asked us if we ever thought about killing people. I said no, I don't even eat meat, I don't even want to kill an animal, and I definitely don't want to kill a person. I asked the question back to him, and he said yes, that's something he would like to do sometime before he died. I didn't continue the conversation, but he did. He said, ""for example, if I was going to murder my ex-wife, the police would look at me first. So I would do it by killing a few random people first in a really specific way, kill her, and kill a few more in that same specific way to make it look like it was a serial killer."" I told him the conversation was making me really uncomfortable, and excused myself. I shook it off, thinking this guy is just awkward and doesn't know how to start conversations.

We went out for drinks with classmates after school and my boyfriend met us at the bar. My boyfriend talked to him for a while as I and my classmates chatted about things going on in the school and bonding over mortuary science stuff. When we left, my boyfriend told me that this guy described the same plan on how to get away with murdering his ex wife by serial killing. Apparently my boyfriend told him that his plan wouldn't work and required a lot more research than my classmate has time for and that it isn't going to happen. He said my classmate was disappointed his murder plan wasn't viable but seemed to accept it.

My question is this: I believe that this man is unstable. I believe that his beginning to talk to people around him about murder is similar to how he was discussing suicide as he was planning it. I think I need to talk to the police. But if he gets in trouble, he will most likely know it was me, and he hasn't done anything but say creepy stuff he could brush off as a joke. He knows where I live, work, and go to school. How do I alert someone without endangering myself?

An aside: Funeral service professionals are proud and immensely privileged to offer a person their last kindnesses before being buried or cremated. We are trusted by families to bestow the final compassionate touches to a person. The idea of someone who is thinking about how to murder people even looking at someone in the vulnerable position of death makes me so sick and angry. The idea of someone like that learning about anatomy that way makes me absolutely livid. I have the instinct to protect them from him.",16Mar2019,1

I always lose. I’m just 16 years old but I’ve had many chances and have always ended up losing.  I know I have many years left in my life but I just feel lost right now. Everything started like 3 years ago when I was in a relationship with this girl. Eventually, we broke up and all her friends just hated me. This gave me really bad anxiety in the coming years when I get an opportunity with a girl. Well, a year later there was a new girl in my school and I started to like her. I talked to her constantly through messages and in person. I felt like she was so into me, but then after a few months she kinda friend zoned me and I just felt horrible. I felt so sad during the next few weeks until one day a friend told me something. This friend told me that a girl in his grade (a grade below) was kinda into me. I got so happy cause this girl was very cute. I had talked to this girl before in person and I just felt like she was the best. I start talking to her through Snapchat and I think everything is going well until one day I see her in person. Well, instead of talking to her like a normal human being, I just smiled and walked away. I know that I screwed up, because after that she started talking to me less and less until we just didn’t talk. I like to think that it was because of that situation and not because she just lost interest in me, which might also be a possibility. A year after that I still had a crush on that girl, I mean we would constantly see each other but just we would just look at each other and immediately look away. Now, you might be thinking, didn’t you meet other girl? The answer is no, because I never went to the parties. I don’t drink so going to parties didn’t attract me that much. Eventually, I went to one like a month ago. In this party I saw this girl who was very pretty. Like the usual me, I didn’t talk to her in the party because I didn’t know her. I woke up the next day feeling regretful. So, I asked a few friends around to see if they would help me. They gave me her Snapchat username, but because she didn’t really know me she didn’t add me back.

630,"Ok this is probably going to be very long so sorry about that. 

It all starts with my friend (Let's call him ""B"") who after years of living in a decaying house with his parents, 3 sisters, and pets, he finally gets his wish of living with one of my other close friends (Let's call him ""P"").

P's family recently moved out of state so his mother was paying for the rent willingly until he gets his own job and sticks with it (at least to my knowledge). Problem with that is that P is autistic. and has difficulties communicating with others. The result of this is that he only had 1 week of experience as a dishwasher to his name, and i'm guessing he'd rather play Smash Bros 24/7 than try to find another job. He's 21. P's situation is bad itself, but it got much worse when B finally moved in.

B did get a decent job to pay the rent, which was half the cost along side P's mom. Although throughout the time of his stay, I've heard constant rumblings from my other friends, who constantly visit P + Bs apartment to hangout, that B blows through his money so fast that he has no money saved from his paychecks, and his credit cards were maxed out on a monthly basis to the point of him already being in debt at a young age.

Things proceed to get worse from here.

B's girlfriend (Lets call her ""L"") then decides its the perfect situation for her to stay with her lovely boyfriend since he finally has his ""own"" place. She then visits the apartment for about 12 hours a day nearly EVERY day to spend time with him. All in his bedroom the entire time. They never do anytime intimate btw, cause they believe in sex after marriage. So they sit on the chairs or bed the entire time. Also FYI, B gets furious any time criticism is brought on L to the point of arguing with us. Also, his sisters constantly visit as well for long periods of time despite them having their own home. This wasn't has big of an issue before because well, B had a job most of the week, so why would this be happening?

Fast forward to about a month ago. B then decides to quit his job because the employer was evidently treating him like ""garbage"". Most of my friends honestly believed he got fired.

Over the coming weeks, B tells all my friends including me that he's been applying to plenty of places and that he'll get a job immediately. 

Present day, he still doesn't have a job and the rent deadline comes in the first week of march. Apparently his share was paid, but given everything that was said prior about his spending habits, he probably used a loan and not his savings to pay it, if he had any at all.

This has gotten to the point where most of us don't want to believe any words that come out of his mouth. Especially given his explosive personality. He constantly makes up lies on the fly, has mostly no matters when it comes to being in public, and defaults to calling us ""cowards"" and many other colorful words for not agreeing with his opinion. 

On top of ALL OF THAT, let me paint you this situation.

Me and my friends (including B and P) had planned to take a vacation in the next few weeks. Its usually an annual thing to have fun once and while. Well guess what? B doesn't have a dime to spend when we get to our destination. He said that himself. Also, he said he thinks he can do Doordash for a continuous living. To pay $400 a month. And even asked if he can use the rental car we got for doordash, while we are ON VACATION.

I'm just thinking of cutting him out of my life for how he's manipulating one of my close friends just so he can have a roof over his head, despite him not doing ANYTHING at the moment to earn the right to stay. I honestly want to tell P's mother about the whole situation and get this straightened out, but in this case B would be very unpredictable. 

Its not fair to her or P, but B needs to be taught a valuable lesson about this and needs to get out of his fantasy world about nickeling and dimeing his close friends.

Any advice?

Background:

- Me, Callum and Craig have been friends for 10 years.

- Spoke and played games together everyday.


The issue:

Callum just one day, left... kind of. He stopped going on Xbox, stopped replying to our messages in the group chat (he does see the messages, just ignores us), and when he does reply he’ll leave us hanging saying “yeah I’ll talk later or I’ll be on later”, but never does.

Me and my friend Craig spoke about this and he has implied that I’m a little crazy and exaggerating the situation, I’m not, Callum left and ignored us - for absolutely NO REASON!

Callum does, very rarely, talk to us and reply and maybe play a game or 2, but ignores us again for months and months and months. I’ve even tried personally messaging him to catch up and he either doesn’t respond at all, takes days to reply and reply with one word like he can’t be bothered interacting with me.

633,"We dated around a decade ago, I was his first girlfriend and I was far more into him than he was into me - I said the 'L' word and he started distancing himself from me, I eventually confronted him about his behavior and we broke-up.

My ex got back in touch around eight months ago to apologize for how he treat me. Around this time I broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend, as a result of this break-up I'd lost my social group, so I decided to meet up with my ex just to get out the house. Over the past few months we've had many online conversations and hung out a few times.

The problem is I'm developing feelings for this ex...

He has developed into a great person, he's intelligent and genuinely caring, he's also great fun to be around as he's funny and very warm. He's the closest thing I have to a friend right now, a few weeks go when I was suicidal he was the only one to reach out which meant a lot and he seems to understand my struggles right now.

I know this is likely about the fact he's a nice guy and I've no one else in my life, I'm confusing affection for him as a friend (if he's even that, it's not like we've spent a lot of time together) for romantic feelings. Also to be frank I'm horny so part of me has also been thinking about him as a potential fuck buddy, as at least he's someone I know and feel safe with.

So far I think any hints I've made have been subtle enough not to be picked-up on by him, or maybe he just thinks it's part of my personality as I tend to make a lot of innuendos and I'm a little flirty, but I'm worried if I get carried away I'll scare him off so lose the closest thing I have to a friend right now or I'll just end-up hurt pining for someone I can't have.

He and I would never work as a couple - he is very intelligent and educated while I can be a bit 'dim' and I struggle to take-in information, he has a lot of friends and is super sociable while I don't and I'm not, he doesn't want kids but I do, and he is always busy with different things (two jobs, his music, multiple courses, etc) but I like a partner who's able to give me a lot of their time. Besides he doesn't seem interested, he's had plenty opportunity to make a move but hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Ex is the closest thing I have to a friend right now, this is leading me to develop feelings for him and I'm scared I'll get hurt or scare him off if I can't get this under control. How do I rid myself of these feelings and keep my cool? ",16Mar2019,0

my friends keep telling me to continue my studies since I'm already behind in my college classes (I dropped out of biology this semester because my professor wasn't a big help) meaning I'm still doing my prerequisites before actually taking any nursing classes (also forgot to mention, that biology class I need to pass in order to take all my other prerequisites before my nursing classes like human anatomy &amp; physiology, microbiology, etc).

I've also seen a lot of videos of people saying you should consider getting your license as a CNA before becoming a registered nurse since it will give you an idea of what a registered nurse is going to do in their job and help you decide if nursing really is for you and if by any chance I hated the job maybe nursing wouldn't be for me and that would save me a lot of time. Others have also told me if I ended up loving the CNA job and finally got my license as a registered nurse it would look good on my Résumé when I apply for a job.

Can I get some of your opinions on what's a good path to take?

So should I over the summer take the cna course (outside of school) or continue and catch up with my college classes?",16Mar2019,1

im a 16yo boy and i met this girl last year on school ,but i started talking with her on a school trip, some months after. we became really good friends and our friendship was amazing. we werent that close but we talked alot and we loved to talk to each other. Now, 2019 started and she went to a different period of school (we were in the afternoon thing and now she went to the morning one). After that, i started missing her alot. Some other friends also went to the morning period and i also missed them, but she is different. I came to the conclusion that i like her, but i dont want to do it.

His ex was really jealous and texted him stuff like ""I cried the whole night"" She also probably was mad at me too because she invited every girl in our class to her birthday party except me even though before i met up with M15 we were pretty close friends. M15 still has feelings for her or at least he tells me so and she always has mixed feelings which really messes with him.

641,"Picture of my hand after being debrided https://imgur.com/a/2leyRLK

I’m a clinical laboratory scientist at a large lab company, and I do some STD/HIV testing along with other blood tests. I’ve been at my job for a few years and I never call in sick. I work hard and extremely efficiently. I get shit done, and on time. I’ve worked extra days, I’m helpful, I do everything I can to make sure everything is done and people are happy. I’ve only received excellent reviews. 

So, in my home life, my cooking skills get like maybe 2 stars. So, had a bit of a cooking accident that resulted in a grease fire. I sustained second degree burns to a decent portion of my dominant hand. I went to the ER and got a note for 2 days off and a referral to a burn clinic. I didn’t take the days off, and went to work the next day thinking I could tough it out and then see what the burn clinic said the next day. Bad idea. The burn specialist doctor said I needed a month off work and wrote me a work note. 

I went into work the day after burn clinic, and thinking I’m being generous, I ask for just a week of that month off. I get told no. I say “I’m afraid the sweaty, moist environment of the XL gloves I can barely fit over my bandages may contribute to a greater likelihood of infection in my already vulnerable wounds.” No. I say “this really, really hurts and I’m doing too much with my hand.” Nope. There’s no one else at our facility trained to do my job.

I feel so used and abused. I get paid absolute shit. We’ve had other labs in the same company send us their samples for me to run because the only person they had to run those tests was on vacation, but this can’t be done for me during an infection prone injury? 

I was about to cry, as I had already scraped one of my finger burns while trying to get a bottle of machine wash fluid out of the cardboard box. I’m so frustrated and hurt that I’m being forced to work in pain and in conditions that make me more prone to infection. And with disease ridden blood samples. That this company thinks so little of me that they can ignore my concerns, my doctor’s concerns, and put me in danger of infection, surgery, and more unnecessary and undue stress. I feel so unappreciated. I know they could find a way to figure this out. I just don’t know what to do. 

I know I could apply for short term disability, but I’m afraid of retaliation from my supervisor for doing so. I guess I could make 60% pay work, not easily. I kind of feel like a whiney bitch because I made it through those work days (in a LOT of pain and using my hand WAY more than advised) so surely I can just tough out the rest, but people keep telling me “no, you’re being a bitch for not standing up for yourself.” I don’t know what to do.

I’ll take advice. I know I need to find a new job real soon. Thanks for reading. ",16Mar2019,598

644,"Hey people of Reddit, this is my first post and I need some advice.
 I am a gay man in my sophomore year of high school, and my best friend is a straight Junior, we’ll call him Kevin. He’s been nicer and closer with me than any straight guy has before but I’ve had some problems with him that I haven’t told him about because I’m worried I might just be sensitive. Here it goes. 
    
     So  for the most part Kevin and I have been on some pretty good terms, we hang out multiple times a week, he’s been supportive thru my highs and falls throughout our friendship, but he’s never wanted anyone one at school seeing us together. For example, well go out to lunch during our lunch period and typically I’ll drive, but hell ask me to wait five mins after he gets out before I go in so nobody sees him with me and so nobody thinks he’s gay. 
    
   But something similar is happening and I don’t know what to make of it. So at least five times a year we go down to California to a resort we have a share in. Every now and then my mom will let me and my sister bring a friend. Now the resort is gorgeous, everything is in its place along with the beautiful interior of the buildings and their stunning views of the water. Of course, with all of this I love to take vacation photos and put them on my social media and here’s where my problem comes in. 
 
   I invited Kevin to come with me to California for spring break and he sounded ecstatic to come. I was telling him I couldn’t wait for him to appear in my vacation photos and he stopped me. He told me that he didn’t want to be in the photos. I asked him why. He told me that he doesn’t need to be catching shit for being gay, and that if people found out he went on vacation with a gay kid he’d never hear the end of it.  He also told me that people tease him all the time for being friends with me and that they’ve even gone so far to make up songs, and then proceeded to tell me the lyrics which sounded as if he’d just made them up. He told me this as if it shouldn’t bother me.

  Am I wrong for feeling upset with him about this?

645,"Sorry for the long post. I'm 24, and have never had a girlfriend. I've never tried. Partially due to some particularly gruesome (imo) self harm scars I inflicted when I was 17-18. I do what I can to cover them. I was a bad, bad alcoholic form the ages of 21-23, and went through delirium tremens while withdrawing. I spent the entire year of 2018 rebuilding, trying to get back to square one, and struggling feverishly against self-hatred and general terror. All that to say, it's knocked my self esteem down a peg, or two. Not trying to complain just to complain. That out of the way, I've recently started an internship (~4 weeks ago) and kind of fancy a girl that I work with. The thing most baffling (heart-pounding) to me is that I think she might like me, too. I work alongside her (I mean I literally sit next to her), and the boss, who is mercurial, and can be terse, but I get along with him regardless. What I mean when I say that I think she likes me is that she'll turn her swivel chair and lean towards me when I'm talking, and almost stare at me. Not in a leering way, really, but more of an at attention way. She's mentioned she's single. She asked me if I had ever been to a particular museum, and when I replied I hadn't, she said she hadn't, either. She'll ask me questions unrelated to work, throughout the day, and commonly starts conversations with me about topical news stories. It's easy to joke around with her. I just find her really easy to talk to, and don't feel stilted and weird around her. I showed her the trailer for the movie ""Us"", and she thought it was great. She expressed interest in seeing it, and I really want to ask her if she wants to go and see it with me. But how do I go about that? We work so close in proximity, I'm afraid to make things weird. I mean, it is normal to ask people questions like that, right? Like I mentioned earlier, I don't have any experience at all with women, and feel weird for thinking about one, simple, innocuous decision like this, but I'm kind of lost.

Today, I got into a heated argument with my mom about declawing my kitten. She wants him declawed so he doesn't scratch the furniture, while I don't because I think it's cruel. It quickly turned heated as I lost my temper and pounded the table with my fist when she raised her voice, while she resorted to personal attacks (""if you get a girlfriend and she's dieabetic, it's her or the cat"", ""I regret getting you that cat"", etc.) until my dad broke up the argument. By then, I was in tears. She started the argument under the guise that she's thinking of my future, but I don't think that's it. I think she's getting angry because she isn't getting her way like a child throwing a temper tantrum. 

Another thing she's been pushing me to do lately is to change my major from Computer Info Systems to Software Development because it'll give me more programming experience, except I can get that experience with an internship and my advisor doesn't think the program will last long. I'm also against it because I don't want to spend anymore time in college than neccessary because I want to move out to escape my autistic youngest brother, who lately has done nothing but yell and scream. She also tried to push me towards a master's degree which seemed like a good idea at first, but my advisor said that it may lock me out of entry-level positions for being over-qualified and that real-world experience matters more than a master's degree. My mom also doesn't like my advisor because she objected to my mom speaking on my behalf so my mom disregards anything she says.

Also, she's trying to get me to stay in the home longer by suggesting that I save up for a down payment for my first house, which seems like a good idea except she also cried when she said that she's scared that I might leave home right after college because of my aforementioned brother. I first dismissed it as my mom being concerned for me, but now I'm honestly convinced that she's trying to keep me in the house for as long as possible for whatever reason.

The thing that really got me thinking, however, is that after the declawing argument, my dad came up to me and told me not to marry someone like my mom, almost like a word of caution. He also called my mom's personal attacks ""brutal honesty"" and warned that I should not argue with my mom. Either there's something wrong or I'm just being paranoid. She's only human and we all have our flaws but I don't know. She's not bad all the time. What do you guys think?

649,"I'm 18, just graduated high school last year, currently going to community college and live at home with my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I need to preface, I frequently spend time with my parents. I'm not isolating myself from them or anything like that but I am becoming more independent (like everyone else my age) and am spending less time with them then I did a few years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad, for as long as a I can remember, can talk anyone's head off who is willing to listen. This isnt always a bad thing, but can get extremely frustrating. When I was younger I wrote this off in my head as just it being normal for kids to be bothered by their parents, etc etc. But now that I'm a little older and have met other parents his age and whatnot his way of conversing is pretty outside of the norm as far as I can tell. I have pointed it out to him in the past in a very respectful way, he acknowledges it, and then nothing changes. This is the main reason I don't invite friends over because he will pretty much corner them into a conversation when they get to my house and will continuously keep talking to them until I'm pretty much dragging them away from him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, The main reason I'm posting here is because there is one thing that drives me absolutely INSANE. Almost always every single time I talk to him (which is tons of times a day) he ends up going into an extremely long winded story loosely related to what we are talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, if I were to ask him what he wanted me to order for him from a pizza place, he would tell me and then somehow tie the response into a long winded story about how his friend was a pizza delivery driver in college. Just stuff that BARELY relates to what we were talking about. Frequently these stories, take like 5-10 minutes and it makes me want to RIP MY EARS OUT! Especially since I have likely already heard this story 10+ times before! 

&amp;#x200B;

Its really hard to deal with it especially when he just begins talking AT me without really allowing for any back and forth or if I plain and simply am just not in the mood to talk. I feel like I keep saying this, IT DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY NUTS! He can never take a cue from me that I would like to stop the conversation, change the subject or anything like that and will literally keep talking to me until I'm all the way up the stairs with the door shut to my room! 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, How do I get him to stop going into such long-winded stories and dominating the conversation without being rude? I have tried the nice approach in the past (granted, it has been a couple years since I mentioned it) and that didnt work. Where do I go from here? ",16Mar2019,6

* I have debt to pay off
* my job is a long commute for my mother to take me to and from and I feel like such a burden on her, gas money is so expensive and I’m trying to pay for everything and save up to move out, but I can’t move out until I get a car, but it’s hard to save because of many expenses happening back to back (ie our fridge broke right after we replaced our washing machine)
* Public transit is NOT an option where I live and taxis and Uber’s would cost like $35 a trip or more.

What I need advice on


* should I take a pay cut (I’m making 10/hour right now) to get a job closer to my house to make it easier on my family? New job would be me about $8-9/hour but would most likely give me more hours than current job
* or should I get an auto loan for my own car? I’m paying like a full paycheck on my current bills, so idk if I can even afford it? But would it be worth it to not be a burden anymore
* I want to save up to go back to school to get a biology degree and a minor in forensic science because I think a career in the science field (preferably forensics) would make me happier than being a retail manager

What would you do if you were me? Stuck in a shitty job, at home, being a burden on your family, not being able to afford to move out and up in life but desperately needing to. Wound getting another loan just be dumb of me? Or wound having my own car change my life in better ways?",16Mar2019,1

i do not communicate well with people at all, so if i just get the goods to deliver to someone then just take wages from that to add onto my social security so i can live alright then? yeah sounds solid and quiet, and sounds like a job that once i get the hang of it, i can hang onto well

Normally, I'd fight these thoughts with optimism.  I set up small goals for myself such as creating a SAT prep schedule and learning guitar but it's not doing shit. In fact, my feelings of sadness have gotten 100x worse. I don't wanna do anything anymore other than to die. I have nothing to feel happy about.",16Mar2019,6
