1,"I'm double majored in English and Computer Science. I've completed my English degree, and have about 4 semesters left for Computer Science.   


My issue is i'm about half way through a semester and i don't want to do Computer Science anymore. Ever since I've finished my English degree I've fallen into some on/off depression. I have no motivation, my passion has been lost, and i haven't been able to write or work on my novels.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to the realization that maybe i shouldn't complete my CS degree, but at the same time i think about the time and money I've wasted and how angry my parents are going to be if i tell them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking into Journalism, a job that centers around something i honestly enjoy doing(writing), i do have a semester of sports writing under my belt and that's about how far my experience goes in that field. So i was thinking of possibly mastering in Journalism which would require me to be apart of other internships excluding the ones I've completed already.

2,"Hello guys, I would really be thankful for your advice here.

So my best friend told me yesterday that I contradict everything she says in general and also when she tries to give me advice I contradict that too and start to explain to her why I can’t take it. I’ve definitely noticed myself that I start my sentences with “Yeah but...” or even say just plain “No” a lot and I hate that. I don’t want to be this person. I have no clue why I do it and I want to stop. 

Are there any ways to specifically look out for the moments where I contradict someone so that I could take it under control? Also, do you have any ideas why people do this? I’m 30yo female.

Thank you!",28Feb2019,2

Wife and I have been married for 5 years, known each other for 8. Married at 21 and now can't stand even being in the same room.

5,"My long-term substitute teacher for AP French is considering quitting because the school administration is treating her unfairly. This is a high school in a suburb in Ohio by the way.

So she has been our substitute for a few weeks now, and today in class she told us  she might be quitting because the school refused to pay her 130 dollars/day, which was the amount they agreed on when she started subbing for us. Today was her pay day, and she told us when she received her paycheck they paid her 100 per day, which is the nornal rate for long term substitute teachers in my school teachers.

Bit of context: she told us the regular substitute teachers in our district (1 day subs)  make 95 per day, but long term subs only make 100, which is ridiculous considering the amount of planning, grading, etc. they have to do, and she said she would not have accepted the job if she thought she was going to be paid 100.

She says that if the district doesnt pay her the 130 for the past few weeks (which they agreed upon beforehand) she will quit in the next few days.

The reason she is angry at the district is because not only did they refuse to pay her the agreed 130, our school district has a history of complaints from substitute teachers about being treated unfairly. The district board does not care about the quality of the teachers, nor the quality of the students' education, as they often assign long term subs that are underqualified in the subject. This teacher is a native French speaker and she says that if she decides to quit, they will most likely assign us a teacher incapable of teaching this class, as good AP French teachers are in high demand and hsrd to come by.

Anyway, she is a very popular teacher in our class and we would hate for her to go, especially since the AP exam is only a few months away. Many of my classmates have expressed that they are frustruated with the situation as well.

How do we (the students) help to negotiate with the school board or administration to get her to stay? What can we do?



Tldr: ap french long term sub reacher might be quitting because of wage scam, what should we do? Any way we can negotiate w school board?",28Feb2019,5

10,"Background: In my final year of high school, I was dating a girl a year younger than me. When I graduated and moved away for college, we maintained a relationship via Snapchat. When we broke up I was arrested because of the nature of our communication and after spending half a year in jail, and registering as a sex offender for the rest of my life, I went back to school. 

Effort: During my time at college, I joined the film department, doing the multi camera technical direction for all the sports games our school filmed for the entire time I was there. I internshiped with various local non profit organizations to direct and edit short films for them. I even had a freelance editing gig for a company in Hollywood. I took every opportunity to grow my skills in the film and broadcasting field, and got a glowing letter of recommendation from each person I've worked with.
This semester I am graduating with three degrees: Film, Broadcasting, and Communications. 

At the beginning of the semester I got in contact with a local TV station with an opening for Technical Director (The very job I was hoping to get.) I applied, interviewed, past the drug test, and was offered the job with enthusiasm.

The problem came with the background check.
It showed my status as a sex offender and they promptly retracted the offer.

The advice I'm asking for is:
Does the effort I put in to become a better person matter, or will I forever be viewed with a stigma that will render my efforts useless?",28Feb2019,41
12,"When I was 18 my mum moved her “boyfriend” into the house who she had known 4/5 weeks. When she told me we had a big argument, I told her it was irresponsible and she didn’t know this man and she was placing her relationship above her children’s safety. (I have 2 brothers who were 15 and 22 at the time- the 15yo lived at home too) 

After the argument she was still adamant he was moving in, so I went to live with my friend. My friend had a young baby and I was working and at uni at the time, I ended up caring for the kid and paying for everything- so it got on top of me. One day my mum came round and I was crying and in a mess, so she convinced me to move home. 

After I moved back I had a few run ins with the boyfriend, he spoke to my mum like shit and treated my brother like a servant. He also would buy me gifts like “hooker heels”. 2 weeks after I moved back, he rang my mum to say he was coming home and did she want anything, she said no and hung up. I came in a few mins after and she asked me if I wanted anything- I said yes and she rang back to convey. Anyway he hit the roof, telling my mum that I don’t dictate his life etc.

He came back and started berating my mum, screaming in her face and calling her names. My mum just shrivelled and didn’t respond so I argued back and told him this wasn’t his home and he doesn’t get to speak to her like that. This carries on for a while and my mum tells him he has to leave. He “calms” down then and says he has nowhere to go and can he stay one more night. My mum, for some reason, agrees.

I went out to a friends for a while and came home around midnight and went to bed. My mum, brother and him leave in the morning for work/school. At 9am I woke up with him on top of me and a knife to my throat.

He told me I had ruined his life and now he was going to ruin mine. He then spent 3 hours beating and raping me. At one point he asked if anyone was expecting me so I told him my dad was coming to take me to the bank, he took my phone and text my dad telling him not to come anymore, it was all misspelt so my dad rang 3 times after that but I obviously couldn’t answer. 

Eventually he stopped. I managed to convince him to let me go, said I would tell anyone. He asked what I would tell my mum about the bruises on me (my face was a mess and my neck was badly bruised from being choked) I told him I would say I was jumped at the bank.

Anyway he left, I ran to my aunties around the corner, she saw the state I was in and tried to ring my mum, when she couldn’t get through she rang my dad. My dad arrived, cradled me like a baby for a while, rang the police and eventually my mum arrived. 

This happened in November 2010, he was arrested the day it happened and sentenced 1st July 2011 to 7 years on an independent public protection sentence, meaning before he could be released he had to “prove” he was no longer a danger. Part of the reason for this is because he had a previous conviction is his home country for almost the exact same thing. 

He was released earlier this year and deported back to his home country as he had entered illegally. 

Anyway, since then me and my mum have had a very difficult relationship. After it happened I never wanted to be back in that house again, I got terrible “flashbacks” in there and overall it just reminded me of something horrible that happened and I could only view it as a crime scene. I ended up effectively homeless for 2 years staying with various people until I managed to get a flat. 

Initially, I wanted nothing to do with my mum and made this clear. But she kept forcing herself around me and eventually I decided to try and have a relationship with her. I have tried to go to the house as both my brothers now live there with my mum, but I can’t go upstairs as it still brings back memories of that day and overall I hate being there. So I decided that once a month I would go for dinner with her, so she could see I was alive and okay and that’s all.

Anyway, the advice part. My mum has just been diagnosed with cancer, it’s not “serious” yet, but she is having to have surgeries and treatment to prevent it becoming something more. Since being diagnosed she is forcing more of a relationship with me and using being sick as the reason. She hasn’t changed anything, even the simple request of moving (it’s a council house and they offered her a swap at the time) but is still trying to have a relationship that I feel doesn’t exist anymore.

My younger brother thinks I am being too harsh and that she’s sick and I should be supporting her. But I just can’t find it in me. I blame her for what happened and the impact it has had on my life since. She acted like a victim throughout the whole thing and I just cannot her passed it.

I don’t feel anything in regards to her being sick and it’s making me question if I am a terrible person for not feeling sympathy for her.

I’m at a loss how to proceed here and people close to me know my mum is a touchy subject so just agree with me and won’t be direct.

I need to know what to do here, do I push my feelings down and just try to get along with her because she’s sick and if she gets worse and dies I would regret it? Or do I do what’s best for my “mental health” ? 

Hopefully it’s okay to post this here and I apologise for the length. Any guidance is welcome.

13,"I dated a guy a little under a year ago. We'll call him Greg (not his real name obviously). He was my first real boyfriend. We were in love, yet things were really unstable and toxic. Greg eventually fell out of love with me (at least this is what he told me), and things grew worse. Eventually neither of us were happy so we ended it mutually, yet with quite a bit of conflict, as we didn't see our relationship and its situation quite the same way. It ended dramatically, we agreed we didn't hate each other, but for months, us ""moving on"" consisted of blocking each other on social media, and angrily yet indirectly posting about each other when we'd hear the other had spread false information about the relationship. It was messy.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually (a few months later) I got a new boyfriend. I really liked him. I admired his charm. and romanticism, and how he did practically everything Greg never did that I wished he would. I saw him as perfect. We'll call him Jack. Jack was also the best friend of Greg's close friend.  I was uncomfortable by this at first; as I had known this friend from when Greg and I were together. I decided to just try my best in not making the situation awkward, and accepted this person as being both Greg and Jack's good friend.

&amp;#x200B;

In the early stages of Jack and my relationship, I was admittedly still hung over Greg. I wasn't still romantically attracted to him, but I was angry of the unfairness revolving how we ended, and how he was spreading the word that his and my breakup was practically my fault (which him and I had both admitted, wasn't either's fault entirely). I was furious at the immaturity of his actions. I figured it was because he was jealous of Jack being my new boyfriend, yet Greg had admitted to falling out of love with me, so why would he care? It didn't add up. One big issue with Greg and my relationship, was that we were both struggling with a lot of mental health problems at the time, and we didn't know how to help each other consistently. I knew he had remained mentally unstable as I would help him mentally whenever I could, and now he didn't really have anyone else to aid in his mental health. Deep down, I felt sad for him because I knew he was unstable, but his mental health wasn't my place any longer so I kept to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, due to the tension between Jack, Greg, and their mutual friends, I decided to move past the conflict that came with the end of Greg and my relationship. Jack suggested I make amends with Greg; be the better person and all that. I texted him and asked if we could move on and not hate each other any longer. We talked a few things out, agreed it was a good idea. After that, we were slight friends. We'd say ""hi"" when we say each other and all that. A few times he'd text me for advice. He'd tell me how he was sad, and I suggested he maybe seek out another girl in order to be less lonely. At this time, Jack and I were still together, and he had no problem with me being friends with Greg as it at least ""avoided drama"".

&amp;#x200B;

There was a party about a month later thrown by their same friend. Greg, Jack, and many other mutual friends of them would be there. I didn't see any issue with being there any longer. I went with Jack, and Greg was there. There was a uncomfortable tension the minute Greg, Jack, and I were in the same room together. One girl at the party who was friends with Jack was interested in Greg. Throughout the party they'd been talking. Later in the night, I was leaving the living room where they sat together, and glanced to see them kissing. I shrugged it off, but felt slightly off. I'd never seen him kiss anyone else besides myself. It felt strange to see him on the same couch we'd sit on, but with her instead. I brushed it off, happily reminding myself I had a boyfriend of my own.

&amp;#x200B;

But, Jack wasn't too great that night. I could secretly tell he had grown eyes for another girl who attended my school, and he spent the entire party looking around for her. He hardly talked to me all night, and just to his other friends. This night I felt like I had nobody.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out about a month later, I found out that he'd been messaging this other girl at my school on the daily, obviously in order to get to know her, and without telling me whatsoever. He admitted to be that he wasn't happy, but he declared that it *wasn't me.* As you could imagine I didn't feel too hot. But I wasn't nearly as heartbroken about the entire situation as when Greg and I broke up. I wondered why this was and came to the conclusion that I hadn't felt love for Jack in months, if at all. I did really love Greg to the end, and I was distraught when we broke apart. By the time Jack and I had been dating for awhile, I was certain I was over Greg for good.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not so sure. Greg and the girl he kissed at the party dated for a mere month and split up in what seemed to be a pretty unfortunate situation, yet I haven't heard any details. I texted Greg asking him an unrelated question about a teacher we both have, and then asked how he was. He explained he had started medication for a newly diagnosed mental illness, and that he and this girl had just recently broken up. Again I felt bad for him. *He's troubled.* Yet again, often times during his and my relationship, he treated me horribly. When we fought soon before our breakup, he called me names and used extremely manipulative language. Yet at this point I don't even care. I don't expect to get back together with him, as it certainly wouldn't go well. Yet, I find myself going on his Instagram account, looking at pictures of him and thinking he's good looking. I hadn't thought this in months. It's as if all the emotional trauma from our relationship diminished; despite me remembering it all. I think more than anything, I missed being madly in love with him. I miss not caring how the relationship affected me because of how much I cared for him. I'm not sure if that ever completely went away. We bonded over many things and I think I miss that, but not him necessarily?

I've definitely drawn on more than I had to, but I had to get this off of my chest. This is my first time admitting all of this. I guess I wanna be proven I'm not delusional, or insane. Any response will help me somehow. Thank you",28Feb2019,1
14,"So I turn 20 next week. This all happened yesterday. I am at school from 8am until around 7:30pm. I left my car at 8am. I go to my classes. I was walking out of Spanish class around 7pm. I am walking to my car. I have an evening Spanish class. I pass through this one alley I usually pass through. Some 40 year old looking dude tells me to stop. I turn around. He pulled out a knife. I say ""Hey man. I got 60$ on me. I'll give it to you"" He says ""I'm sorry but you have to die."" He starts running at me and I dodge his thrust with his knife. I knock the knife out of his hand. I notice his hand has the same scar on my hand that I have had since I was 11. I punch him in the rib cage. I push him to the ground and start running. He yells ""Stop.

16,"(sorry if this is long)

I'm in high school and for a big chunk of my life, I've been abused by my parents. As a result, I'm afraid of being close to people, emotionally and physically. I haven't gotten any outside help yet, but that's not what I'm here  for right now. I have a friend, who is technically my best friend, that makes me super uncomfortable. She's already pretty affectionate with other people, and super open about sex and stuff like that. I have almost every single class with her, and my teachers always put us together because they believe that we can help each other with our school work. She also has a boyfriend that she's very close with and is not afraid of PDA. 

Before my parents turned real bad (it used to be just a couple physical fights here and there and being forced to sleep out on the porch) I would hug my friends in greeting, and sit close to them. That was around the time i became friends with my friend. Now I get uncomfortable with her hugging me randomly. She treats me as a stand-in for her boyfriend. She'll grab my hand and try to rub it when we're sitting and doing work in the library, or rest her head on my shoulder in the middle of class. She'll grab my hand in the hall and try to squeeze it tight, and gets close to my face when we talk. I've told her to stop, I've physically forced her away. I told her that I don't like it. She still keeps doing it. I had the idea (which I've since dropped) of swearing at her and hitting her whenever she tried stuff like that again, even when she didn't, just to give her the idea that ""hey, I don't like you being all up in my space like that."" Nothing has stopped her.

The worst part was when i was about to get closure to my crush. We were getting closer together, and then he did something that forcefully reminded me of my parents and my best friend. I had to get out of there immediately before he could see me break down. i apologized later and I haven't seen him since (we see each other at an out of school club.)

so I'm coming here for advice. How do I  either a.) overcome fear of affection and closeness, or b.) get my friend to finally understand that I am not her boyfriend cuddle toy, and that what she does makes me genuinely upset? and, as a last ditch effort, c.) should/ how do I break up with my friend?

To preface, I am a sophomore in high school. Recently, I took a large national math contest (not part of grade or anything, and I'm too young for it to count for university). The thing is, I'm not sure if I will get in trouble because of somethings that happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started the day of the test. My friend had gotten the test from another school who did the exam earlier in the day (the questions were the same) and started doing them. They added me to a group chat with all the answers, which I then left, but not before catching a glimpse of the answers that were posted. (It was a multiple choice test)  The answers that were posted were the last questions of the test, and were quite difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go into the test, all prepared, and then I realized that the questions were exactly the same, and I had no idea what to do. I knew the answers, but I ultimately decided to leave the questions that I knew the answers to blank. I did this because I did not want to cheat. I probably would not have gotten them anyway, because I'm not that good at math.

He asked what I’m doing awake? And I said I have to get ready to go out lol wbu and he said “idk just woke up I guess wyd” but how do you wake up at 7 when you go to sleep at 5 that’s not normal? 
There’s days where we just don’t talk &amp; he will ghost me? He hits me up all the time and I rarely hit him up, but when I hit him up he just opens it and doesn’t reply.... it’s weird. We can go days without talking and then he will out of no where hit me up which makes no actual sense. He also always watches my stories etc. Also, he flirts w me a lot. He’s not sexual and hasn’t asked for anything explicit but he does like to flirt and he’s always talking about hanging out (since we go to college rn he’s an hour away from me but when I go back home he’s about 10 mins) it’s just sometimes he doesn’t make much sense and he’s confusing &amp; if I’m honest he’s very frustrating to handle. I don’t know  what to do or even think . It’s like he’s taken a toll on my emotions because I’m so caught up. 
Last week everything was normal? He snapped me everyday up until Wednesday, he snapped me, I replied and he didn’t reply back (sometimes he does that) and then Thursday I snapped him and he opened it after 1 minuet , and just ignored me. I don’t understand if I did something. 
I told him I cared about him last Saturday and he said “I appreciate that a lot more than you’ll know” (he took 15 mins to reply) he usually is a fast replier and he always seems interested, but he opened that long message about me caring and waited? He’s on a business trip for college at the moment in another state, he’s been gone since Friday and hasn’t contacted me for 6 days now. Was I the issue?",28Feb2019,1
31,"I met this one boy online who I ended up really enjoying. We grew decently close (despite the insane physical distance) and, recently, we were talking about something kind of regarding relationships. I asked him a question that revolved around the topic of feelings (specifically for me) because he was acting super weird; I just wanted to get some sort of straight answer out of him for clarification. He dismisses it with a joke and so quickly changes the subject and continues changing the subject that there isn't a moment of silence for the rest of the call. 

The next day or so, he brings up that he wants to talk about ""something"". I immediately know what this something is and I'm sure you can assume as well. He messages me some things that make me think that he might confess that he is ""enamored"" with me (wishful thinking), but it could just be me reading into it a bit (most definitely is). We end up not talking about it till the next day: today. 

I call him to ask what he wanted to discuss, figures we do not cover the subject until an hour in because he keeps dodging it. Essentially, it was the most dissatisfying call I've ever had to make. He wanted to inquire if what I asked the other day was ""serious"". I respond with yes and he proceeds to ask some other questions, which I answer. Then, it is silent; it is silent for what felt like 5 minutes (a pretty long time to be silent and cooped up to my own thoughts). During the silence that should've been for a better cause, I was genuinely contemplating throwing all the cards on the table and asking if he has feelings for me, which I should've done (would've saved me another call), or if I should tell him mine to maybe invite him to the playing field. He asks if we can talk about something else and we do.

I call him after my class to talk about this subject again, surprise surprise. We talk about it, get side tracked, and talk about it some more. We finally get to the point of me asking if he likes me, to which he responds ""as a friend"". I immediately say something in dismayed acceptance in attempts to end the conversation there. He continues by stating that it would never work out, which is completely true as the distance is far too great. Plus internet relationships? Genuinely, what the fuck are those? He then asks me bluntly if I have feelings for him. I kind of do? But, the internet relationship thing is just so weird and foreign it makes me recoil and internalize all feelings in my response that ends up being a sad and up-spoken ""no...?"" That was only after he demanded that I make my answer straightforward (I had started explaining that I care about him but he cut me off). I toss the question back at him and receive: ""it's incompatible, it won't work"". Again. Yea, thanks for the newsflash, pal? I kind of explain my reason for saying no which is that I also agree that it won't work, but definitely don't put that in the clearest of terms. It is quiet again for a bit and we end the call.

Should I address this topic again and clarify my feelings or is it really just not worth it? I do have them and I feel shitty that I lied, but I also do not really want to talk about it for a third time and have another conversation where maybe both of us are just tip-toeing around the real subject and it ends in awful silence. Should I ask him for his feelings in a yes or no format? Should it matter at this point? Opinions on internet relationships? How do they function if they do at all?",28Feb2019,1
32,"I’ve been in several meetings and classes where I have been called out for sleeping because my eyes are closed and people do not believe me when I try to explain that I am fully awake and cognizant but just having a flare where I have difficulty opening my eyes for long stretches of time. (I have a diagnosis and medication, but it doesn’t always work.) 

I’m wondering if it would be better to proactively let people know during my flares to counteract the disbelief after being confronted and because many professor, supervisors and what not just ignore it but might think I am sleeping, which could harm my professional and academic reputation.

The problem is when I have had such conversations,  they can be awkward and people tend to think I’m lying for whatever reason. Which is also terrible for academic and professional development. When this happens these conversations can mar my self esteem and be unbelievably frustrating.

So should I share this information with individuals in a professional and academic setting and if so how can I do so without making the situation more awkward?",28Feb2019,1
33,"19M in college. Had a thing with a girl. We had kissed in private alone at my apartment a few times so it was definitely a thing not just friends. Went to a sort of dance event (fraternity invite) and because of how things had been going I was a little close to her most of the night. Hand around her and stuff but never inappropriate or grabby. Nothing happened at the end of the night just said bye. Apparently I made her uncomfortable by being in her space like that most of the night so I completely misread where we were. I heard this from a (mostly) trusted source, and for this reason she isn’t really interested now and has been acting like we’re just friends and nothing happened. I really connected with this girl and I absolutely hate myself for messing this up. How can I fix this, if I can at all? And if I need to apologize (which I want to) how do I go about doing this, I would rather not shoot a text out of the blue I want to say it to her in person but it’s kinda hard to talk to her alone one on one at this point.",28Feb2019,1
34,"High school junior here. 

So, performing arts is probably the BIGGEST thing at our school. Sports are nonexistent. Additionally, and I’m NOT trying to brag, but I’m kinda known as one of THE theatre kids: Always hanging around drama room, getting leads every play, getting awards at competitions, always singing, etc. 

I think this has put some pressure on me. And combine that pressure with the pressure every junior in high school goes through, I’m freaked tf out rn. 

I don’t want to pursue theatre. I don’t want it to be my career. Acting, singing, performing. I don’t want that to be my vocation or what I’m known for. I’ve even been paid for it before and I still don’t want to do it. I’m not happy now, so I doubt I would be doing it as a career. Assuming I can even make it as a performer. 

However, whenever I try to pull away, I feel myself getting roped back in. I’m too far deep into this world I’ve created, My school and friends have created. And I also get scared. I’m scared of losing theatre, because that may mean I lose myself. I don’t have anything to put on my apps for extracurricular besides performing arts (theatre, choir, and solo singing). Acting and singing are all I have. But I don’t want them anymore. 

I want to study something else in college. Idk what yet. Maybe law or politics or economics. Just not theatre. I want out. But I can’t get out. The pressure to stay in this world I, my friends, and my school have all subconsciously created for myself won’t let me go.

My parents don’t want me to do it either. Well, they just want me to be happy.

40,"I’m a second year in college at a pretty prestigious school for engineering. I came from the opposite side of the country to come here for the engineering program. 
For context, I’m from an extremely small town and my high school was a joke, I got a perfect gpa without much effort and took many AP classes. I was very excited to get out of the small town to go to California for school but this year college has been making me completely miserable. I didn’t do great my first year partly due to not knowing how to study and partly from having the worst professors at my school, this year has been much worse, I feel like I work so hard and study so much and I keep barely getting C’s while my classmates do so well. I feel like I don’t deserve to be here. I have also recently started getting panic attacks and migraines from the stress of it all which is keeping me from going to class which is making it all so much worse.
All of this is making me wish I could drop out but feeling like I can’t because of what everyone expects from me. I feel like I’ve tricked so many people into thinking I’m smart when I feel like a complete loser. I know hoe heartbroken my parents would be if I dropped out but I feel like I really can’t do it. I’ve lost all passion to do well and I’m burning out.

41,"I posted this on another thread because I am DESPERATE for some form of help. I'm completely lost at this life, and adulting thing. This will probably be the hardest thing I will ever type. I was born in a foreign country, and adopted by American parents 21 years ago. My father served in the military, and my mother worked for NATO with him. They were amazing people who gave their lives to helping others in numerous countries, they truly had kind hearts. What happened to them in their elderly years does no justice for all of the sacrifices that they made for this world. We moved to the USA the day after 911, and I was in the country for about two years when my father died of cancer, and my mother was diagnosed. My life has been grieving process for my parents, the loss of what I wanted to give back to them with my life, what I wanted them to teach me, I miss their love, I miss our happiness. I feel like I don't see in colour anymore, the loss of my father is that great. He was my best friend, my hero. And he's gone. And I don't know what to do anymore, 15 years later after his death. It's been so hard without him. I grew up with my mom constantly being in and out of the hospital with her cancer, and end stage liver failure. She has another daughter from a previous marriage with special needs, so I've never had what I've needed. I worked so hard with studies, and dance throughout my school years. My education, and sports were my outlet. But all of that hard work in the end got me no where, because two weeks after graduating highschool my friend flipped a car, and I almost died. I bled from every hole in my body, broke multiple bones, had to learn to walk, talk, and everything again after waking up from an almost month long coma. Six months after learning to walk again I enrolled into college despite giving up my life-long dream of dancing, and it has been so hard ever since. I desperately need a car, I've worked up to 3 jobs and going to school full-time, because school allows me to have a partial military scholarship from my dad, but it just barely gets me by. I use that income to pay for rent, utilities, and help my mother. Where I live it's impossible without a car, and I'm in absolute tears everyday not knowing what to do. All I want to do is give back to my family, to this world, and carry on my family's legacy. I want to continue my parent's humanitarian character, and I truly want to make this world a better place. I really do, it's been my childhood dream. But I don't know what else to do anymore, I'm in school on scholarships so it doesn't cost me to attend, it's the cost of living that's hard, and without a car, even with a job I spend more on transportation than any income I earn, and it creates stress for school which is my only future. I can provide proof of my adoption, medical records, and school enrollment. I don't know what else to do, my mom is dying, and will die before I finish my degree. I just want to give her a few good years since my father died. It's been so hard for her, and they both did so much for me. I'm not lazy, I'm a hard worker. I fought for my life on the road, the life-flight, hospital, and I went to class, and work with a limp, a walker, and I will never give up. It's been so hard, I can't afford therapy from my accident, or grief over my parents. I feel like I'm failing at life, but it's so hard to do it all alone. I had great examples of parents to show me how to be a good person, but I have no support, and I am absolutely lost. I can't get loans, all student loans I get apart from my scholarship are capped because I'm currently at community college in pathway to transfer to University, and I've tried every possible option. I've worked as a server, retail, customer service, I've volunteered, I don't have friends or family who would loan any money, I've been to banks, I've been to service departments, I've been to counselors with my school, and I've been to churches. I've begged and screamed to God for temporary help because I don't know what else to do anymore. I know that I'm just one person, and my parents are just as valuable as anyone else's, but they were good people. They deserved more than to die of cancer, not see me graduate, marry, or have my own life. I can't tell my mother that I'm depressed, and struggling, she's already under so much stress, and has experienced so much trauma herself. I don't drink, do drugs, or party. I don't spend needlessly, I try to be responsible..I just got behind through these set backs in life. If they didn't get sick, or if I didn't get so hurt it wouldn't be like this. Please, someone, anyone, help me. I just don't want that to be too late, when both of my parents are dead. My mom has called me suicidal because of her pain, and lack of income. I myself have been suicidal from all of this, but I couldn't tell her. She spends all of her income on her medication, housing, and my special needs sister. We didn't want this life, they worked for an amazing life, we had one until death, and disease hit us. I can't eat, sleep, I can't stop crying, stressing, or worrying. I have panic attacks, and I'm absolutely desperate. I've contemplated giving up principles of morality, or making dark choices in order to better the life of my family, but I'm asking here first before anything rash that could destroy my reputation, or future. I don't want to dishonor my parents. I really love them. I used to really love life, but it's just been hurting me. I don't pity myself, I just beg for a true miracle. Please. I need an absolute miracle like a connection to a job close to where I live, or a work from home, anything, a network connection, anything, advice, Please. Life isn't the same when you lose your parents, and I lost my dad when I was 7, and my mom has been sick since then. It's mental watching everyone die, I don't even know what to do anymore. I can't stop my education, it's the only thing I have. I feel so alone. I feel like such a failure, this isn't my first time venting, but I don't know what else to do anymore. ",28Feb2019,1

I was placed on a forced leave of absence after starting with my company because the job that I was doing requires a lot of physical strength (lifting up to 200 pounds), and I was not physically strong enough to do it. They gave me this leave of absence to hit the gym and get stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to offer a bit of background before I jump in, to give you a better picture of the overall situation. Feel free to skip the italicized section, as it's just background for what led into my personal situation.

&amp;#x200B;

*I'm prior military with a total of \~10 years of professional experience (both military and civilian), a bachelor's in Management Information Systems, and I'm actively trying to grow in my career (e.g., I hate downtime, and I need to be busy to be happy). This is my first job after getting out of the military and getting my degree, and it's in an entirely different industry than my military experience, which was my goal (I hated what I did in the military).*

*I was in the process of moving for my wife to attend an accelerated veteran nursing program, and I had two job offers. One would get me in the door for DoD civil service (GS employee), but it was low paying, boring, and entirely unrelated to my degree, and because of the location, I would have had to leave 6 months later when we moved. The other was very interesting, in a niche industry, would get me into the field my degree is in, and because of the location, I would be able to move halfway between the office and my wife's school, and keep the job, but we would both have a 45-minute commute each way (or so we thought). I ended up in the latter, and we quickly found out our commutes are both over 1hr each way with traffic.*

*My wife started her program in January, and found out she has classes or clinicals every day, with the school being 1hr+ away, and her clinical site being 1.5hrs+ away. Her program is 4 semesters, and runs until roughly May 2020. We originally planned to move immediately upon her graduation, so we already only intended to be in this house for a little over a year.*

*I am also in the process of attempting to commission back to active duty, which would essentially negate everything I'm discussing here. Unfortunately, that process takes 1-2 years (yes, that long - sometimes longer), so I need to figure this out in the interim.*

&amp;#x200B;

I randomly stumbled across this small, niche consulting firm on LinkedIn, and realized their specialties were directly related to my degree. I tailored my resume, drafted up a killer cover letter, and applied. I had already received an offer for a GS-06 position with the DoD at this point, so I was secure in knowing I would have something to fall back on. I got the call for a round of interviews, and eagerly accepted.

I interviewed on the phone with the HR rep, then had a video interview with the president of the company, then had an on-site interview with two senior staff members. According to their feedback, and discussions with them since then, they liked me and my qualifications right off the bat, and wanted me in their company, but didn't think I was quite right for the position they were advertising. The president wanted me to move to their corporate office in another state to work directly under him, but I was not willing to move until my wife completes her program. He accepted this, and still wants me to move there after she graduates. They ended up creating two additional positions, and hiring three of us.

The one who was placed in the original position (Junior/Associate Business Analyst) was immediately assigned to full-time billable work, and has seen serious professional development over the past 8 months. He is becoming a great asset, and he is doing quite well in his specific role.

The other is a former front-end developer who is absolutely brilliant, and a complete workaholic. He has a love for technology, gadgets, and innovation like nothing I've ever seen. He was hired as a mid-level Business Analyst, and has also been mostly engaged with full-time work. A few of his projects are on hold for the time being, but he is currently working full-time on revamping our website, and developing an internal software product for the company. He is also doing very well, and growing professionally.

Then there's me. I had zero experience in this field, but am eager and able to learn. I am incredibly interested in what we do, and our industry. They created a junior Consultant position for me, which actually ended up being sort of a ""catch-all"". The first three months, I coordinated everything to get us an office space (they didn't have a local office when I started, as the firm is headquartered in a different state). After the office was established, I worked for the next few months learning our contracting mechanisms, and maturing some internal contracting and project processes. I've also been assigned to multiple projects, but most are either on a long-term hold, or were scrapped before they started. I spend a majority of my time asking people how I can help, performing trivial admin tasks, and doing training courses on Lynda or Pluralsight. I've recently been helping the other BA with implementing HRM and CRM software internally, but there is - quite literally - never enough work to keep me busy for longer than a day or two.

Combine that with commuting 2-3 hours a day, and I feel like I'm stagnating terribly. I don't have time for personal development at home, and I feel like I'm struggling to develop professionally at work. I've literally begged for work from our senior staff, but they haven't given me much, and everything I do get is very sporadic. I'll have a dead sprint to get something done within a day or two, then I'm idle for a week or two, sometimes longer. I feel like I'm wasting all this time commuting and just sitting in the office as a body, but the senior staff claim they have ""big plans for me"".

I was able to negotiate 2 days per week from home, which has reduced my wasted commuting time. However, my wife is driving 1 hour each way - the opposite direction - 3-days per week for school, and 1.5+ hours each way the other two-days per week for clinicals (nursing). Between our two commutes, we're on the other side of the state from each other all day, and we're lucky to see one another for more than 2 hours before bed.

Now, all that being said, I absolutely love this company. I love what they do, I love the people, I love what they stand for, and the benefits are second-to-none. The pay is average for the industry - if not low - but I can't blame them, as my position shouldn't even exist. I just feel like I'm useless here, and I'm not growing. It sounds like an ideal position for some - getting paid to have basically nothing to do besides show up - but it's driving me insane. I feel like I need to get a more challenging job closer to my wife's school, sell our house, and get rid of these commutes, but I feel like my lack of growth over the past 8 months with this company has left me woefully under-qualified for anything similar. I'm honestly terrified that I'd be entirely unable to find a comparable position.

Depending on how bad they want me to stay, I may be able to negotiate fully-remote work, and still move closer to my wife's school and clinical site. This would solve the problem of the wasted commute time for both of us, but would still leave me in a very stagnant position career-wise.

If you made it this far, thank you very much for reading! Have you, or anyone you know had a similar situation? What did you do? What would you do if you were in this situation? I'm looking for any and all responses here. Thanks!!!",28Feb2019,1

47,"Hey all, long time lurker on the sub. Obviously pretty torn on my decision to be posting here, so here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

WORK

I just received a new job offer that would have me move to NYC from LA. It's a decent position at a late-stage startup, similar to what I'm doing now, and comes with a sizable pay increase and eventually some equity. 

However, my current job is pretty great, I helped build the company from the ground-up. I'll accrue (because of a weird structure) 3 year's worth of equity 10 months from now. It won't be worth a ton as is and the company would have to sell for several times our valuation right now just to break even for the pay differential with the new position. Ideally, I'd work for them in NYC, but due to a lot of circumstances, that's not viable.

If necessary, I do feel like I could land another similar position in NYC down the road...

&amp;#x200B;

LIFE

This is where I'm really unsure, and what inspired me to look at other jobs. I feel like my life in LA has stagnated a lot - I went to college here and while I do have friends here, they're just vestiges of my friend groups in college. I haven't done much to help that, but I have made efforts like joining gyms and taking classes around town. I normally have at least 1-2 events with friends throughout the week, but otherwise, I spend a lot of it on my own. I don't mind that, but the ratio is a little skewed for my liking.

To top it off, I've had a few serious breakups over the past couple years, including a girl I thought was ""The One"". LA has become a bit of a relationship graveyard, and with LA dating as hard as it is already, I feel like a fresh start might be in order.

It could be a lot worse, but overall, I feel like I am in kind of a rut and have been for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I love NYC - I love having so many activities at my finger tips, being able to walk / take public transit everywhere, cafe culture, 4am last calls (still in my mid-late 20s), the whole nine yards. I feel inspired and lively every time I visit. Plus, since I'm from NY, my parents still live nearby and so do a number of high school and college friends. I'd like to hope that a new city will get me out of my comfort zone and let me get a fresh start.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do: do I take the job and start a new life in NYC, or do I stick things out here for a while?

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr**; Good job with almost-earned equity but lackluster social life vs a new job and a new start in NYC

51,"I (M,28) have been seeing this person (F, 23) for about 2 months now. There is strong connection between us, i really enjoy her company and her whole being. she has told me she is starting to fall in love with me which i 100% feel the same way. 

From the beginning she told me there is this other guy that she had grown up with and helped her through her darkest moments (depression, abusive relationships, awkward childhood developments). They started dating then about a year ago they went to being not exclusive, which meant they still see each other and from what she told me sleep together (they haven't in months).  At the start i didn't really second guess this other guy because she was putting in the effort to see me and really showed me that she cared. I never questioned her about it or anything. Then i asked if i could make her mine (trying to have that exclusive chat) and she said not yet. i asked the question so i expected an answer like that. She told me she has to sort out stuff with this guy, but every time she does try he says hes going through a tough time and is super depressed. she gets worried that he will do something stupid if she tells him she doesn't want to be with him. 

I dont want to make her choose, this guy clearly means something to her. its her best friend that went through everything with her, helped her, cared for her, held her.  she knows if she says they wont be together again that would break him which will break her. 

i guess im just wondering am i being strung along fulfilling her needs until this guys sorts himself out? i just dont know what to do.

52,"I am currently in a Master's of Social Program after graduating with an undergraduate degree in liberal arts. I've always had a lot of passions and hobbies. Mainly, I make music (actually I have an album coming out soon so I can balance school and hobby pretty well). I love making music, it brings me so much joy (and frustration at times) but I worry that making it a job will suck all the joy out of it. I have a few key needs on my path, I want to make a difference in the world and I want to help others. I guess that's what drove me to pursue my MSW. But also I had no idea what else to do with my life other than more school. Fast forward about a year and I am so lost, I feel burnt out. I'm unsure if this field really is for me. My goals with it are so different than my peers. They talk of opening their own practice, working for CPS, etc. And I want to help college students (either as an academic advisor or working with student athletes) (At least I think that's what I want to do, for all I know I may hate that). I read a recent post on this sub about the importance of working in a career and creating a nest egg so that you could potentially transfer to your hobby later on. The problem with that is, everyone tells me, even the professors I have, that social workers don't get paid well at all. So in my mind I struggle with the idea of pushing myself through a program, learning about things that don't exactly apply to what I may want to do, only to get paid peanuts when I could work in my hobby and still not make money. Because if this , I thought about jumping ship and joining a program that would lend itself to a better career financially that still helps people, like physical therapy. Though to the honest the thought of more school makes me wanna rip my hair out. Any advice on sticking to school, more schooling, or my hobby?",28Feb2019,2

60,"This man was creating a scene at my work being extremely rude to me, my co worker, and another manager. He was screaming and insulting me after I was only informing him about what he was waiting for was ready so he could stop being aggressive and making everyone uncomfortable which lead him to insulting me. I went to my managers told one of them everything and she did nothing she just stayed in the back I told the other manager on duty and he again did nothing he didn’t approach the man after screaming and making a scene he didn’t even look at the man who yelled and insulted me. 

I felt soooo many emotions rush over me. A man was screaming at my co worker making her feel uncomfortable to the verge of tears and shaking since this man was being rude, aggressive and kept getting more and more loud each time he came back to ask her more questions. Screamed at me and insulted me calling me stupid! When I was just backing up my friend that’s getting yelled at. Told both my managers this and the first manager after I told her everything she didn’t go up there and the second manager on duty went up there but didn’t handle the situation, speak to the man, or even look at the man. 

Let’s be real, men are not threatened by women and will back talk to other women but when it’s a man they know they could get into an actual fight and choose not to get to the point this man was getting with us so when my male manager got there and didn’t say anything he didn’t really need to since he was a man so the customer just stood there waiting and didn’t come back to my co worker to yell at them. 

I just felt so alone in the situation. After I told the first manager she should have gone up there and handled the situation but she didn’t she just stayed in the back didn’t even bother to let the second manager be the one to handle it. And he didn’t even handle it or correct that mans behavior. 

I’m definitely going to speak to my store manager but I feel like my managers need to be held accountable for something for just leaving me and my other co workers in the dust I’m astounded of their lack of management by TWO managers. Neither of them spoke to the man or approached him. I’m thinking this needs to be brought up to my District manager because of the utter LACK of management from those two. They’re managers and are paid to manage and handle these types of situations and just the fact that it got to this point and absolutely nothing was done they didn’t even approach the man after insulting me and creating a scene did any of them do ANYTHING not even talk to the man I felt disrespected by my managers. 

TL;DR 
A man screams, insults me, create a scene in front of all the guests and leaves my co worker in the verge of tears and shaking; one of the managers doesn’t even leave the break room to handle the situation and the second manager doesn’t even approach the customer. 

Need advice on how to get the issue of my managers lack of of involvement fixed by the District manager HR or someone. I don’t think this is a job for the General Manager but what do you guys think? Should I just go straight to HR or DM after taking to the GM?and how to approach it since I believe with two on duty someone should have done something.

61,"Ok, loooong post here:

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how do you avoid family you don't want to see but may be stuck bumping into them at family gatherings?

So, first of I have this relative who is just kind of a toxic. All throughout high school she would accumulate a lot of enemies. These enemies of hers weren't always enemies. They always start out as friends and then slowly through some ordeal they become enemies. In fact, she had almost like a little club of girls who just hated her that these girls then became really good friends because of their hatred of her. I'm not even joking. This has been happening with her all throughout her middle and high school years. I, as a relative of her and close in age (we attended the same high school too) my mom encouraged me to be nice and put up with her. so I did.  

Anyways, fast forward ten years later after high school is over with she is now married with a husband and kids. We've been social media friends for about just a few years. Her arguments with her husband can get pretty intense on social media for all to see so I usually just keep on scrolling if I see that stuff. Never paid too much attention to details. 

One day she shared on her wall about how to save money to travel if you would just make a sandwich for lunch and stop buying Starbucks everyday. The meme even some math calculated about saving $300 a month if the person would just make sandwiches to eat for lunch instead of being lazy and going to Starbucks. Some people commented saying they only bring home lunches to work but still can't afford vacation trips. I made a comment that echoed what many people had already wrote that many people don't buy Starbucks daily. Somehow, her husband chimed in under my comment that she (my relative) does go to Starbucks daily. Suddenly, the comments under my comment became this long war of arguments between them and I was the unlucky person who got chosen to get dragged into it. There was a lot of well, so and so said this and said that so therefore you are this according to this person (me). Suddenly, things that her husband wrote represented my opinions without me even uttering anything. It was really awkward. I was so confused. I felted like I was a punching bag for some underlying issue between them. Has this ever happen to anyone before?

The bickering went on for like 2 days on social media. Eventually, it ended when they came to the agreement and conclusion that I was the bad guy. Her husband and, even her sister, stating that my comment \^\^\^ was insensitive &lt;--I'm putting this lightly. I felted like they needed someone to play the bad guy in order to restore their marital peace and whatever underlying issues that was going between their relationship. There was even a few rude insults thrown in about me ""not living in the real world"" to make her feel better and stop the madness. Mind you this is all public on social media where other relatives of mine that is friends with her can see.  

My issue is I would like to avoid everyone of these people (her, her husband, her sister, which is another relative) who I am stuck with as my relative but they attend too many family gatherings. Also, I've been told I'm not the only person they've done this to. They find happiness pointing fingers and blaming others for things that go wrong in their lives to make themselves feel good, so I really don't want much to do with them.

What should I do? How does one avoid toxic family when you may be stuck bumping into them at family gatherings?",28Feb2019,1

70,"When I was 3, my mother died of cancer. My aunt on my mother's side (I'll call her J) became my guardian in case anything ever happened to my dad, and luckily to this day nothing major has. My normal schedule to this day was go to school, get picked up and go to J's house until 5 or so, then get taken home by my dad when he got off work, or by my uncle, J's husband. Throughout my whole life her side of the family pushed me to become a Jehovah's Witness just like them, but I'm happy being catholic with my dad and other family members that I lived with (no offense to anyone who is a JW). They've yelled at my father and I when I was really young and didn't want to attend meetings with them, telling us how I NEEDED to go, how I could never see my mother again in paradise if I didn't listen to what was said in the meetings. I remember one time my cousin (aunt's daughter, I'll call her M) picked me up at my house unannounced and said they were taking me to one of those really important studies held every couple months (sorry I don't remember what they're called), and when I refused to go, M slammed the door behind her as hard as she could. (My dad and I rented a room in a house owned by my mom's other sister and her husband), when my other aunt and uncle heard the door slam, they started talking down to M, telling her that she can't be lashing out her anger on their stuff, she left quietly, but angrily. That was luckily a one time thing, everyone made up days after it happened. My relationship with J has always been good, I see her like a mom I could have had, even though she is dangerously overprotective of me, never letting me play outside with the dogs or anywhere that wasn't the living room, and even though I'm 16 now, she won't let me walk home despite it only being 10 minutes. I can't really blame her for wanting to bubble me though, she's gone through traumatizing accidents with kids before, and one of my mom's last words days before she passed was her begging J to take care of me, it must've been a really big toll on her. My relationship with M has been hit or miss. Sometimes, she's really sweet and helpful, but other times she's rude and hypocritical, I could never tell when she was gonna yell at me for saying something grammatically wrong only for her to make the same mistake a couple minutes later. 

J's side of the family have been nice and caring to me for the most part the whole time I've known them, including M, but in recent years, I've come out as Bi to my family members who aren't on J's side, and the majority of my friends know as well, but **anything** lgbt related is a big no-no to the JW side. I've been told time and time again by M that JW's who have lgbt friends/family must break contact with them, as ""punishment"" for disobeying Jehovah for their selfish needs. I'm almost 18, they're going to expect more from me, they're going to want me to focus more on religion than school, J has told me throughout high school that I should only be in college for two, at most  four years so I can study the bible with them more. I know that if I do come out to them, J will become depressed and won't take it well, she's always seen me like a son, she made a promise to her sister that she would love me like she did, and I don't want to hurt her by leaving. I have a strong feeling that everyone (besides J) could accept it and move on, but they still miss me. On top of all of that, no family members know I have a boyfriend, not even the ones that support me, I feel like it's too risky to tell anyone about it. I wouldn't be in any physical danger if they ever found out, I would probably get yelled at by all of them at most. None of them are bad people, far from it, but when the time does come for me to go to college and make my own decisions, many contrary to their beliefs, I'm going to have to leave them behind and hurt some if not all of them emotionally. I don't want anyone to walk away feeling like they were the problem or anything of the sort, I just want them to be happy, and for me to be happy, with a different religion and whether it's with a boy or a girl. What should I do?

TL; DR: Came out as bi in recent years, when JW side of the family finds out, they're going to shun me, and the one I saw as a mother is going to become heart broken. I don't want to leave any of them and I don't want anyone to become depressed/feel guilty because of me being bi and deciding to be catholic what should I do?",28Feb2019,2

I told him I like him at one point as well which just makes me feel embarrassed and silly for mentioning it because he kind of just brushed over it and never really acknowledged what I said at the time and judging by this comment he clearly doesn’t like me back :3

But yeah I haven’t spoken to him since then and kind of avoided him/ignored him because I’m annoyed. Not even because I have a little crush on him and didn’t like hearing him mention a huge insecurity I have, as a reason not to be attracted to me.

So that’s that I guess haha just wanted to put it out there and get general opinions on it :3 comments welcome even blunt ones

77,"Hello, I'm Portuguese, and I'm going to live in San Francisco for the next 6 months.
I have ceramic braces and I'm concerned about my dental check-up appointments (I should have at least 1 check up every 2 months, making it a total of 3 check ups, or maybe just 2 if I do the last one in Portugal)
Should I do a dental insurance for these 6 months?
Does anyone know how much is a orthodontic check up appointment in the US, or specifically in San Francisco?

78,"I'm getting some windows and frames replaced. It was discovered that one of the frames could not be removed due to in being part of the structure. To solve the problem the builders simply took the windows off the new frame and attached them to the old one which was in fine condition and we wrote the purchase and painting of the new frame off as a loss.

Today I got a bill for $300 for this 'extra work'.

I don't think this was very fair as:

 * The builders probably should have checked the frame when they came in to create a quote in the first place.
 * It seems to me (not a builder) that simply installing new windows is a lot less work than installing new windows *and* new frames.

79,"um.so this is going to be hard. my friend (lets call him bff) is going through a very hard time. At our school, bff is very very VERY popular. He is very funny and I am glad for him to be my friend. There is this girl who always starts drama. Lets call her, crazy.
      Crazy has a giant crush on bff. She has been OBSESSED with bff. Crazy threatened bff by saying ""if you don't date me I am going to hang myself."" And bff got SUPER paranoid. He came to school crying so I talked to bff alone. He wouldnt say anything to me so I let him be. Bff's friend told me how bff has been cutting because he is getting incredibly paranoid about crazy.

Another thing that happened was during the PE class we both had, he threatened me and said “do you want to fight right here and now” angrily and aggressively walking up to me at the end of the class. Can’t he get into any trouble for doing that or is it too late for anything. I also kind of got a similar threat during a different class from someone who is in support of him and someone else, and he basically told me “if you touch any of them, you are dead.” I told my counselor at school that and they only said if it happens again, then tell them.

84,"I’m a 21 year old male in college if that info helps at all. In October of 2017, my girlfriend of nine months at the time and i split up. we were in love, and i know that sounds stupid for such a young age and the time but i was absolutely head over heels for her and i know she was for me as well in the beginning and middle and such. she was my first and only love so far. she decided that she wanted to end things and take care of herself and thought i deserved better and someone who could give me more attention and such. i respected this decision and said i’d always be around if she needed anything. she didn’t have many friends and i didn’t either so the thought of losing my best friend really did terrify me. 

she said she wasn’t looking for love or a relationship or anything but perhaps a week after we split i had seen her on twitter flirting heavily with one dude in particular. i don’t know whatever happened to that guy but i asked her about it when i dropped her stuff off at her apartment to which she replied “it doesn’t matter we aren’t dating anymore” and i agreed and apologized. but it still hurt to think that she had moved on so quickly. it came to a point where i would get panic attacks whenever a post of hers would come across my social media feeds. my mental health took a nose dive into generalized anxiety disorder and depressive disorder with suicidal ideations. i ended up blocking her on everything and eventually deleting all of my social media’s for most of 2018 until july when i needed them for my student organization. though i wouldn’t say my mental health was the best before we split, it certainly didn’t get better, and is now just a bit of a mess. but i don’t blame her for it or anything. that’s not fair to her and her decision.

it’s been a very long time since i’ve contacted her but she still floats around my mind. i’ve had a few close calls with my mental health which have led me to getting serious help now but i still have days with darker thoughts. recently i’ve been feeling as if the reason i still think of her is that i never got proper closure. i just randomly cut off contact and every now and then would get updates on how she was from friends. she’s since graduated and is in grad school across the country. i’m really happy for her and hope she’s doing well, and i always will. i just don’t know if i should reach out to her. i wrote this message to send to her but i wanted to get some advice first. i don’t have many friends, so i thought reddit would be good for this. here’s the message i’ve drafted:

 “hey, so you don’t have to reply to this or anything. you don’t even have to read it if you don’t want to. i don’t even know if this your phone number anymore. this is just some stuff i’ve had on my mind for a fairly long time and just feel like the universe wants me to say it to you. i feel as if i never got closure for everything and it’s been eating away at me. i wanna start by saying thank you for the many lessons you’ve taught me both in our relationship and after the fact on my own. i truly believe that they’ve made me a better person than the one that i used to be. i’ve learned a great deal about myself in the last year and a half or so, and i think one of the things i’ve learned is that i hold on to thoughts for too long and let them stew to the point of them hurting my mental health.

i haven’t been doing too well in the last year and a half but am finally now getting serious help with that after a few episodes of extreme mental weakness. we didn’t end on the best of terms and i wanted to apologize for that as i feel it was my lack of maturity and fear of losing my best friend that resulted in me cutting out many people from contact with me. the idea of getting in any sort of contact with you has terrified me in the past but i’ve been sitting on the idea of this for about a week or so and feel as if it’s something i must do. i was afraid of seeing you or thinking about you at all which led to me first cutting you out from my social media’s until i just deleted them for most of 2018. i was afraid. i’m not sure of what. maybe feeling like i was missing out? i only use social media now because my student org requires me to help run the instagram account.

but that’s not relevant. i just wanted to say that i’m sorry for not being as good of a friend and a person as i could have been after we split. i said that when we decided to end things that i would always be around if you needed anything, and i wasn’t. i don’t hold any resentment towards you and never have and never will, as there isn’t any reason for me to and there never was. you were doing what you had to do for your best interests and i respect that. i hope that you don’t hold any resentment against me as well. i feel like i hold some against myself for not doing more than i could have in the situation, but i was feeling more afraid of the future than anything else at the time. i try to hold on to the mentality now that all things must pass.

i appreciate you being a part of my life, even if it was for a fairly short time. i hope that you are doing well up there in grad school, i’m sure you’re killing it.”

the last two months have been a really tough time for me after a recent hospitalization after a suicide attempt. i’ve been getting serious help recently and while i don’t think this will cure me of anything, i feel as if it may help close the chapter of a rather tough part of my mental health journey. 

what do you think reddit? i’m really sorry for this fucking novel. i’ve just been feeling really anxious about the idea and would love some input. thanks for anything xo",28Feb2019,1

Achieving freedom proves to be challenge for all these characters, causing them suffering and pain that ultimately stops them from chasing their dreams.

This exploded and once people became upset and started talking to each other it turned into a drama tornado. He was exposed to be incredibly unethical, immoral, a liar, you name it... I have serious issues with his actions and handling of the whole situation. Now as a manager I am tasked with cleaning up his mess and trying to put a cork on the rumors.

 Biology so I could then take my MCATs to get into medical school to become a pathologist.

However, I have always had a love for forensics ever since I went to a summer camp that was about forensics. I had so much fun at that camp and loved all the aspects of forensic science. 

Now the time has come to officially tell my college what major I’m perusing and I’m left debating on which one would better suit me. 

My college offers a bachelors for Biology , minor in Biology, bachelors for Forensics, and they have a concentration in Forensics. 

The reason I am debating my original choice of Biology is because it’s a smaller university so they can’t have specialized biology majors, just a general biology. So I would be stuck in zoology and botany etc which I really don’t care about. Whereas, in the forensics program, all of the required courses to get the major are exactly the same courses to get into the closest medical school in my area. And with wanting to be a pathologist, they have forensic pathology that I might want to pursue. 

I just really don’t know... my family says I should stick with biology but my friends and the head of the forensics department suggested that it would be the smartest move to go with forensics (I really couldn’t tell if he was just be completely biased because he is the head of the department). I was thinking of majoring in biology and doing the concentration in forensics but idk if you can do that.

99,"I've wondered if I have depression for quite some time now. A long while back I took tests online and they all said I have mild/moderate depression. I took a few recently and they said the same thing. But when I told my mom and she said we could talk to a therapist a long while back - one, I felt like I had lied and that I was gonna be seen by the therapist as a fraud, and two, my mom ended up saying that since I would tell her things that I might not need one (not that my problems didn't matter enough, she just thought she could help me herself).

Here's some symptoms I have:

Loss of interest in activities and friends

Kind of a loss of appetite (the past two days I've had one but before that I had little appetite for a bit)

Have less energy

Here's where I'm not entirely sure - I'm not constantly sad, and it's not like a feeling of being depressed really, but it's quite a bit where I'm not really happy either. I don't know if it's enough to be depressed though. And I've heard that being depressed doesn't necessarily mean being sad but can mean being numb too, but I'm not sure if that's true

Sleeping too much (on weekends when I don't have an alarm for school)

Feel like a burden and that I bother people. I do tell my friends some stuff but not everything, and I've been telling them less lately, partly cuz they have bigger problems than me. I used to tell my mom everything but I've been telling her less and less lately.

Feel like no one cares, a lot of times I'll talk about something I like or something that bothers me and no one will seem to care, even my best friends sometimes.

Low self esteem, I've always hated myself

I've also hit myself out of frustration but not very often. Last time was a few months ago, and I don't remember the last time before that.

But my mom and friend have legit depression and my other friend has even worse problems, so even though all the stuff I said above is true, I feel like a liar or a baby, that I don't really have any problems.

This has been happening for about a year, but not too consistently either. I've had periods of being really happy, and it gets worse around my period which makes me doubt myself and think I'm just hormonal. I've also had people tell me ""you're happy"" and ""you don't have problems"" when I wasn't feeling happy. So I've got a lot of reasons why I doubt myself and think maybe I don't.

101,"Hey, so...

&amp;#x200B;

(tldr at bottom) 

I'm a dumb teenager and I need some help. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 5 years (8th grade + the entirety of high school, I am a senior graduating soon) and we've had plans to go to the same college together. Our main priority was finding schools that catered to our individual wants first. If we wanted completely different college paths, we would do long distance 

(which is NOT a problem, because the majority of our relationship has been long distance as her family moved around through the course of the relationship. It's not like this is something we're **new** to. we just thought we'd be done with it)

But, we managed to find a school we BOTH love. It's a big school, we're pretty confident in us not breaking up after so long but if for whatever reason we did, we could go about life never seeing each other. 

Well, throughout the course of the year, I've been asking my parents how much money they have saved up for me because the school's real expensive. I told them that I'm **not concerned if they haven't saved much, or even haven't saved at all. I just want to know so I can prepare.** They told me not to worry about it. 

Well, I found out today that we've got basically jack. They didn't want to tell me because they thought I would be over this ""girlfriend school"" idea by now. And, obviously... I'm not. 

I tell my girlfriend and she panics. She tells me that her parents have a LOT saved up for her, and says that she can help me pay through college. Mom says there is absolutely no way we're taking this much money from a family she ""doesn't know very well"". This idea is falling apart. 

I honestly thought *I* was the one invested in this college idea, but at even the suggestion I do community college again my girlfriend sounded like I told her I had killed her puppy.

103,"I graduated May 2018 from college and still am looking for a full time job. I took this seasonal job at an amusement park mid season and was forced into food service. It was due to an emergency due to my post grad internship ended with short notice. Needless to say, I made it work but I refuse to work food service again. I have a BA and am getting certifications in IT.

They are offering me a pretty nice return pay deal, and since the commute is only 15 minutes from my house, is a solid plan b job. I am currently side jobbing for money and have just enough to pay my bills. Depending on my situation in May, it could honestly be a second job due to distance.

Since the park has numerous openings available, I inquired about their IT position. I know for a fact they have one at the park, was told who it was last year. I even saw, the posting for the internships at the park and had IT listed. The HR head (who BTW is my age) told me via email that they do not have an ""official"" IT job but to call him to talk about my return for the summer. I also asked about HR or business oriented job (my minors in college).

I feel they are dodging my calls. Its been almost a week and no response (since HR email), in total I have been back and forth with this company for almost a month. I left 2 voicemails this week (1 with the HR head, the other with the HR phone) and am about to say to heck with it. I am honestly wondering if they just want to place me in food as they feel I will end up leaving anyways. As I am totally overqualified for this place and stick out like a sore thumb (over 21)

I am still looking for IT role and am calling a family friend tomorrow about a job at his company. Hopefully this family friend can start to give me advice on how to handle my situation if the job at his company does not pan out. He is one of the managers in the department. I am also looking forward to more jobs which will be posted in March as Feb been a slow month for my field in my area.

His mom died when he was 9 and his dad died when he was 11 so he was taken in by his relatives and all of them were extremely religious and strict, few years later he moved to America and joined a strict Protestant church, while there he met my mom then I was born.


I made this post because I don’t want to talk to anyone else IRL about this. because I’m afraid they might take it the wrong way. It’s because they way he treats me and the things he tries to teach me I’m starting to question some things about my family, why did it start? is because of the conversation I had with him.

He is like the guy who follows the rules of society like,

-Men should be tough and not cry

-Women should be married and help with the kids.


Those types of rules and every time I try to reveal my emotions he says, “Oh come on, be a man! are you a girl? You can deal with this, kids never get stressed in school just be a normal student and you will be fine. People always fake these type of things so they can get attention.” 

And of course he is very strict about how I worship God, but I don’t really believe in him because if he was real, why did he put me with a person who can’t even be nice to me, The church we go to has these “Stand up” and it’s final thing we do before the ministers dismiss us from the church.

Basically someone who is from the listeners then says a first quote from the Bible, or say something about their strong faith in god, I do these sometimes so that my dad can be at least a little proud of me. My father is a minister as well and now wants me to do these “Stand up” at least once every week, and if I don’t he says some things that kinda hurt me and discourage me. “You see those little kids, they do it every day and you? You can’t even do it once a week!, God is going to be very disappointed in you.” 

His way of punishing me and my siblings includes hitting me with a belt, sandal, plastic coat hanger, and sometimes a wooden spoon, then makes us read the Bible so we can make it up to god.

Now some things about me, I’m 15, currently a freshman in high school, I feel really anxious about school and it’s work I have to do, sometimes when I worry so much about it I go into the shower and cry, or go into my room play a video, then cry, I do not feel comfortable talking about my feelings or anything about myself, I don’t have a lot of friends and we don’t talk a lot.

Now onto the conversation I had with my father that I started thinking about this.

We were getting pizza because my brother stood up and said a quote from the Bible, so as we went to the car and drove he said something to me, 

My Father: Alright listen, you are 15 years old and you are now in high school, and you aren’t even thinking about what you are going to do in your life? You have to start thinking about these things because you only have 3 years left, Don’t you want to get married, and get a job?

Me: Well I have been starting to think about what I want to be but, I think I don’t want to get married when I’m done with high school.

My Father: What!? You have to get married, everyone has to get married, it’s a normal part of life!

Me: that doesn’t mean it has to apply to everyone.

My Father: that doesn’t make sense, do you want to live with us rotting away?

Me: No, there are a lot of people who don’t get married, but they still have a house and a decent job.

My Father: really? That doesn’t make sense what if I died, and your mom died, who will be with you?

Me: Friends, I have a social life you know, you too,

My Father, Oh my god, Friends in America do not help you, they are not family, family is the only thing you have.

Me: Still, I have some friends who will help and support me.

My Father: Support? What do you mean support?

Me: you know, like getting me through hard times just in case just like-

My Father: will they help you when you can’t pay your rent?

Me: No, bu-

My Father: they will not let you in their house, only family will, what if you become old and cannot work anymore? Who are you going to live with?

Me: well I heard something about retirement saves, it’s like you save up for retirement, then when I can’t work anymore, I will use that money to get me through life normally.

My Father: No, you are wrong, people who set that up have no one to stay with, unless if they have family they can stay there without setting that up.

Me: ok, but it’s nice to have a little money on your own.

My Father: The point is, you should get married, you have to baptize, then marry, then you can have children to have more followers of god.

Me: but I don’t want to be married I like being alone.

My Father: oh sweet lord, there is the pizza place let’s go.


I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to talk to anyone because what if they don’t believe me? What if I talked to my counselor and she calls my parents? I can’t do anything about it and I just want to go away,

I’d like to know what people’s thoughts are on this.
I sometimes think I might be bi but in all honestly i don’t know, the reason why I think this is sometimes I do have thoughts about guys (especially friends)

110,"Our school year is having this field trip that is overnight to a place. If the person wants to participate, they have to write an essay and get accepted AND pay the grand total of $300.

I’m in the dilemma of choosing my roommates for this. There is this one girl who’s been my friend for years. She is assuming I am going to room with her along with my two other friends.

Backstory: We’re friends but she’s extremely problematic and uses her problems as a way to excuse herself. For example, she said she was dealing with diabetes when I was asking her why she was being so rude. She also tends to fight a lot and can be quite excluding and a big hypocrite. I really don’t want to be her friend. I also don’t want her to ruin the trip by getting into one of her tantrums, and another thing, she smells bad. None of my other friends want to share a bed with her.

So, I told her that I might room with other people. Naturally, she got mad and is acting up. 

She really has no one else to room with, so if I decide to room with her it’d be out of pity, she’d probably ruin the night, and someone would have to sleep on the floor since she kinda smells. She’s also really loud. I don’t want to waste $300 just out of pitying.

I really don’t want to room with her.

Should I room with her or not?",28Feb2019,1

116,"I don’t know how I screwed up, but if this were a casual normal friendship I would either break it off or just ask her out on a date. At one moment she’ll be really flirty, then aloof, then attentive.  We see each other at least once every week and always make plans together. It only us 99% of the time going out, on what I would usually call a date.  We’ve both dated while we’ve known each other but always spent a lot of time together.

I’ve stopped looking for signs or trying to interpret things, a long time ago. I thought we were just goodish friends. I just sorta tried to drift away but she always reached out to me.

Over the last 4 months, things have gotten weird. She asked me to go on vacation with her, keeps talking about our future together, and spending more time together. She is not a touchy feels person and I always thought she was sorta detached from feeling, so this was an abrupt change.

But now she’s such an important part of my psyche that I know losing her would really screw me up.

The other day we just went out and when I went to say goodbye she gave me a head-chest but hug and ran off. I’ve tried to talk about how I feel but, then pull back because she didn’t have an out.

But I’m worried about screwing up when we go on this trip. Last week she said we can stay at a particular boutique hotel, and winked at me. Both of us said we’d share a room, but she knows full well this expensive hotel only has 1 bed per room, so we’re sharing a bed...I know landing lights but like wtf.  I had already thought we’re friends, end of story, I like her a lot but have tried to suppress any attraction to her.

I’m worried that if I don’t do anything ], the friendship will crumble. I’m more of a talker, and at this point I feel I have to ask, can I make a move? Even though she’s super confident, she never makes advances with people.

TL;DR: I think my friend wants to add sex to our friendship, we’re practically dating right now, not that I care.  I enjoy every moment with her, even the awkward ones.  I feel that if I don’t do something, she’ll just pull away.  Should I talk or just make a move because she’s more of a physical person.",28Feb2019,1

119,"Hello,

I am going to be moving to a small town in northern Alberta at the end of April and I am not sure how to keep myself busy. This town has just over 200 people living within it. I currently live in one of the biggest cities in my province and have never lived anywhere smaller than 800000 people in my life so I am used to constantly having people and groups around me, additionally for the first time in my life I will not be taking part in any form of education so I will have a lot of time on my hands when I am not at work. 

I find that I struggle to make new friends and bond with people even in the city  and I struggle with feelings of loneliness as is. I was wondering what strategies those of you that live in or have lived in areas like this have used to keep themselves busy.

120," I'm posting this with my backup account for more anonymity. Sorry if this post is a bit of a train wreck, my head is all over the place. 

My husband is a Veteran who suffers from mild-moderate PTSD. We have been together for 10 years and have 4 children. I am a Stay at Home Mom as it is more affordable than the cost of daycare/aftercare. 

Last month, my husband got fired for the second time in a year due to lack of concentration and mood swings which were affecting his job performance significantly. He sees a therapist regularly who has recommended medication but so far my husband has refused to go down that route.

We live near my (small) family, but about 6 states away from his. They live in a very economically depressed area with not a lot of good job opportunities. Right now, we live in a major metro that is relatively affordable.

For the past week, he has been saying he doesn't want to work ever again and that he wants to live in his parents (unfinished, no bathroom) basement. He's 35 years old. The most bizarre part is that his parents seem to think that's a great idea. He alone could live on his partial VA Disability but it wouldn't be enough to support a whole family. His parents couldn't support him financially either. 

Now, he's saying I must not really love him because I don't support his desire to leave to go live in a cold basement in the backwoods miles away from anywhere indefinitely. 

I'm desperately trying to figure out how I would make it if he up and left, and how I could manage to support our kids and I on my own. I've got a college degree but it may as well be in basket making. I had planned on going back for something else when the kids were all in school but it may have to be sooner rather than later. I haven't worked in years and the most I've done is admin/reception type work (which doesn't pay well).

My husband has been the sole breadwinner up to this point (since we started having children), as he isn't emotionally up to being a SAHD and is very hands off as a parent. 

I just don't know what to even do at this point. Tell him to go, have a nice life and then attempt to support myself and Kids? Tell him we will all come with and live in that foresaken place in the basement? Beg him to stay and pray he gets a job soon?

In my entirely non professional opinion I feel that he should be on some kind of anti depressants but respect his decision not to be. I also think his emotional problems run deeper than *just* PTSD and he has certainly got worse over the years. 

Anyway, I just needed to get all of that off my chest. Thank you all in advance for ""listening"".  Any advice or wisdom would be welcome.",28Feb2019,2
121,"Hi for some background i had a crush on this guy for a couple months. A little later after my birthday  (we were born 2 days apart) i told him i had a crush on him. He liked me to so we started dating.

We were together (during school) for 4 and a half years. Last school year i had to change schools and we stooped talking to each other. We would talk every now and then like we usually did but it wasnt frequent. Over the summer we officials broke up. We both liked each other but since we didnt see each other we decided to stop. Even though we broke up we talked to each other. Honestly after we broke up we talked a lot more then we did before.

Yesterday i was playing with him on X box and we were talking casually and he mentions that he likes a girl who's similar to me. When he saif that i felt empty. I thought i was over him but hearing that really hurt, and I realised i still had felling for him. I didnt tell him anything. I want to get over him but i cant. We played for a little bit more then we stooped. 

I wonder if I should tell him or try to get over him. Not talking to him wouldnt work..i just cant.. hes a great friend and person who always supported me.

124,"video games have been the entertainment source of my life. Since I was 6-7 to present day I've enjoyed them and had great times, with great memories. I personally believe I've always kept them ""within personal control"", and have had a diverse life experience outside of them. Now in college, nearing the end of freshmen year I still find myself playing a hour of games before I sleep. As said previously, I don't watch tv any other entertainment type, primarilly its just games. The pressure to become more competitive in academics is always apparent, and even though I realize I've had great times, the growing amount of hours makes me wonder if I should have spent this time forcing myself to do something more beneficial, i suppose, like reading, of which on a side note i have tried previously, just a month of only reading as entertainment. In addition to this conflict of desires, the knowledge of my parent's disapproval of this behavior, while I dont value their input very largely, lingers as an additional conflict. I've achieved alot outside of the relm of games, consistant A's in academics, 200+ paintings and even more drawings, but still, the conflict lingers. Therefore, should I quit enjoying video games?

127,"Hey, all. Also posted this in r/relationship_advice but want to cast as wide a net and get as many opinions and advice as to what the hell happened as possible. Warning in advance: this is gonna be a loooooong one, but the length is necessary for it all to make any kind of sense.

Background on me: I’m a 32 year old male and live in a major city in the Northeastern U.S. I’ve recently come to accept that I have suffered from intense depression and anxiety for well over a decade but have seldom acknowledged it or attempted to treat it, despite its demonstrably deleterious effects on my life. This will be important later.

I’ve only ever had one long term girlfriend of two and a half years, and we split up almost nine years ago, when I was 23. Since then, I’ve drifted from casual relationship to casual relationship, and a ton of first dates that went exactly nowhere, and long stretches where I didn’t bother with dating at all. A couple of women captured my attention but never enough to inspire me to fully commit and pursue them. That is, until I met Liz.

I met Liz here on Reddit, in one of the pen-pal subs. It was a lonely Saturday night in August of 2017. I learned she was 24 (so seven years younger than me) and lived in the southern U.S. We moved our conversation to another platform and quickly realized shared the same sense of humor and appreciation for classic rock. We exchanged photos (nothing sexual) and I was taken by how gorgeous she was. We chatted late into the night. By the time I fell asleep, I knew I needed to speak to her again as soon as humanly possible.

Checking her Reddit the next day, I discovered, much to my horror, that she was married. Devastated, I asked her about this and she confirmed yes, she was married, but rather unhappily, as it turned out. We initiated a long-distance friendship anyway. Phone calls and FaceTime chats confirmed her to be exactly who she presented herself as, which was a tremendous relief. We became intensely close and long conversations became the norm for us. We both shared our individual travails with mental illness. I listened to her talk about the problems with her failing marriage and offered as much advice as I could to help talk her out of what sounded like a rotten situation. There was a lot of fun and laughing too; talking about our respective days, our crazy families, pop culture stuff we loved and hated. I had never met someone who “got me” as much as Liz, and she told me the exact same. After a little while, she was talking to me more than she was talking to her husband. Frankly, I didn’t care. We were already falling for each other. She even sent me a birthday gift a month after we started talking.

In November of 2017, Liz and her husband moved into their first house. He did not yet know of my existence. Overcome with guilt, Liz decided we couldn’t speak anymore. I was shattered. This end was brief, as we began communicating again a week or so later. Liz cared too much about me to just forget and ignore, and I was relieved she was back. We decided it was finally time to meet in person. She would fly to me on a weekend and then back home in time for work on Monday. I was apprehensive and freaked out about impressing her (I’m pretty broke and was concerned I couldn’t show her a good time) but she didn’t care about any of that. She just wanted to spend time with me.

Liz flew to my city in December of ’17. We’d been speaking for only four months. It was her first time ever being here and we spent the entire weekend together, me showing her the sights. She even met my family. It was during that visit that we first kissed, and had sex, and realized we were completely in love. But she wasn’t ready to leave her husband. My memory here is slightly hazy, but I remember he found out about us around this time. He was pretty pissed, but nothing major happened.

Enter 2018. Liz and I continue voice and video chatting using alternate means that her husband was unable to track (Kik and Skype). She frequently expressed intense guilt about deceiving him but loved me with such an intensity she had never experienced before. She was deeply unhappy in the marriage but so hesitant about leaving and throwing her life into chaos. There was another brief period where she stepped away out of guilt, but she came back again because we simply could not pull out of each other’s orbits. We were completely keyed into each other. But remember the mental illness I wrote about earlier? Liz had been imploring me to let her help me to find more professional help for what I was dealing with. I was so deep in the hole that it had become my home, and it blinded me. Kept me distant from all the things I really wanted in life. This had always been the case, and as much as I loved Liz, I was terrified by all the work her love would inspire me to do; I’d have to do to claw myself back into the world and I did not see myself fit for the challenge. I kept promising to get help, never following through, always trying to deal with it myself because I was petrified of revealing the extent of my illness to my family (we don’t really “do emotions” in my family). I thought I could talk myself out of it. Sometimes I even succeeded. It grated on Liz when I would lose myself, but we were still there for each other when our respective mental illnesses got the better of us.

Liz and I visited in person again last May, this time in her city, while her husband was on a business trip. She paid for my airfare and put me up at her mom’s apartment (she was also out of time at this time). We spent the entire time together. I pushed through a hellacious fear of flying to make it happen, but I had to see her. Nothing was going to keep me from her. We spent four days together down there, and Liz was distraught by the end, wondering when we were ever going to see each other again. Quite wrongly, I tried to “be a man” and serve as a stoic pillar of strength for her. I hate that I did that. I was as torn up and uncertain of the future as she was. Of course, her husband figured it was me who had come down to see Liz (not just “a friend” as she had told him), but the marriage shambled along like a zombie, deteriorating and rotting but never actually dying. Nothing changed.

We attempted another break that summer, but by now you know how well that worked out. My depression/anxiety continued to eat away at me and Liz threatened to leave if I couldn’t enter treatment. I promised her I’d get better but I could never find the bravery to open up to my family. Surely I could finally find the magic words, some archaic incantation, to talk myself out of it and avoid shame and embarrassment! Liz hung around, and we had our good days and our bad days. She went back to school in the fall to finish herdegree, and with this and her persistently shitty marriage neither her nor her husband seemed to be able to leave, her own life became highly stressful, but we continued to remain as close as we could in kind of a “holding pattern.”

In September, Liz asked me what I thought about moving down to live with her, if she got herself out of her marriage. Me being me, I freaked out and instinctively said no. The hole was home, remember? I’m too stupid and helpless to do something like move to a completely unfamiliar part of the country! I didn’t want to say no. My brain was screaming “YES! YES! YES!” through the frantic cacophony of my anxiety. The damage was done; Liz rightly interpreted this as a rejection of her. I knew how wrong I was but I was so terrified by the idea that I reflexively ran from it. I spent days and weeks breaking myself down to remove the fear, and told her how wrong I was, how I wanted to do it. Things settled down, but Liz hangs on to that initial rejection to this day. I can’t blame her for being wounded.

In October, her husband caught her talking to me via Skype. He flipped his shit and Liz once again terminated contact. I was already beginning to feel numb to it by now, almost expecting it to happen, but it neverfailed to obliterate my heart when it did. You already know what happened next. The holding pattern continued, then she started spending more time trying to buckle down and be “the good wife.” Our communication became dramatically limited but we would occasionally chat about how much we missed each other. She had planned a trip here with her mother and cousin which was due to happen in January, and we both dreaded it because we didn’t quite know what to do with each other at this point.

Liz did come here in January. We met and spent a lot of time together, and our love was reaffirmed. She told me her marriage had finally collapsed during Christmas and she was unofficially separated from her husband. She ended the trip with a promise not to leave my life again, and there was optimism that we could finally move forward with her marriage out of the way.

When she got home, she texted me that she suddenly realized she “couldn’t do it” (be with me), how deeply unhappy she was, how she wanted to be alone, etc. All these doom and gloom ideas. Communication fell off for a little while. I entered into a dark and painful period of depression wherein I kept trying to force myself to seek therapy, having finally accepted this was bigger than me and I couldn’t do it myself.

Liz and her husband officially separated early this month. And this is when it all comes back to Reddit.

I stalked Liz’s Reddit account one night, a week ago. I hadn’t heard from her in a few days and was worried. I wanted to see if maybe she’d been active on here. My world ended. I discovered she had met another man on r/r4r only a couple of months ago, and they've already made plans to meet up, entirely behind my back. I confronted her about it, and she came clean. She said she was afraid to tell me because of how devastated I’d be but had planned to do so when she “could explain it better.” She told me she could not wait anymore for me to get better. In a flash of suicidal ideation, my defenses broke and I finally admitted what I’ve been going through for years to my dad and my brother. They’ve actually been extremely helpful and supportive. I’m already wait-listed at two mental health centers.

Liz doesn’t want to hear anything about it, though. She’s told me she’s heard it all from me before, after all the help I refused from her. She doesn’t believe this time is any different, but it is, because her betrayal and selfishness decimated my world and my hopes for the future. The thing about Liz is she was the first person in nine years to make me believe I could be a good person, that I could have a future, that maybe I did deserve to be happy. And I wanted it to be with her. She’s the first woman I’ve ever actually loved and wanted to climb out of the hole for. Now she’s barely responding to my e-mails as she continues at school and the divorce gets underway.

In January, she looked me in the eye and told me she loved me. It wasn’t until after she left here that she “realized I was never going to change.” Does that all disappear in a month? Is this completely my fault, as I suspect? Was I only being used by Liz to help her leave her marriage, as my friends and family suggest? Was it all a lie, or was it something beautiful and pure that I destroyed because depression closed its grip too tightly around my neck and I was too stubborn and prideful to ask for/accept help?

Somebody please help me gain some insight and perspective here. I’m in desperate need of it. Thank you for reading.

tl:dr: Met a married woman here on Reddit a year and a half ago, we fell madly in love, we’ve met in person three times, but I could never bring myself to get the help for depression that she offered/wanted me to get. Now that she is finally divorcing her husband, I’ve discovered she’s already been carrying on with another Reddit dude behind my back and already made plans to meet him without telling me. Please refer to the last paragraph for my questions/concerns. Thanks again for reading!",28Feb2019,2
128,"I was 18 years old, and I had moved on my own to a city far from family for college. I threw a party in my apartment with my so called friends at the time. My friends girlfriend brought a friend over and I was very drunk by this time, and she was pretty attractive and came over and started talking to me. I was more interested in just chilling with my friends on the porch and she seemed to notice that, and I remember her literally yanking my arm and dragging me off to some bedroom as everyone was cheering and egging it on. I was so drunk I can’t collectively remember all of what happened. I think I blacked out.

  But I remember that one moment we were standing in the room and the next moment she was undressing me aggressively. I wasn’t into it. But she was strong for how thin she was and kept pushing me onto the bed. Sober me would have fought harder, but I was blackout wasted. 

   I remember her getting mad because I couldn’t get an erection. And I kept saying I need a condom please let me up so I can get the condom. Finally she did and I got it on and she pushed me on the bed and tried having sexual with me but I still couldn’t get an erection. So she ripped the condom off and started working me and then had sex with me. I remember being upset and afraid and embarrassed, and I woke up the next day and wouldn’t leave my room the entire day. 
  She was gone by the time I woke up but she left behind a bloody tampon. 

I was angry at my friends and they called me a “pussy” and tried to laugh it off. They said I was lucky.

I was very scarred by this experience. I left college a few weeks later. I moved back home and completely ghosted my former friends. 

That was 7 years ago now. I haven’t had sex or been in a relationship since. I have also become very introverted and have developed really bad anxiety. I’m a shell of the person that I used to be. I haven’t been able to discuss this with anyone because I’m so embarrassed about it. 
    I found the girl on Facebook recently and she died a few years ago. I don’t know why. People never say why on Facebook, you just see a bunch of RIP posts. But I wanted to confront her about what happened. I don’t know if that would have made it better or not. But now I feel like I’ll never get closure. And I feel like there’s a stigma because I’m a man? I feel like I won’t be taken seriously. I feel so depressed and even sick, physically sick. My health has declined a lot the last couple of years. I think it’s because of stress and anxiety and depression. And it all stems from that night. 

I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but it’s how I feel. And I feel broken and used and lost. And I don’t think I’ll ever recover. I needed to vent and I needed to say it, I have never spoken about this ever before. Ever. 

**TLDR** When I was 18 I got raped by a girl at a party, my friends made me feel worthless for bringing it up, and now 7 years later I feel mentally and physically broken and completely alone in life and I can’t confront the girl about it because she apparently died a few years ago. I’m so depressed and disgusted and embarrassed. I don’t know how to move on. I don’t know why it’s hitting me particularly hard today. ",28Feb2019,20
129,"I'm conducting a documentary project for my school, and I partnered up with someone record this video, but recently, this person has been trying to manipulate my entire project.

I really lost my trust in her after she went behind my back and started to interview and record students on her own without telling me anything, when she is simply supposed to be helping me edit the documentary.

130,"Yeah, basically my title. One of my instructors asked why I was struggling in school, basically prying into my life. I was a little annoyed but didn't think much of it, told her I work on the weekends, etc. I'm also taking medicine for TB that I've received an xray for and am not contagious for, which makes me very tired. After her nagging me about potential reasons why I wasn't doing well, I said my medication for TB was making me tired. She immediately began e-mailing the school, and the next day I had over 30 emails from administrators and other faculty members asking to meet with me and discuss my ""condition"".

WTF??? My doctor told me I am NOT contagious, and that I am free to go to school. Did she have any right to do this? Is there any repercussions? I am embarrassed and distraught over this. She's my nursing instructor (I'm in nursing school), and is an RN. I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure if she was within her legal rights to do so. Is there anything I can do? Legally?

132,"So, my best guy friend (we’ll call him Allen)and I dated once while my current boyfriend and I were broken up. It never really amounted to much, and we broke up in under a month, after which I got back with my current boyfriend (we’ll him call Jake). So fast forward to now, about two years after all of that happened. Allen and I became friends again a while back, and we would hang out occasionally, but he began flirting with me and even said that he’d bang me if given the chance. Obviously this made me uncomfortable, but I have very bad social anxiety and I didn’t want to make a scene, so I didn’t really mention it. However, I did tell Jake, who was furious with him and asked me to stop hanging out with him. So I did. And for a while after that, things cooled down, and Allen didn’t text me as much. He and I eventually began talking again, and this time he wasn’t flirting with me or saying anything inappropriate, so I took it as a good sign and tried to become friends with him again. And then, the cycle essentially repeated, but this time he didn’t say anything inappropriate or sexual. However, flirting is flirting and that’s still not something he should be doing. So, I tell Jake. Jake gets mad, and starts to blame me for it too, which I suppose is fair. I haven’t exactly stood up for myself or anything, even though I know what Allen is doing is wrong. Jake and I reached a breaking point a few nights ago, and I ended up cutting Allen off with a message that essentially said “I’m sorry, thanks for being my friend, but bye.” Allen is very hurt and upset, saying that I was his best friend, and claims to not understand what he did wrong, but Jake is adamant and says he knows exactly what he did, and just won’t admit it. But, I still feel guilty. I know that I can’t control what Allen did, but I feel like I could’ve somehow prevented this if I stood up for myself more. I just feel like all of this is completely my fault, I guess, and I’m not sure what to do. And I feel bad that Allen feels hurt, and I also feel bad that this ended up hurting my relationship with Jake. Allen isn’t a bad person, and was a good and caring friend, but that doesn’t excuse his actions. I don’t want to betray my boyfriend or hurt him in any way by letting Allen back into my life, but I feel awful that I cut Allen out basically out of the blue. I just feel really confused and guilty right now, I guess. I just don’t know what my next steps should be in any of this. Did I end up doing the right thing?

Tl;dr: Guy friend flirted with me knowing I have a boyfriend. Ended up ending the friendship, but I feel slightly guilty about hurting his feelings. What do I do now?

For extra context, all of us are still in high school, and I’ve never had to deal with anything like this before. Does this happen a lot?",28Feb2019,1

137,"Sorry, this is longer than expected, and apologies for mobile formatting. Here we go:

I (18m) plan to take a year off after highschool before uni. As stated above, I plan on taking a working holiday in Australia from the US, and afterwards attending uni, also in Australia presuming I don't hate life there.

I have several reasons for doing so, namely saving/learning money and mental state. I'll start with the first part of that: My family falls in the US wage bracket wherein I don't qualify for any substantial aid, and due to my parent's poor spending habits (Together they make low six-figures, yet we live as if we had less than a third that and have virtually no savings) I will be paying my tuition no matter what. For that reason, I feel that I need real life experience to learn finances, and the true value of a dollar.

I am aware that working part-time and putting myself through community college would be the most economical option, but I don't know if I can stand two or more years in this area (Living in the actual middle of nowhere, as in, that's literally my town's official motto). I am barely forcing myself to get good grades and fortunately got a great ACT score, so that I can be eligible for as many scholarships as possible when I get there. It is my plan, therefore, to get the move done and work full time to save money, while still experiencing new things and overall getting in a better place mentally.

I do already have my own savings totalling around $6,500 AUD, so I will have a few month buffer for job finding and inevitable expat must-do-the-things for a short time, and have done the budgets to make sure it's feasible.

Tl;Dr: I want to move abroad to the same country I wish to attend uni, so I can get a fresh start while saving money for a year. Is this a terrible idea that could ruin my academic future, or could this work out for the better?",28Feb2019,1
138,"This is just oil and water situation. It just sort of shitty when both of us are feeling shitty at the same time. Just different issue. Whenever it happened, we tend to take down our profile picture, sending message to others that we need private time. And we are both good friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I am torn, anxious, and scared. Relapse real hard. But I still attempted to reach out to my friend, wanting to make sure that they are doing okay, letting them know they are still there. I received no reply. I personally can't judge my friend for that, if they need some space to recover themselves, I am perfectly fine with it. Even if my anxiety is not taking it well, I was still able to hold it off and wanted to give them some space that they need. But things escalated, and I am now no longer sure if this is just my anxiety talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, they are talking to some others just fine. Just a few people online, really. I am not sure if these people are close to them or not. But since I saw my friend making small talk about some of their interest, I tried to make small talk as well. But I was ignored. They like short stories, so I wrote them a prompt as they requested me several weeks ago. Ignored as well. So I just stop talking and went back to liking their feed as always. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I really just wanted to know and do some self-reflecting of what I did wrong. Maybe it was because of the negative tweets that I posted up, blaming the world, blaming everything for ignoring me, expressing my bitterness that my anxiety caused me to feel. What if my friend seen it and misunderstood it that it was directed at them because they were ignoring me for needing their space? Was it my fault again? They haven't unfriended me or unfollow me on social media, that's a surprise. Doesn't mean they can't mute my feed but...you know...

&amp;#x200B;

Now that they returned to put their profile up again, they still haven't talk to me. I am aware just because they return, doesn't mean they are ready to talk. But I am just torn. I don't know what to do. My head keeps spinning, wondering why I was ignored. I know it's my fault, I can't in no way judge or fault my friend. I believe in helping people and continue to reach out to them once in a while to let them know I am still there. But at this point, I just feel like going against my own belief because rejection just caused me so much pain. Anxiety just 100x making it worse. I feel like cutting them off completely as friend, but wouldn't that just make me an asshole for giving up on a friend because they aren't responding due to their depression? If that happened to me, I wouldn't want that. I want to be patient with my friend, but there's something lingering, saying that I was no longer wanted around.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I continue to reach out at the moment? Maybe once a week? Or just not do it at all and let time solve itself?

When I moved in, she said it would be $120 pw including power. Now here's the thing, because she doesn't receive any of my rent money, nothing is going to her to help cover household expenses or wear and tear. Although we didn't agree to household expenses at the beginning, I am happy to pay them now that the subject has come up. What I feel uneasy about is also contributing for wear and tear of items, because she is not willing to allow space for me to keep my own stuff. So I literally have no choice but to use her stuff. I'd rather hsve a choice in the matter and buy some of my own things. So at the moment, I am only willing to chip in towards expenses.

145,"I'm sorry in advance for how long this post is. I'm not good with making long stories short. Earlier this week a woman who I've been crazy about for years has come back into my life and I'm not sure how to handle it. She just got out of a relationship not long ago and has told me that she is just wanting to be friends which I completely understand. We live roughly 5 hours apart and have only met physically one time back in 2016 and since then I've been head over heels in love with this beautiful woman and back then I was under the impression that the feeling was mutual. We had talked a lot online before we actually met in person (4ish years on and off) and the time we spent together was nothing short of perfect. This woman knew that I loved her and after we met and ended up making love she told me she loved me too and apologized for taking so long to say it. I thought my life was finally complete. We spent that night together but the next day she was starting her college classes up again. I took her to school and shortly after I drove back home with the biggest smile on my face. The following few months were amazing but out of nowhere things started to change. She told me that we should stop saying I love you to each other and just act like friends. I was sad but I understood because she was busy with school and at the time I was working full time overnights. She then began to slowly distance herself from me and it got to the point where I wouldn't hear from her for over a week (mind you we had been talking everyday for 4ish months at this point.) I didn't want to give up hope and would still continue to message her everyday regardless just so she could see that I'm still for her and that she still meant everything to me. Eventually I got to the point where I was sick of being ignored and had done something that I would regret doing after it was done..I messaged her off a fake phone number from a texting app and shortly after sending the first message she responded (though she never responded to any of my messages) and asked me who I was. I told her to guess and she asked if I was Brandon (I'm not Brandon) She ended up finding out it was me and went off on me which I probably deserved. Mind you that I'm not a very social person and she was pretty much the only person I talked to. She ended up telling me that it wasn't her fault nor her problem that I had no friends and when I asked if she still wanted to be friends she said she did until I turned into an asshole..that was almost 3 years ago and although we had an ugly falling out, I never stopped loving her the way I did back then and she's well aware of that. I'm thankful to be back in her life but I don't know what to do. She says that she's changed since then and isn't as talkative as she used to be. I want to pour my heart and soul out to her but that would just complicate things and I can't stand the thought of her not being in my life again. What should I do? I'm sorry again that this is so long. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",28Feb2019,2
146,"I’m wondering if I did the right thing.

My girlfriend (26) drinks at least a 750ml bottle of tequila a day.Yesterday I told her parents and suggested they find an inpatient facility to help her detox and recover. She drinks so much, I really don’t believe she can quit without detoxing. She’s tried but succumbs to the shakes.

Fortunately her uncle was a drug and alcohol counselor for several years and he was able to come over and help form a plan. They are planning have an intervention with her on Saturday and offer/ take her to a 30 day detox facility. They had no idea of the level of her alcoholism, aside from the change in behavior over the last few years.

We’ve been seeing each other for 6 months. At first I knew she drank, but not to this extent. She is unable to pay rent, fix her car, or have money to do much of anything . She works full time as a hostess at a restaurant/brewery. I am basically providing for her financially.

I feel guilty for going behind her back and speaking with her parents after she repeatedly said not to. She is an only child, and says she doesn’t want to disappoint them. I nowbelieve this was an attempt to keep hiding her alcoholism. I truly believe that she will drink herself to death or kill someone in an accident if this behavior continued.

The girlfriend and I have spoken about getting her help, so I know there is a recognition of her problem. She has seemed willing, but between insurance, a lack of money, and her addiction, nothing has come of it.

I just worry she won’t go if surprised by her parents, but I also don’t want to have to tell her prior to their plan and create an entire series of additional stress/ events.

148,"I’m a junior and currently, my physics class is the worst class I’ve ever had in my life. 

For a bit of context, the teacher is horrible, anytime a question is asked he always answers incorrectly or incredibly vaguely. He barely teaches, or at least teaches very poorly. The class work consists of worksheets, and just about only worksheets. And we’re expected to print each and every single one out of our own pocket. 

These worksheets are very vague and have ridiculous questions at time, (e.g. why is the number part in seconds larger than minutes when converting from minutes to seconds?). His “teaching style” is for us to work in groups of 3-4 and solve every problem in every worksheet using a whiteboard and assign roles, (recorder, manager, speaker). No one does the work in groups because the work usually just doesn’t work that way. 

On top of these worksheets, we’re given a new assignment to make a 4-6 minute video on how any technology uses kinematics, explain it, and explain its impact on society and the environment.

The classroom environment is just not a healthy one and I can’t stand it. Unfortunately, engineering is one of my potential future careers and I feel like I need to take this course in order to have a career. My other option is in commerce, (accounting or finance), but I’ve only ever taken one business course freshman year and have not taken an accounting course. 

I’m talented in math, I’ve always done very well but the teacher just ruins any motivation to make an effort. There’s only one other teacher that teaches physics and from what I hear, her teaching is completely different, however it’s very tough. It’s also very unlikely I’m able to switch into her class.

TL;DR: Teacher is horrible at teaching and ruins the classroom environment. I’m losing all motivation to continue in my physics class but feel stuck since I might want to pursue a career in engineering. Only other option is to go into commerce (accounting/finance) but never taken any business courses past freshman year.

150,"Hello everyone! First off let me say thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Now into the meat of it. I'm a 20 y/o Highschool dropout currently working for my GED. I'm on and off with a job for my ex step dad where I get paid pretty well for the work we do (carpentry, compensation based on project pay) 

I don't really hate what I do, I'm not very good at it, but I'm still learning. Overall things are going quite well for me. Now obviously this wouldn't be a post without an imposing main point to counteract the good shit. 

I have little to no motivation to do anything. I feel worthless most of the time and even when I KNOW I can do something and probably should, I refuse to do it. 
I can't seem to find what motivates me. I haven't really talked to anyone about as I'm uncomfortable around most of my family and friends about subject like this. 

There are things I love doing, like playing games, dancing, and just being me. I can't make money of these things however (or at least not now) and that kind if prohibits my actions. Money doesn't really motivate me, getting things I want rarely motivates me. I feel like I've fallen into this cycle; Wake up, barely make it through the day, sleep, repeat. I fucking hate it.

I will say though I have an astounding amount of bravado, or confidence depending on how you look at it. I'm really charismatic and can get something done realiably by myself if need be. The issue is again, I can't bring myself to do these things. 

I've never been coddled as a child. We never really had the money to always have the things we wanted or needed. If I had something it's either because I worked for it or the planets aligned and my parents or grandparents were kind enough to gift it to me. (I also have a but of spending issue. I tend to spend money I should be saving despite knowing I should save it) 

Overall it just kinda sucks. I want to enjoy my life and live at least comfortably, but I just lack the motivation to move on and get things done. I'd rather just do other things besides what I should be doing. This is just one of a myriad of reasons why I just can't seem to enjoy life. I just don't have a clue how to handle myself, but on the other hand I give a lot of advice to my friends. Really good advice too that I can't follow for myself.

I have a decent amount of friends and am currently trying to land a relationship with this one girl (here's hoping). 

All in all, I would just like some advice. I've tried a lot if things that I've read online or have been suggested by others in off topic conversations. I don't know how to get out of this rut. Sometimes I fear it'll always be like this, and I won't lie I've cried myself to sleep a few times thinking about how this will ruin my life. Yet, it never changes. I just lack motivation and I don't know how to retain it.

152,"This has happened too many times and I have tried to ignore it as well as talk to her. For context, I’m 18, the youngest. My brother is in his mid twenties. 

We have responsibilities obviously. The girls help out cleaning the house, taking our dog for a walk, things like that. I have no problem with doing anything because my mom does do most of the work plus we’re her kids. What I have a problem is with the fact that my brother ends up doing none of his shit and we have to do it in the end. He stays out all day and rarely comes home. That is just annoying and inconvenient but there’s more. 

He has the responsibility of bringing dog food and taking Lisa (our dog) to the vet. He always delays it and we’ve learnt to hide a few cans so Lisa doesn’t go hungry. He is straight up ok with neglecting our dog that HE wanted to adopt (we had no say in the matter) irresponsibly. Lisa has health issues and is very expensive because of vet bills. I love Lisa and wouldn’t change a thing, but it is extremely irritating that my brother adopted this poor baby bc she is cute, and would probably be neglected if it wasn’t for everyone else. We were straight up told to shut the fuck up at the shelter when we gave any suggestion. 

i told him to take Lisa to the vet for the check ups. Mom and he were making cracking dumb jokes and my mom was like “he’ll do it” even though he’s been delaying it for weeks. He started changing the topic and I overreacted by yelling. Mom got angry at me and told him “do it so she’ll shut up”. And he was like “why do you overreact so much?” This isn’t a first time. Whenever he does something wrong or irresponsible that might affect someone or everyone in the house, you can’t call him out bc “he’ll do it eventually”. 

Whenever I do something it becomes a big deal and the hot topic of the day. I shut myself up in my room because of anxiety and stress, but that’s the Big Problem. 

That made me even madder and I left the conversation. I was going to apologize for raising my voice but honestly it feels like she favours him too much and doesn’t deserve my apology. She doesn’t take us feeling discriminated seriously and I don’t want to take her seriously anymore. ",28Feb2019,3
153,"So I had two best friends since high school and college. We would talk basically every day and hang out a lot for like 5 or 6 years. About a year ago they both kinda stopped talking to me all of a sudden. I would ask them to do something, they’d say they were busy with work or something then I see them on Snapchat with other people. I was pretty mad for a while but I got over it and decided not to talk to them anymore.  

We have watched every season of game of thrones together, like every episode and we would always watch it at my house because I had a decent TV and like a movie room set up. So fast forward to now, they text me like “can we come over and rewatch season 7 and watch 8 at your house?” I dont wanna just say fuck off, they were good friends for a long time but it seems that they’re only contacting me for my movie room.

161,"Listen I (18f) am in some real shit. I’ve been disassociated on/off (mostly on) for the last three years. if you don’t know what that means look it up because I don’t think I can articulate all that right now. Over the summer I had a manic episode (due to my meds) and somehow (I know how it’s just a sensitive subject) ended up +$6,000 in debt. I work a minimum wage job and cannot pay my bills. I grew up in an abusive household and still live with my abusers. I’ve FINALLY started getting some of my personality back. I’ve made a couple friends and gone on a couple dates. All of this makes me feel good until I remember I’m out of school, thousands in debt, and working a shitty minimum wage job. The debt and the inability to pay it off on top of still living with my abusers REALLY fucks with my mental health. It makes it nearly impossible to enjoy any slight progress I’m making. 

sooooo here’s the thing:

This “purchase” that I made that put me in debt was made when I was under 18. I had to get someone else (one of my abusers) to put their name on it so technically they have to pay not me. I promised to make these monthly payments however and they know I have to because .. well.. I’m fucking scared of them. I have been making them too! But each month it gets harder and harder. Every day I obsess over this strange fantasy where I just get up and leave without a trace so THEY have to deal with the debt. This makes me feel good because 1) I don’t have to worry about it anymore 2) I don’t have to live with them anymore 3) it’s almost like payback for all the pain they’ve put me through 

The only problem is running away isn’t easy. Where will I go? Nobody’s gonna let me crash at their place for free very long. What if I do get a roommate situation and something goes wrong? Then I have to go back to an abusive household that’s most likely gonna be furious with me??

165,"So I need some advice and I want to know what’s going on... 


For some backstory, basically, I was really close with this girl back in middle school but when we got to high school, stupidly retarded freshman me decided to abandon her basically. Around mid-January of this year, I started developing feelings for her again after 2 years of not talking to each other. 

We started off a little awkward but eventually we both began being very invested in our conversations (texting-wise). Like, she would send me decent-length text messages and she’d be very engaged in the conversation. We’ve even video called each other a few times. 

Everything was going alright until I’d say a few weeks ago when she suddenly started becoming less and less interested in our conversations. She’d eventually end up saying like “lol ohh”, “lmao”, “ohh okay”, etc. I received a gift from her on my birthday and she had a note in the gift that was basically sort of a cry for help. Turns out, she said that she was depressed due to a lot of shit happening leading up to 2 weeks ago. I gave my support to her and everything and I hope she genuinely feels a lot better and I hope she can fight her way out of this dark headspace of hers. 

By this point, our conversations were becoming very one-sided since it would be mostly me who did the talking/texting and she’d give half-baked answers (lol ohh”, etc.). She claims that this was the “new her” and that she’s gonna need time to recover and come back as her regular usual self. We continue talking but the conversation again remains really one-sided with me carrying it. I thought she hated talking to me but whenever I say this, she’d say that she doesn’t and that she enjoys talking to me (which I think is a lie, but whatever). 

Recently, on Monday, she told me that she was talking to this guy who she said made her day and everything. She said that the guy she was talking to was kind, funny, fun to talk to, tall, really talented and physically active, made her have butterflies, etc. I’m not gonna lie, I was kind of sad and sort of jealous but it’s whatever, she can like and date whoever she wants, I just want her to be happy and stuff. They even had plans to have a sort of date at this one event on Saturday (she claims that it wasn’t a “date” but come on, let’s be fucking honest here, it sure did sound like a date from how she described it). 

Yesterday however, she messaged me first and said that she and this boy that she likes/liked/I don’t fucking know anymore basically cancelled everything and they were only going to remain friends (I think she still has feelings for him and she’s just lying but hey, life’s life). She said that it went “downhill” between them and that she wasn’t ready to date since she needed time to recover from her breakup with her ex-boyfriend of 2 years, meaning that she won’t date for a while. 


I don’t know what to do now. If we’re being honest, then I’m not exactly 100% jealous or whatever, but these past few days have really been throwing me off since it’s been in my head with what she’s said and everything. I just don’t know what to do now. I still like her and I want to be supportive of her as well as be there for her since she’s still depressed and I want her to be happy, but my friends have suggested that I stop talking to her. 

I’ve also came to the conclusion that I should stop talking to her unless she initiates a conversation first. My logic so far is that, if the guy she is/was/whatever the fuck they’re doing now makes her laugh, is fun to talk to, etc., then I don’t need to fill that spot anymore since it’s been replaced by someone else that she clearly prefers. Like, I’m gonna do us all a favor and remove myself from her since she’s got someone better to talk to and I suck in comparison to her new guy, so what the hell is the point in talking to me anymore? 


But I still want to support her and help her out with her depression. Even though I still like her, I want to be her friend also and be a supportive one at that. I still want to be there for her. Is my strategy/plan of not talking to her anymore unless she talks first workable or will it just ruin my friendship with her? What about talking and interacting with her in real life? What do I do about that? How else can I help her and everything? What should I just do in general? ",28Feb2019,1

171,"I broke up with my ex almost two years ago, but we were talking and were FWB for a while. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend again but I said no and officially broke things off with him. Even it has been almost a year since then, I still hate him a lot and I hate the person that I have become.

Long story short, he was emotionally abusive. I started dating him when I first started college, I wasn’t born and raised in America so I had a very hard time transitioning. I was constantly stressed and didn’t do too well in my classes. I also got my drivers license freshman year in college so I would drive around and practice my driving skills with him. He constantly yelled at me, cursed at me, asked me “are you fucking retarded?”, literally screaming at me every second, it stressed me out to the point that I would start crying, I told him I hated it when he did that but he wouldn’t stop. 

Also, before I started dating him, I hooked up with some guy at a party which he found out. He constantly brought that up and he would call me a whore/slut/all kind of names, I have never cheated on him. 

There are countless things he did that hurt me a lot, tbh I feel like this toxic relationship kinda made me a worse girlfriend. I’m currently seeing someone else and we have been dating for around a year, I get so defensive every time we argue but my current boyfriend has never done things to hurt me intentionally. I feel like I could have been a more understanding/tolerating girlfriend but because of my ex, I always feel like I have to be tough so no one can take advantage of me, and I feel like it’s not fair to my boyfriend.

Hi Reddit. I really need to get something off my chest that's been preoccupying my mind for about six months now. It's about an incident that happened last fall at home when I was living temporarily with my parents, along with my sister. My sister is in her early thirties and has been unemployed for years, and even though she's not quite mentally ill she has some serious personality disorders and is overall a very hostile and confrontational person. I apologize in advance if this ongoing post sounds a little robotic but I just want to give an unbiased and objective account about what happened this night so that I can finally stop questioning and ruminating over it. She's been in many verbal and physical fights with my parents, usually stemming from them pressuring her to get a job and move out of the house, which I'll get into more detail soon. Anyway, one night when I'm in bed trying to fall asleep for work the next day, she opens the door and asks what I'm doing still awake, glaring at me. She starts walking towards me, telling me how I'm responsible for her being stuck at home and how I'm ruining her life, just psychotic nonsense. I try not to acknowledge her but she walks right over to my bed and slaps me in the face.

At that point I get out of bed, grab her wrists and just try to push her out of my room. At this point she starts screaming and cursing at me, I'm still holding on to her wrists and trying to push her out the doorway and into the hall, with her resisting and pushing back the whole time. We end up in the hallway, I'm telling her to calm down and now she's just screaming at the top of her lungs to let go of her. I tell her to stop screaming because I don't want the neighbors to hear and call the cops. She's thrashing and flailing her wrists and it feels like she was trying to hit me back. During this, I decide to just use force and I reach back and punch her in the face. It was partly to defend myself and my dad from her, who she later she tried throwing random stuff at along with our dog. I have to admit though, I was simply very angry with her, not just for slapping me and her out of control behavior at the moment but for all the times she had fought my parents and left them with bruises and scratches. She falls backwards and I pin her to the ground and tell her to stop screaming. She's screaming even louder and I slap her lightly on the cheek, not with full force. She keeps screaming and cursing at me and I slap her again two or three more times with the same amount of force. Finally she stops screaming and agrees to quiet down, and I let go of her. As soon as she gets up, she continues cursing at me and threatening to call the cops herself and then she starts acting fully batshit crazy.

She goes over to the bathroom to grab a pair of scissors, which she uses to chop off half of her hair randomly in the mirror, goes over to my dad's room where he was observing all the commotion and waves the scissors right in his face, screaming and cursing at him. She then walks over to my dad's office and starts knocking everything off his desk and bookshelves, and even throws this big, heavy mug at my dad and other objects at the dog too. She then picks up the phone and calls the cops, and they arrive about five minutes later, while my dad and I are pleading with her to just calm down. The cops lead us to separate rooms and questions us, though my dad comes with me and tries defending me saying she's acted just as violent in the past, which is true. She had assaulted my parents plenty of times in the past, leaving them, especially my mother, with scratches and bruises. One night she had randomly grabbed a handful of sharp kitchen knives and threw them at my parents while they were watching TV.

Recently before this one incident, my parents told her to stop seeing this one illegal immigrant in the area (for obvious reasons) that she had been dating, with whom she had gotten pregnant twice, and both times my parents urged her to get an abortion, footing the bill each time totaling more than $1,200. My parents pressured her to get a job to pay back the costs to which my sister responded by assaulting and cursing my mom multiple times, which really pissed me off hearing about (I was in another city when this was happening) and explained some of the contempt I felt for her when I decided to punch her and use force. Going back to the cops, after hearing our stories, they told me they were just going to leave us alone since my sister admitted to having slapped me first without provocation. They did give me sideways glances though and acted like I would have been in a lot more trouble had that not been the case. My sister had a black eye from the punch and some moderate bruising on her cheek when I was slapping her on the floor and trying to get her to stop screaming. The cops offered to take her to a hospital to get the bruises healed up, and the next day she calls us and says that she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital, which she spend three days in.

Afterwards, we pick her up from the hospital, and she's acting a lot calmer now and even apologetic for how she acted that night. We took her out to eat and get coffee plenty of times over the next few days for the sake of feeling like a normal family again. As for her bruises, they had completely healed in a little over one week. Fast forward to today and she seems to have mostly forgotten about that night. My parents and a close friend have urged me not to worry about any fallout from that night and that people would understand my side of the story if I gave them even few details about my sister's behavior for years leading up to that incident. But here's the thing, I do admit having gone overboard in hitting her that night, and I do feel some guilt for not having used more restraint with her. I'm pretty scared of this incident 'surfacing' later on, if my sister gets in another crazy mood and tries spreading a picture that she might have taken of her bruises and describing that incident completely out of context. I have constant images floating through my head of losing jobs, friends, girlfriends or a future wife if they see some hypothetical picture of my sister's face with the black eye and bruises on her cheek and assume I'm some violent, trailer park trash woman-beater. I can't help but think nobody likes a guy who may have committed domestic assault against a woman, whatsoever, no questions asked, end of discussion.

This is a really nagging thought that has left me incredibly anxious and unable to concentrate on anything important. I'm actually working a new job in a new city now, but when these intrusive thoughts pop into my head I can't think about anything else other than ""Oh my god what would people think of me?"" or ""Oh god, how would I explain what I did to her that night?"". Sometimes I do feel more clear headed and believe that if I had explained to them just how violent my sister had been in the past with my parents, especially with the incidents involving throwing knives at them or assaulting them during arguments over those two consecutive abortions, they would probably think I was at least somewhat justified in punching her back. However, I'm still struggling with this overwhelming sense of panic I feel two or three times a day thinking about what would happen if my sister tried sharing details about that night with future friends or coworkers. It feels like a skeleton in my closet or some dirty secret I have to live with. Based on what you've read here, what do you think guys? Do I really need to worry so much if other people learn about how I hit her or see some possible picture she may have taken of her face after the incident? I really don't like to think of myself as a violent or bad person.  In any case, thanks for reading and please let me know here if I'm being paranoid, if I really did fuck up that night or if I just lie somewhere in between and should just let go of this fear.

Whenever I tell her my problems she just talks and tries to make me think it out myself (which is actually an amazing thing that that company does, but it’s not what I should do because I am mentally ill and I can’t think for myself at the moment). I can’t feel emotions. I don’t have any urges or wants. I’ve had this problem for almost 2 years now but I was just recently able to name it. I really want to do something about this. I want to be able to feel again.

I just got enough power to write this post as I never have the power to face this lack of emotions.

I now want to find a therapist myself, but I don’t know how. How do I get myself a therapist? And how do I know it’s a good one? What am I supposed to do right now?",28Feb2019,3

179,"I was thinking recently about my future calling/vocation goals and a possible career pathway that could allow me to achieve them all. I have always wanted to join the Navy to join special ops, but I also very much have a desire to one day become a physician.

In order to accomplish both of these goals, I thought of a possible career plan. The first step is to graduate with a Bachelor's (I am currently a 2nd semester Sophomore in undergraduate), ensuring that I take all required medical school pre-requisite courses. Then I would join the Navy and serve for roughly 7-9 years until the age of about 30. Then from there I would take the MCAT and apply to Medical School in order to pursue that goal. 

This plan was brought about after being inspired by Johhny Kim ( [https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/jonny-kim/](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/jonny-kim/) ). I thought this would be a wonderful plan until I realized one possible wrench. 

I know that MCAT scores ""expire"" after roughly 3 years, which is why I would not plan to take it during undergraduate. But I can not find any information online about how long GPA lasts for. I'm confident that my degree would not ""expire"", but I am concerned that medical schools may look at the prerequisite classes and decide they were taking to long ago (roughly 10 years earlier), and decide they were not valid for admissions even if I had an above average MCAT score.  It would be extremely inconvenient if I spend the next 2 years to finish earning my degree just to get out of the Navy and have to take the prerequisite classes again.

My question to you is if you are aware of how this works and what the estimated outcomes would be? Another thing to note is that while in special ops I would try to specialize as a medic, but from what I've read this is not under my control and is simply dependent on what the team needs at the time. 

Thank you so much in advance for your response.",28Feb2019,1

183,"Background info: I am 22 and my sister (We'll call her Alyssa). Childhood wasn't really the best for either of us, since we were both abused mostly emotionally but sometimes physically from very young ages. She was always very shy and quiet until 7th grade, which is when all the big issues started. 

I moved back in to find a job after graduating college in June last year, and so far, since me being home, Alyssa has been in  3 fights both in school and out of school, she's been suspended twice, skips classes at least once a month, and almost never comes home when she's supposed to which should be 3:30pm. My parents don't allow her to have a job because she's been in so much trouble in the past. In fact, a couple years ago, she committed an actual crime which I won't get into but it was a huge mess nonetheless. Somehow her grades remain OK, she has a B+ average in most of her classes and a few low A's. Alyssa barely toes the line between detention and getting sent to a straight up Alternative Learning Center. I know she does drugs and vapes/smokes/whatever and I really don't know if I want to snitch on her and have her get beaten by our mother. 

I don't know if she's just rebelling HARDCORE or actually mentally ill, like sociopath-personality disorder ill. She can be pretty manipulative and she's an excellent and compulsive liar, but upon further research I really don't think that's the case, still possible though. 

I just don't know what to do. CPS? Tipline? Counseling? There's not much I can think of at the moment.

Thanks to anyone that can give me ideas on what to do with her.

184,"was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments. Then while talking to me she held long eye contact smiled. When we were done she continued staring into my eyes and smiling in silence, then when I broke it continued staring at me when shes right in front of me. She did that multiple times and her friends would smile and look at me or giggle.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class on time and I was staying late for that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her. I do care about her and have platonic feelings for her.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows",28Feb2019,0
185,"I’ve been seeing her for a while now and the only issue has been getting there and back. I’ve been able to see her around 2 times in the last month using Uber (which is insanely expensive, talking $120 round trip $150 with tips) and it’s really not a favorite of mine considering I’d like to see her at-least once or twice a week.

188,"She used to be blocked. She made my life hell and stalled me and called me and was trying to get my boyfriend to be back with her. It came to a head when she came over unannounced and he blocked her on everything. 

Well last night we were watching a video on my boyfriends phone and she called him. He didn’t answer. I left because I had to for work but hung out outside his door to his place for a second and heard him talk to her and mention that they had talked in person last week. 

I feel so betrayed and upset. I shouldn’t because I’m being controlling but how could he be meeting with her and not telling me? I heard him say to her that he is sad when he thinks of the future and it involves me. That we haven’t grown together like he had hoped. He was giving me a shot and it wasn’t working out anymore. He had given me a shot for the last year but nothing has significantly changed (he said). 

I’m hurt. I met his whole family. His friends. We always go to his friends events. I thought this ex thing was over with. How is he trying to go back to her when he has been with me and everything has seemed so fine and great lately. I also heard him say he has never felt the way he feels with her with me. That he isn’t head over heels for me. He said he knew it may be because he is older but there’s something missing between us. 
He never said to her that he wanted to be with her. 


I did hear her say that she doesn’t want to be with someone like him. She likes him as a friend but she and he aren’t emotionally compatible because he must be dating someone. She told him she believes true growth comes from being single and finding oneself. She said she hates how he copies her and how he doesn’t seem genuine. He just wants someone around so she doesn’t see him as something valuable because he doesn’t value himself. She said she may not even want him as a friend and she called to tell him that they shouldn’t talk again. They had talked the week before and she said she felt wrong for doing so cause he was dating someone.  


He said he would get back to her later in the week. He hasn’t reached out to her at all. I know. I got a tracker app for his phone. I mean is he just playing her too? ",28Feb2019,1

I work at a quirky restaurant back in my hometown and have basically a family of friends that work there. Every time I come and go from the larger city to my smaller hometown though, I really get nervous and dread going one way or another.

192,"I (23/f) work in an in home licensed daycare. I have for years. We have a parent we will call Bill, who works for CPS. My friend who knows bill, told me that he's a creepy and to stay away from him, but wouldn't tell me why. Well... She finally told me why.

Flash back to highschool I was sexually assaulted. It was pretty devastating. I became suicidal, and depressed. I went to school with my attacker, so I had to see him every day in the hallway. I ended up having to go to a therapist, where I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD from the attack. 

With all of this in mind, i was asked to house sit sometime after the attack. I was extremely paranoid being home alone so I sat on the couch with a knife because I kept hearing noises from upstairs. I told my therapist this... Big mistake. She decided to call CPS on me, and tried to get me into a psych ward saying I was a ""danger to myself and others"". CPS found nothing, obviously.  

Well flash forward to now, and apparently Bill went into the CPS data base to Snoop on us, where he found my CPS case. He had asked me a few months prior if we had ever had a CPS case on us, and I told him no. He then said ""I kinda wanna check on my data base, but that's illegal and I'll get fired haha"". I feel like I've had a complete invasion of privacy. Like I already have to do a background check, why couldn't that be enough?

Basically I've known this guy for around 4 years, we met on chatroulette. we started out dating but realised we weren't good for each other so ended it, also side note we live in the same country just far apart. after we broke up he didn't speak to me for a while which was understandable, a few months ago by and he pops up, we catch up on things and I found out he has a new girlfriend which I was happy about I felt bad about breaking up with him so I was glad he was moving on. Some time goes by and we're pretty close, he's basically my best friend at that point. I'm kind of the antisocial type and don't often respond to messages so eventually we stop talking but do try to make an effort to catch up every so often, it's so of a mutual understanding that no matter how much time has passed we still treat each other like we did before we're just kind of like that, it makes the friendship a lot easier. I get into a really serious relationship that was kind of toxic and he helped out a lot, he definitely saved my ass a few times from being dumped. once again we don't talk for a like a long time, I think it might have been 5 or 6 months, which to this day is the longest I think we've not talked. That serious relationship I was in ended and I was crushed, it was definitely the most depressed I think I've ever been. (From this point on I will be calling my friend RM) Out of desperation to try and find some happiness I messaged RM, of course he messages me back and asks if I want to call I say of course I needed some human interaction, so we talk and catch up and I tell him about everything that's happened and he feels sorry for me, he knew that I was gonna get really hurt in this relationship but didn't want to pressure me because I had to go through it myself (first love kinda deal)  we talk some more and I find out he's still with his girlfriend, we start talking about something sexual as teens often do. It was innocent at first like a joke, but I guess he took it too far and I felt like things were actually getting sexual. I really wasn't in the right headspace for all of this, I knew he had a girlfriend and I just came out of a devastating breakup. It really got to me and midway through the call I just break down I don't know why I couldn't stop crying I felt like we were doing something wrong,  I felt like he was taking advantage of me because of my vulnerable state and I couldn't understand how he could try and pull something like this. He asked me what's wrong but he already knew, he starts apologising saying that it was just a joke he took it too far he says that he will go and we can talk about it tomorrow and leaves. The next day I told him it was fine but it really messed me up, I think about it today and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. 2 months pass and I forget all about this. me and RM are still friends, I get into a new relationship and all is right with the world. Fast forward a little bit and RM has a new girlfriend also, she was really nice by the way, and for the first time we talk about meeting in person. He said that he wanted to hang out so we planned a little bit of a vacation together and he would bring his girlfriend and I would bring my boyfriend. I'm going to skip past it because it's not really important but it is important to know that we met, the whole thing had its ups and downs, my boyfriend is a little more antisocial than I am and found it difficult to be friendly with RM which caused some unwanted tension. Besides all that it was great and we all had a lot of fun. A few months after this I have a big falling out with my mum to the point where I just wanted to leave my house. I couldn't be around her it was too much, I told this to RM and he suggested that I come and stay at his for a few days. I thought this would be a great idea as I've never traveled that far before and going to another part of the country I live in seemed really exciting, so I make long trip to his house and I meet his mum and his family and they are all lovely. surprisingly throughout the whole friendship I'd never met or heard about his family I didn't even know he had brothers until I was there, it was a little bit worrying to know that I had known him for so long but didn't even know he had siblings. I just put it up to him being reserved with his family life, the first night goes fine I stay in a spare bedroom which I'm thankful for as I'm still with my boyfriend, he wasn't all to happy that I was there but I told him to relax and not be so controlling which he agreed to. The next night was much worse, it was obvious he was trying to get me drunk, I understood he was trying to have a good time but I didn't want to get drunk I just wanted to chill with my best friend. It gets a bit later and he suggested we watch a movie I said sure and he puts on some shitty comedy, we were watching it and he ""falls asleep"" for a few minutes and then ""wakes up"" and out stretches his arms, I ignore it and he makes a noise trying to get my attention, I assume by what he was doing he wanted a hug so I lean in and give him one (something I forgot to mention is that RM had serious mental issues and tried to end his life a few times) a lot of people might be wondering why did I give him a hug well because I felt sorry for him he had gone through so much and he was like a brother to me at this point. I tried to lean out of the hug and he held me there, I froze I didn't know what to do. I find it hard to tell people no or to speak my mind if I'm uncomfortable so I just sit there with him hugging me. More time passes and the movie ends the screen goes black and it's just me and him in his room alone with him hugging me, at this point I'm silently panicking. Suddenly his arm moves closer to my thigh (I believe I was wearing shorts at the time) it becomes too much for me and I suddenly say I'm going to bed and push him off me and leave the room. It happened too quick for him to respond and I shut the spare bedroom door and just cried. I texted my boyfriend about how I wished I had never left and wished I was back home, I felt stranded, I was in a strange part of the country I'd never been in before. I was very cold towards him the rest of the trip and when I got back home I didn't talk to him for a while, of course though I forgave him, I just made up some stupid reason as to why he did it and why it was ok. We're still friends but a lot of times when we talk I find myself thinking about the awful things he's done to me and how he's made me feel, a lot of people say girls and boys can't be friends and I can understand why now. I don't know what to do, part of me wants to stop talking to him and forget he exists but another part of me is willing to give him another chance because that's just who I am. I'm really sorry this is so long and that it might not make a lot of sense I just don't know what to do.",28Feb2019,1
199,"To properly paint this picture for you I got to an alternative school for kids that are behind in academics, where they do online classes so they can get on track to graduate on time or as soon as possible. So think of it like an extension of my main school. Sounds good on paper right? Well you'd be right but it doesnt always have an overseerthat sets this straight if things go wrong. 
With a student or, more importantly, a staff member. 

Some other important info is that theres a front room, a where you can work without a teacher breathing down your neck telling you to get work done. You (for the most part) get to do what you want when you want, as long as you get your schoolwork done. And a back room, where the teacher I'm talking about (we'll call him Mr. M) is constantly yelling at you to work even when your doing something as simple and ask another student a question about something, even about school. You dont get to do anything except work, I once got yelled at for getting a drink of water (no shit). 

They say you get from the back room to the front is by getting your weekly goal done (or so we thought). Now I was up in the front room for months, till this morning when Mr. M, immediately started yelling at almost everyone to get in the back. We were all VERY confused as we were all in the front room the day before no problem, we asked what was going on but he refused to answer us and just say ""get in the back, now!"" At increasing volumes and in an increasing tone of agitation and aggression. After seeing there was no reasoning with the man we all did as instructed and made our way back. After putting my belongings at a desk I made a B-line to the very calm, likeable and most importantly, reasonable, Mr. H, with a few of my friends. I asked him what the hell was happening and he explained they would now be doing front room eligibility on a daily basis, not weekly. 

(I should also note that this kind of shit happens where they change the way they do things on a dime without warning greatly disrupting us, the students, flow.) 

I wasn't at all happy with this because they gave us absolutely no warning of a change that would be so detrimental to us. The front room can go off campus for lunch. Back room cannot. That was a problem because the people who got moved back brought money for food. Not food. It was evident that we would all go hungry. In disbelief I joked to my friend and said ""did you pack an lunch because I didn't!"" ""I did not."" Was my friends reply, ""I would've liked a warning of this change yesterday so I could've brought food, but I suppose we'll go hungry because they didn't tell us."" I said the last sentence right when we left the office where Mr. M was walking around the corner when he heard me say ""they didn't tell us-"" when he said ""I dont care."" He continued talking but I just walked away. He didn't care that because of HIS lack of communication, kids would go hungry if he had it his way.

Later on he told everyone in the back room that our parents basically didn't raise us right and in essence we were fuck ups.

Mr. H got Mr. M to let us go off campus lunch for the day since we had no time to prepare. ""I mean we can let them go if you want, but I'm leaning to the side of letting them starve"" those were his exact words we overheard.

After some time passed I went to use the bathroom when I heard Mr. M preaching to the front room kids that us back room kids were basically a bunch of, and I am quoting his exact words ""elementary school babies that are acting like jerks* *fucking dumbasses* that, if he had his way, would go hungry on lunch."" If you at all understand that logic the last we should starve for not preparing for a change we didn't know about, please explain because I'm lost.

We all got our daily goals completed today which should mean that we would be up front tomorrow, that's what the said multiple times today explaining it to us. They said that at least thrice.but at the end of the day I met with Mr. H just to make sure I was good for tomorrow when he told me that that was the case anymore and that we would have more information tomorrow.

...

Are you fucking me? You remember when I said things change that should be set in stone? This is what I mean. In essence, yesterday, the way front room was  determined was if you hit your weekly goal the week before. This morning its decided by if you hit your daily goals. And when I leave its changed to some unknown process I can only imagine. That's what me and my friends deal with on a frequent basis.

Now above those were just things Mr. M did in one day. I will now share some other instances of more serious things he has done:

One of my friends as a joke said, without smiling or laughing just said ""I'm gonna kill myself"" while Mr. M was in the room. Mr. M wasnt looking at him when he said this so he was only going off of what he heard, ""go ahead, just dont do it here, its messy"". Keep in mine when I put a sentence in parentheses its exact wording. This is no different. I live in Colorado, which has one of the highest highschool suicide rates in America. And he said that to a student that he heard literally say ""I'm going to kill myself."" Now as far as I'm aware my friend who said this is not suicidal, and he said it as a joke, while in bad taste. But what if he was suicidal and he said that in complete seriousness?""go ahead isnt what anyone, let alone should say. 

Another time, my friend, who drinks Ensures for breakfast because he almost never has time to eat a normal breakfast, did not get a chance to on this certain morning and complained about how hungry he was and made a joke about how he didn't get his liquid sustenance and was done for. Mr. M left to room with a Boost. A similar liquid meal to ensure but the one Mr. M had was much bigger than an ensure. ""Ensures are good but I personally prefer Boost,"" Mr. M  said to my friend handing the Boost to him ""its bigger and has more protein. Read the ingredients panel."" my friend was holding the boost while reading the ingredients. Now a teacher, who heard a student say that they were super hungry, that has an extra Boost, I would say it's not too crazy to think that they might give the hungry kid the Boost so they dont go till lunch starving. But Mr. M is no normal teacher. Instead of doing that he, I'm not exaggerating at all, literally snatches the boost from my friend opens it and drinks the entire thing in one go, right where he was standing, next to a hungry kid. This isnt necessarily as bad as the ones above but it still helps paint what kind of person Mr. M is.

We dont know what to do about Mr. M as hes getting out of control. What can we do?

200,"So in the last class of my day, I used to sit next to this girl. I kind of felt a spark between us and kind of developed a short friendship and I like her. It was fun sitting next to this person, then my teacher changed the seating chart.  Thanks to my schools weird schedule, we have 3 of the classes one day and the other 3 on the next. Each class is 2 hours long. It’s been a while since the seating change and I feel like sooner or later the relationship hanging on a string isn’t gonna last. Before when we sat together, we got close enough where she invited me to go somewhere with her, but things happened and it didn’t happen.  Now that we’re on the opposite side of the classroom, we barely talk or communicate and the only time we do is when we see each other in class for like 10 seconds. Shes also a grade above me and I basically never see her since we don’t have any classes. The only time I get to talk to her,it last very short and its the end of the school day and everyone heads their own separate ways. I can tell she still wants to talk to me because shes always coming up to me in class or bumping into me randomly.


The advice is probably obvious, but not to me. I basically have only one friend at school and the rest are acquaintances that never socialize with me when its not at school. Im an introvert and don’t really know/never taught how to socialize since it’s just been me and my mom (only child). My mom said real random friends don’t really exist and family is the best friends you could have. I agree with her that family is good, but there can be real friends outside of family.

After she told me I just kind of paused for a few seconds, and then said how sorry I was to hear that. I also made it very clear that she can talk to me anytime about anything, as I know that these things can be very difficult. After that we just kind of sat in silence for a few minutes and then went back to a regular conversation. She gave no indication of sadness or guilt whatsoever. She is an extremely strong person emotionally, so she either hides it well or I can’t notice it. 

My question is, should I just not mention it? I can’t tell if she wants to talk about it or not, so should I just try to keep her happy and carry on like always, or sit her down and have a serious discussion about it (if that’s what she wants.)?",28Feb2019,0

I took a semester off after graduating (May of 2018) and decided in October I'd attend college since I couldn't find work as an electrician.

I'm almost 2 months in and I can't stand it. I only go 2 days a week, and i only have 13 hours of class a week.

From what my grandma says, my sister probably doesn't get up until around 10-11, maybe later. And I can't do anything about because I'm at school. My mom's the only one who could, but she's also sleeping at that time.

She came back to me just before my last exam and talked about keeping the relationship going, however, what she wanted was 2hrs + a day of talking which was impossible with me going to uni the next year, so I said no (manly due to the fact that she put me through so much pain without stopping to think about me during my exams or even wait 5 days).

216,"So, I moved into my apartment 6 years ago when my daughter was 1. I live on the second floor and the people who lived below me for the majority of my time here moved out about six months ago. New tenants moved in, four 21 year olds who just got out of college and moved to my city. My landlord lives above me. 

I have shared custody of my 7 year old daughter and she is only with me 50% of the time. She is in school full time and i would say during the week she is really only awake and moving about the apartment from 5:00pm to 8:00pm. That being said, she does run around the house, play with toys, laugh, etc. This past weekend, she had 5 friends over for her birthday party. While I tried to keep the kids quiet, they were excited and rowdy and I couldn't take them outside because it was too cold. The guests were at my house from 4-7pm and then left and during that time, the landlord who lives above me texted me and asked that the kids ""take it down a notch."" I was very apologetic and explained that it was a birthday party and it would be over soon. Then I told the kids to calm down and it seemed to work pretty well. I haven't heard anything else from the landlord and I have never had any of the other people in the building complain. 

Today my daughter had 2 friends over after school and they were running around again but only from 6pm to 7:30pm. And I received this text from the neighbor downstairs: 

Hi, this is your downstairs neighbor, I asked the landlord for your number because I didn't want to like bang on your door but I need you to know that the running around upstairs is really really loud down here. It seems to be happening a lot more often so I needed to say something. 

I was miffed as they tend to have people over late at night and also play music/video games pretty loudly. I have never complained because it's not that bad and I live in a big city where I expect noise. So I responded saying, ""I'm sorry it's loud. My daughter just got home from school and will be in bed in 2 hours.""

This was the response: ""ok I get it but just keep in mind she is running and jumping on our ceiling. This isn't the first time and it's not appropriate.""

I haven't responded and I'm not sure if I will. But when the 3 kids were over I let them run around despite the text because I found it to be so obnoxious. I don't think she should tell me what is and isn't appropriate for my daughter to do in our private home. Until winter is over, we are stuck in this apartment and she is only here half of the time. I am equally annoyed that the landlord gave her my number without permission. 

I looked up rights as a tenant and so long as the noises are not happening before 8am and after 9pm, I am perfectly in my rights. Also, my daughter isn't acting in a way that any child wouldn't act. Is there a good response I should send the neighbor or should I just ignore her? Or, am I completely out of line? Just looking for honesty. ",28Feb2019,2

I am a 13 year old girl and I have a brother who is almost a year older than me (he attends a high school special program while I’m still in grade 8) 

 Lately I’ve been thinking of the future and what I’ll do with my life, it all seems scary since my family is not financially doing that well (we are immigrants who left our country because of the dictator)  attending college will be hard as school is already super stressful . In addition to that, there is my brother, he’s been disabled since birth (had his brain bleed after birth which ended up clogging something and now he has a pump in his head to drain the cerebral liquid) this caused him to be mentally challenged I guess and he also can’t use his right hand but he’s fine with regular every day things. He doesn’t understand what’s socially acceptable or not, and because of puberty (Idek) he started acting aggressive. My parents are already tired and he just makes them even more tired. I’ve begun to dislike my own brother and I cry about that everyday but can’t stop it. He’s rude to me and makes my mom very VERY sad so she takes her anger out on me for everything. She apologizes but it still hurts after getting slapped and yelled at for every little thing. I love my brother, I really do. But sometimes I cry because I wish for him to die and let me live a normal life. I’m terrible, I know. I’m so terrible that I became numb. When I was little, I would think “what if my mom dad or brother died?” I would cry my eyes out. I can’t anymore. I don’t FEEL anything and the only time I’m sad is because of that. What is wrong with me? I know it’s not normal that I feel this way but I can’t help it. In the future, when my parents pass away, what will I do with him? I can’t send him away because I LOVE him SO SO much and I would not want to disappoint my mom (she once told me I would take care of him if she wasn’t there anymore) I’m very confused and conflicted about my feelings.

224,"Tldr at the bottom

About a month ago I started my first “real” job out of college. The base pay is decent, but there’s significant financial incentive to work overtime. Some people work 70 - 80 hour weeks, and those people make well into the 6 figures (I grew up dirt poor, so that’s a lot to me regardless of the hours put in). 

The job itself is providing direct care and psychoeducation therapy to extremely, extremely troubled kids. They’re frequently physically aggressive, verbally abusive, etc. All of my coworkers have been threatened and anyone who has worked here more than a few months had likely been punched. So understandably, the work itself can be physically and emotionally exhausting. 

I’ve heard coworkers talk about falling asleep behind the wheel driving home, feeling like they’re on the verge of a mental break, feeling anxious/depressed/irritable all the time, but still not wanting to give up the money.

Since I’ve just started, I haven’t really felt those things yet. Some days suck, but that’s any job. Right now I’m working about 60hrs a week and really happy with my paychecks. 

The advice I’m looking for: How do you know when you’re working too much? Have you ever worked too much and how did that negatively affect you? At what point should you take a step back?

Tldr: When working in a stressful job with unlimited overtime opportunities, how do you know when to take a step back?",28Feb2019,2
225,"Hello everyone this seems kind of dumb to be putting this on here considering everyone is asking deep questions. I'm a freshman in high school and one day I notice this girl. I quickly ask friends if they know who she is and most say they don't. Eventually I find a friend who knows who she is. It's been a while since I've found out who this girl is but I haven't been able to talk to her. I have no past experience with girls as I am still pretty young but i get anxious and scared every time i think about talking to her. I'm not really interested in flirting with her but more to just meet her. I need some advice can someone help?

226,"I really need an honest answer here. I feel crazy.

I was recently dating a guy that I work with. Yeah, bad idea off the bat but still, bear with me here. I work with my best friend of 3 years and this guy. So things started going downhill with this guy, I had some serious feelings but I was starting to realize that he was really manipulative and overall not a great person. SOOO my best friend and him started being overly friendly. Like when we hung out, he got in the front seat and I sat in the back, she started driving him in to work instead of me driving him, I even caught him laying in her bed (at the work paid for hotel) and drinking. I approached her about it as nicely as possible, and she pretty much told me I was going insane.

So boom, it seemed to get worse, so I stopped talking to both of them. But they remained friends and started hanging out more and more. She kept trying to talk to me and hang out with me, but then he’d call her and she’d hide her phone. I ended up saying some really nasty shit to her and told her not to speak to me anymore. Well shit got pretty heated. 

Long story short, all she ever says is that she “doesn’t understand why I was mad” because she “was just friends with him”. 

As my best friend of three years, is she wrong for befriending the guy that I really had feelings for?
Or am I over-reacting because they told me they were just friends?

228,Alright so I’ll do my best to summarize. I’m 22 and my boyfriend (20) has been my best friend for the past few years and we share a bond but about four months ago a lot of stuff happened which in turn made him treat me differently and made me feel like he never wanted to be with me in a romantic aspect and settled for me and such. He never told me he loved me and I guess I was so caught up in those thoughts too that I never solely watched his actions. During these months he’s been cruel and called me names and such out of hurt and pain but in turn I felt worse. I felt he was pushing me away and I started to grow much closer to a coworker (26) and he and I just really get along and have so much in common. Well a month ago my coworkers roommates gave him a thirty day notice and he panicked because living here in Cali makes him happy. He couldn’t get a place on his own because he works at the dispensary and doesn’t have proof of income. I qualify because I own a business on the side that looks like I pull in a large amount monthly and I applied to to apartment thinking I probably won’t get it anyways. If I didn’t get this my coworker most likely has to return to Oklahoma which he can’t stand being in. He’s also the manager at the store and very well trusted and liked. We need him kind of. My boyfriend decides to show me more love and be sorry and tell me he loves me and I was confused at that point so i asked him to stay with a friend. During this time the apartment approves and my coworker is stoked and then my boyfriend found out. The lease has to be signed tomorrow and I’m freaking out because I want to do this and move on but at the same time I want to break down and cry and be held by my boyfriend saying idk what to do. He doesn’t want me to do this obviously but I kind of feel it’s too late and I have no more time after this evening. I really don’t know what to do. I need clarity right now.,28Feb2019,1
230,"They've been extremely interested and very gifted in the medical field for many years. If they were allowed to take the courses needed, they would be very far ahead in their studies - everything in the field comes to them naturally.

But then the complications come in. They have many, many health issues that get in the way of some education - they have severe narcolepsy, fatigue very quickly, and have discalculia, among other health issues. This isn't insurmountable except in the case of math. 

They are not capable of passing math courses. They've tried tutoring, they've put in a lot of effort, but it's not a realistic possibility to past, most likely, even the beginner level courses of math. This is a problem because our University will not let them take the courses they need without getting all the way through calculus - that's at least 3 math courses, none of which they have the time, energy, or ability to pass.

They tried applying to the classes anyway, and tried reasoning with the advisors, but nothing worked out. I'm not really sure what to do at this point - is there actually a way around this?

Don't bother suggesting they ""focus on their math studies more"" or something like that. It's not going to work. I'm skeptical whether they could pass those classes even if they dedicated their entire life to those classes one at a time. If the answers a hard no, then... well that's that.",28Feb2019,1

233,"Ok I’m on mobile so sorry for the formatting but here we go. 

A couple of months ago, I was in my science class doing a project with a friend, and when I look up, this girl is staring at me. I didn’t really know what to do so I kind of stared back until I broke the eye contact. This happened many times in a span of a couple of days. Then Christmas break happens and I get a break to relax and chill out. When I return back to school, I notice that she will occasionally start looking at me, whether its at lunch or in my classes. I thought at this point that she totally had a crush on me. One time when I was eating my lunch, I noticed that she was staring right at me. When I looked back at her her head did a complete 180 towards the wall. I told one of my friends this, and then he told me he would figure it out. I told him not to do it and just leave it be. The next day, he comes up to me and tells me that she has no interest in me whatsoever. He apparently after school asked her and a bunch of her friends if she did, and they all said no. She said that she would just stare at me sometimes and would stare at someone else then. A couple of days later, she comes up to me and tells it to my face.  This left me pretty shocked and surprised because I thought I was given every sign that she did. But I noticed as time went, she would continue occasionally start staring at me. One time in one of my classes, my friend next to me told me that she was staring at me. I take a quick peek and notice that she has wide eyes and is just staring at me. She always claims that she’s just “staring off into space” but I don’t know anyone who turns in a specific direction and just stares at somebody when they are daydreaming. She also cuts off every conversation she has when I walk near her, and she always looks at the floor when I walk by her, to avoid making eye contact. According to one of my friends, she does talk about me when I’m not around.  So I don’t know what I should do, I feel like all of her actions make it seem like she does, but if I do anything, it will be kind of awkward because she’s already said that she has no interest in me. Should I do something? I feel like she may have denied liking me because I initially said that I had no interest in her whatsoever, but she also says that I totally have a crush on her.  Which then conflicts that statement. Or should I just leave it be?",28Feb2019,1

I feel so guilty that I left him behind in order to escape to a better life with my mom. He was so defenseless and innocent he didn't understand why he befell such cruelty or why I disappeared only to show back up at the last and most painful stretch of his life. I cannot describe how horrible it was to watch him over the coarse of three days go from perfectly normal to deathly ill as tumors took over his body and brain. My stepmother couldn't have been bothered show any remorse or sympathy until he was laying on the floor of the vet motionless as I wailed cradling him. I miss my baby boy so much, yet I feel like a monster leaving him to a similar fate of death I ran away from. Does this make me a horrible person? Was there something, anything I could have done for him? I don't understand how something so innocent could be shown such blatant cruelty without some sort of retribution.

I filled out most of the problems to the best of my ability, but I had a lot blank, and even if all the ones I filled out were correct, I still would fail. The person was done, and my teacher has a rule where even if we’re done with a test, the whole class must turn it in at once. I looked over at her paper and all the answers were there. I knew I was doing something bad, but I copied most of her answers down. A few days pass and I forget about it. On Monday we got it back and I got a 87%! I was so happy! But hours later that happiness was gone. The little voice inside my head was telling me “you don’t deserve this grade.” Even my math teacher commended me in front of everyone.

251,"I was vacuuming at 11am. It’s winter, I have dogs, dirt and ice everywhere. I have every right to vacuum at 11am. 

My downstairs neighbors have recently moved in. I have been here for a year now. My attempts at talking to them are moot. They’re disrespectful and rude, and now lying to the landlord. 

They said I was vacuuming at 8am. I was not. 8am is also still within lease terms to be active and doing things. 0800-2200 are sound-appropriate times.

This resulted in my landlord sending me a letter saying I have violated the lease and I could be evicted. Seriously. She claimed to have sent me an email saying she wanted to have a meeting. I never received this email nor did my room mate, who is never home btw, and the landlord also texts us and said nothing. 

I have video evidence of my neighbors playing bass music so loud at 2am that I could hear them through the floor. They are very loud, love to tell, and they enjoy loud obnoxious sex and slamming doors. But they’ll bang on the ceiling when I have music on every few days when I’m doing a cooking project. Again, at appropriate hours.

I work nights. 0000-0800. On the weekends I know how to shut up and play games with turtle beaches on. We are quiet people and no one ever has issues with us but the landlord is taking their side and I’m at a loss. This woman also claims to work night shift but I think she’s bullshitting. She’s loud all day AND night save a few scant hours of sleep? When she thinks everyone else should shut up. It’s day time. I have to suffer with a weird schedule too. It’s like the sun revolves around this chick. 

We can’t afford to move and just signed a year lease. Renting a house next year, sick of apartments.

Does anyone have advice for this? We are talking to the landlord soon, I’ll provide the videos, but the landlord really dislikes me. She seems to have a prejudice against PTSD vets based on what another neighbor says. She didn’t like the times I freaked out a little when maintenance tried to get into the apartment while I wasn’t dressed. So I’m not credible to her but my room mate is.

I just want to know how to handle this best I guess. I’m frazzled because this is absolutely ridiculous and my phone can only pick up so much of their stuff. I also don’t think about sitting there all day recording their bullshit. When I’m home all day I don’t do anything but listen to music with my headphones on to ignore them. ",28Feb2019,3
253,"Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to quit my job and I'm just 4 months here. I previously posted in several sub reddit the reason why I want to quit and the feed back I got from all of those who commented told me to quit and find a better job. For reference here's what I posted:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hey guys! I'm a newly hired marketing manager at a company (been a marketing manager for 2 yrs now). I'm 4 months here and I'm having difficulty with my marketing head/managing director because she micromanages everyone and even bypasses me to micromanage my subordinates.

Other behavior/characteristics she does that annoys me are the following:

She does not disclose budgets for our marketing projects. She would just let us look for suppliers and disapprove them because the quotes are too expensive for the budget she has in mind. Basically, we're guessing how much budget we have while trying to make an awesome marketing project happened. We go back in forth we the supplier trying to pin the right price she has in mind with very little compromises. 

She's not a marketing graduate. This is her only job, ever, because his father owns the company. Which makes her inexperienced in marketing. She keeps on insisting her directions and want's event if it's totally out of brand/brand damaging. I'm embarrassed that the projects we do have to go with my credentials, they are awful.

She can't handle multiple concerns from multiple projects. She can't handle advance concern to have the next project ready why doing the almost finished current project. This causes delays and even cancellations of other marketing agendas. I tried being aggressive and update her every progress so she doesn't micromanage and she gets mad when I raise multiple concerns. 

She changes her mind more than 15 times within the project. This causes constant change and adaptation on our end, suppliers and outsourced talents. It's taxing and stressful.

Now I got several interviews lined up. However, I don't know how to tell them my reasons properly because they might profile me as a bad employee or a quitter. But I know that I am not. This is the first time I want to quit this early from a job. I just want a better boss (no great or good, I know everyone has flaws but I just can't take how my boss treats me now.) and better office ambiance where I can earn equal to my efforts.

Recently he has come out and told me that he is Polyamorous which I think means wants multiple sexual partners. Now we had discussed possibly adding a 3rd person throughout the years but it was never a needed thing. I thought we had always been content and happy with each other, being as I am a cam girl and we are know to have sex online for fun. We both get enjoyment out of that and i started doing it because he said it was sexy to him. I also felt sexy and saw it as a huge moral booster for myself. My problem is that I recently lost our baby at 6 weeks along. After that is when he started talking about a threesome and discussing our rules for when it happened. this has been a super fragile time for me and not ally I would find joy out of discussing this stuff. But lately it has felt like he prefers someone else over me. That the point in bringing this up is because he is bored of me. That since I lost his child, and am not currently the most mentally stable I have ever been, that im to much. Recently we had gotten into a fight because he was losing his temper with me and I couldn't take it on this particular day. So I completely snapped on him. We broke up and decided to separate. He talked about how his feeling of how he loves me but I'm emotionally to much for him right now.

She’s the only Asian at her work place and is always the target of jokes, mostly about her race. I know this might sound mean but she’s not very good at standing up for herself and she says that she doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it by going to HR.

258,"(Background on me: I'm a high school junior and have a slightly below average gpa and average hs credits. I have a few extracurriculars but nothing too crazy.)

 I have been given the opportunity to either enroll in an alternative high school or stay at my current high school. The biggest pro of enrolling at the alt high school is that I can graduate in November and begin working in real estate to get a head start. The biggest pro of continuing at this hs is that I get to stay with my friends and have a normal high school experience. 
 
Pros and Cons of each

Pros of staying at my current:

• I get to stay with friends
• I get a better school on my diploma (not sure how important this is??)
•I can have a normal senior year
•I have far more sport and academic opportunities

Cons of staying at my current hs:
• I have to continue to struggle with my sinking GPA 
• It's a notoriously tough school
• Apparently, colleges compare applicants to other students in their school and my hs ranks as one of the best public school in the state

Pros of enrolling in the alt hs

• Fresh start with a better attitude
• I'm going to school with my brother
• I will have far less homework
• I graduate in early, in November 
• I get a head start on work experience


Cons of enrolling in the alt hs

• I've heard the people are trashy and obnoxious 
• I don't think it will look as good on a diploma 
• I get less sport and academic opportunities
• Farther from my house

259,"First of all, I’m new to Reddit and not clear on if this should go on r/relationship_advice, r/teenrelationships, or r/advice, so please correct me if I’m wrong.

I might add that I could be completely wrong about everything that I’m doing right now, and I could be imagining everything.

I’m a 13 year old male who’s kind of a social outcast, so I’m on discord quite a lot. I met a 14 year old girl, who I have many times voice chatted or video chatted with, and I’m kinda into her. The thing is, I’m, as earlier stated, a loser, and I’ve never really done this or even thought about doing this before, so I for some reason need confirmation that she returns the feelings, and also advice on whether it’s reasonable or even possible to get together.

We’ve gotten pretty tight as friends, and we’re on some role play discord servers together (please don’t judge). The thing is, without any push from anyone in the server, her characters always end up being in a relationship (or what my dumb ass thinks is a relationship) with mine. She has many times said “I love you,” but always followed by “in a friend way.” She has also called me cute, and I have no idea what this could entail. As well as that, she laughs at my jokes, even when they suck, but I’ve heard this is a common misconception.

She’s also across the country from me, and I can’t travel there because I can’t travel independently yet, and it’s also very unreasonable to ask your parents if you can go across the country cause of someone online. Her ex is also a bit of a white knight, and would probably try to murder me if I showed any sort of affection to her. 

I’m confused on what to do, and need some help deciding what’s possible, what’s not, and if she’s into me.",28Feb2019,2

262,"For the past few years I’ve had a relatively stable friends circle, but I never really had anyone I would’ve ever called a best friend. 

Fast forward to last year and most of my friends moved to a bigger city, I moved there too only half a year later, but in the process of that I lost contact to almost all of them except one person. 

This person calls me their best friend and I enjoy spending time with them most of the time. 
But then comes the problem: I just start hating people that genuinely like me and I don’t know how to stop this. They just start annoying me terribly and I get anxious when I think of seeing them which sends me spiraling down into deep depression until I completely isolate myself for a month or two without seeing anyone. 

I’ve never had a close friend simply because I push people away especially after opening up a little bit to them because it makes me feel horrible. 

This has been happening to me ever since I was a child. Get a friend, get close, hang out one too many times, start dreading the person, never see them again.

Wednesday night would be the bachelor and bachelorette party, Thursday rehearsal dinner and Friday wedding. Aside from that she’s mentioned staying in hotels for her bachelorette party as well in a party city. It’s just all adding up in my head and I don’t have the money for it.

266,"Hello! 

I am currently doing an internship in digital marketing abroad. I am not paid and right now I'm living in an Airbnb (which is 400€ per week, way too much for me but I have no other solution). My internship is supposed to last 5 months. 

The problem is, I am extremely bored. I just go on Facebook all day to post ads and that's it. Nothing else. I learn nothing and spend 400€ a week (without the groceries and stuff) to learn nothing. My manager was supposed to find me a flat but he just told me today that he didn't find any and he has no other solution (I have to find my own in a country where I don't speak the language). Now, it's too late for me to find something for March so I have to spend my whole month in an Airbnb (think more than 900€).

  
My internship is mandatory and I need this to get my degree. I feel like I'm wasting my time when I could learn or at least do more things in another company. It's rather difficult for me to find an internship, and it's super complicated with the college administration, but I don't know if I can take 5 more months of posting ads on Facebook. 

As for now, I have an internship which guarantees my degree. If I leave and I can't find another internship, I have to redo this year in college and I would prefer to go raise spiders in Siberia rather than doing this year again. 

Unfortunately,  dropping out isn't a solution. In my country, we need a degree or else we can't have a job.

274,"It's her sister. Her sister is essentially making my girlfriend choose between me and her. Her sister will only live in an apartment if she lives in the same room as my girlfriend. It's such a shitty thing to do, my girlfriend is crying because her sister's only point is ""it's family or him."" But she's okay with my girlfriend and I Iiving in the living room while two other people have their own rooms. But get this, she thinks everyone should pay the same rent even though we would share a living room that's smaller than the bedrooms. She doesn't think that the people with more space and an actual room should pay more. 


I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's great.
We're currently living in a one bedroom place, but she'd like to get a bigger place with more people next semester to save money, and I think it's a great idea. The other apartment she's looking at is a two bedroom two bathroom apartment in a nice area. 

But here's the thing, her sister wants to live with her. In the same room. And our friend already called a room to himself (my girlfriend and him were originally planning on living together, but my plans for the next year changed so I'll still need a place for college). So where does that leave me? The living room - which will apparently be covered with curtains or some type of barrier - or with our friend who is pretty adamant on having his own place. 

My girlfriend and I are both college students that work while the other two only work, and I enjoy having an actual room to study and vibe in. She also said the rent would be split equally 4 ways, but I think the guy in the living room should pay a smaller cut while someone with their own room should pay more. I feel like I'm not even being considered. Apparently only 5 people are allowed to live there. AND THIS IS THE BEST PART: her sister who has a boyfriend made my girlfriend sleep on the floor next to her (while she was in bed with her boyfriend) when my girlfriend stayed at her place for 2 weeks. And if the tables were flipped, my girlfriend's sister's boyfriend would not be okay with it. But he's leaving back to his hometown so he's not in the equation. 

When I bought up my worries to my girlfriend, she just said she's always wanted to live with her sister and that my plans changed too late in the game. I told her that I respected that, but that I can't live in a situation like that. Her sister is the one who applied for her, so I'm sol in terms of lease security. It honestly kinda hurts because I've stood up and supported her, and now she's insisting I stay in the living room or just live with (mainly) her friend. Then I have to ask if I can live in his bedroom while someone else takes the living room. 

Her sister already applied, the dude already claimed a room, and the sister, who I think is idiodic, will not see another perspective. Everyone who I've talked to agrees that the sister is being ridiculous and toxic for making it a ""family vs boyfriend"" situation. Or that it should be a boy's room /girl's room thing. If we're all trying to save money, I'd honestly prefer for the sister to suck it up and live in the living room and let the couple be a couple. Just yikes man. ",28Feb2019,1
276,"I've been referred to as blunt and honest throughout my whole life. Some people have even said that I'm not nice but kind (seems a bit contradictory). It's only recently that people have been saying that I'm just straight up asshole or a mean person, and that I have no filter. 
I tend to say whatever's on my mind, and I have a more dark mindset and humor than most people. 
When I say what's on my mind, I don't really realize that it might not have been the right thing to say until I've said it, but obviously it's a bit too late at that point. 
I've been working on it little by little, but it doesn't seem to be a noticeable difference between when I was aware about my insensitivity and the present me today. 
For example, today my friend (lets call her F1) comes into the classroom with a new haircut. I sit down next to her and give her a quip (I called her Asian Dora). Evidently she was offended immediately and exclaimed that I was being mean. Later, I was messaging my friend (different person, I'll call her F2) and she randomly asked me if I actually called F1 an Asian Dora. F2 happens to be in the same class as F1 and me but she somehow missed my remark I suppose. I kind of joked about it, saying I plead the fifth and she got really upset as well. She ended up giving me unsolicited advice and I didn't take it too well (she doesn't know though as it was through messages and not in person). Am I reading into this too much, are they being too sensitive? I'm stuck thinking about these things and more concerning my speech for long periods of time.

279,"So, I'm having trouble with a staff member from the Executive Office at Comcast

&amp;#x200B;

Comcast has been charging me for cable ever since I got internet with them.  I want this to stop.  I've never hooked it up.  It's been more than five years.

&amp;#x200B;

Comcast openly admits that they can see that I've never hooked the cable up.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time a service staff member has come out, I've sent them back with a complaint about having to pay for cable that I don't want.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't ditch Comcast.  I need high speed internet for my job, and nobody else is available in this building.

&amp;#x200B;

Every three to six months, I used to call in like ""can we undo this and pay me back please""

&amp;#x200B;

Because it had been five years, I got referred to the executive office about 15 months ago.  Unfortunately I got someone named \`M--\`.

&amp;#x200B;

\`M--\` decided to take ownership of my account.

&amp;#x200B;

After \`M--\` took ownership of my account, the only answer I've ever gotten is ""I'm not allowed to make changes to your account, because someone in the Executive Office owns it.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's typically 5-10 days before \`M--\` returns a call.

&amp;#x200B;

Six months in, \`M--\` hadn't achieved anything, and I was still paying for cable, so I aksed her to let go of my account and let someone else handle it.

&amp;#x200B;

She found that rude.  Because I rudely said ""after six months I don't want to deal with you anymore,"" she decided that she's never, ever letting go of my account.

&amp;#x200B;

It's now been 15 months.

&amp;#x200B;

The only things I've ever talked to her about are not paying for cable anymore, and being rid of her on my account.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, after a six day wait to talk to her explained as ""I wasn't in yesterday,"" she told me \*again\* that she didn't know I wanted rid of cable (she's been telling me that for 15 months,) and that she'd happily get that done for me.  Then I immediately lost the phone call.  Then she called back three times in a row (I'm at work, in a meeting) and hung up every time I picked up.  When I didn't even try the fourth time, she left a voicemail talking about how she was ready to remove the cable that I just told her I didn't want, and all I had to do was talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect it'll be another month before we go through this again.  This is the seventh or eighth time.

&amp;#x200B;

There appears to be no oversight of her at all, and she appears to be the only person with any ability to say ""yes, it's okay or no, it's not okay that this person has failed to modify your billing statement for 15 months because of her own emotional state.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel that I should be paying for more than a year of cable TV because someone in the executive office decided that it's rude that I didn't want to talk to them after more than half a year of failure with an attached price point.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, it came to a head.

&amp;#x200B;

My internet went out because my credit card changed.

&amp;#x200B;

It was five hours of my being unable to just get my internet turned on, because nobody would accept my card, because my account was owned by someone in the executive office who wasn't there that day.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I was able to get my internet turned on at all was I realized that I could do it through an automated system operated by a different phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

In five hours of phone calls, I was unable to get a credit card taken.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the person who's supposed to discipline people over that failure is the person who's held my account for 15 months personally to punish me.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to deal with this?  I don't know what to do.  I just want free of \`M--\`.  It didn't used to be anywhere near this bad.  I don't feel like it's okay that I am required to deal with a single individual staff member because they said so, and that they're allowed to fail for literally more than a year at a time with no consequences to themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to waste five hours just trying to give Comcast a credit card because \`M--\` has decided it's okay to punish customers \`:(\`",28Feb2019,1

It's folded in half and I notice it and pick it up and open it and it has my name on it. It's blank and unsigned. I asked him why he has my check and he says ""I have no idea. I didn't even know you had checks. Where would it have come from?"" 

The thing is, is I'm almost certain he didn't know where my checks were. Because I only use them to pay rent. Last month when I paid rent I was snowed in somewhere else and so I paid online and before that he had never been to my house. So I had no reason to bring it out and I keep my check book in the very back drawer of my vanity with my makeup. He wouldn't know it was there. I don't know if I had any loose checks in there but he did my laundry this morning and I keep my laundry card in the front. And if I had a loose check in there.. is it possible he put it in his pocket with the laundry card and just didn't notice? If he had stolen it from me wouldn't he have been more carful and not have it loose in his jacket pocket knowing I always stick my hands in his pockets?? Please help me. I'm so lost and I'm falling in love with him. He treats me so well and he is giving me $300 to help me pay for rent since I had some money taken from me earlier this month by who I thought was a friend but now I'm not so sure but why would he take money from me just to give it back because before any of my money went missing, before the check in his pocket, he had said he was going to help me pay rent because he has been staying with me so much. He does meth but he's a functioning addict. He's never up for days at a time, he still goes to work, he eats, he sleeps, and he isn't high all the time. He has never done anything for me to not trust him. He says he's falling for me too and the way he treats me shows it. He gives me gifts with meaning, like a new silver chain for a pendant that my grandmother gave me before she passed away.. he gives me back massages and took me to the casino and paid for everything and that was before he had ever even been to my house.

287," So, 8 years ago I met this girl on a virtual game and immediately we just had a great chemistry with one another. Nothing romantic or sexual just a very strong connection on all levels. We shared stories about our families and childhoods then realized over the 6 months we had been talking to each other we basically realized had the same life growing up and we didn't feel so alone in the world. Except she didn't grow up with either parent showing her what love really was. While my mother showed me as much love as she could give, my step father was abusive. Her step father was abusive and controlling and her mother was just there not believing the abuse she would tell her. Her step father didn't like the idea of her talking to me so he threatened her.

 If she didn't stop speaking to me he would find me and hurt me, he had looked up social media profiles, phone numbers and addresses on me to show her he was serious. I had no idea of this until a few years later after we had found each other again and he had died of a heart attack a few months prior. Her life was a wreck and I was just starting Culinary school. So we drifted apart once more then two years ago we began talking again but we were no longer playing on a virtual game, we were texting and Skyping one another and we finally got to sit down and voice our emotions and feelings that we had for one another for so many years and before you knew it we were basically seeing other. We had the I love you's along with good mornings and good night's going off everyday without a hitch. 

 We would Skype all day usually ending with us sleeping on the phone, she would go to work and call me just to hear my voice. Things were great for about 9 months then we finally made plans to meet up and that's when things took a turn. She ended up telling me about a guy she was living with (I was high key pissed off at this whole situation) they weren't currently dating but they had dated prior to us speaking to each other again. The guy and I spoke, he spoke and he sounded very controlling of her life. He didn't want her speaking to any of the friends I had introduced her too nor myself. She had no friends of her own outside of the friends he had when they got in a relationship. 

 Her friends she had prior he didn't like so he made her push them away. He literally sat on the phone and told me ""I don't want her speaking to you and I haven't yet decided if she could speak to the others."" That sounds like control to me but then again I may just be crazy and paranoid. Either way he was stepping up and wanting her back and he was her first love so she gave him that chance to show her. I took a step back because I was hurt but I still wanted to be her friend because we still helped each other through so many issues in life. She felt the same way and we continued to speak in private talking about current issues we had going on in our lives. 

 My feelings were on reserve and I constantly pushed for him and her but he was being a dick according to her and not playing the bf role by basically ignoring her at all turns. The first major holiday since finding out about him and her had come around, it's Thanksgiving time and he went to his parents house and she went to her grandparents, she spent the whole time Skyping me. She seemed happy to spending that time with me but I was still pretty reserve and constantly telling her to message him because I knew were her heart was with him. Then Christmas came and she dreaded having to go and pick up his brother and girlfriend because she knew she would have to be around him and know he was basically gonna pretend their lives are great in front of his brother.

 I was content with all of this because I still felt her heart was with him and I was fine with just knowing if I ever needed to talk to someone about my issues I could speak to her. The night after Christmas when she called crying saying they got into an argument he had called her overweight then she went on to say there was other times he called her clingy and her behavior was out of control and blamed her ADHD. Their relationship is a mess basically but the way she always spoken about them being together it sounds like they're just roommates. 

 They never sleep together, he would be in another room playing video games all night after work and she would be on the phone with me. New years and my birthday came by and she spent it all with me then February came and he found out about her still talking to me and made her delete all of her social media's and block my number and cut me off. I've been trying to deal with not speaking to her daily and it's hard not knowing if she's ok or not. I completely understand that I was a bit stupid for even trying to stick around in her life after the fact of all of this but she was the only person I've ever known in my entire life that I could speak to her about anything in the world and not have to worry about judgement or thinking she'd be bored with whatever interests I had and vice versa. 

 She was a best friend I never thought I'd have in my lifetime with how I live such a loner lifestyle. Now all of that is gone because of some dickhead who claims he loves her but has constantly forgotten and ignored her basically the whole time they've ""been together"" shows her a little bit of what she fell for all those years ago then he reverts back to ignoring her again. She keeps falling for it because that's all she knows as love and she's become so content and comfortable with that being love. I'm already seeing a therapist but that's only once a month and my mind is forever running. So what would you guys do in this situation? ",28Feb2019,1
288,"Hello all. 29 (M) here that has never had any interest in doing anything. 

I'm married, in the military working IT. I've got 12 years until I retire, and I have nothing that I enjoy. I don't even like my job, but there's nothing that I would rather be doing. I'm working on my M.S in IT,  I've established myself pretty well, own rental property, have a great retirement account, and a pretty decent savings. I exercise regularly, sleep well, have a good diet, very sexually active (okay... I enjoy sex). I try many hobbies, I typically don't care for them from the start, but I work on them, get good at them, still have no interest, and stop doing them. I'm not very social, and one thing I despise are team sports (both watching and playing.) I just find no joy in anything I do. I have trouble figuring out when the point of anything is. I'm not suicidal, and I dont think I'm depressed. Everything is just ""meh..."" 

List of hobbies I've tried: marathons, trathalons, hiking, backpacking, hunting, fishing, skiing, snowboarding, MMA, drag racing (my POV on certified track), street bikes, motocross, guitar (still suck at guitar), gardening, traveling the world, reading, sightseeing, building computers, video games (kind of a waste of time for me, couldn't get in to them)... probably a few others I'm forgetting. But I'm good at most of them, did them all for quiet a while hoping I would enjoy them at some point, but never did.

289,"And I was pretty confident in my ability to make new friends. Yet here we are, eight months later, and I’m... struggling to say the least. 

Rewind. Before I moved, I was trying to be a little self aware and anticipate some of the issues I’d face. Apparently, motivated people call this “planning.” Now, I’m not a complete piece of shit. I just fall into unhealthy patterns easily, equally due to my lack of self-control and foresight. So the fact that I was really putting some thought into, not only insuring an easy physical move but also an emotional one too, made me proud and confident. Plus, I was moving with my SO and we’re a kickass team so having that support made me that much more certain that everything would be fine. 

Which... honestly it was and still is. But I don’t have any friends and it’s driving me mad. Still insanely proud of the both of us for knowing ourselves and making sure to focus and follow through. 

I don’t like to go out very much but have fallen into “bar regular” groups in the past, which I attribute to my impatience (I’ve always worked in kitchens and if you haven’t before, there is typically an accepted culture with a lot of drug use and functioning alcoholism . 

This time, this move, I approached with the plan to wait until I feel a genuine connection with others before I fall in and accept my new life as an amateur billiards player. 

Initially, having this extra caution to my approach was fantastic. I’ve spent a lot of time picking up hobbies and really growing as a person. And once every blue moon, I get to socialize with my SO’s coworkers which takes the load off. But man do I wish I had someone I could ring up to come over, drink beer and play video games. And, in retrospect I still value that time a lot. I’m not experiencing any regret.

291,"So I was renting a house with my single mother for a few years helping raise my two underage siblings. We rented in a house within a central location at the time and the landlords charged $300 per week (it was my mum and I going halves in that so we both paid $150 AUD per week). A few years have passed and my mother recently purchased a house of her own and strongly encouraged me to move in with her along with my now-adult siblings. We live in a country town and the average rent going for a house in the area she just purchased in is $300 AUD per week.   


The problem is... Generally speaking at least, rent usually becomes more affordable the more tenants you divide it by. That's the whole point of having a roomate (to share the burden of expenses). 

&amp;#x200B;

So my mother's house is 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (one of these bathrooms is her own personal en suite that nobody else can use). She also has a lot of ludicrous restrictions because it's ''her house''. None of us are allowed to do laundry (we have to wait for her to do it). And she monopolizes the living room area during the evenings with her boyfriend so nobody else can watch TV. Me, my brother, my sister, and my mother's boyfriend live here. She's charging us all $150 per week. When multiplied by 4 that's $600 per week my mother's making from rent alone. I've been looking at rental properties online in the area, and the most expensive house in this neighbourhood currently listed is $150 cheaper per week than the rate my mother is charging at this house.   


Once again: That's rent alone (we all divide the bills by the number of people in this house). But strangely enough, we're not doing the same when it comes to rent. The rent itself is a mysterious figure that she won't reveal.   


So I sat my mother down and broached this issue with her calmly. I asked her how she could reasonably justify just an exorbitant price hike compared to other houses for rent in the neighbourhood. I asked her how much the rent is set for this house (so we had a tangible figure to work with). Her response was that was none of my business and she became extremely defensive and angry. So I pointed out that she was charging us all $150 per week and when multiplied by 4 that it comes to $600 per week which is $150 more than the most expensive property for rent on the market in this area. I said, economically, this just doesn't work out fairly. I then told her that we may all have to move out if she can't come to a reasonable compromise and I suggested her lowering it to $112 per week between the four of us (which means she'd be pocketing $450 per week instead of $600). 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother then started screaming, calling me ungrateful, saying that she provides a ''service'' as our mother (cooking, laundry, groceries) and that's why it's $150 more.   


The thing is, we're not kids anymore. My mother has a full-time job where she works 6 days a week from 9 to 5 and so she never cooks because she's dead tired. She doesn't make breakfast, and she's not around to make lunch. I'm not saying this because I expect this of her (I don't). But it's disingenuous to act as if you provide some kind of service towards us. The only thing she does for us is the laundry and that's purely because she refuses to let us use the washing machine (she's worried everyone will drive up the power bill by doing individual loads). But anyone with half a brain knows not to do that. Part of me also thinks she just has OCD and doesn't like anyone using her washing machine, and another part of me thinks that she likes having an excuse to justify such a large return.   


Additionally, she's been ambiguously merging the grocery bills with rent to make it harder for us to itemise and break down expenses. (When she does the weekly shopping she comes home with barely anything and then we all have to go out and do a separate shop). So I suggested she separate the grocery expenses from the rent and then asked her to itemise the grocery expenses next time she does a shop (and we all just divide the total by the number of us). She just got really angry and started screaming again. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has a mortgage, by the way. And the last thing she said during our discussion-turned-argument was that she has land rates and and a mortgage she needs to pay off. And then started using that as a reason for why we have to pay extra (because this house will supposedly be left to all of us one day as a legacy). The thing is, that seems like a very bad argument to me. Buying a house is a personal choice.   


I think I'm just going to move out with all of my siblings and find some place A LOT cheaper. The sad thing is, this will screw my mum over as she'll no longer have us paying her rent as we'll no longer be there (and she won't want strangers living in her brand-new house). So she'll just end up struggling even more financially as it will just be her and her boyfriend.  


I am just posting all of this as I wanted to get some other perspectives. Do you think I'm being unreasonable if I move out because it's costing me and my siblings too much?... Do you think my mother is justified in charging said amount, or do you think she's ripping off her own children?   


Context: I don't think I'm necessarily right in this situation, so if you feel I'm being unreasonable or unfair please let me know.

299,"I should mention before I post that I'm  I'm 24 years old but I'm don't really have the freedom or life experience of an average 24 year old.

I'm really need advice of how to stop my mum doing this to me. I'm 24f and I do a lot of chores for my mum. I get up before everyone else and  it usually takes 3 hours just to finish the morning chores and then something else like the bathroom needs cleaning or there's more dishes to wash.  I spend any free time trying to clean up and honestly, I find it so exhausting doing so much everyday. In total I must spend at least 7 hours doing chores daily. 

A fortnight ago, I had to clean the gashob daily for 3 days when J usually only do it once or twice a week. So I spoke to my mum ' could you please try not to spill things on the gashob. I've cleaned it 3 days in a row, so just please be more careful. I don't want to clean it everyday'. My mother replied ' I didn't realise you find this hard to do. I thought you're since your an adult and you're old enough to clean the gashob that it won't be too hard to do. I'll try to not make a mess but sometimes it can't be helped. If you use the gas hob, then a mess should be expected'. She didn't understand the it never used to be this messy before. Cleaning it daily seems excessive to me, and you actually have to scrub all the different components, dry them and put it back together. I'd rather not do all that as it eats up even more of the limited free time I have.

The next day, I didn't expect the gashob to be messy, but it was. I felt like I could burst into tears but my mum was watching me so I didn't . I had gotten up late that day ,and  the gashob was the last of my morning chores to do. My mum just stood there watching me and shouting at me to hurry up and finish as she needed to use it. 

Everyday since my mum has made a point if making it messy and also making the dishes even  harder to clean. You have to scrub for ages to fully clean all the pots and pans . This was my punishment for saying I didn't want to clean the gashob everyday. I wish I'd never said anything at all. I'm so stupid. All I do is make things worse for myself.  Now, not only do I clean the gashob daily but also more pots and pans that are hard to scrub clean.  Since that day, I didn't mention the gashob being messy to my mum again.  I just get on with it and keep my mouth shut  in case it gets worse and worse.

I wish I could say ' I love you mum but I'm not just your cleaner,  I'm your daughter and I wish you could respect me a bit more'. But I can't,as my mum just twists what I'm saying.  It's now something like day 12 of cleaning it daily and I need advice. What can I do? I feel so defeated right now. I get punished everytime I say 'no' by even harder chores. Everything I do or say is the wrong thing to do or say.

300,"My dads got an amazing heart and everyone he meets adore him. I adore him, always have always will. But there is literally a burning rage inside of me these days that I feel out of control of. I even swore at him - I’ve never sworn INFRONT of him. It’s not good. 

My mum died really suddenly recently. My mum was my life, literally. My everything, not because I’ve developed an unhealthy awe of her since her death or anything just because she was the best person I ever met, I could go on about her kindness forever. 

And it’s her kindness that got her slumped with my dad in the first place. She thought she could fix his cheating, womanising, selfish, gambling and alcohol problem having ass. She never did. He’s a good man truly. And no one knows about any of these issues it is on the DOWN LOW hahahaha everyone thinks we had the perfect life, Dr and his wife and their daughter. Lol.  

They divorced when I was 12. I stayed to live with my dad cause I wanted to be close to my mum but then my dad got ill and he couldn’t look after me comfortably so I went to live with my mum. Best years of my life. We had a little apartment, it was just honestly the best quality time and memories ever. 

Two years of that and then we moved back in with him to financially support his fucking gambling self. That’s how selfless she is. Till the day she died she worked her fingers to the bone maintaining this house and this life for him. He remortgaged our house without telling us to fund himself, he constantly begged her for money and if she found the strength (from me begging her/screaming at her) to say no he’d punish her by behaving so sadly around the house the guilt would kill her. 

It was a constant conversation for her and I to leave, move abroad, move to another city, just get out of this cycle that was making her feel so stuck and crappy so we could be happier. I was just to graduate college, get some REAL money (she worked her fingers to the absolute bone for such a small salary :( ), and her and I could so easily live - she probably wouldn’t have even had to work. And then she died right before I graduate college in a few months b


I can’t help but feel so upset all the time about this inside. I’m so angry with him. I dream about the life she would have had if she met someone better. I wouldn’t even mind if I wasn’t here (I would never have been here to miss it anyways lol). She always said the only good thing that came from them was me. 


But even after all this speech..we were a family. And even though the romantic love got violently smothered to death by all his shit, I know in my heart that family love was there between them. Hence why she was so giving all her life. She would have done anything for him, she felt responsible for him. 

So. What now for me? I love my Dad. I’m an only child. He’s all I have. And I don’t want to upset him with my anger - I’m sure the guilt kills him every day anyways, he doesn’t need me to kick him when he’s down about things he’s screwed up in his life. He’s a grown old man, I’m sure he already know. But I just don’t know what to do with all this anger. Soon I start counselling so I 100% will offload the ENTIRE story, all the horrible bits I’ve left out and all, to them because they definitely won’t tell anyone. Other than that, I just don’t trust anyone with my close family secrets. 


I just feel alone. I miss my mum, my rock my friend my person. I feel like I’m just by myself now and then I feel so angry (and rightly fucking so) but so guilty for that anger and for the times once in a while where it does bubble up and I’m a bit harsh with him. It’s particularly tense because we’re handling her finances now and after all the fucking financial MESS he’s dragged us through OVER MY DEAD BODY will I allow all she has left to be fucking drained away on his debt. You must be joking. 

But then I worry....if I am financially strict with him how I always wished my mum was. What if he gets so upset or annoyed he does something bad? He’s already lonely, old, not many friends and dealing with the bereavement of his life partner who he knows in his soul deserved 5000 times better than him. But at the same time, those are his mistakes, and as long as I maintain our loving happy relationship the best I can I’m not being manipulated.

My boyfriend threw a small kickback for his birthday and invited his high school friend and some housemates. Everything was going great with the cake cutting and typical birthday ceremony, until his high school friend started turning it into a pity party for herself.

(Context:
The friend is going through a lot because of college, relationship problems, self image/esteem. She usually copes with self-deprecation, suicide, or eating disorder jokes. It’s usually tolerable, but gets worse when she drinks or hit up nicotine.)

I’m not even sure how the topic came up, but it just spiraled and went out of control. Friend starts turning the birthday party to all about her by talking about her problems. My bf and one of our housemates, being super helpful, tries to talk her into positivity and try to build up her self image.

It gets super uncomfortable for me and other housemate when suicide and anorexia is mentioned due to personal experience. We don’t mean to downplay her issues or problems, but it also felt extremely inappropriate for her to turn someone’s birthday party into a therapy session. We offered resources to free counseling on campus, but the friend brushed it off. 

At some point, my bf, his high school friend, and housemate turn it into a pity Olympics and it escalated. Housemate and her had to step out to talk, which he basically became a therapist for her.

She’s insecure with her relationships and constantly talks about how her bf would breakup with her or how her exes promise to stay and then break up with her. She would follow up with how lucky my bf and I are together regardless of our hardships or bad experiences with our exes. It makes me feel like I’m rubbing it in her face that I’m in a happy relationship and she’s not. So I try to avoid pda around her, which makes my bf upset that I’m not giving him attention and think I’m embarrassed to be with him.

After the kickback, she ends up staying the night because no one could drive her back home. Whenever she stays over after drinking, she’ll lay in bed and cry. Which makes it awkward for me, since the guest bed is also in my room. I have offered tissues and water, which she declines and cry even more.

I don’t like hanging around her because of the emotional labor that comes with it. I don’t know how to reply to her self-deprecation. I feel extremely uncomfortable with her jokes and constant negativity. It’s kinda silly on my end, but I feel like she’s guilt-tripping me into being friends when she says that she’ll kill herself if no one cares that she’s gone. I want to stop hanging out with her, but I don’t want my bf to cut off a friend because of me.

How do I approach her without sounding like I’m downplaying her mental health and struggles? Should I talk to my bf about why I don’t like being around her?  What should I say or do without sounding like an asshole?

306,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife (31F) has struggled with depression, anxiety, and a few other problems for, depending on the problem, the past 6+ months, to on and off battles to her entire life. I've been there, she's been there, but while I've currently mostly got my mental ducks \*mostly\* in a row, she's been suffering chronic problems for quite a while now. She's agreed recently that therapy, specifically probably something pharmacological, would suit her well, but she seems extremely reticent to take the next step.

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, therapists throughout her childhood either dismissed her problems or acted pretty terribly. To avoid going into details, I thoroughly respect the legitimacy of her complaints, although I don't think it's inevitable so much as bad luck. Either way, it built up some anxiety for her since... well, she anticipates throwing time and emotional effort down the tube for any given attempt, even while both of those things are in short supply. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, my philosophy as reflected by my own experience in the area, plus the philosophy reflected by many whom she's interacted with suggests that she's going to have to go through at least a couple therapists before finding one that really clicks, which - again - just not great for her motivation. This isn't to say I've emphasized it at all on any sort of proactive basis, just that, when the point comes up that she's heard it other places, I can't really say ""no that's not accurate"" and still consider myself honest, which means it's really hard to be reassuring when those concerns come up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, she's not opposed to the idea of seeing someone, and I think she's really, \*really\* close to getting some of the help she needs, but I don't really know how to help her over the edge to actually committing to something that might push her forward. Her last attempt,  a Dr. Appt to get a referral which didn't end well (although not something most people not suffering crippling motivational problems couldn't overcome) was over a month ago, and since then it's been really difficult to watch her slowly stew in her own misery and sorrow when I know there's a better life if she could pull herself out of her current pit (acknowledging that an inability to pull yourself out is in fact a symptom of the disease). 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is: anyone know of ways to encourage people to seek help to which they might be reticent to commit? I've tried a few tactics - nagging, baby steps, offering to tackle sub-tasks like finding someone or making the appt -  and while my tool box hasn't been exhausted yet, it's getting harder and harder to push on, even while it's still pretty discouraging to watch the emotional scourge continue.

As you can imagine as this is my first tattoo I’m quite worried. I’m not sure if this goes against the rules of this sub if it does just send me a pm if it does and I’ll remove the post.

318,"I graduated from my local uni with a degree in computing in 2016 and after a few months of volunteering with kids I jumped into a factory job in October. I've been there ever since.

My question is how likely am I to get an admin job when my only work experience is as a Production Operative? I'm honestly just after admin/reception work, I've never been really ambitious as far as my career goes (hence the local uni thing), but they all seem to want experience. Well, that's not entirely true but I'm worried that no matter what I apply for the recruiter will open up my CV and see I've been nothing put a Production Operative since I graduated and they'll just brush me off straight away. I can't stay here for much longer, three years in October. I'll never get out of this kind of work if I don't leave now.

As a bit of extra info, I have had two pay rises, I do quality control, packing and despatching, a bit of stock control plus all the different areas of work usually by myself, plus I'm one of the first aiders. I also do a lot of work with the company database, inputting data on products, booking them in and out of stock etc. But no customer service or any real admin work? Well, I'm not sure what I do counts as admin anyway. I fill in order sheets for despatch, database work, but that's it. I'm trusted and efficient and I know my managers love me. I've done graphic design work for the place I volunteered plus a couple of other odd jobs. 

Also, while I was at uni I was a student rep and the team leader for multiple group projects. I did database work, coding in Java and C#, IT project management, some work with actual robots, and some Adobe creative suite work, plus some other stuff. 

I can't afford to go back to uni, as much as I regret where I went and what I did, I can't do it. I was thinking of doing a masters but I don't think I could handle going back to uni. I learn better in the job. I can take a pay cut, money isn't the problem because I still live at home so I don't pay as much in rent as normal, and I have money saved up. 

I worry I need at least customer service skills, so does that mean I'm gonna have to quit and go work in a coffee shop or something? Do I have to go back to school? Quit and volunteer/do free work experience until I gain the experience I need? 

TLDR; how bad is it that my only real work experience is as a production operative? Will this hinder my chance of getting an interview?

320,"So I work for an EMS company, I do it to get medical experience but, the company I work for is not the best and recently I have just been frustrated.  The culture of my company is that the lowest people in the company the EMTs get the most shit but, can't say or do anything about it.  Often my managers and people who are higher than me would treat me with disrespect.  When someone higher does something wrong they won't get in trouble however if I do it then I would get in trouble.  Recently, I have had a bunch of problems with my company that I raised to my higher ups which ended up with me feeling like I would lose my job.  Some issues that were concerning me was that some of the ambulances were not up to date and was causing a safety issue.  If you report the issue after you left the base, logistics will just say deal with it until you get back to base.  However, if you get into a major accident you are fired.  Recently, I took the job as ALS operator which was awesome at first because I was getting more medical experience but, now it has became political.  The paramedics think they are gods and my company thinks they are gods too and would like me to treat them as such.  I also have extra responsibilities as well which is awesome but, it comes with no change in my pay which I do not like.  Lately I have debating if it is worth it to keep the ALS operator position (or my job in general) because I don't get paid to deal with the politics.  The other issue that I had with my company is that the higher ups likes to be verbally/emotionally abusive.  This is fine if I only see them for a few minutes but, when on the road I am being watched on cam.  The other thing that they don't officially say is that they listen to your conversation both on the cam and on the work phone.  I have not gotten penalized for anything like that but, I feel like they use that information to further make your life miserable.  The other issue that I have noticed is health issues, like when I put the work phone in my pocket I noticed that my balls started to hurt.  Why?  Because I figured out that the have been listening throughout my day.  So that cell phone radiation was going to my balls without no one telling me how bad it was for my health.  My company/workers doesn't care about respiratory health either and in fact doesn't penalize workers that smoke/vape near (or in) a building.  They also don't care that if when you drive an ambulance there is a burning oil smell and when you call in logistics they tell you to deal with it.  They would also tell you to deal with it even if you have been smelling car exhaust and you suddenly start getting bone pain.   My last issue that I noticed with healthcare in general is there is still a bit of racial superiority.  I noted that generally the lighter skin people were treated more kindly.  I am guessing that is everywhere I go but, I just wanted to also get that out of my chest.  


At first, I could deal with the verbally/emotionally abuse but, now its become an every day thing.  In addition, to the verbal/emotionally abuse my company would go out of there way to make sure that something on the bus doesn't work.  Like radio, wifi etc.  This tacit was recently stopped but, I just wanted to put that out there too.  What really got me mad was the health dangers that was apparent in my workplace and no one caring.  I feel like the managers all know the dangers but, does not want to do anything about it.  They have an unofficial company policy called ""respect the order"" which means just do as your told and heard one or two people mentioning it.  Once I learned about the health issue I try to avoid it as much as humanly possible.  I still can't believe that my company will knowingly put someone's health in danger like that.  I am thinking about leaving my workplace but, in the mean time I am stuck with it.  


I would like to get some advice on how to deal with a company/managers like this?  Sadly to say, I feel like I might have to deal with situations like this in the future and I am not sure what I should do.  I also fear that my company would like to just ruin my reputation if they don't like me and make it difficult for me to find a new job.

322,"First post on any advice subreddit, lemme give you all some backstory first
One year ago I moved to another country with my mom, stepfather and two younger sisters. I can barely speak the language of this country and for this reason I haven't been able to make any friends. Coupled with my difficulties in school and general lack of social skills, you can imagine it's been... really hard for me, and taken a toll on my mental health. I regularly start crying for no apparent reason, can barely sleep at night and the only thing I have that keeps me going is knowing I'm going to move back in a few years.
...I'm not even sure about that anymore
Things happened, and now there isn't any specific date I'd move back in. I also got into some trouble in school. More than once.
My mom finally gave up on me. She said that I can either move back and live with my dad (who I've always had a rocky relationship with) but that way I'll at least be back home, or she will take my phone away (only way I can talk to my old friends, pretty much my only way of coping with everything that has been going on).
My mom has always been really supportive of me, but this time she said that if I end up moving I can't ever come back.
Which means that now I kinda have to decide between taking the risk of going back home and things getting even worse or staying here and risk never feeling better.
As a few side-notes, my mom's financial situation is way more stable than my dad's, but she decided she won't help me in any way if I move back.
So, should I do it? Or should I stay here?",28Feb2019,1
324,"My girlfriend fucked one of her friends a while ago and it’s fucked me up ever since because when she did it we were friends with benifits but I figured since we spent so much time together I’d be her first. Anyways a month after they fuck, we started going out and the dude bounced. He just recently texted her saying how he wants to talk. I told her I want comfortable about this multiple times but she continued texting him anyways. He wants to see her after school on Thursday and I think she’ll do it since I’m working that day.

Yesterday though, she told me how she told him off and is cutting him off this time. I believe her. Today out of no where she looks at me and say “why are you looking at me like I’m hiding something?”. I’m confused. I decide to ask “can I see the message you sent that dude?”. She gets super defensive almost as if she’s hiding something. She says she deleted the messages on instagram. I bluff and say “well I know how to get them back”. She pauses. I ask “can I see your phone?”. Again, she gets super defensive saying “why?” And calling me names and shit. She tried everything in the book to get me to drop it but I wasn’t. She finally walked off to her bus saying “don’t even wait for me after class”. As we speak she’s probably deleting everything involving him or something I don’t know. 

My friends say I take all her crap because I’m young (only 18) and because she’s my first love. 

Should I see her after class and ask for her phone again or tell her I feel like your hiding something and things gotta end?

P.s. I was already planning on breaking up on her, see why in my previous post.

[update] just saw her this morning and only stared at her. The only thing on my mind was dumping her but before that I wanted to talk to her mom since she like me and tell her how much of a hoe her daughters been. I feel like that’s too petty though. Maybe I’ll just say bye or something. Anyways when I saw her this morning she said “i don’t know if your looking for an apology because you’re not getting one”. She also said “I know I overreacted yesterday but you wouldn’t respect my request to just drop it”. I see her again after this period so what should I say to her? Or should I stay quiet?

326,"Have a mad crush on a girl, like for ages, and she turned me down nicely a few months ago after finding out herself I liked her without me saying anything. Since then, I’ve become good friends with her and will talk to and see her multiple times a week. I’ve even tried and help her with a guy friend of mine that she likes (she got rejected as well). She’s apparently getting setup by some of her friends with a pretty good sounding, older guy and I feel like now would really be a perfect time to finally get over her before she possibly gets into a relationship.

327,"There is a new male student who just transferred into our school, but prior to that he would message people about how he needs friends so he would be beaten up.

Mostly everyone thinks he is weird guy with some red flags since without meeting a female student of mine in highschool he has already forged, what he thinks as a deep friendship. My mates initially just though he was a person who is desperate for attention or a girlfriend.

However when he finally arrived at school he wasn’t very confident in his actual social skills and would often be judge or criticised by the females in our grade. He was a completely different person online compared to offline and thats had ticked of some of my friends. But some of my friends think he is either on the spectrum or just extremely socially awkward so we just trying to be open minded.

He started associating with me after I helped him out find where his classes were and I was asking general questions like “why he moved schools”.  I founded out that he was bullied by the entire school or was the laughing stock of his previous school.

Overall he tried connect with everyone by randomly sitting with other people which made theme extremely uncomfortable. My friends are kinda what you would call the “funny not popular group” so being the idiots my friends were they started tease him as well as offering actual advise to him. But half of my friends had already hate him due to his behaviour of ’trying to be cool just to fit in.’

During a business studies class my friend talks about a badly photoshoped image of our teacher as I was bought in with a baguette. The teacher said it was student to teacher bullying even when the hypocrite of a teacher purposely tease and gossip about us behind our backs. We didn’t know who showed him the image as it was only in our  private social networking circle.

Anyways the student said I was the sole creator  and had JOKINGLY snitched on me thinking the our teacher was cool. In the heat of the moment I said swore at him beneath my voice and kinda disowned him as I was getting told off and prompted a detention or at worst a suspension.

I had to snitch on the my other friend or I had to suffer a more serious consequence. My friend said it was ok since I was placed into that situation by the new student. How my entire grade is witchhunting him, but I had quickly apologised to him for my words and the same with him after school,  since I realise this could end like his previous school. 

I’m also genuinely concern for him as my nice friend told me he was self-harming by hitting his head and was on the verge of breaking down. Now after its after school and I have been messaging my grade saying it’s is genuinely not his fault. But he keep creating group chats basically shooting himself in the foot and playing by playing it off as the victim not excepting what has happened. And my fucking retarded friends brought in his old bully into this for some reason.  I kept telling everyone to relax and move on but both the new student and my grade keeps attack each other over text, which is stupid in my opinion.

I have fully accepted the responsibility of what I have done and I honestly just what the kid to have a more normal social life. However everyone in my grade keeps bring him down due to the incident I truly want this drama to all stop. But with the entire grade joining the hate bandwagon it must be a total nightmare for him and I can only imagine the other trash people are saying to him behind his back. I honestly don’t know what to do to help or stop him. As he is unknowingly adding fuel to the fire my lashing back.

328,"first things is this is obviously a throwaway account. 


so i understand this is illegal and i’m starting to think about the consequences. i can’t necessarily talk to my parents about it or any other adult i know so the internet is my anchor point right now as well as my sinking weight. 



on any platform i’ve used (primarily instagram and snapchat) i’ve use throwaway accounts with no relation to my main email address, main phone number or real name. but i do think that when i go to college/ job applications they will link these throwaway accounts to me and i will probably go to prison. so i’m scared and that’s my main question i want advice for. could background checks link me to those accounts? 




my second question is that since it is somewhat child pornography as well as proper pornography what are the consequences if i do get caught? and i’ve never paid for any this, ive received all of it for free with permission from which ever female i asked, so could that help me in some way?

She had been hanging out with a guy maybe once a week for the past 6 months and was really hoping he would finally DTR.  They would hang out about once a week, mostly when she was housesitting because they he would visit that house and they would get physical. She was upset that they never went “out” or on real dates. 

He never would pre-plan a hangout either. She would always just be wondering when they would see each other next. Sometimes she would even stay after work instead of driving home which is outside of town just hoping he would text back to see if they could hang out..

Right around Valentine’s Day he told her he doesn’t like he “as he should” and he just liked having sex with her. She was really upset and stopped replying to his messages for a while. 

Now they’re talking again and she again hopes they will date.  He told her he also doesn’t like her because she smokes and posts too much on social media. She’s upset that he didn’t give her a chance to change - like to stop smoking for him. 

What would you do? I have said small things like “he doesn’t sound great” and “you’ll find someone who treats you better.”  Would you really let her know how you feel or does her being young mean she has to figure it out on her own?

In this time we texted a lot, and I really liked her over text, but when we were together, she was awkward and always seemed uncomfortable and never talked. In this week that we were talking, we went on one date alone, and we went on a fieldtrip together where we got to spend the whole day with each other. After this field trip, I realized we just didn’t vibe, no matter how fantastic of a person she is, we just didn’t have that romantic energy, and she confronted me at the end, and we broke things off. She has depression and anxiety and didn’t know what she wanted, and would tell me all the time that she didn’t want to get her hopes up. I was very open with her, and having just recently got out of a relationship, let her know I wanted to take things slow and would give it a chance. I’m not a scumbag, so I was exclusively talking to her and made sure she knew that. I was committed to at least giving the relationships a try. But when we broke it off, she started accusing me of leading her on, and her mom even called me yelling at me telling me she was bawling her eyes out and I broke her heart and I shouldn’t have done what I did to her daughter, and that after everything she’s been through in her life, I shouldn’t have done that.

338,"  

This may end up being longer than some are willing to read, but I feel like it may help by just putting it all out there. Please excuse me if it seems like I am rambling or sort of all over the place, but I'm just going to lay it out as it comes to me. If you deem this as the wrong place to post I am happy for other suggestions. 

Id like to preface this by saying that I'm really in no position to be ""complaining"", as I know my situation is far better than most would ask for. 

**Here's a little about my situation:** I'm in my mid 20's and married to my high school sweetheart. I have a young but promising career in information security. I am finishing up my masters degree which of course can only help my cause. I own a home, drive a ""nice"" car, and outside of those I have minimal debt. Mine and my wife's families are outstanding and supportive. I have what most would consider a extra large group of people who have been and will continue to be genuine friends to me. I'm not a bad looking guy, considered extremely intelligent by most that know me, and excel at most everything that I try my hand at. If you would have asked me 10 years ago what I dreamed my next decade would be like, it would have fallen short of where I am. 

With that being said, for a while now I cannot help but feel like I am not doing enough. Like I have fallen short of my potential and that I am being held down. I have always been a go getter, and I generally always have had the things that I want and need thanks to it. That has always been material though, and I feel like what I really want is more fulfillment of the life I am living. It's hard for me to express the way I feel about this as I have ALWAYS been the happy/funny guy, and I never once have had to question any one of my feelings. Generally I would be on the other side of this looking to help someone who may be feeling lost. I just feel as if I have fallen into the work to live, until you die trap, that unfortunately has become the standard. I have so much more to offer than that but I just feel held back. Held back by my job, bills (which I can afford), etc. The normal things that we are brought up to expect to have to do. I am good at what I do but it is not what I want to do. 

The arts have always inspiring to me. I listen to, talk about, explore music constantly. I have and can play a few instruments. I get lost in thoughts about movie and TV show's deeper meanings for sometimes hours after I've seen them. I read to learn about the casts, the scripts, the production for everything I see. I love the way one person can mold a character that was once only on paper, into something so great and unique. I read books about/written by my favorite actors to see what it was like growing into the person that are now, outside of character. More importantly I envy the platform they have to be able to be a voice for what matters to them. I have seen first hand how musicians and actors along with the fictional characters they often play can become so influential and so meaningful, sometimes for someone who needs it most. Other times there may be less meaning, but either way there's a story being told. I want to be that for someone. Whether I know it or not, I want to have the opportunity to do something that I love everyday knowing I am providing for myself and my family, and potentially leaving a lasting impression on someone who needs it.

This is where my issue lies. I have ZERO actual formal experience in anything theatrical beyond what I see/hear/read. That does not stop me from constantly thinking about what it would take to make a run at it. At my age, and in my situation it just does not seem feasible. That is where my new found ""anxiety"" comes into play and why I feel trapped. I have always been able to do what I wanted, but I can't now. Why did I not think about this earlier? It's not a practical lifestyle for 99% of people who choose it. I have been gifted with a very stable lifestyle and maybe I was scared to risk that. I have no concern's over whether I am cut out or fit to do such a thing; Again I am not trying to boast but I generally excel at the things I do. 

So what would it take. Is it worth risking everything I have for something that even as I write this sounds so silly. Would it cost me my house, wife, or family. I know it would cost me my job. In a sense that sounds so relieving, yet at the same time, so unnerving. 

I often fantasize about uprooting everything and starting somewhere new and something new, knowing that at this point that is all it will ever be. A fantasy. Partially because I have no idea how to begin again, and partially because when you come from the Midwest especially from families like my wife and I do, going away is never really ""on the table"". Everyone stays close. My wife is keen to this idea. 

Idk where I really am going with this, but I just wanted to get someone else's opinion on what they think about it all. It sounds kind of crazy to me, but it has also felt great to put this in writing for even just one person to see. Maybe arts is not what I want either. I think it is, but again, is it realistic. It's not fair to me or anyone close to me at this point to start moving in reverse. There is so much more I feel like I want to say but I think I will leave it at this for now.

   
 Thanks in advance. For any advice that may come, or even just any conversation. I really am in a pit like i've never felt before and talking seems like the best thing to do. ",28Feb2019,1
339,"I work in a small office and have a colleague who I believe suffers from high functioning Asperger's, ADHD, amongst other health issues. He's on a concoction of medication which he talks about openly, including antipsychotics and whatever else.

I try my best to get on with my job and we don't have much interaction for the most part.

He is very indulgent in many areas, for example his diet, which consists of nothing but fast food, KFC, burgers, pizza, sweets, energy drinks etc. Needless to say he lives an unhealthy lifestyle. His desk is filthy and covered with McDonald's happy meal toys and sweets and empty cans of drink. I know I shouldn't really care about what he eats/drinks, however he goes on about his food, and announces his lunch plans to everyone every day. He boasts about how much caffiene he is going to drink, and how much alcohol he drinks all the time. He constantly has the shakes. He lives with his parents and spends most of his time playing video games and is a stereotypical nerd.

Now I don't really care about what he does, it's his body right? However the fact he constantly talks about it every day means I can't not pay attention. He speaks VERY loudly (probably dependant on his caffiene intake) and it's making it really difficult for me to focus on my work without putting in headphones to drown out the noise, which means I'm not aware of things going on in the business that I should be aware of.

I've complained to my boss about him being a big distraction for me, my boss said he wasn't sure what else he could do apart from build a wall like Donald trump. I'm not the only person who has issues working in the same space as him.

340,"We were together for like 5 years so it was a big thing, anyway it's been about 4 years since we spoke and she messaged me telling me she has a baby with her current boyfriend, it was weird and random but I congratulated her and that was it, she messages me again saying that she just wanted to talk to me ""cos I know who she is"" and telling me she is having a bad time with her boyfriend. She starts telling me she thinks of our past relationship sometimes and misses it, would of done things differently etc. She starts telling me about her kid and her school work etc, the baby, she tells me about motherhood and breastfeeding etc. I figured she just wanted a familiar face to vent to. So she tells me that her boyfriend is upset we are talking and apologised but she told me she had to go. She did call me twice though but I don't answer phone calls for an anxiety reason. Then about an hour later she messaged me again telling me he has gone out and she wants to know what I have been up to the last 4 years. Again I think she just wanted to chat but then she tells me that she cares about me and wants to know how I am doing, I tell her but then she says ""I got to go again im sorry we can't talk it'll upset my bf"". At this point I am not even sure if she just messaged me to make me think about her or something like that and I asked her if she was just trying to wind me up, she says no and starts talking to me about some things going on in her life and I tell her a little about what I have been up to the last 4 years. She asks me for my number and we talk a little more about random things, like her new pets etc and tells me that if I need something I can message her but normal chit chat would not be kind to her boyfriend. And she blocks me but then unblock me to give me her number and apologised again and stopped talking to me. This on and off a few times 

I can't tell if she just wanted to vent to a familiar face of she is trying to get my attention for some reason. Either way it is pretty weird but maybe it's just cos she is an ex, I feel like there is some motive behind it. I told her I care about her too (just in a well being sort of way) and we ended the conversation for the last time. I am torn between her just wanting a familiar face to talk to and/ or some sort of feelings of game going on. I feel like she will message me again and I am not sure how to respond.

I've had fairly serious depression for a couple years now after I was raped by a close friend, and self harmed a lot, I know i'm stupid for doing that.

My country is quite cold atm and I don't really wear anything short sleeved anyway, so i figured it wouldn't matter for a while. But then I found out we have school injections next Wednesday (in 6 days). I thought that it would be fine at first, I'd just cover with some foundation. But then i remembered how they wipe the site which would likely remove the foundation. So essentially I'm a bit fucked.

344," 

So, right now i am sitting at an university m(27). I started a couple of years later them most.

(10 years old) When i was kid i was a victim to something that I've never really talked about. It lasted for quite some time, and while i never really thought about it before this year because of some medical issues that might have some relation to what happens.

(18)When i started in high school i changed my life around. I started to be out going and did a lot to help my friends and the school. I became president of the student counsel, got good grades and helped my sister (10 years older) and brother in law raising their daughter, i had a ton of friends and was popular. My girlfriend at the time and i couldn't have sex because of what happen earlier in my live and she ended up cheating on my with my friend in class, and he started openly mocking me for my inability and the rest of my class found out. This started a series events. couple this with dealing with my friends death and my dads cancer it launched my into a deep depression and a long substance abuse. I dropped out of high school and i started working different kinds of jobs. I learned to bury my stuff even deeper and became almost unable to deal with people. I was very angry at women especially.

(age 22)Years later i was with a very bad crowd and looked up to this kind of lifestyle. i was kinda smart (compared to most) and had started building up some muscles so i was slowly being let in. I never really got very deep. One day at a festival i was looking at my life style, the people around me. I took my stuff and i left it all behind. I quit drugs, alcohol and bad influences. i moved back with my parents and started getting better. I saved up a lot of money, i started traveling the world, finished high school and found peace of mind and happiness.

(age 24) I started university. On the first day i met the love of my world. She was really not my type at first. But she was amazing. We where together a year before she moved to Canada, sadly our relationship didn't last, since then i have spent a lot of time alone.

(age 27) today, My older sister f(37) and her husband are having relationship issues , he may or may not have forced many times. The have 3 children and i am so far away that i can't really help except listening to my sister and her issues. He is pretty much holding her economically hostage. She is finally getting ready to leave him. I convinced our parents to give her any economical help she might need to get out of this and they have made preparations.

I am writing this because i feel so exhausted. relationships, friends as well as girls have really soured lately. i feel like a teenager unable to deal with easy emotions. i have spend a lot of time these past yew years trying to open my self up. It has gone very well. But lately i started drinking again. a lot.

But the biggest issue is that i cant seem to relate to people and it feels like everyone is out to get me. i cant have fun. I know it is not like this. but because of a couple of situations with a girl i had feelings about and ended up being super award and unable to talk to her, even though we used to talk a lot, have sex and such, kind of starting a relationship. its like i have gone back to the high school version of me. I don't know what to say. i want to tell people my story to explain my recently especially weird behavior. but it feels like i am just want to tell them to get out of problems or something. I have never told my story to anyone. maybe bits and pieces but never the full story especially not first part.

Truth is I really don't know to say or feel lately. I could really use someone else opinion on my situation.

I lost myself, I lost him, I lost everything, really.

I made the mistake of not giving him space and also allowing my emotions to take over more than actual reasoning.

I genuinely miss that connection we had before everything fell to shit... And the fact that we allowed it to fall to shit and not get ourselves together is what stresses me.

358,"First time poster, I hope I’m doing it right. Long story incoming, my apologies:
If i may get right into it, I would like to ask advice regarding my perceived relationship with my psychologist. To give a quick historical summary, I have been visiting psychologists for 8 years now, since I was 16. Five years ago, after a bad break-up, I entered an office close to home, where I was helped for 4 years by a psychologist named N. She helped me with my issues with my parents and quasi-neglectful upbringing, my fear of communication, and other stuff. I really liked her, but when she told me after 4 years that she would switch me to another psychologist because she couldn’t teach me anything new, I agreed. Variety is the spice of life and all that.

So I ended up with psychologist A., a woman of 24 (same age as me) whom I happened to know from elementary school. I was told this would not be a problem if I did not consider it one, which I didn’t. What I didn’t mention, because it didn’t matter to me at all (we were about 7 years old, after all, and the experience did not feel like it had been an incredibly profound one), was that she was my very first ‘kiss’, the way 7-year-olds sometimes mush lips together because they’re curious about grown-up behavior. I mention this now because some people do consider this important, even if I don’t.

A. immediately became more interpersonal. She agreed to speak with me every week, I shared some television shows with her that I thought she might be interested in, I shared some written material with her that she enjoyed and after which she was eager to read more, stuff like that. However, at one point she offered me a ride to where I needed to be, and, even though I couldn’t agree anyway because I had other commitments, this kinda seemed disagreeable to me.

I have to admit that I have a tendency to label any kind of friendly contact as a sign of something bigger. So, when I once again felt a bit neglected by my close family and realized that i was seeing my psychologist as a substitute ‘friend’, I also realized that I was wrongly attributing this relationship. But, I wondered, I do think she really likes me as a person? She offered me a ride, after all. Asking her if we would have been friends if we had not been doctor and client, she agreed.

I was starting to idealize her, and am even starting to consider studying psychology (I am almost done with my studies in Film and Literary sciences, my true passion, but I’d like to keep learning/maybe I’m a bit hesitant about entering the job market/I might just be trying to mirror myself to A., who has led a blessed life and immediately ended up where she wanted to be, if her stories are to be believed (are these things it is normal to know about your psychologist?)). I can admit it turned into a bit of a crush, which I know would/should never be reciprocated.

Asking different people what they thought of this, I often got the response they did not agree with the way my psychologist was acting towards me, finding it unprofessional.

I decided to tell my psychologist that I had kinda lost sight of the borders between us, and what I should do, as it was really affecting me mentally. Bluntly put, I wanted her to affirm our friendship so that I would know we were sympatico, at which point I would feel validated, but would also trust her enough so I could be more vulnerable and tell her more so that I could be helped with my mental state (I can imagine readers might consider this a wrong approach). But, if A. was going to tell me I was misinterpreting things, which I considered a strong possibility, then I would need to figure out where it all went wrong.

Her answer, after telling her everything that was bothering me, was something that struck me as odd. She started to speak but stopped herself, and then said: ‘Now I’m explaining myself, and i don’t think I have to do that to you.’ ‘Could you explain that?’ I asked. ‘Well, I know you know where the borders are between us, and so (I don’t accurately remember the second part, so I’ll paraphrase) I don’t have to redefine them with an explanation.’ This seemed like a strange answer to me. I had told her that something had gone wrong regarding the borders of our relationship, and this seemed like a covering move to pretend as if nothing had gone wrong. She told me that we would keep discussing this, but she also made an appointment with previous psychologist N. for me, so that I could discuss this. I told her I was surprised she didn’t immediately break contact, having braced myself for this. ‘Well, she said, then it’s good you can now realize being truthful doesn’t always lead to negative social repercussions.’

Well, how ironic, because N. called me up a week later. ‘I was told by A. about the situation, and we will talk about this, so until then you don’t have to visit with A. anymore, or I won’t be up to date.’ Smelling an excuse, I asked her if A. was still my psychologist. ‘No... we don’t think she can offer you the proper therapeutic help anymore.’

Talking with N. in a session later, I told her this whole story (leaving out the ride and the crush I had, so as not to get anybody in trouble), and she immediately told me she knew I was at risk for this. Well, I thought, getting a bit angry, after 5 years, why wasn’t I told? If we consider A.’s behavior to be perfectly okay, why was she assigned to me without a more transparent approach? I might not fully realize this situation, but I was the one who mentioned it and tried to solve it. I’m not a complete idiot. N. was apologetic and that helped, because I felt like they had left me twisting in the wind a bit. An outside psychologist agreed with me on this, finding it strange none of these issues were ever discussed if they were known. But he didn’t really want to discuss A. fearing ‘legal repercussions if this goes too far’ (which I don’t want, I just want clarity), and, when pushed, I think he came to the conclusion that it was simply a friendly approach that I had an intense response to. ‘If you feel up to it, you could restart this relationship and see if this time, you could keep a clear head and not lose sight of things.’

So, to make a long story short: Is he right? Am I simply responding to intensely to A.’s simply friendliness? Am I correct in finding her approach to be indicative of not accepting the whole story/her role in this? Please be completely honest with me, if I’m simply being an idiot somebody needs to tell me. I discussed this with friends, but I don’t want to keep harping on about it with them, you know how that goes: after a while it gets annoying, and I should try to let go anyway.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me.",28Feb2019,1

366,"I’m feeling a little down because I don’t feel like I really matter.  It comes down to a lot of different factors, I’ll try to go through each one.

First comes my work life.  I work for a place that has been a literal dream for me for so many years.  I don’t want to name what it is for fear of doxxing myself, but it’s an internationally known organization that does amazing things.  If I had to name places I’d want to work at, it would easily be in the top three.  Trick is though, I am working a relatively meaningless position that doesn’t have too much to do with the amazing work going on throughout the rest of the organization.  I work a support role that honestly isn’t wholly necessary.  I plan on being here for my career if at all possible and working my way up to something more crucial and meaningful, but I know that will take a long time.  For the time being, I just feel so bureaucratic, bored and meaningless.  There’s not much I can’t truly add and it feels rough not meaning much to the overall goals of the organization.

Also there’s my home life.  I have a great wife who is always loving and supporting.  I also have great friends who spend a lot of time with me.  But sometimes it hurts a little when I see them without me.  My wife sometimes doesn’t have a lot of time for me because she is consumed with work or other friends, and my friends tend to just assume I’ll be busy with work or my wife and also do a lot without me.  I feel like I do a lot for them and try my best to be there for them, handle favors and chores, and just all around be supportive, but I don’t feel like all of this is necessarily returned.

It just hurts sometimes feeling kind of unappreciated, and without much value.  Like if I suddenly died, it wouldn’t matter too much to my workplace or people in my lives.  They’d just move on fine without me.

368,"Dear Reddit. 

I'm a 28 year old (m) who has been working in a call centre/ customer service role for a large utilities company for the past 4 years. Recently I took some time off work for mental health reasons, some of which may or may not have been relating to the job ( depending on your perspective of course). 

During this time off I needed to have a look at my life, choices, people I was surrounding myself with and of course my job. 

I came to the conclusion that my job was making me miserable and that I couldn't motivate myself to deal with customers with care anymore and had no pride left in the work I was doing so I quickly got into the headspace of what's the point. 

Fast forwards a couple of months and I have since returned to my job. Upon returning I have quickly realised that I love the people I work with, I really like our office, the shift I have really suits my needs and lifestyle and to be frank, the pay and benefits are fantastic. Of course with the pros, there must be cons. 

The cons at the moment are that the company is looking to close a major office in our region so in the next year our two we could all be offered redundancy and let go,at which point the market will be saturated with people looking for work and may make it difficult to find another role for my skill set. This has caused an atmosphere of tension and the company isn't hiring anyone new until a decision has been made. So for all the people that have left( 42 and counting this year alone) the work load is being picked up by those that remain. So the solution has been to upskill everyone to be able to do everything and thus the goal post for our bonuses have all changed and we are all being micromanaged on skills that are very new with no consideration for the staff. The training of these new skills has been lackluster to say the least and our pay is being affected. 

I have since applied for a new job in the mean time and have been offered the position. My hesitation is that the company is relatively small and new in the grand scheme of things and some reviews left online by former employees has left me with some doubts. The shift is not very accommodating of my lifestyle and I feel this may be a rushed decision / forced change on my part?

I would really welcome some feedback/ perspective on my predeciment if you could find the time. I hope the above made sense, I have had to type this on a mobile.

The story is its really complicated as there are many players who were involved who messed it up for us out of their self interest and I had some problems from the beginning.

After I met her, I faced stalking, harassment, threats etc. for 8 months (still ongoing) and when I conveyed this to her she did not believe me, gaslighted and later lied to me, thereafter I told her that I want OUT and LEAVE her.

Then my reputation, my livelihood was attacked, so much I would be attacked by her stalkers no matter where I went. So the only way out for me was to talk to her and fix it which sounds simple but she refuses to act like an adult and do that too. Instead, I am continually stalked and attacked every-time I try do things that she does not approve of?

I want to fix this or move on because I need a female companionship and need to rebuild my life. I can't be in prison of this girl forever. But she does not understand this and now she knows about what happened instead of apologising and fixing the situation she USES the stalkers to harass me whenever she dislikes what I am doing..........BUT refuses to talk to me? and I was NEVER in relationship with her and we never had sex or anything WTF?

How can I fix situation with her? What do I tell her? I don't understand this girl at all.",28Feb2019,1
370,"I just received my feedback for an exam I took recently. I didn't do as well as I could have and I wanted to make sure why. 

A friend of mine had a higher grade, and we had done the same questions on the exam, so we asked to have our feedback at the same time. 

My lecturer pointed out a few times where I could have gone into more detail, and I clarified by saying that I went into detail later in the work. (Which I did.) 

She seemed to keep wanting to hurry me along through the paper, so I kept asking her to go back because I didn't understand her points. And when I said that, she would just repeat the same point. She seemed to be getting agitated, but I needed to understand the feedback so I kept asking questions. I have a feeling that she thought I was trying to challenge her. Which I guess I was in a way, but not to say she was wrong, only to clarify her points because they didn't make sense to me. 

Then my friend had her feedback and it was fine. Afterwards, my friend asked if she could take a photo of her paper so that I could read it (I didn't request that). But my lecturer said that it isn't right and that if I don't understand the paper after her spending 30 minutes explaining it to me, then she can't help me. I told her that it wasn't about her, it just helps me to understand my issues sometimes if I compare my work to another student with a higher grade. 

I've never had an interaction with her like this and I'm wondering how I should handle the situation? I'm contemplating going to speak with her about it, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong - and don't feel like I owe an apology. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",28Feb2019,10
372,"Alright so this girl that i go to the same high school with one day just started talking about me with her friends and looking at me when i’m around. She also waved everytime she sees me. I just brushed it all off as a troll. Whenever she tried to talk to me I didn’t really say much because I didn’t care and she thought I was uncomfortable. And then later on one of my friends gives her my number, we talk a little, pretty dry. She asks if i would ever date her. I go along with it and say yes and ask if she wants to date right now. She says something about how we don’t know each other and can’t date. Alright. Next day she tries to talk with me again and I don’t say much because again, I don’t care. When I come home I see a text from her saying “This won’t work”, I reply “What won’t?” and she replies “We will never be together, you’re so quiet and awkward.”, I reply back with“Great.” and she asks “Are you mad?” and I say “ Obviously not, why would I?” “Idk😂”
2 weeks later after constantly waving at me when she sees me. She comes up to talk to me, I’m suddenly her “friend” and she says she saw me eating pizza and says she wants me to buy her a pizza tommorrow. I say yes, but obviously I’m not gonna do it.

373,"Info before the question:
- groupchat 1 has someone without a subscription but he works at the movie theater. So joining a film is a hassle since he can only join if the room has a certain amount of empty seats and having the exact spot next to us free.

So there is this group chat made for people with a subscription for the movie theater (groupchat 1) which I left because I cancelled my subscription. Last week I subscribed again but made a different group chat exclusively for people who have a subscription.

375,"Hello, does anyone know how I can get rid of depression or anxiety somehow?
My depression is becoming so bad to a point where I don’t feel anything, no happiness, excitement, hope, expectations. Everything feels meaningless right now, anxiety is also as high as ever, my heart is constantly racing and I feel like something bad is about to happen all the time. I also don’t have any motivation for anything that I do, I can’t study at all, I can’t eat properly, my apartment has become so messy, I can’t make any friends, any relationships, nothing!
I tried to reach out to my family but my parents never believe me, they just tell me it’s normal. My brother just dismisses it, and I didn’t bother my sister with it because she already has enough on her plate, and I only see her once every few years.
It started 2 years ago, and the worst thing is that before I was the happiest person you can see, doing anything, even studying, used to make me happy because I felt like I was making a difference somehow to someone. Now I don’t feel anything, except for the constant pain in my heart.
This past month it has become so bad that I’m even having suicide thoughts a lot, I just feel like it’s an easy way to just finally rest.
I’m sorry if I talked too much here, but I really need some advice because it’s unbearable, I’m currently in my university and I just have this urge to quit everything, just leave this place and jump in front of the tram or something outside.",28Feb2019,1
377,"Full disclosure: I was bullied as a child, and that contributed to being diagnosed with depression and general anxiety as an adult. When I walk into a room I automatically feel inferior/feel like no one likes me. I've tried different meds and therapy with very little progress.

I'm now well into my 30s and dont have a degree or any specialized training. I've worked in general manual labor for the last decade +. A few years ago, I found myself working in a shop with a group of guys that I mostly enjoyed working with. Except for one, we'll call him ""will"". Will was quite a bit older than me, and he became something of a bully. I tried to avoid him, but it was a small space and it just wasnt possible. When he was by himself, he was decent, but when a large group was present, he would begin demeaning our coworkers, myself included, and I took it to heart. I approached the shop manager, whom I was friends with, hoping he would just tell him to knock it off. Instead, he took me to our area manager and had a meeting, the a.m. promised he'd get it resolved, and a few days later he had a follow up. He claimed will was just ""old school"" and it was all a big misunderstanding. Back in the old days it was common practice to rib each other, and he didnt know it upset me. I was assured it wouldnt happen again. Things were fine for a few days, until I walked into the shop one day, and will loudly exclaims ""alright funs over, that pussy nyjets42347 will run to management if we say anything else."" The bad thing is, my shop manager was standing right there. I asked him to handle it, and he just looked away, mumbled something about 'thats enough will' and pretended like it didnt happen. It didnt get better. And I ended up leaving. 

Now I find myself in a different workplace, but a similar situation. Most of my coworkers are pleasant to deal with one on one, but when theres a large group, such as meetings, they begin insulting one another. I try to distance myself, but it's impossible. I dont join in, and try to make it known that I dont enjoy it. Even management participates, sometimes they initiate it. I recently had a conversation with management in private, and it became public knowledge, and I'm getting ridiculed over it. Most coworkers seem to enjoy it in a group setting, but in private will confess they dont like it. 

I'm not sure what to do. It's really hard to just pretend it doesnt exist, and it seems like this line of work, it's just expected. A 'boys will be boys', 'we dont have a PC culture' type of atmosphere. I'd love to find a different job, but all of my experience is in this line of work and with a family to support, I make too much money to just walk away. What should I do?",28Feb2019,1

I didn’t question it since it was normal for her and her friend to do that so I woke up this morning.

I was confused so I looked in the restroom and didn’t see anything and then I went to the shower. I saw my dirty underwear I must’ve dropped was on the floor.

383,"I 21(F) from Perth, Western Australia want to just leave everything behind and go some place else. 

I have an apartment that I live in with my boyfriend (27) and I’m halfway through my degree studying criminology (dropped out of law because I was too stressed). I work part time at a cinema. My family and I keep in touch, but it’s hard to accept my parents alcoholism when I’ve been on the road to recovery for alcohol addiction myself over the past two months. 

I’ve had this urge to just leave everyone behind for a while. I have one long term best friend , who I don’t see that often and she seems to have a lot of other friends . I do volunteer work in a prison and sometimes go camping (which I love), but I really just want to work a lot, save some money and just move to a different country and see what happens. 
I’m incredibly bored and I’m tired of seeing my old “friends” going out without me. I also feel angry? or jealous? with a physical pit in my stomach when I see  people I know traveling, getting married, buying a house, having kids, graduating or just “doing well and moving up” in life.

I don’t know how to be comfortable and feel so uneasy about my identity. 

The happiest I’ve ever felt in my life is when I haven’t “needed” anything; ie- when I volunteered in Cambodia and hiked in the jungle for a month (15) and when I backpacked Europe for 2 months on my own (18). Each day I focused on what I needed to do to stay alive, ie - where I was going to eat, sleep etc. Before any one asks I have been independent since I was 13 - working 2 jobs at a time to look after myself financially.

I’ve never really been around deaths my entire life. We’re both only 17 and i am fortunate enough to have all four of my grandparents, both my parents, and have never been to a funeral in my life. As a result i really can’t imagine the pain they’re going through and i can’t exactly draw on my own experience at all. I just don’t know what to say to show that i’m here for them, and all my words of comfort feel hollow.

388,"I applied to spend my second year of university studying abroad. I had been feeling really excited about going to my first choice of university which is in Spain and had been looking at places to live online, learning the language, I even visited the city with some friends etc. However I got an email today and found out I was not accepted to study at this university, but instead, was offered a place at my second choice, in Germany. I've hardly looked into studying at this university and to be honest, I'm not hugely enthusiastic about learning German or German culture. I don't have anything against Germany at all, but being from the UK, it doesn't appear to be all that different.  I was so excited about living somewhere with a really different culture and climate and diet and way of life. 

I only have one week to decide whether or not to spend the next year studying in Germany. If I had been accepted to study in Spain, then my decision would have been an immediate yes. However, since I haven't really thought about Germany, I'm really not sure what to do. On one hand, the prospect of being able to live in another country for a year is really exciting and an opportunity that might be difficult to come by in the future, especially after Brexit. However, I'm finally feeling like I feel at home in this city and at my university and I really enjoy living here. The biggest thing stopping me is that I have recently gotten into a relationship with a close friend of mine who I've liked for months now. It's early days, but I've never felt this way about someone before and I'm so happy with her. To think we might only have a few more months together before I leave to live somewhere I'm not that interested in living makes me feel pretty shite to be honest.

389,"It's been 5 years, and my friend is still mad.

It first started far before all of this, when his girlfriend at the time broke up with him and visited her sister (keep in mind, my friend and the sister had never met and did not know each other at all). My friend's GF complained about my friend, aired her grievances, and her sister naturally listened and offered some advice, such as, ""If you're unhappy why don't you break up with him?"" She did, for about a week, and then he got her back.

Ever since then, my friend has absolutely loathed the sister, hated her, and felt she ""meddled"". He told me about it at the time, and I listened, but thought he was being a bit ridiculous. There's nothing surprising about a sister offering advice to her sister, and it wasn't personal, since she didn't even know him.

Years later, I meet this sister, connect with her, like her, begin dating her.

And my friend gets very upset, increasingly upset, and finally says I need to break it off, cut her off, because he basically says so. Then I ask for the reasons why, and he brings up all of his issues with her, from the past, about how he felt she ""meddled"", how she interfered, how she stepped in and, he feels, partly caused his GF at the time to momentarily break-up with him (keep in mind, he did get his GF back).

I then asked her, the sister, about what happened, and she said nothing really surprising: she offered her sister advice at the time, didn't know my friend at all or have anything against him.

Now, she had come into town and met my friend, and had no issue with him. We met a few times, all of us, myself, my friend, both sisters. My friend, who claims he was greatly ""hurt"" by this sister and hated her at the time which he told me in private, got along just fine with her, which I found a bit odd.

But he was having none of it in our personal conversations, he kept pushing me to end it with her, and finally he felt I was just outright disloyal, saying, ""I'm your friend and if I'm hurt and someone hurt me, you should break it off with that person.""

I kept trying to look at the situation logically, and nothing added up. The sister had nothing against my friend. The sister was willing to try to 'make peace' with him. I even asked the sister to apologize to him to try to make peace (something I should not have done, and I regret asking her to do that). She did do it, and he didn't seem to care.

The sister had not said a SINGLE WORD about him for years, never interfered once! Not once did she call up her sister and say something like, ""Hey I thought you dumped him?"" Nothing you would expect a meddler to do. Nothing. Zero. She barely even knew of him.

I also liked her quite a lot.

She ended up being my GF for three years after this, and we didn't spend a day apart, and she's a nice, good person.

I've told my friend all of this, tried to logically hash it out, but he will have none of it: I'm disloyal, I won't apologize for how ""wrong"" I was, therefore, he will never be friends with me again. 20 year friendship gone, all my fault, according to him.

Am I wrong here? Or is my friend being unreasonable? He's never shown any willingness to really forgive, move on, get over it, nothing. He doesn't care at all that I liked her, he feels I should just have gone and found ""some other girl.""

It's all or nothing.

Is he wrong here? Or am I wrong? Should have I just listened to what he wanted and cut her off? (I would have regretted it.)

Was I not loyal enough? Or is my friend too selfish, controlling?

Be honest. I've tried to present the facts as clear as I can. I'm sure HE might dispute some of it, but I'm not sure what. We've hashed it over for years, and his ""case"" against her isn't much more than some vague idea that she ""meddled"". In fact, he doesn't talk about her anymore, because his case against her fell apart over time, just didn't add up. Now, it's all about me and how I should have just done what he asked, no matter who the girl was or what the circumstances were.

He isn't really able to argue it through, though. It's just, ""You didn't say you were wrong, so we can't be friends.""

I refuse to say I'm wrong about something I do not believe I was wrong about. I also do not believe the sister did anything wrong.

Yet, my friend hates her and thinks I'm disloyal.

390,So my company requires us to work at least one night shift a week if your part time. My co worker’s husband works night shifts and brings home most of the money to support them. My co worker works with me at a Hair Salon which can be a very catty/cliquey type of environment. Well she’s thinking about transferring because they are telling her she has to work one night shift otherwise it wouldn’t work out. Her daughter has severe Down syndrome and she also is in charge of taking her other son to school and picking them both up. She’s been extremely stressed out and is starting to get depressed. The girls at work are throwing shade at her and it’s making her feel unwelcome. They keep saying things like “We all have problems we deal with but we work around them.” Anyways I feel so bad for my co worker because she has it harder than most. Is there anything she could do (like get a doctors note or something) so she can work around her husbands schedule and be there for her child with Down syndrome who needs extra help!

393,"So just to give you all an idea of the relationship between me and this friend. She started working for the company I work for last year. We've been actually really close a few weeks after, because you all know that sometimes it just clicks between 2 people. I had no idea she was in a relationship and had a kid, but I fell in love, really bad.. I told her, because I wanted to be honest with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she was never going to leave her boyfriend, because of circumstances. But we kept talking nonetheless and became really good friends (even though she is not allowed to have friends). And since a few weeks we are asking each other personal questions, because we want to know each other a little better. And when asking question, she had a few answers which made it clear she actually wished she never met her boyfriend (they are together for 12 or 13 years now). 

&amp;#x200B;

She also said she would've been way happier if she met me at that time or if I was her current boyfriend, since then she would have a ""normal"" relationship. I didn't know what she meant with the ""normal"" part, until today. I felt something was up and asked her what was going on. She told me her boyfriend asked who I was (he would check her phone often, because he is extremely jealous) and that he had dreams about her leaving him and being together with me. I thought that was kinda strange, but then he added that he was already thinking about scenario's where he'd shoot a bullet in both our heads (me and my friend) if his dreams were true. And the scariest part is that he actually has a gun permit and guns in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to her today about that I'd be there for her and that she doesn't need to be afraid to leave him, because I'd never let him hurt her. But she is terrified to leave him.

402,"My fiance and I have been living with his parents for 2 years.  He's been living here most of his life save 4 years and 2 tours in the Marines.  He has a daughter so that is the main reason for that.  It's a long story I won't bore you with but to make it simple - we are beyond ready to move out.  His parents are decent people, meaning they have helped us out by letting us live here.  We have paid rent and they were nice enough to suspend that for me last year after I got laid off.  I'm not sure how nice, however, as it turns out his mother has made it apparent that she doesn't want us (rather my fiance and his daughter) to leave.

She's made that clear passive aggressively - there have been a couple occasions we told her we were going to start looking for an apartment together.  The first time, literally a week later, she raised our rent.  Making it extremely hard to start saving for a down payment.  And then this time.  We took a hard line with her and said that we would pay the original rent and she said fine, but if we weren't out by 3/1 we would owe her back rent.

Well it's 2/28, and we finally had the money together for a down payment mid February.  We were really hopefully on a couple of places but the owners went with other applicants and I know the reason is me.  My fiance has great credit and doesn't have a criminal record.  My credit is not good, and I was arrested and charged with a felony for possession of heroin back in August.  It's kind of a long story but I have struggled with addiction for over a decade.  I had been clean with only 1 other relapse since I met my partner but I am on Suboxone therapy.  My POS doctor at the time failed to send my Rx and I was left with the option of being sick all weekend while I had to work (and possibly losing my job) or find something else.  I chose the latter, was pulled over and the rest is history.  Thankfully I got myself to a different doctor before my arraignment at a wonderful clinic, have had zero issues since and in January accepted a plea deal for a reduced misdemeanor charge and a 6 month suspended sentence (the state I reside in does not use probation in the traditional sense).

We are viewing an apartment in an hour at a rather large complex.  We also saw a place Tuesday night that was owned privately by a young guy that seemed open to having our family stay there but the place isn't entirely finished (he just bought it) and he just let on that he had a lot of interested parties in the place.  I know that even though he met us and knows we are good people, others are going to look better on paper than me.

I don't know what to do.  The clock is ticking and I feel terrible that my bad decisions in my 20s and up until earlier this year are going to put us in more financial strain because of his mother, and I'm the reason we aren't getting accepted.  Any advice is welcomed. ",28Feb2019,3

406,"I get sad and anxious sometimes.

My boyfriend does too, so when he tells me he feels this way, even if it's inconvenient timing, or if I'mfeeli g poorly too, I make a point to sit with him and remind him how loved he is, and how everything's alright,and how this anxiety will pass just like it always does. I don't have the magic words to make it right for him, but I always work hard to make him feel validated and that his anxiety is an okay thing to feel, but I remind him of all the things that are okay in life, and why this episode of sadness/fear WILL pass, and I'm right here no matter how long it lasts.

Now I'll say here, that I'm trying not to let my happiness hinge on how much help I get. I normally get over it on my own. But sometimes I just want a little comfort and reassurance.

He however, when I'm sad, anxious, or anything, he clams up. 
He's very sweet, but he freezes and just looks sad, with me. It makes me feel like a crazy person, for talking about it and then having him just sit there. I mean, he cares, and he'll hold me and say he's sorry, but that's....not good enough for me.
He often checks in on me to ask how I'm doing or feeling, but when my answer is that I'm not okay, or that I need support, he says he doesn't know how to help.

I know he can do better, but how do I ask for help properly without sending him into shutdown mode? I just want some small degree of what I work to do for him. But I don't want to HAVE to ask directly, or to give him a virtual script of what to say, because that would be ingenuine, I think. He says he doesn't know what to say or do to help.

Sorry for bad formatting I am on a phone.

   Anyway I just got an odd friend request from my ex's son. Now that wouldn't be weird except for the kids a little over a year old. And it looks like a new profile that was just made.

   A little background this ex and I were really good friends but he caught feelings for me. I told him that I didn't want to really be more than friends unless he was completely broke up from his baby mama. They both said they were all broke up, we dated for 2 weeks. Then he broke up with me and he baby mama made him cut all contact with him. And said if I even reached out again then she'd beat me up or something. I haven't spoke to them since and this was about a year and a half ago. And I've had no desire to be friends. I also found out he was cheating on his BM for the second time but to her its always the other girls fault.

  Well we saw each other going down the road yesterday. And I think they recognized me. I've seen my' friend' (I use the term loosely) a few times the last few months, never thinking anything about it. I feel like messaging the BM about the fake profile but I really don't want to inflict any drama, also I have a theory that my friend might be trying to reach back out especially since he knows I have my own relationship now. 
 

 TL:DR; Should I say something about this? Or just delete the friend request and go about my life?

415,"I really like this girl that was in my old Marketing class and apparently according to my close guy friend and his girlfriend, who is close friends with her and her other small group of friends have told me a bit that she likes me as well, as well as a few of those other friends of hers. 

This all started when we were all getting ready to leave the class and the whole class was sitting in silence waiting for the bell to ring and she said “Happy Halloween &lt;my name&gt;” out of nowhere and I said the same. After that almost everyday she started saying “Have a good day” and I as well would do the same. For Christmas I got her a card and made her cookies and she told me how I didn’t have to and she was very thankful. I got her stuff for Valentines Day too (just more homemade cookies)

We never really talked outside of this class though and now we’re in a new semester so now we can barely talk at all. We never get an opportunity. Fast forward to this month and I realized the other day I really, really, really do like her. Heres where the problem begins. Everytime I see her I plan to say something to her and then when I see her and get to her..my mind goes completely blank. I forget everything and I cannot remember a thing, so then when we talk we kind of just daze off a bit until I can pull myself to find words to say? This is killing me and I have no idea what to do. This is my main issue. I really like this girl and I have no idea what to do. My mind goes blank and when i’m done talking to her I realize I shake too? I don’t know what’s going on. I’m so lost and confused. 

I should probably mention one time last month we were walking down a hall and I was talking to her and when we reached where the stairs are she said she had to go downstairs. My class was on the opposite side of the school so I said “Oh alright. I’ll see you later then. Have a good day.” and she kind of just stared at me for a few seconds and then just said “bye.” I don’t know if I messed up and she didn’t hear me or something else, but I felt like i was punched in the gut for the rest of the day.

417,"One of my best friends attended a party this past weekend and was raped by a complete stranger. I won't go into  the details, as they aren't really relevant, but she is currently feeling very embarrassed and ashamed of the incident. She has significant childhood trauma and trauma due to a friend of ours committing suicide about 4 years ago. She has thankfully already been working through these issues in therapy for about a year now and has responded much better to this incident than she has in the past. She is being very open about her feelings and I am super proud of her. She has chosen not to press charges, and although I would love to see this piece of trash stand trial, I am supporting her wishes and not trying to force her to do anything. She is still quite shaken up and has developed a bit of claustrophobia due to being pinned down by this guy when he attacked her. She has bruising around her pelvis, a bump on her head, and bruises on the sides of her neck where I am assuming he grabbed her. I have already advised her to get STD/pregnancy testing and to be open about this with her therapist.

I guess my question is what I should do to help her. I am thinking of make a care package with a heating pad (she has expressed interest in this as her pelvis is still sore), soothing scented body wash for showers, melatonin (because she is having a really hard time sleeping), CBD gummies to help with her anxiety, some face masks we can do together to chill out, and microwave popcorn (one of her favorite foods). I would also like to write her a note telling her how proud I am of her for opening up and to let her know I am here for her, in addition to the other friends she has chosen to share this with. 

I don't want it to come off as if I pity her or think she is broken in some way, like a care package you would give to someone that is sick. There is nothing wrong with her and she should know that. Giving gifts is definitely one of my love languages and I just want to show her that I love her and am here for her.

I did a science degree in hopes of getting in to dental school or medicine. That didn’t happen after repeated applications. I pursued a masters in health research and administration (2 year program) in hopes of increasing my chances for medical school. I did amazing there. I was very confident and social. I seemingly had everything going for me. But when it came to coops and jobs I just always had bad luck. I just wouldn’t get responses. I didn’t have too much work experience under my belt. But others in similar experience level as me got jobs. 

It was extremely demotivating going to the library every day 9-5 and applying mindlessly to all the health care jobs in public health and pharma; for 1.5 years straight. Sometimes 20-30 applications in a day. I got my resume checked multiple times. Never got a response... i had maybe 2-3 interviews max in a year of applying, only to be rejected. (In hindsight i was so desperate for a job that the interviewers would probably have picked up on it).

At the time I was working in retail sales at a company. I had a terrible break up with a gf that cheated on me. And that sent me down a spiral for three years full of negativity and low self esteem, confidence and depression. 

At this point, i just decided to move up with sales in the same company and I did. I got a cold calling position (which i told myself Id keep applying in my own field while I did it). But cold calling was so draining and a pressure filled job that i couldn’t keep up with the jobs apps. eventually i decided ill just switch fields to business and move up. Bad decision.

I don’t have the educational background or experience to get the jobs i want in business. If i think about healthcare, i now have a 3 year gap with no healthcare experience at all. Ive also forgot most of what i learned in my masters. 

Im in a weird place, where its become difficult for me to network and be my best self. Im burnt out and drained. I have no motivation to do what i do in sales. I don’t seem to have the qualifications to get analyst or project management jobs. I don’t have the experience for my healthcare jobs either. 

I can’t seem to move anywhere. Going back to school is daunting at this point. And I’m confused out of my mind about where to focus my attention and what I truly want to do.

432,"I'm turning 28 next month and I feel like I'm living my life wrong despite nothing at least on the surface being wrong. A little background on me: after I graduated high school I went to college for a year for architecture where I smoked a lot of weed and got involved with girls that I shouldn't of and almost had a kid in my first year of college and that was the sign I needed at the time that let me know I need to unfuck myself before I make a mistake I can't take back.... The day after I found out my girlfriend had a miscarriage I walked into an Army Recruiting office and signed the next 6 years of my life away. My girlfriend obviously upset with what happened and my subsequent choice dumped me thereafter and 6 months later I was a college drop out with nothing to my name and I was a private in the US Army.

6 years and a deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, 9 month rotation in Korea and 1 year rotation in Kuwait I was Honorably discharged from the army and 70% disabled. I sustained a number of bone fractures and skin conditions due to the terrible environmental conditions I was forced to live in while on deployments that ultimately granted me a 70% disability rating from the VA. While I was in the Army and off of my first deployment I met a girl that would later become my wife. She and I are still together and love each other very much and we have been through a lot together including a miscarriage and poverty while I was in the service and she couldn't find a job and not being married at the time I was not entitled to BAH so we were just living off my $900 pay check to support two adults and what we thought would be our child before we got married. She too ended up having a miscarriage, which shook me to my core because this is the second time this has happened to me and it was at this point I thought to myself maybe it's a sign I should be alone, maybe I should end things here and just reset. I didn't and right before I got on the plane to Afghanistan I proposed and she said yes and we cried together for what felt like an eternity and then I got on the plane and went to war for 9 months and we got married as soon as I got home in December of 2013.

Fast forward to now and I have no idea what I should be doing with my life.... I'm currently half way done my degree in the IT field which I'm not even sure I really want to do. I work for an IT company and I don't hate what I do but I hate the people I work for a with. Ever since I left the military I feel like damaged goods, I feel worthless and I feel like my life and everything I do is pointless. My relationship with my wife is another big question mark in my life. I still love her and I believe she loves me but our sexual relationship is almost non existent and sometimes I believe she doesn't really find me attractive anymore. I feel like we are really good roommates sometimes. We have had talks about this and she promises every time she loves me and will show me more affection but I am still the one who has to initiate any sort of contact and recently I've just gotten to the point where I just don't give a shit anymore and I haven't pursued any kind of sexual advance. She works for the same company as me in a different department and is a full time medical student as well.

I just feel completely lost in life right now. I find myself often fantasizing about dropping everything, either selling or getting rid of everything, and leaving my wife and just getting in my car and driving until the tank runs out of gas. I feel. So. Fucking. Lost. I feel like I've done everything wrong in my life and my current feelings and circumstances are my punishment. I know my fantasy is not going to make me happy and to be completely honest I feel like I have an undiagnosed mental illness which I refuse to seek help for because I feel like nothing is going to be accomplished by talking to a shrink. I know this isn't the right answer but I just don't want to talk to a therapist, I had done so after my deployments and I have had nothing but terrible experiences of feeling belittled and judged by military therapists. I just want to find purpose in my life, a passion to persue, and I wish my wife would show me some affection. But there's this part of me that keeps saying just drop everything and start over.

I have never been pointed in the right direction for anything and now I am here. Any advice? Ha. ",28Feb2019,6
435,"I (21,F) have always had a hard time building and maintaining friendships. When I was younger I used to be very shy and insecure and when I finally got rid of that I still didn’t manage to make any real friends. A lot of times I do get along well with people, but they still don’t seem to have any interest in befriending me or oftentimes even forget who I am if we meet again a while later. Is anyone else in their twenties and doesn’t have any friends at all?  
I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I am in a loving relationship and am very close to my family - so clearly I’m not completely incompetent in having relationships. I just feel so incredibly lonely and hurt, whenever I see friend groups together or my boyfriend goes out to see his friends multiple times a week (which is great and I am happy for him, of course). 
Also, i feel like my lack of friendships has turned into some sort of trauma and destroys my self esteem. I get increasingly shy and awkward around people because I “don’t want to mess it up” and sometimes I question every single thing I say because I don’t want to come across as weird and I want someone to like me so badly. 
And don’t get me wrong - I am for sure an introvert and need my alone time. I enjoy doing things by myself but also there’s a limit of how much I can take. 

So I guess my question is, if anyone else feels this way and how you cope? Any tips on how to turn acquaintances into friends? ",28Feb2019,952
437,"I’m a 26M. I guess like a lot of people in their 20’s, I’ve reached that weird phase in my life where I don’t know who I am or what I want. Out of the million thoughts that race through my mind as I attempt to analyze them, there’s always that one that comes up that I can’t make sense of; Relationships, Romance, and Love.

I was sheltered when I was young teenager. I never had a talk about sex with my parents. I learned about it through curiously searching the internet. I never received any dating advice either. So I’ve never been good at flirting or expressing my romantic interest in someone (at least in a way where I actually appear attractive, ha). Still, I somehow managed to have 3 serious relationships in my life, as well as a few flings off to the side. I feel pathetic saying that none of those relationships lasted any more than 8 months, but I digress. 

A part of me wants to believe in true love. The kind where you get married and grow old together, never getting tired of each other. However, a much BIGGER part of me refuses to believe that is possible. Through observation and experience, my perspective on love and relationships has warped drastically since I was a kid.

I grew up with parents that were at each other throats over every little thing. They both claim that the other had changed ever since they married and had kids. It took me over a decade to finally convince myself that it’s not my fault that they don’t love each other anymore. I have been surrounded by friends and peers who have cheated or have been cheated on. Even my older sister, who I used to look up to, has cheated on a previous boyfriend of hers (she’s now married to somebody else). Hell, I ended up cheating in my relationship over a year ago, when I thought that I wasn’t capable of doing so. Don’t worry. I got what was coming for me, and we’re no longer together. 

I’ve witnessed seemingly happy relationships end for no apparent reason. Just the other day here where I work, a worker’s wife had just started to push for a divorce, after 19 long years of marriage. There was no sign of it, besides another worker noticing that she had seemed “detached” at some point. I witness people choosing to stay in relationships (including my own) when they don’t even love the person they’re with, for months or even years at a time. Because they feel trapped, or are scared of being single? I honestly don’t know.

I see women flock towards men who are in committed relationships, and then I see them ignore the same man once he is single. This behavior can be observed in many places in the animal kingdom. It makes sense on a biological level. A male that attracts a female is worthy of mating, and thus attracts more females. A male that doesn’t have a female must not be worth mating, and so he is left alone.

So all of these things occur, and despite it, somebody says “To live a fulfilling life and truly be happy, one must find their soulmate, get married, raise a family, and be together UNTIL DEATH DO US PART”. It’s a romantic ideal, to find love that could last a life time. Sounds amazing in fact. Who the hell wouldn’t want that? I’m already excited. I can’t wait to find that perfect person for me. I won’t even question WHO came up with the idea. Society, Disney movies, the Bible, a guy that really likes to watch penguins? Who cares!? Everybody else wants it, so I want it too. Don’t want to be that one weirdo that can’t find a soulmate, because that would mean there must be something wrong with me...

Let me get things back on track before I get too carried away. My point is, long lasting relationships, and arguably monogamy, both seem unrealistic . Don’t get me wrong. I believe in love, and passion, and intimacy, and I enjoy them just as much as anybody else. But being with the same person day in and day out, of course things are going to become stagnant. The passion fades, and suddenly a relationship that used to be fun becomes work. Hard work. One partner ends up “changing” in some way (or the problem could be that they *dont* change), and the other partner has trouble accepting this. One partner becomes the chaser, the other becomes the runner. The runner is becoming overwhelmed, second guessing what he/she wants. The chaser is desperately trying to keep things together, which seems to only be pushing their partner away even more. I’ve experienced being both the runner and the chaser, not just in my relationships, but also in the romantic interests that never bloomed. There’s always one that becomes more invested than the other.

I hate that I view relationships the way that I do. But I can’t help it. My observations speak much louder than the fairytale in my head. I now see every relationship as a time bomb. Yes, they’re fun while they last, but they will all end, messily, with hurt feelings and the occasional “Whats wrong with me? What did I do wrong? Why am I not good enough?”. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with anybody! Yes, different personalities will get along better or worse than others. But EVERYBODY DESERVES TO BE LOVED. Instead of questioning our own value, maybe we should be asking: Are we forcing ourselves into doing something that is unnatural, and thus doomed to fail?

In college, I shared a room with one of my closest friends from high school. Sweet setup right? Sure, he’s a bit more energetic than me, but we have similar hobbies and get along great! What could possibly go wrong? Fast forward a couple of semesters later, and we’re having the awkward discussion of wanting to room with different people. Years later, to this day, he is still one of my best friends. I would also never dream of living with him ever again. 

So what makes romantic relationships any different? Well, the romantic part I guess. More intimacy, more vulnerability, and a lot more sensitivity when things don’t work out. And I’ve course love - you know, that one word with 1000 different meanings depending on who you ask. Is it a feeling or a concept? The answer: Yes.

I love all of my exes. I still think about them occasionally. I care about their well being and hope they’re doing well. 2 of them, I would never want to date again. And 1 of them I can no longer stand being around. I may no longer be *in love* with them, but I still love them.

I realized that my parents ended up the same way. They love each other, care for each other, but they *fell out of love* a long time ago. I wish it didnt have to be this way. I wish they could still be together and get along. But they can’t, and I don’t blame them.

So to wrap this all up, my big question is, how do all you people do it? How can you dive into a relationship knowing what’s to come? I think almost everyone would agree that the perfect partner doesn’t exist. But if you’re consciously choosing to settle for less than perfect, then isn’t that the same thing as admitting that you *know* it’s not going to last? I’m starting to no longer see the point in dating, and I cannot ever EVER imagine myself getting married. But at the same time, I know I want intimacy and love in my life. Everything seems to contradict. I want intimacy, but I don’t want to date. I want love, but I don’t want commitment. Is there a compromise that exists, or am I doomed to be alone because of this mentality?",28Feb2019,0

444," A couple of days ago I met this very nice guy in my lab. He sat next to me and talked to me pretty much the whole time. (The lab was 3 hours long) Most people had finished about an hour early, but I was having problems with my microscope, so I had to stay later. He was finished, but he waited for me to finish. I noticed he was sort of stalling (talking to the TA, being super slow about everything, tying his shoelaces, etc…) and when I packed up and went to put my coat on he followed me and asked me if I was in the lab with him normally because he hadn’t seen me before. I said no, I was just there for that day and my lab was supposed to be on a different day.

He then walked beside me, following me as I left the building. He asked what I was doing for the day and if I had any more classes. He then asked if I wanted to study with him in the library for a few hours. (He said he didn’t have anything until 7 pm, nor did I, and it was 3 pm at this point)

So in the library, we had a lot of fun. I noticed he laughed at literally everything I said, even if it wasn’t even funny… He teased me a lot, asked me tons of questions about myself, and made a lot of eye contact. (Now listen, I am super bad at eye contact. I know it is supposed to signify that you like someone, but for me, I am so shy if I am interested in someone that I actively avoid eye contact it makes me so nervous)

I ended up spending the next 4 hours with him. Whenever I said I was going to go somewhere, he would come with me. He ended up walking me to my class and then asked for my number before leaving.

He did text me that night, but he hasn’t really talked to me much since and hasn’t made any effort to ask to meet up again. Listen, I know it’s only 2 days and I’m probably being ridiculous, but do you think the signs were there before that? Was he was interested?

447,"For a majority of my life I've always felt unsure. I would talk with people during my time in school, but It never felt like I was that persons friend. I would always have to force myself to be apart of the conversation. ^(I made a terrible habit of blurting out ""funny"" responses during class.) When It came to finding a career path I was just as lost. Since I was at least nine, I've had a fascination with cooking, which was mostly due in part to Alton Brown. I just ate up Good Eats, and would just binge it constantly. However, while my parents liked that I was Interested in cooking, they didn't want me to pursue It as a full time career. They wanted me to explore programing and IT. Their reasoning was that pursuing a career as a cook/chief is highly laborious, my mother in particular would often cite that my grandmother worked as a waitress in her home town, and had to take care of all the duties that came with running a restaurant. However in my high school, there was barely anything to do with programing or IT. At best I could take some CAD and Animation classes, but It just was not what they wanted. ^(""Not to say they were bad tho."")

   When I started college, my parents suggested that I immediately jump on as an IT major, but I chickened out and decided to start as an undecided/exploring. At the time the thought of pursuing IT seemed daunting, and I wanted to get a better understanding of myself before I committed to a major. From what I remember, when I had to make a decision on picking a major, I followed the advice of an upperclassmen I meet, who suggested I major in Business It (BCIS). The upperclassmen stated that Business IT isn't as hard core as the full IT program, and that having a Business degree would be much more flexible. So I agreed.

   While I did enjoy some of the classes in the program, others were understandable nightmares, and as you could guess I was never in the top of the class when It came to grades. The other problem I faced was networking. I had a hard enough time making people interested in me, getting them to hire me was something else. I went to a few job fairs that were hosted at my school, but nothing came of it. After I graduated, things weren't much better. I endlessly searched through job sites looking for someone to hire me, and then someone did.

   The two responses I ended up getting were for ""advertisement"" firms. Since I was desperate, I said yes to doing an interview. The first one didn't go too well, but the second one did. As I was talking with these people I started to notice some red flags. Things like chanting the phrase ""Juice"" during morning group meetings. The structure of advancement sounding remarkable like a pyramid scheme. Then we went into the field. This pretty much amounted to door-to-door salesmanship. By the end of the first day, I was a mess.

   After quickly quitting that  job I started looking again, and ended up as as a retail cashier. Where I stayed for two and a half years. It's not too bad, as I am comfortable with the job. However, my parents encourage me to try and find a better one. The question I ask now is, what should I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

* Do I pursue my own ideas, and go into the field of Cooking/Hospitality?
* Do I accept that my parents only want the best for me, and seek a career in IT?
* Should I consider going back to school in order to learn a new field of study?

449,"        I (f19) moved in with my best friend (W - f21) and her boyfriend (B - m21) about 4 months ago to escape my crazy old roommate. I love my W, she’s one of the closest friends I’ve ever had, and I really liked her boyfriend at first too, we were all friends before we lived together. 

       I stand behind the fact the B is disgusting, and not just messy. He only showers 2-3 times a week, he has to use multiple anti-fungal powders and creams because he just doesn’t take care of himself. His felt smell so bad that once he takes off his shoes, you can be sitting across the room and smell them (I’m really not exaggerating, but I wish I was). He’s obnoxious and talks down to me about stuff he doesn’t understand, he uses my stuff and then wrecks it, and he’s careless.  Not to mention that W tries to keep their room clean but not only does he mess it up everyday, he smells so bad that he makes their room smell like ass, one day it was so bad our whole apartment reeked like stagnant water somehow?

       They’ve been together for a year, and W has threatened to break up with him multiple times over multiple things. They had been friends since they were in high school, and they began dating last year right after W had gotten out of a 2 year relationship (which I helped her get out of). 

       Recently, they’ve been fighting all the time. It’s even woken me up multiple times. He’s crazy jealous yet does the same things he tells her not to do. He went on her phone while she was sleeping, and woke her up to ask her about the trip me and her were planning on taking because she was talking to her friend about setting him up with me. She freaked at him because it was obviously an invasion of her privacy. 

       Last month B left the kitchen a DiSaStEr and I texted him and told him to clean it in a rude tone I’ll admit. He responded with “Don’t talk to me like that or you can clean it yourself.” and that sort of set me off. When I got off work, the kitchen was clean, yet he left a pile of dishes. I waited 3 days and he didn’t wash them. I asked him to again. 2 days pass and I get hone from work and they aren’t done so i put them in the middle of the counter. He takes W’s car to a town over (about an hour away) without telling her, so she calls him and freaks out at him. He eventually comes home and tries to make it up to W. I ask him to do the dishes again. He washes one pan then goes back to his room. I’m kind of at my breaking point so I get up and start doing the dishes very loudly and aggressively so they can hear. I’m embarrassed about it now but has been almost 6 days of food covered pans sitting in our kitchen. 

     W comes out and tells me to stop being crazy and I tell her that this isn’t about her. B comes out and I start yelling at him and telling him he never cleans and he only leaves messes and he has the most dumbfounded look on his face the whole time. W yells and says “I’ll just do it, I’ll clean.” and I say “It’s too late I’m doing it.” and she tried to rip the pan out of my hand while I’m washing it and starts saying she’s having a panic attack, which causes me to have an OCD panic attack in which I start repeating “I have to finish.” So obviously I’m not the most sane person but I developed slight OCD after my mom passed away, they know this, but it’s the only time I’ve EVER had a breakdown about it. B &amp; W leave the apartment, which made me feel like shit. I text her and say we need to talk about this the next day. 

       Two days later, when we talk about it, she basically blames me for their relationship issues and says that they haven’t stopped fighting since I freaked out. She goes off on her little tangent then gets up and leaves me and B to talk about it. He basically says that I lack intuition (he used it in the wrong context and i dont know what he meant by it), he said that I too emotional, he said that I didn’t know how to have a conversation and criticized the way I was looking at him while he was insulting me for no reason, he didn’t listen to a single thing I had and basically chalked it up to me being the problem. 

       When B went to work that night, W almost immediately texted me and asked if I wanted anything from the liquor store which led to the following:

       W has been saying since September that if she wasn’t with B that she would be a lesbian. The next night we went out to a club and her one goal was to make out with a girl, which she did. When we were leaving, I was talking a cab to my friend’s dorm and she was going to get B to pick her up. But instead of him coming to get her, she texted me and said that he was too stoned to get her and let her walk home from downtown in a big city. He could’ve at least met her halfway. He doesn’t know that she cheated on him but I encouraged her 
because I want her to know she can do better. 

       Last weekend, we took a trip to another city to see our friend and I thought that this would be the end, because she doesn’t like him either. But it actually ended up making them closer somehow? I know that they’ve been friends for a long time, and that their group of friends and entangled, but I fucking hate him so much it’s hard to hold in. 

       When we returned home he didn’t clean the kitchen, he actually made the bathroom messy (I cleaned it spotlessly before we left), he ate my chips, used my milk, and took my jacket I told him not to wear because he gets food on his clothing because he can’t eat like an adult. I know this seems tedious but he’s one of those people that doesn’t respect any rules I lay down. 

TL;DR: My best friend/roommate’s boyfriend is disgusting and completely whack, she wants to be a lesbian and made out w a girl at a club. She wont take the obvious signs as hints and gtfo the relationship. I’m caught in the middle because I live w them and they looking for anything else to blame their problems on instead of looking in a mirror. 

Is there anything I can do? Last time I helped her outta a relationship, we stopped being friends (she’s a really good person don’t get me wrong). Can I at least make it so I have a better roommate?

452,"I would like to get advice on a life decision here are some facts: 

•I go to university to get my bachelors in fine arts and I’m currently in my second year (out of four). I attend every day.
•Because my family can’t pay my uni tax or give me pocket money I have a job which I go to every weekday for 4 hours. Job is ok, but the boss is mean, pay is minimal.
•I live with my family in a 2 room apartment and share one of the rooms with my sister and my grandma (85)  who recently had a stroke. I’m 21 and have 0 personal space.
•every day I go out at 8:30 and return at 7 at the evening. After which I help care for my sick grandma and work on my side projects.

I love university and I don’t struggle with the studies, it’s a dream come true and I’m happy with my friend group. However with everything else in mind I feel exhausted and I have to take a decision to at least try to make my life more bearable. I do not know anyone my age who has a job (ppl start working at 24 usually) and I certainly don’t know anyone who lives with their grandma, my situation is quite a picture. 

 To the point - I have saved enough for the remaining university tax so should I:

•leave my job and focus on studying? I could make occasional pocket money from selling some artwork here and there which I already do, but I’d still remain home sharing a room with my grandma and sister.

Or 

•should I attempt to move out on my own so at least I could get some personal space? (For the first time in my life) The drawback is my mean boss, the low pay and the fact that there aren’t many part time jobs available where I live, so I can’t just find another one. Rent would take 80% of my pay without living expenses, by my estimation, but I guess I could count on the odd sale here and there.

Both scenarios seem possible. All opinions and experiences will be helpful for me in making a decision.

## Can't get a guy I (22F) haven't seen in 5 years out of my head

📷 [\[new\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/search?q=flair_name%253A%2522%255Bnew%255D%2522&amp;restrict_sr=1)

So  when I was in 12th grade, I was dual-enrolled at a community college.  There was this guy in my class who I really liked; he was funny,  outgoing, attractive. During that year he showed up at the church I  attend (church is a big part of my life), and although I didn't actually  see him, he told me the next week at class (apparently my Dad saw him  that day).

One day in class he told me I  had pretty eyes, and otherwise was very friendly with me although not  flirtatious.  He seemed impressed that I was the age I was and taking  college courses. Being super outgoing, he asked everyone in class to  follow him on Instagram.

Thus began years of stalking every so often (I didn't actually follow him).

Right  after my senior year of HS, I moved from my hometown to another state.  Embarrassingly I continue(d) the stalking, and it didn't help that many  of his posts were from other churches/schools etc that I was connected  to growing up and had no idea he had any connection with. I found out  that he recently moved to the city I am from (I'm from a large  metropolitan area), and I guess all these ""coincidences"" got me  daydreaming that sometime I would go back to my hometown and bump into  him.

I was only ever casually acquainted  with this guy and it's pretty messed up that the situation snowballed  in my head to something like this 5 years later. Can anybody tell me how  stupid this is and knock some sense into my head or am I not as crazy  as I feel?

457,"I have Relatives that we see 4-5 times a year, they’re in their 60’s and for as long as I can remember they have held racist, homophobic and discriminatory opinions. Usually when we are at their houses it’s a case of grin- and- bear- it and I bite my tongue. But hearing them say inappropriate things in public is so... cringeworthy I just don’t know how to react. I get mad on behalf of the people they’re insulting and I feel a little bit bad that they’re missing out on life and meeting new interesting people because of how sheltered and bigoted they are.

Calling them out on it doesn’t work, they don’t see anything wrong with what they say and I don’t see them often enough for my opinion to change their minds. It’s not that they have outright hatred for minorities or things that are different from what goes on in their little bubble, it’s more of a disdainful approach.

For example they have no clue that stereotyping is discrimination. Comments like : “all the Germans are like that” or “it’s because they’re French” are super irritating. I try to put forward the idea that you can’t generalise like that but it falls on deaf ears. There are other examples which are more obvious discrimination and some things that are less so.

I don’t think I’m gonna change their views but I’m not comfortable in being passive in these conversations- I don’t want to be complicit and agree-by-default by not saying anything.

Anyone any clue how to tackle this?",28Feb2019,1
459,"As a precursor, I’ll say that we both love the dog (D). 


Background: 1.5 years ago, D was adopted through a rehoming situation by my SO (S) through Craigslist. S lived alone, was in a dark place, and could barely get out of bed. Since medication wasn’t working, an ESA was S’s next option. I had quite a few issues about D’s adoption process and my lack of involvement, but S and I have discussed this and know there’s nothing we can do about the past. D gave S the motivation to get out of bed and provided companionship, since I was not there. Still, S skipped all classes and quit work to take care of D. 

D is the first dog I’ve ever had, and I was not aware of or prepared for everything that goes into caring for D and dogs in general. S grew up with dogs.


Other info: Now, we live together in an apartment. S is in a much better place and spends most of the time in class/at an unpaid internship. I work from home mostly and am the sole breadwinner. I took on a lot of debt and worked extensive hours to pay for all 3 of us. S took care of D’s expenses at the beginning but soon ran out of money. My financial situation has changed for the better and I’m close to paying off all the debt, but I’m still not in the position to comfortably support all 3 of us.


Issues:
D sheds a lot, has separation anxiety (barks and whines when left alone), is very hyper/energetic, is destructive/chews a lot, is not obedient, and is very needy of attention

Stressors: Time/energy and monetary expenses


S doesn’t care about the shedding, but it’s a big issue for me. Therefore, I’m left to do the extra chores to take care of the fur everywhere. During the week, S is out, and I’m left alone to look after D. I can’t concentrate on work when D wants attention, chews everything in sight, whines/barks when locked in his crate. The latter is the reason I’m hesitant to leave D at home and work from a coffee shop.

Since S is rarely home, I’m the one trying to train D, taking D on walks, feeding D, brushing D, searching for/buying D’s supplies, and replacing everything D destroys. All of this, as well as other chores, happen while I’m supposed to be working. When S comes home, we have dinner, S takes D out to pee, then we go to bed. S spends the weekends catching up on sleep and de-stressing while I’m doing errands and chores. I know that while S is in a better place, it takes a lot of effort for her to keep going. D no longer seems to provide emotional support and is now just like any other pet, loving but very difficult to deal with.


While D’s behavior is an issue for both of us, I’m the one dealing with it most of the time. I don’t have the time or money for formal training and am still not ready for the responsibility of caring for a dog. I’m very stressed out and overwhelmed but also recognize that S doesn’t really have the time or money to help me with D. Rehoming D is not really an option, so I feel like I’m stuck taking care of D and just have to live with the stress. I don’t know what else to do...


TLDR: I take care of my SO’s ESA more than my SO does. The ESA does not have the personality of a service animal and provides more stress than emotional support",28Feb2019,2
460," 	I have a sister who has been bothering me a lot lately. She has depression and a few other minor health issues, she is divorced, on disability. She is very negative, selfish (when ever I give her news about me it’s always how she feels about it) and usually only wants to get together to complain about her health, my parents, her kids, or ex husband. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and constantly texts me all day. I would like to put some distance between us because all her issues are stressing me out which is leading to my own adverse health affects and I just don’t have time for them. I have tried to say things in the past but she always says “this is the straw that broke the camels back” or she feels “attacked”. She has always been like this and it’s really starting to bother me. I feel bad saying I need space when she doesn’t have any many peoplearound but I’m tired of her drama. I don’t want to cut her out of my life just limit our interactions to once or twice a week. Do you have any advice on how I can achieve this?

462,"Hi, I’m a part time (34 hours) worker at a city agency. I’ve been here since Oct. My supervisor (who is only in charge of me and has relatively minor power within the department itself) always discourages me from putting any extra time I work for overtime. Her “reason” is that as a part time worker, I am not entitled to it anyway. But I know this isn’t true. 

It’s literally just her and I working together in our tiny subunit of the Department, so if anything awkward goes down (like if I tell a higher up) it’ll make our professional relationship strained, without a doubt. And as a non confrontational person, I dread that. 

This has been causing me a ton of frustration. I’ve challenged her silly propositions of “no overtime” a handful of times. At this point, I realize that she truly doesn’t want me to put in the time (for totally unknown reasons!!!). It’s a damn city agency, not her own private organization.

Between homework, research grant applications, manuscript writing, management, and working as a design engineer, I'm to the point where my average work day is 12+ hours. Combine that with the fact that I had an apartment fire last week, and I'm officially falling behind. 

I don't know what to do - my businesses and schoolwork are taking back burner to dealing with insurance and apartment repairs, but I'm concerned about being able to bounce back once that's done. I can only live off of 2 hours of sleep a night for so long, and I can just feel my brain getting more and more sluggish from it.

465,"I resell online and buy most of my inventory at Goodwill. A lady approached me when I was looking up comps on my items in the corner of the store. She asked if i could look up comps on a few items she had because her phone was dead. I helped. She then tells me that shes never actually resold before and is looking for someone to help her. Her husband died and she got burned in a house fire and she couldnt afford the home shes in now. She was hoping reselling would help her. 
She kept complimenting me and talking about how she wanted me to meet her 19 year old daughter (I'm 20) because she thought i could be a good influence on her. Then she wanted me to meet her son and wanted me to go have pizza with her. Then she wanted me to come to her house and list items for her. She was very overbearing and I ended up giving her my number because she wouldnt stop asking. I'm not great at saying no and I hate myself for it. 
So it's time to check out and shes in front of me. She decides to get a shirt and some mugs to resell. Then as I'm walking out she GIVES ME THE ITEMS and tells me to list them for her and PayPal her when they've sold. Immediately when I got home she started texting me tons of photos and putting a price after it. She would literally send me a crappy photo of some item she wanted ME to list for her and the price she wanted. 

I explained that I didnt think her items had any chance of selling (they were junk) and that it costs money to list items on Ebay. She said ""I'm so sad maybe I cant do this afterall"" and didnt contact me for over a month. I thought it was over. Unfortunately a few days ago she messaged me asking if the two items she forced upon me had sold and I said no. She took two days to respond but when she did it was a Loonnnggg message about how great of a person i am and how we have to go to goodwill together so i can teach her how to do what i do (which would take money away from me) and how she still wants me to meet her whole family. 
I have no i dea what to do. I go to that goodwill a few times a week, if i block her and dont respond theres a HUGE chance I'll run into her again. I've tried just going to that goodwill with friends, but even with someone else I'm sure shed still awkwardly approach me. How should i handle this?

466,"Without trying to complain and make this a sob story, here’s the situation. I moved to Boston six months ago to further my career and sacrificed damn near everything to do it. Five months ago, I met the girl of my dreams and we quickly started dating. Two months ago I landed my dream job; January was the first time in years that I was actually happy and everything seemed to be going great. On Tuesday, my boss called me into her office and started telling me that I’m doing a shit job and started making up things that I’ve never done like sleeping on the job; this led to her saying that she doesn’t think I’m going to make it through the 90 day probationary period and she’d be making a decision by next week.

471,"My girlfriend has 4 kids from a previous relationship (all have same father). They are between the ages of 2 and 6. My girlfriend is teetering whether she should fight for full custody or not. 

Their dad has been in and out of jail. He has been to jail 5 times the past 10 years. He has gotten enough DUIs to lose his license. He has crashed many cars and got sued once for doing so. He has went to jail for a bar fight. He went to jail most recently for attacking/beating my girlfriend (a year or so before I met her). It was so bad her face was swelled up and she had to get fluid drained from her ears. He only served a year and I think it wasn't a felony. This wasn't the only time he abused her. Their house was riddled with dents and holes in the walls and doors from her getting her head smashed into them. 

He is also frequently drunk and abuses drugs such as Adderall and Xanax (though he never got arrested for drugs). He currently has a bench warrant for crashing a car and abandoning it. He also has a bench warrant for owing child support. He is loud and obnoxious, always saying something mean. He once showed up (uninvited obviously) when I was spending the night at my girlfriend's, knocked on the window and got their daughter to let him in the house, but he left before we woke up. We knew it happened since the front door was wide open and he admitted to doing it. Another time he came to pick up some old clothes that he had left behind in the basement years ago and started screaming ""pussy"" at me. My girlfriend says he once smacked a little dog in the head with a shovel just for coming into their yard. 

My girlfriend thinks he may have abused their kids when the kids were alone with him. She came home once and one of the kids had what looked like strangulation marks on his throat (he has choked my girlfriend many times). Another time one of the kids had a split lip and the other kids refused to speak about what happened and were acting really quiet. 

I have been with my girlfriend almost a year and we just started renting a house together. The kids still see their dad about once a month. My girlfriend thinks it's important to have their dad in their lives but other times she gets so fed up with him she talks about him never seeing them again. What complicates this is the kids sometimes will say they miss their dad and it breaks her heart because she wants him to be a good father (obviously the 2 year old doesn't care about his dad, but the 4 year old twins and 6 year old do care). Their dad has already been a bad influence on the older ones. They will speak fowl language and talk about how they want to smoke cigarettes like their dad. 

It annoys me and my girlfriend that the kids think the world of their dad. Even when he does see them, he never once did anything memorable with them (no vacations, no trips to the zoo, he has his mom and dad who live close by to help out since he can't drive). He has said numerous times if I wanted to adopt the kids and he never pay child support again and never see his kids again he'd be perfectly fine with it. 

My girlfriend refuses to badmouth the kid's dad in front of them, and rightfully so since all the experts say not to. I think the daughter is the only one who remembers the dad abusing their mom. She used to tell him to stop being so mean to ""mommy.""

My girlfriend is happy and says I have been a wonderful addition to her and the kids lives. I have already had a good influence on the kids, they are happier too. I am afraid that them spending any time with their dad will erase all the good work we have done. My girlfriend's parents were abusive and she has anxiety because of it. But she still has a relationship with her parents and forgave them even though they served 5 years in jail for it. When I tell her I don't think they should see their dad, she says ""but my dad was in my life and I don't want them to miss out on not having a dad."" Even though her parents' abuse negatively impacted who she is today and put her in foster care for 5 years (the parents got her back when she was a teen). 

Would you let this man see his kids ever again? Does my girlfriend have enough reasons to file for full custody? 

Do you think the kids in anyway benefit from having their bio dad in their lives? They have a father figure (me). 

My girlfriend has said it is better if they form their own opinions about their dad and learn for themselves he doesn't truly care about them. 4 and 6 is just too young to know the difference between right and wrong. All they know is you're supposed to love your parent's. They went from seeing their dad everyday to him rarely seeing him (well except for when he was in jail). I personally think she is putting them in harm's way if she lets them see their dad and having a good father figure is better than an abusive dad. ",28Feb2019,1
472,"Hi,

Got removed from personal finance sub, stated it's because I'm trying to convince someone to do something. Doesn't fit my circumstances, but they directed me here. She actually does need solutions and I'm providing her with as much info and support as possible, so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I am here seeking advice for my mother (58 F). She is located in TX. She was diagnosed with ER negative, stage 1A Breast Cancer, 1.5 cm tumor. She has no insurance and is self employed. She makes over 4k per month. Her expenses are 2.4k per month and she just got over being homeless for 3 years. She does not qualify for medicaid, does not qualify for community programs and does not have Credit Cards. She applied for CCs and they are offering 25% interest rates, as she doesn't have credit history. She does not currently qualify for Obamacare as she is past the enrollment period and is not within their exclusion criteria.

I have offered to help. She has already spent money on a homeopathic doctor and 200$ of apples.

Questions:

Where can she go to get treatment on a payment plan?

Do you know of ANY programs that she may qualify for?

If not, any suggestions would be helpful or similar experience outcomes. Thank you so much for your time!

Edit to add: She only has 5k of savings. She ideally wants to 'pay cash' for treatment, but needs to start treatment within 45 days. It's not possible for her to earn and save for the total upfront. She's looking at lumpectomy and radiation, at a cost of 30-40k$. If you know of any financing options besides CCs, please let me know.",28Feb2019,1

477,"I really don't know where else to post this but here we go. Apologizes for the long rambling paragraphs.

My husband and i have been together for 6 years ( i met him when i was 18 and he 25 ) I have horrible ""anxiety"" but I've never been diagnosed. I don't go outside, I don't go out unless he brings me with him and even then I sometimes have a crying fit that I cant force my brain to stop (he is great when i break down, he is very helpful at those moments) I don't have a job, the last job I had was at McDonald and I would bike 2 hours each way, which only lasted a few months till I broke down and my brain just shut off and I stayed in bed for weeks. Husband pays for everything, he supports us 100%. I clean and cook healthy meals from scratch and prepare his laundry for when he gets home and pack his lunch and generally attempt to be useful, which gives me something to do and keeps him from feeling used (hopefully) fyi we don't have kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my husband a lot, and for the most part he's amazing, but he is pretty insensitive when it comes to mental health stuff. My childhood was filled with horrible experiences and I still have night bad dreams about it, he usually wakes me up and helps me fall back asleep so he knows im having a hard time and not just faking. My husband doesn't want to hear about any of it. If I talk about how im afraid of everything he tells me about the time ""he was shy in grade school"" and goes on about all the ways I can fix it based on his extensive knowledge of the subject, which makes me feel like nothing is wrong and I'm MORE crazy for not figuring out that obvious solve, Otherwise he'll ignore me and change the subject as fast as he can. He used to show me google pictures of starving children (He stopped) in Africa to make me realize how easy I have it, he is right, but it doesn't make me feel better. He whines about sex and once freaked out and told me ""i'm about to walk here"" which means he's going to leave me, if I don't start having sex with him more (we average 2-3 times per week). If he were to kick me out I'd be homeless, which I understand is a stressful responsibility for him, but threatening things he isn't actually going to do, in order to scare me into having sex with him more otherwise ill be homeless makes me feel horrible. He is very physical with me but has NEVER EVER hit me, he usually tries to grab my arms and hold me down and tickles/pinches/gropes/kisses me (which I am laughing most of the time) but sometimes I don't like it and he wont stop when asked the 1st 2nd or 3rd time he just says ""you love it"" and I always have little finger bruises on my forearms. He constantly gropes me, CONSTANTLY. If he hasn't had sex in 3-4 days he has anger fits and acts like a child and will say ""its because I haven't got laid lately"" and on the rare occasion will say something to the effect of it being my job because I don't have one. When he's angry he will call me crazy and ""that I need therapy (which I do) but him saying it as an insult makes me feel ashamed.  I wait until the dust has settled and bring up the mean things he has said but he will just respond "" I never said that "".

&amp;#x200B;

This all makes him sound pretty terrible but my life has been much better with him and 90% of the time I have no issues. He wakes me up with coffee and a kiss every morning, takes care of ALL the adulting, and makes me smile on a daily basis. I am a big ball of negativity at this point which doesn't help, how do you feel sorry for someone if they always have a chip on their shoulder and never helps themselves? When he does try and talk to me about getting a job/contributing I shut down and feel terrified like I'm being attacked and literally run away and hide which I've tried to not do but otherwise I start crying against my control and its stupid. He only really brings up the job thing when he is mad at me in the first place, he said he doesn't bring it up when things are good because he doesn't want to ruin the good mood. When I have small moments of anxiety like going to take the trash out he'll say ""how are you supposed to \_\_\_ if you can't even \_\_\_"" and then get upset when that upsets me, am I being sensitive? Can't help but to feel like I'm just bringing him down and he deserved to have a normal relationship with a normal person like him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the solution is ""go get professional help"" and ""talk to him about it"" but I have an issue with those things. I cant see a doctor because I am afraid to go out, and my mom used to bring me to a psychiatrist and frantically coach me about ""what to say"" so she could get medication and use it (she's a drug addict) people used to stare at us in the waiting room because she was doing this, and the doctor would say he couldn't help me if I didn't speak to him (but I was too nervous) and was ""trapped"". So now I have a phobia of the doctor and feel like i'm just using it to get drugs and try and beg for disability like she did. I can't even talk on the phone anymore, words just stopped coming out whole one day and I talk too quiet for anyone to hear me. If I were to sit down and talk about issues with husband it immediately goes to how I don't have a job which shuts me down and I cant continue, or he will do the ""I didn't say that"" thing.

What should I think? I don't even know how to conceptualize my own situation. I don't even recognize myself in the mirror, I don't know what kind of clothes people wear, everything always happens at once and its completely overwhelming. Being a normal human is foreign to me, how do people walk around, hold jobs, make friends, go to school? I cant even walk without thinking ""what do normal people do with their hands?"" and start walking like the invisible suitcase lady from Seinfeld. Am I just a whiny self absorbed first world idiot who is too lazy to get a job and pretends to have problems so I can try and make people feel sorry for me? What should I do? I want to just suck it up and that's what I WAS doing for years but now I start crying uncontrollably against my will and everyone looks at me because I'm fucking crying, THANKS BRAIN, REALLY FUCKING HELPFUL!!!!!! What other options do I have for helping myself? What kind of support should I expect from my husband? I eat healthy and all that jazz. I don't have any friends or family to talk to so It's just you and I reddit peoples.",28Feb2019,1

I am struggling as to what career/industry/organizations to enter that would fit my experience and skills. I have a BA in Japanese and Chinese Language and Literature and minors in Psychology and International Business. Although, I'm not sure if employers look at or consider minors at all... do they? I graduated and 2 years ago and joined the Peace Corps and am about to finish my service. However, I'm struggling to figure out what to do afterwards. 

As for the types of industry or career fields I am interested in are: entertainment (movies and games), international relations and business, and maybe NGO work youth related cause I've done some work with youth development through the Peace Corps. For example, I've designed and implemented grant projects focusing on promoting environmental awareness among youth through summer camps, developed youth employability workshops, and improved pre-existing creative writing conferences by adding innovative and immersive role playing features for youth to learn various creative writing methods that do not follow regular classroom techniques. When I implemented the environmental youth summer camp, I was in charge of marketing and communications. I managed relations and communicated with prospective campers and camp counselors, managed applications and social media pages, conducted leadership trainings, developed positive relations with venues and NGOs to give presentations to campers, and created various activities to build teamwork and leadership among youth, review the material learned during the camp, and promote the camp activities and reputation through social media. What kinds of careers or jobs would I be able to apply these skills and experience?

Also, I think I've identified some transferable skills I've gained from previous jobs to apply to future jobs: creating and developing events, trainings, conferences, workshops; perceiving patterns, researching, planning, interpret, speak, and read foreign languages (I have Japanese and Chinese language and literature degrees and am in the process of getting the language proficiency certification). What jobs do you think would apply these skills with the career fields mentioned above?

489,"My mother(39) usually comes home from work really late (8:00pm to 11:00pm) when her work is finished hours earlier. She drinks beer at her work and she prefers staying at work rather than here with my dad(43) and me(16M). This has been going on for quite a while and I am totally not ok with it. I have tried telling my mother to stop it and come home when she is done but she either says that she had a lot of work (which is a lie because she is drunk and with a can of beer in her hand) or that she prefers staying at work because my dad and I don't really talk to her and stay with here at home, but that's because she is drunk and when she is drunk she becomes really toxic and mad at everything we say to her. Anyways, as I said this has been going on since I can remember stuff from my early childhood. Today, my dad and I were alone at home (as usual) and he told me his problems with my mom.(Keep in mind that my dad is not really a talkative person and when he has a problem he doesn't let you know he has one). He said to me ""She prefers staying at work and drinking beers but I always tell her, come here and drink beers. My problem is not the alcohol, but that she prefers staying at work. If she has more fun at work, drinking beers, I will show her how fun it is (insinuating that he is going to have fun outside of home as well)"" I told him that that is not a solution to the problem, and it will only make it worse but he said he has tried everything else and she keeps doing that, what else can he do?

People have been making up the dumbest rumors about me, talking shit in front of me and behind my back, making fun of the fact that I have anxiety and that I have anxiety attacks, laughing at everything I wear and say, even though I’m a pretty basic person and I don’t wear anything out of the ordinary except for some platform shoes I bought.

491,"Just information:

I'm a boy.

For easier understanding, let's give the persons in the story some names:
My best friend is now called Adam.
The other friend is now called Rachel.
The third friend (not as important to the story) is now called Hannah.

*These are not their real names*

Here we go;

At the moment, I'm an exchange student located in Argentina. I've been here for around 6 months now and have found my best friend here, Adam.
We are really connected. We have so many common interests, we're honest to each other, sarcastic, pick on each other (jokingly) and almost know each other like twins.
We hang out all the time and we're having a fantastic time.

There are also four other exchange students here in my city and we've went along pretty well.
Sometimes Adam and I also hang out with two of the other exchange students, Rachel and Hannah and Adam has seemed to get especially pretty well along with Rachel.
I used to get pretty well along with Rachel too but it seems like things are starting to get heated between us at the moment and I don't know when and why it started.

Rachel seems to always:
Laugh at Adam's jokes no matter what, defend him when he or I disagree with each other, text him all the time, get close and touchy with him, inviting him and Hannah to hangout and excluding me, etc.

The atmosphere in general seems pretty heated when Rachel and I are in the same room and I'm pretty sure why.

I THINK she is jealous/threatened by my close friendship with Adam. Even Hannah (she's very close to Rachel) once texted me about what I think of her being best friends with Adam, how I feel, why we seem to argue all the time, etc.
I don't mind them being friends with each other or even more if that's the case. But what does bother me is her hostile and toxic behavior towards me.

And I even talk to Adam about this and he notices it too. And we both agree that it looks like Rachel seems jealous and has a crush on Adam. Once he accidentally saw a message on Rachel's phone about her liking him. Though he doesn't feel the same way towards her.

The question is though, what do I do?

Who should I talk to, how should I say it or should I just act like nothing?

I just want Rachel and I to be able to share the best friend without acting hostile towards each other.


I apologise if there are some grammatical errors or confusing parts. English is not my first language.

Any further questions or help is always appreciated :)


Thank you.

493,"I \[F21\] have a long and complicated history with my ex \[M21\]. The latest news is that we ended our relationship because things were feeling off. I agreed initially and we decided to be friends. We ended up sleeping together which triggered the thought that if we want to be best friends and are still sleeping together, why wouldn't we try again? so, I expressed my thoughts and feelings to him and asked him if he would be willing to work at our relationship one more time. He told me that part of him really would like to say yes and get back together, but a rational part of him doesn't think it would work out in the long run and we should save ourselves the harm. He's admitted to still having romantic feelings for me and not wanting to lose me in his life, but that he's just sure we wouldn't work. I'm kind of stuck because I think that if we both want to be together, we both love each other and don't want to lose one another, why not try? We could go about it differently and have more open communication - something we lacked.

Essentially, the ball is in my court, i can be his friend if i want or i can cut him out if thats what i feel is best. But he has said no to getting back together. I just feel so strongly that he is wrong and I am almost sure that we could do things right this time. But then again, i don't want to lose our friendship and i can see his perspective. I can be just his friend because I am able to compartmentalize my romantic feelings if he doesn't initiate their return.

I wrote him a letter detailing my feelings and thoughts. It isn't to ask him to get back together or to say goodbye, i'm just clearly expressing my emotions. Should i let him read it? I'm thinking it could help me let go of our history or maybe it could get him to see my perspective.

TL;DR: ex and i still have feelings for each other but he doesn't think getting back together is a good idea because we would only end up hurt, but I know things can change this time around. I want to give him a letter i wrote about my perspective in hopes that we'll get closure and be friends or a small part of me wishes he'll read it and change his view. What do i do!!!",28Feb2019,3

495,"(Bit of a warning: My experience may be triggering to some if you’ve been r*ped, m*lested or anything of the sort this may be triggering.)

This happened back in 2015 when my dads side of the family came to visit, the first time it happened was on my familys’ couch. Me and  two cousins were watching sinister I think? I was on the couch laying next to my cousin let’s call him PC p*do cousin and his sister sitting on the floor NC nice cousin. I was laying there wondering when the next character was going to die and then..I felt something go down my underwear...I felt scared, uncomfortable and just wondering when he was going to stop..he did when my father came in he talked for a bit and went back into the kitchen (If you’re wondering why He didn’t see the couch pillows covered my lower body.) And we went to bed after the movie was done.

A day later I wanted to watch Under the bed with someone and PC offered to watch it with me..He did it again..He only stopped when my father or anyone came into my room where we were watching the movie (we had a blanket covering us.) and he didn’t do anything after that. I just told myself “Live and forget.” I didn’t forget. 

I came out to my brother 2 years later after it happened to me he is the most wonderful brother and I trust him ALOT. He told me to tell mom, and I did he even told her “Mom, You need to listen to her.” And It spilled She was horrified to find out what had happened I thought she told my dad but a month ago my father was showing pictures of PCs NEWBORN BABY and I was sad to know my father liked someone who touched his own daughter my mom told me that she didn’t tell him, that she didn’t HOW tell him and I told him..if you’re wondering, no, I can’t take legal action as 1. There is no evidence just my words. 2. We were both minors. 3. It happened years ago. The only way to prove it was to get a confession witch I DOUBT he would confess. 

My dad says he loves me with all his heart, I fucking doubt that after that night. He said shit like “I thought we are closer than that.” And BEST OF FUCKING ALL “Great, Now I can never see my great grandson.” YEAH FUCKING THANKS “DAD”. He cut ties with his son who we call Big n (No, Not big nigga gamers.) and we haven’t seen them since.

Guess what! this never would’ve happened if big ns wife NEVER dropped off the kids they were even told NOT to drop them off. And do you know what my father said to put the cherry on top? 

“Can you forgive him?”


.....Yes my father asked me to FORGIVE a PEDOPHILE. And I have another story but that would make this post even longer. So should I trust my father? Or no. (I am not old enough to get a place of my own yet.)

I just started a remote part time job and turns out my employer lives ~50 miles from me. She’s very sweet and we bond over some common interests. 

Well, she called me today and asked if I’d be interested in coming to her area for an event somewhat related to our work next week. It’s not FOR work and she just asked if I’d like to come from 11am-1pm to this event. I do have a nannying job a couple days a week at 3pm.

I started with, “Well, I’d love to! But it’s about 1:15 hours away, and I do have another job in the afternoons at 3pm.” 

She said: “1:15 hours? No way! I know that (her location) is only 30 miles south of (near me).”

Me: “Well, I live a little further north, but yes my Google maps is telling me I’m about 1:15 hours away.” 

Her: “I don’t want to pressure you! But I just thought you’d like to come. It ends at 1pm so you can go to your other job after.”

I sort of said, “I would absolutely love to come and meet you, but I am worried about the commute and timing...” before she had to go answer another call, but it’s very unclear. 

I just want to prep for when she calls me back and asks for my answer. 

Realistically I’d make it to my other job just fine, and she knows this since she knows my
location &amp; distance. But:
- I am not sure if it’s paid (I don’t feel comfortable asking, but I’m going to assume not since it’s not FOR work, it’s just an event where she’s inviting me to come to meet her)
- I also do not have the gas money for ~100 miles round trip AND commuting to and from my second job. (The fact I was looking for another job should say I don’t have enough gas money lol.) As a nanny I have to drive around and do errands and I just worry about gas money. 
- It’s just a busy day as is and I truthfully don’t want to spread myself so thin financially and mentally with the 2:30 hours of driving plus making it to work with kids all evening. I’m wary bringing up gas money issues because it’s not professional and is just awkward.

She’s very sweet but she just started this very small company and so since I’m so new to this brand new company and job, I still want to prove to her I’m a good choice, and fear not going and trying to come up with a reason not to will make me look bad.

I don't know if this is the right place to write this but I really need some advice. For reference, my friend and I are both 19 years old. My friend has struggled with an eating disorder and depression for many years. Recently she went through recovery for her eating disorder and she was doing much better. However, for the last couple weeks she's been going through a depressive episode and has been closed off and suicidal. She is actively seeing a therapist and is getting help. But I guess the issue I need advice on is how am I supposed to help? I grew up in a family that never discussed mental health and pretty much suppressed everything and I guess as a result most people would describe me as emotionally closed off and probably quite insensitive.

501,"Hello. I am a 20 y/o college student and I have two employment opportunities presented to me. Neither are completely confirmed, but I feel both have a fairly high chance of me working for them because of a few following reasons:

The first job is with a company that provides temp hires to other companies while said companies look for someone to fill their positions. I study computer science, and she said she is not looking for someone that does IT, but a general engineering student. Despite what I study, she says I probably still fit the application nicely and would like to hear back from me. The pay does not really matter, but I do not know the pay of the other position so if it ends up being an unpaid internship then I do not really want to do it. This position would pay 15/hr and would be about 15-40 hours a week. I would start working as soon as I could.

The other position is a data analysis intern for an organ donation company, and it is over the summer of this year. I was referred to a position by a woman that works for the company, so I feel that since I know her it would really increase my chances of getting the position compared to other applicants. Particularly why I want to work for this position is because it is only over the summer and seems more specialized as well as relevant to my interests, and likely pays just as much if not more. It also has a consistent 35/hrs a week and that would be great since I would have no school going on.

In an ideal world, I want to work for the first company until the summer hits and then go work for the organ donation company and then come back to the other company. I want to inform the woman I am talking to who runs the first company that I would love to work for her, but am expecting work over the summer. What is the best course of action to take here?

Would it be wrong of me to work for the first company, and if I get the position of the 2nd one, to leave them by the time the summer comes around?",28Feb2019,2

507,"I'm posting this to see if anyone has been in a similar situation. I'm a 30 year old male. I have had back pain since I was around 14 years old, but it was never bad enough to keep me from being active. I played several sports, worked out somewhat regularly, rode bikes, etc.... About a year and a half ago I hurt my back at work. I wasn't able to stand up, and I had to be wheeled to a doctor. This is the exact moment my life changed drastically. I haven't been able to play any sports be active, or even, stand or sit for very long. It's been awful. After fighting with workers comp (they told me it was psychosomatic or a form of arthritis), I finally just caved and got an MRI because I couldn't keep waiting to find a solution. I have several bulged discs and a herniated disc. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, since the pain isn't radiating down my legs, the surgeon isn't too keen on a discectomy. Plus, the pain is lower than the herniation. The surgeon told me the best option for quality of life is disc replacement. But, apparently, this  isn't covered in the US by health insurance.

Recently we have spent hours a day messaging back and forth, telephone calls lasting hours talking him through emotional distress and calming him to enable him to sleep at night. I am very happy to be in the position to be able to help support him through this and dedicate the time to him, however it is becoming more and more apparent that that is all he sees me as now, an emotional crutch. When things improve in his relationship he completely drops me.

I have my own mental health issues which I am mostly in control of but do naturally have less resilience than is required to be such a support for such a prolonged period of time. This is really starting to take its toll on me and I tried to delicately explain this to him but he becomes very defensive and denies that this happens. He told me that he loves me and I'm so important to him and that I'm another person who is going to abandon him..

I am currently in year 1 of a certain program. My sister is entering year 1 of that same program this September. It will be 4 years long. I casually mentioned in passing how I would be selling my textbooks, and she immediately said there was no way I was selling them; she needed them. I said O.K., and asked if she'd be willing to pay about 2/3 of what I'd sell them for online. She said I should give them to her; I disagreed.

Later I found out she went to our father about this and my father is angry and upset I am not giving her the textbooks. Please keep in mind, some of these textbooks, such as my Stewart Calculus one, cost me over $200 CAD. For this year alone, I have spent nearly $1000 on these textbooks. I believe it's more than fair I am willing to sell them to her at a discount; after all, she would have to be purchasing them at a higher rate herself anyways. 

If I give her this year's textbooks, she will want the next, and the next. I have tried getting advice  from my family/friends but everyone is basically saying just 'give her the textbooks'.  I guess that would be the 'nice' thing to do but I work hard for the money I have, and it seems unfair that I am expected to hand over my hard-earned money on a silver platter to her. 

Can anyone provide insight on this? Another way of viewing it? Am I really the only one looked at this skewed?  Sometimes I lock into a certain perspective and find it hard to shift so if someone can provide me another perspective or some advice I would appreciate it.

522,"My first language isn't English so sorry for spelling and grammar :/

I'm 16 years old and I'm feeling suicidal for past 3-4 years. My suicide thoughts started when I was 12 and my parents got into a heavy fight, I was trying to calm them down and calm down my little brother ( 3 yo at that time). My father out of anger stared into my eyes and told me that all this fighting with mom wouldn't happen if I wasn't born. I was at a lost of words. I couldn't say anything to him or my mother for the next 2 months. My mom would try to speak with me but it all seemed fake and forced. I tried to go out more and be less in the house but I have problems with my ankles and I can't walk for extended periods or ride a bike, so I'm kinda forced to stay in close proximity of my house. 

My connection with mom started to get better but my father either ignore my existence or started yelling at me when he was either drunk or in bad mood.

2 years pass and my parents get into a even bigger fight and blah blah blah my father is again angry at me telling me that I'm the problem, that I'm worthless shit like that. I'm was already used to it, but my mom was sick of it so she started packing our bags and told us that we are moving to our grandmother's house. Father went out to smoke. I walked past the balcony where he was smoking and he had the audacity to tell me that next time you'll see me I will be hanging from the roof just like both of your grandfather's.

Fast forward to now and I'm living with my mom and my little  brother. I was starting to enjoy life for the first time in the last years and then out of nowhere I got scoliosis and problems with my heart ( when I start to stress my blood pressure goes up and I start feeling physical pain in my heart) all in one months time. My grades keep calling for the last year. I studying almost all day and I still can't understand anything. My love for drums is slowly fading away. My friends start to feel more and more distant from me. Trying to find new friends has failed more times I can count. For a long time I was feeling better after playing video games especially after multiplayer games but that's not the case anymore. My father sometimes calls me either blackout drunk and just mumbles or asks me about my brother (never about me)  and later calls him just to talk with him and not me. I'm happy that we don't live with him anymore but my life seems to go downhill 

I've lost all my motivation to do anything and for that matter motivation to live. I feel lost.

524,"Hello,

I currently work for Availity. Unless you work in the USA and in the medical field you have never heard of it.

Anyway, I work in a call center position where I take calls from insurance companies and doctors all day every day.

I work 8:30-5:00 M-F and I get an hour lunch... Until Monday when they switch to 2 15 min breaks and 1 30 min lunch.

I don't have healthcare because I am a contractor because they found the single flaw in our laws that allows them to not offer full timers full time benefits. 

I want to love this job because when I do get full time the benefits are worth it but it is hard.

I'm so frustrated and I'm not sure if it is me or the job or what.

Everything I do is basically more complicated customer service. So if you think retail customer service via the phone, that's me but with medical information.

525,"TLDR: uni flatmate is super annoying and cringey to be around and I feel like I can't speak up about it because she's a friend of my girlfriend.

So I'm currently in my first year of university and am living in student halls with 5 other people (including my gf). I get along with all my flatmates just fine, I'm not really friends with any of them but we get along fine and they are good to talk to. All apart from one.

This particular girl, let's call her T, is just the most annoying person I've ever had the misfortune to meet. She's very friendly, and I'm sure has no idea how annoying she actually is to me, but she really pisses me off almost every day, and I can't fucking stand her as a human being.

For starters, she just never shuts the fuck up. As soon as she walks into a room she will just start waffling on about nothing until she leaves the room. She can talk for ages and say absolutely nothing of any interest. She also seems to wait until me and my girlfriend are eating in the kitchen and will come in when she hears us, and then just starts going on and on about herself and I'm just not fucking interested at all. The worst part is that I can't even talk to my gf about anything when T is in the room as she wants to be in on every conversation, and barely ever stops talking to let other people talk.

T is also very embarrassing to be around. She's so saccharine in everything she says to the point of nausea. Almost every time she sees me and my girlfriend together doing anything, no matter how mundane, she has to make some cringey comment about how ""cute"" we are or how ""adorable"" she thinks we are. Would be nice to hear from anyone else, but T says this all the time and to be honest it's just embarrassing and makes me feel really self conscious. I've also learned that I cannot tell T anything as she is physically unable to keep anything private.

T also has a very poor understanding of physical space. Back when I hadn't known her long and she wasn't annoying to me, the whole flat was watching a movie in the kitchen and she just decides to put her legs on mine as a footrest. Only a little thing I know but she does this all the time to people, and I think she is way to comfortable around everyone in the flat.

She also has a habit of getting really drunk on nights out. So much so that me and my gf have to carry her to her room (this is not easy cause she is really fat). She's also vomited on the floor of the kitchen a number of times which is just disgusting, and I now refuse to help her when she gets in a state like that because I'm sick of having to fucking deal with her all the time.

Doesn't help that my girlfriend is super nice and caring and always entertains T's bullshit, so by extension that mean I have to or I look like a jerk.

No idea what to say or do to get out of this situation. Advice welcome.",28Feb2019,2

527," 

Okay,  this is gonna sound a little  paranoid coming out of the gate here. In  fact, if enough of you tell me  my suspicions are unfounded, I'll believe  you. I work in a tech  support type call center that has a decent amount  of downtime so it's  fairly common practice to bring headphones in for  entertainment and  whatnot. I've been doing so with a pair of over-ear  Audio-Technicas  that I've had for like three or four years. They were  the first nice  headphones I could afford. I was only able to afford them  in the first  place because some drunk rich guy tipped me a Benjamin  when I was  bartending.  They seemed to be their flagship entry level set  at the  time but it was years ago so I could be wrong. Looked very  similar to,  or maybe even were, the [ATH-M30x](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/f6e3988012a67cd1/index.html)   model. Anyway, being as auditory a thinker as I am, they quickly  became  an extension of my body. I listened to most of the music that's   important to me now for the first time through them. Spent countless   hours working on creative projects through them. Listened to books I now   carry in my head wherever I go through them. Had countless late-night   conversations through them that changed my life, and one that saved it.   What I'm trying to say here is, this pair of headphones means a lot to   me.

I   left them at work a couple days ago. I'm a pretty absent-minded  person,  so by the time I realized what happened, the building was  closed for  the night. No big deal, people leave their stuff in the tech  dungeon all  the time. It wasn't until my next shift that I got  worried; they were  gone from my station. Now, I know maintenance guys  come through during  the night to get the trash, but none of them came  in for their next  shift with a new pair of headphones that looks like  mine, but for a  subtle logo change from silver to black. Co-worker did.  I did some  research and realize the ATH-M20s would look like that, and  that there's  a decent chance the guy just bought them, but I'd combed  my car,  apartment, classrooms, and even my university's lost-and-found  for days  with no luck so when I saw them, they popped like neon.  Because I've  been dealing with repressed social anxiety my whole life,  it took about  half an hour to work up the nerve to actually ask  anything. I asked  whose they were (they were sitting on a sort of  communal desk) and  co-worker had a weird, flustered answer to my  question for like ten  seconds before saying they were his. Before I go  any further, remember  that I work in a \*tech dungeon\*, so weird,  flustered answers aren't  totally out of the question. However, this guy  has never really come off  as awkward before. Whatever. Worth  mentioning.

My   would-be confrontation ended when my rabid paranoia lifted and the   black logo came into view. I felt silly for saying anything at all and   apologized for being so direct. The conversation just kind of defaulted   to us talking about headphones good-naturedly from there, which  could've  either been natural or a manipulative redirection. Immediately   afterward it occurred to me how easy it would be to color the logo. I   didn't get a good look at the set before we got back to working, but I   had missed my window of greatest opportunity.

**And so,** [/](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones)r/advice,  **we   finally come to my question. Is there any way I can (from a casual   distance) determine the difference between the ATH-M20s and the pair I   described without coming off as a dick (i.e. rubbing alcohol/seizing   them)? I don't want to come off as some suspicious ass in my place of   work, and I don't want to hurt the guy's feelings. I just want my   headphones back.**",28Feb2019,2
528,"I'm a baseball fan, but it feels like teams always have that one element to them that makes things downright depressing; namely, the ownership.

Look all over the leagues, and you'll find tales of shitty owners like:

* The McCourts and their feuding over their parking empires.
* Jeff Loria, who pretty much rubbed salt into all of the Montreal Expos' open wounds and rendered them deader then dead - then did the same thing to the Miami Marlins.
* Marge Schott - who was an insane Nazi (that last part isn't even a joke)
* Donald Sterling - racist asshole.
* Dan Snyder - another racist asshole
* Hell, even Babe Ruth was traded to the Yankees because the Red Sox' owner wanted money to fund a musical production.

With that in mind, I'm surprised there isn't more push for more fan-owned teams like the Green Bay Packers or FC Barcelona. Of course, the leagues in North America are hostile. The NFL outright bans collective ownership (the Packers had a grandfather clause) and when Joan Kroc tried to leave the Padres to the city of San Diego, MLB kiboshed the deal.

You'd think there'd be some kind of movement against owners, but I'm not seeing anything. I started [a thread](https://redd.it/avuzim) and no one seems interested, or they have a cynical outlook.

So when a lot of the team is dictated by the whims of some asshole billionaire who is either unethical, penny-pinching, incompetent, or some combination of the three, is that reason enough to keep being interested?

Is there some movement I haven't noticed? Is there some facet of the situation I haven't noticed?

And above all, is crummy ownership a good enough reason to stop being interested?",28Feb2019,2
529,"Tldr: recent date is making me relive past traumatic experiences. 

I really dont know how to start this... 
I'm currently 28. From the ages 6-12 I was sexually molested and assulted.

I told my mom who didnt believe me and for a year I essentially stopped talking. 

We moved about every 6 months so it was nearly impossible for me to make friends. I wound up finding one person most schools till I moved again.

Anyway during that time all the way up to college I had consistent night terrors and severe anxiety, plus my moms string of abusive boyfriends, I was scared 24/7.

In college after I met my first boyfriend things seemed to become easier. I got comfortable around him and we would hang out with his friends who I was also comfortable with. Things turned around for me at 20. At least I thought so.

I was with him for about 6.5 years.the first couple of months were great, but things went downhill. He started trying to get with others and started becoming mean. From my weight to my habits every thing annoyed him. About 1.5 years in I told him of my past. He became nicer for a bit, but when I would bring up how something makes me uncomfortable he would say get over it. He made me think that I was crazy, stupid or retarded. He said no one would love me like him cause I'm too difficult with my ""issues"". So I stayed with him another 5 years...(also I've tried to break up with him twice. Twice he said he'd kill himself and put his hand/ head through a door and wall, I caved...)

 during this time he completly made me feel worthless. My night terrors came back, when I would wake up in a panic he never comfort me, he'd wake up and go back to bed, leaving me alone right next to him. When he yell, shout and break things he would blame me, saying I made him do those things. If it wasn't for me he wouldn't act this way.

He never hit me, but he would grab me very hard by the arms and yell at me.
He completly destroy stuff and say the object should be me. I again became scared 24/7. He come home and I ran to bed to pretend I was sleeping cause who knew if I would do something to upset him.

  I didnt realize till the end of the relationship that he was manipulater and emotionally abusive (cause I thought everything was my fault).

So here I am more than a year broken up and about a year no contact. I sometimes have nightmares and wake up in a panic, but considering where I was I was doing much better. 

So during this time of me being by myself I've been on 3 dates. 1 from tinder and 1 from a friend who set us up. They were fine but I didnt feel any connection.  
The most recent 1, a couple of days ago was a friend I used to work with 2 years ago. We've kept in contact through text and messenger.

We hung out at his place. It was fine until he figured out I was ticklish. He kept tickling me and kept grabbing me. I would move his hands away and he would grab my hands and keep going. I asked him to stop, but I was laughing so I dont think he thought I was serious. He kept getting real close to me cause i guess he wanted to kiss me so i kissed him. Despite that it was kind of nice... but then he kept tickling and getting close again and I kept kissing him pecks at a time and those weren't really nice. I was kissing him to stop touching me. 

Eventually he said ""I'm undressing you with my eyes"" (super cringe)
""Well dont do that"" I said.
""Why not""
""Cause I dont consent""

He immediately  backed off and about 10 min later he said I can take you home whenever you want.

I waited for an episode of the show we were watching to end and said I should head back. He dropped me off.

Despite how I worded it here I thought it was a good date until after I got home and talked to my friend about it. I started to feel weird about the situation the more I thought about it. I just sat there and let things happen to me like I did as a child. I should've left right away but a guy was interested in me and I didnt want him to become uninterested... he wanted to do a lot more than what I was willing to do. He thought I would be easy.

I was so disappointed in myself. I shouldn't have gone to his place. And now I just feel dirty all the time. Its not just nightmares anymore. During the day I have quick flashbacks to when I was a kid and I twitch. A head twitch to shake the image from my mind. Its happening a lot now and I feel like I'm crazy. I have to be constantly distracted and even then things pop up. Like I can feel them touching me and I'm just getting more and more freaked out by the day.

I feel as if I was sent back to square one in recovery...

So is this just too fresh and will it decline as time goes on or should I cave and finally see a therapist?

Also, the guy asked me on another date 2 days later and ""plans for a 2nd date, things could get frisky?"" (But didnt they already!?) I replied sorry dude. You're too much for me"" and left it at that.

536,"I don’t know how much context is relevant so I’ll just give a decent amount. Lmk if I need to clarify anything. “A” (23,F) and I (19,M) became good friends in fall semester in a class where we end up going to a lot of school sporting events. I had met her a year previously and we’re friends. We sat next to each other for all of the events, and hung out a lot to do HW, play board games with other friends, and get dinner with other friends before events. 

Over winter we signed up for a intramural sports team. First game she says she doesn’t want to go because a guy on the opposing team had creepy crush on her once. I tried to get her to go because you really don’t see the opposing team at all because of the helmets and such. The game got cancelled due to weather so whatever. Second game a week later she says she is sick and can’t go. She had skipped class that week too I didn’t think too much of it, and she said she’d go to the next game with me. Third game, two weeks later (which is now two weeks ago) she decides to go to a movie. I feel ditched and kinda hurt because I was looking forward to hang out. Over same period of time, we didn’t hang out at all and she ditched on a plan to get food with other friends before an event in mid January. 

Ever since I tried to talk to her about feeling ditched she hasn’t talked to me or even waved to me in class or anything. I felt hurt and didn’t sit next to her in class. Is it worth pursuing this friendship? Should I try to get her to say why she isn’t taking, or ask one of her friends that I kinda know? Or just start sitting in my normal seat next to her and see what happens?


TL;DR:

Friend (let’s call her A) doesn’t really talk to me when I see her in class two times a week. Mutual friends that are better friends with her than me always make a point to at least say “hello how’s it goin”. Weird behavior started after I tried to convince A to go to intramural sports game we signed to play together weeks ago. At one point she called me her best friend, and now I feel like I’m someone she talked to a few times in life. What do?

So pancho takes this guys backpack his name is Jose and he slams it on my table. Me not knowing how to react I ignored it. Pancho comes back lifts up the backpack and slams the backpack back on the table I ignore it again. 5 minutes later when lunch was over Jose the owner of the backpack come to get it and thanks me for looking after it. But Jose was sitting at the table with the guys the whole time I'm sure he knew what was going on. Earlier in the school year around December or January I was in my history class. I got up to turn in some papers. I left my glasses on my desk and pancho goes to try my glasses on he sees me and goes back to his desk. I Think he was gonna try to do an impression of me.
Fast forward to today i was in lunch I had my head down and the group of guys were next to me on their own table. I felt some thing hit my head. I heard laughing. I lifted up my head and saw a napkin on the floor next to me. There where no trash cans near us so I'm sure they where aiming for me. On my way out of the cafeteria I felt someone Pat my shoulder i didn't turn around so I didn't see who it was. My sister said that they are buying me but I don't really feel like that's it. I've never interacted with any of them so I don't know what they want.",28Feb2019,1

My girlfriend has made it known to me that sexual purity before marriage is something that is important to her. I have never had sex, however when I was younger (7 years ago) was pressured to do something with someone (receive oral sex) who was a female supervisor at the time. It definitely made me uncomfortable and is a sad memory of my past as well as something that I have tried my hardest to forget because its, well just a crappy memory. Other than that, I have kissed someone before but am overall in the clear on the purity part. We both come from ultra conservative backgrounds.

Do you think this is something that I should share with her or just keep to myself. I asked someone close to me who knows me and they said just keep it to myself and if pressured admit to only the less serious of having kissed someone before . They told me that if I had actually had sex (like intercourse) that's something I should probably share but this would probably be best to keep to myself.

544,"Most people make it look like having friends comes so naturally. They can make new friends and keep old ones close woth little to no effort. 

While im a likable guy, i never make a solid connection with people. No one hits me up to do fun stuff. No one ever cares how im doing. I have no one that i honestly consider a friend. I invite people out for all kinds of stuff but most people claim to be too busy. Rock climbing, lunch, dinner, video games, hiking, biking, drinks, pool. Nothing. If i were to tell someone this they would call bullshit and rifle off 10 names of people who are my ""friends"", but in all honesty we are just acquaintances. 

I tried for years to be more confident and outgoing. I used to be very introverted and reclusive. Now im a pretty outgoing person and i can talk to anyone and hold a good conversation. People often tell me how great i am and how much they like me, but it ends there. I almost feel like im projecting my personality too much. Im always trying to be funny or have something to say back to someone. I often analyze aocial sotuations amd feel as if i should just shut the fuck up for awhile and not engage with people. Maybe this is my past coming back to haunt me. Maybe its relevant. That voice in my head could be sabotaging me and drawing me back to who i once was, or it could be the voice of reason.

Some people just have it so easy. They make friends effortlessly.  They get invited to do things, they can plan get togethers and people are excited to show up.

But the thing is he completely shuts me out. I know he struggles with depression by smoking a lot of weed, and drinking almost every night. He’s gotten to the point where he’s about to drop out of college. He’s also taking psychedelics to try and feel happiness. Or find something that he’s looking for. That honestly all I know about it. He never talks about it with me of why he’s doing this, or why he’s feeling depressed. He’s starting to sleep way more than he usually does. He went from 6-7 hours a night to 9-12 hours. Whenever I try to talk to him he just says he doesn’t want to talk about it and he’s already told me everything but he hasn’t at all. I don’t know how to help him. I try to get him to do other activities other than drink like hey let’s play a video game without drinking. And then he thinks about it for a second and says mmm no and goes and starts drinking.

* I've made friends while living abroad but few are significant and meaningful
* I recently broke up with a very supportive girlfriend and don't want to get back with her because I was a shitty boyfriend
* And I don't know what to do with myself. I want change -- but I'm very unsure of myself and what I want and I lack confidence and determination to get things done.

I'm good at broadcasting news on the radio. But I don't like journalism anymore

I've been told to get into fiction writing as a career from several people and a few colleagues. I do have the time to finish a book on my own, but seriously, who's going to purchase a book and how would that pay for my debt and lifestyle? Should I just do this and see what happens?

I'm also certain I want to move back to the US, either NYC or CA - but those places are crazy expensive and unless I find a high-paying job (ha!), I can't do that.

Personally, I've made some big, positive changes in my life:

* I don't drink like a drunken clown anymore
* I work out 3-5 times a week (though because I have hypothyroidism I don't often see the results I want, which sucks)
* I eat healthy
* I'm trying to schedule a more routine lifestyle (like going to bed early, walking in the morning to clear my head, writing 1k fiction words a day, submitting pitches to outlets (though I really suck at that for some reason)
* I'm good with people
* I think I'm smart
* I've recently excelled at stand-up comedy and have a show coming soon

548,"I'll be the 1st to admit it I'm a loud mouth with an anger problem I have no trouble expressing what I'm thinking or what I'm feeling because that's how I was raised. That's how my grandmother was that's how my mother is that's how I am. I'll also admit sure sometimes I'm a contrarian. Usually I hold the opposing opinion of the majority around me but I formed that opinion myself through experience. Maybe even sometimes I can be an asshole

They always tell me I'm wrong the always just talk down my opinions no matter what I say And it's always all of them no one ever agrees with me what if they do they certainly won't admit it. Every time we're always together it's everybody down talking everything I have to say usually I ignore it but on occasion I actually get upset and try to defend my stance.

Well Just a little bit ago to of them admitted that whenever I try to defend my stance or my point of view they just ignore me. That they don't care. They don't care what I have to say or how I say it they are just not going to listen. I'm just apparently wrong and there is nothing that will change that ever.

So yeah I found out that nothing I say holds any value. I've always been afraid that whatever listens to me. That somehow I'm always wrong even when I'm right and that no matter what stance I hold everyone gets the same one as them they'll will disagree because its me. I've always wondered if I was just cursed to always be wrong to always be told that I'm wrong. It certainly made me feel better, Now I'm starting to doubt that.

554,"I (F 17) am like every other YA and I go through phases of liking people and then losing interest quickly. I have issues with committing to people and due to that as well as my mental health and insecurities, would prefer to stay single. During the holidays though, I was feeling really lonely and vulnerable so I 'hoe'd out a little and started dating around, sending nudes, and just having flings. 

&amp;#x200B;

One guy (let's call him D), who I definitely regret meeting with and involving him with my own personal struggles, refused to do anything sexual with me unless I committed. I genuinely believe that I did have feelings for him at the time (although they subsided as I am indecisive,) so I dropped my hoe activity, blocked loads of boys on Snapchat, and tried to settle down with him and have a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the guys subjected to my hoe activity (We'll call him B) messaged me on Discord not long after me and D defined the relationship and got together. I caved and sent him nudes. I felt like shit, lost sleep over it, and even almost landed myself back into the Psych ward from so much mental anguish and self hatred. I broke things off with D almost instantly due to the guilt and never told him I cheated for the sake of keeping things civil (we have mutual friends and I didn't want to make things awkward.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to two months, I begin talking to this new guy and I'm obsessed. He convinces me that we could spend the rest of our lives together if I went to college where he lived (even then I knew this couldn't happen because LDR are often unsuccessful when you're both so young.) We are currently together but I'm having doubts. 

&amp;#x200B;

This guy is so similar to me that sometimes I can't stand him. I'm pursuing a career in art and he'd like to do the same. I have mental disorders and so does he. I understand that this is shallow in some way but 1. I'd like to be with someone who commits to a career path (he's very indecisive and doesn't work hard enough for his goals,) and a stable one at that and 2. It's not very healthy for two severely depressed people to date, personally, this has only ever triggered my anxiety and overall made my mental health worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everytime I address these issues that I have with him not committing to hobbies and working harder to figure out the future if he's so adamant on planning ahead. He has all of these goals for us but gets tunnel visioned and doesn't plan for himself. I know being 17 allows leniency but if he wants me to pick up and move you'd at least think he'd have the goal to go to college and want to get a degree that could support this dream. Nope. He has no initiative to get a higher education and I just can't see the possibility of us ever working if he wants to just work a part time job and slum in a poor area/ struggle to make rent. When I address these issues, he changes his story and tries to say whatever would make me happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only this but B is back in my life (due to circumstances of us working on a long term programming and art related project with a team,) and he's convincing me that I need to drop this boy. I just feel like I'm stuck. Any suggestions?

563,"I'm so angry right now. I just left the DMV with news that I have to wait an extra 3 months until I can take my license test.
I am 17 Years old and I am a late starter when it comes to my permit, as I had no need because I had no way of getting a car at the time. I went to the DMV on September 10th, 2018 and took my written permit test and passed on my first attempt. I got my picture taken and all the neccesary steps after the fact so that I could get my permit. I went to the counter and recieved what I thought was my permit. I then proceeded to ask the 'not so nice' lady if I had gotten everything I needed to which she replied ,"" Yep, thats all of it."" and she went back to typing away.  

Que two months later when I schedule my driving lesson, only to learn that I do not have all the neccesary paperwork. I was furious but understood that the ""not so nice"" lady had screwed me over because she was being lazy. I went to the DMV on December 4th, 2018 with an appt. to get the rest of my paperwork. And after a long morning I got it. I explained to the lady what happened and she told me that September 10th was still my starting date. 

Around January 18th, 2019. My mom cleaned her car out and threw away my permit (yeah im not fucking kidding). So that brings me today as I spent the entire morning at the DMV to get a replacement permit. Finally, I was called to the counter and the lady explained to me that I wouldnt be able to take my test until 6 months after December 4th. I explained the sitatution and she helped by giving me absolutly no solutions. She explained that her computer system says December 4th, 2018 was when I recieved the permit, but that I took the test and applied on September 10th, 2018. Why would I wait 3 months to get my permit? It doesnt make any sense. My mom is planning on calling the DMV later and trying to resolve the sitatuion so that I can take my driving test in March.
If I had the time to wait I would, but I wait around all the time when it comes to rides and getting around places. On average, 25% of my week is waiting for rides home, the bus, or walking home, etc. Ive been working on my car with the intention of finishing in March. Its all ive wanted these past few months. I need the freedom, and honestly just driving so I can get to work. 

So what can I do so that this situation is shown to be the DMVs fault? Or so that its in my favor? How do I prove my case? Why would I wait 3 months to get my paperwork? Clearly that should be a red flag. Just any general advice would be appreciated.

577,"Hello Reddit, 

I have posted about this in the past and tried the advice I was given but it did not work. I'm truly at a loss so I figured I would come back and ask again. Just to warn you all, I ramble so this could be an unnecessarily lengthy post and I appreciate everyone who reads it all the way through. 

Several years ago, as a high school graduation gift, I received a pre-paid visa card from an elderly couple at my church. It had 25 dollars on it. I thought it was a regular visa gift card, but it was not. It said I had to register it online and I tried, but could never get it to work. I kept it though just in case. 

Around Christmas, I was going through my wallet and found a bunch of old cards including that one so I tried to see if there was money left on any of them. This visa didn't expire until November of 2019 so I tried registering it again. Lo and behold, it worked. But, being the idiot I am, I didn't think anything of the website asking me for my personal information. I really wanted the money off it and wasn't thinking clearly. After the fact, I realized what I had done. It's a debit card for an online bank called Green Dot. I immediately messaged customer support and explained my situation. They told me that as soon as I had gotten my balance to zero they would close my account. I managed to spend all but 17 cents. I've tried spending it in various ways but nothing works. I asked the cashier at Aldi if I could use only 17 cents off of one card and then pay for the rest with a different card and he let me try. I swiped the card and it declined. I went through the self checkout at Wal-Mart and attempted to pay for all of it except 17 cents. But the machines counted my money inccorectly. I tried to go ahead and use the card to pay for what it said I still owed but that didn't work. I've tried loading money onto the card so that I could put it onto an Amazon gift card because they will let you put any amount on one as long as it is at least 50 cents. But the ATM would not allow me to even load money onto the card. 

The customer service for Green Dot is terrible. The only way to contact them is through mail or messaging them on their website, which gives you a character limit of about 300 so it's really hard to convey the message in detail. They've replied to me but have been very unhelpful. The person who emailed me back used very poor grammar and punctuation which makes me wonder if English was their first language and if they even fully understood my message. There is no way to contact them by phone and speak with an actual person.

578,"I’m a nineteen year old girl. Here’s something I posted when I was in a very dark place back at my dorm, to maybe help you understand how I felt:
https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/av1bw9/does_anyone_else_feel_like_being_dead_because_of/?st=JSP4L3NH&amp;sh=3f054c41

For context, I have many mental illnesses. Asperger’s, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I take pills for these but it’s not like everything is perfect.

So I tried to drop out of college once about a year ago. It was just too much for me. But I ended up being talked out of it. And now it’s happening again. I was contemplating suicide before my parents came and picked me up, knowing I was in that state. I’m at home now.

I LOVE the independence I get living in the dorms, but the school work is killing me. I’m always too depressed to fulfill my duties. I go to class but I can’t seem to pull myself together enough to do a paper outside of class for example. I’m also close to failing in most of my classes, like teetering on the edge because my depression sucks the energy out of me. I don’t know if I should drop out. If I do, maybe I won’t hate my life so much, but at the same time I’ll have to move back in with my parents and I won’t have a future (at least the one I was told I could have growing up... I was a gifted and talented kid and everyone said I could go so far. I feel like I’m failing them.)

But if I stay will I end up killing myself? What will I even do without a degree though? What place is there for me in the workforce? I have no marketable skills. I feel like I’m deciding my entire FUTURE right in this second and it’s really  a lot to deal with.

God, if I can’t even do this, SHOULD I just kill myself? It looks like I’m trapped no matter what choice I make. I don’t know what to do. Should I stay or should I go?

TL;DR: College makes me suicidal but I don’t know what I’ll do without a degree. Don’t know whether to stay or drop out and find a job instead.",28Feb2019,0

582,"I work over night with a company that has a contract for a big chain super market. We usually re-arrange the store by building new shelves, making space for new products, or moving the store around. When we dont have those projects we do store help- throwing load/product. 

Now about 2 weeks ago they scheduled me on the other side of city which is a 40 mile drive away from 10pm-6:30am (store help) for a week. Its about 45 minutes there and an 1hr 30 min- 2hr on the way back because of traffic. 
The minimun requirement for a hotel is 60 miles, Home to the store. So i dont get a hotel room either.
So let me tell you what happened 
I pick up my friend whose 20 minutes from my house to go to work. We get there in 45 and then on the way back to her house it was almost 2 hrs because of traffic. Now my friend calls out bosses and ask for hotel and they say we dont meet the requirements, so i tell her im not driving there anymore because im exhausted when i get out and its not safe for me,her, or anyone on the road if i cant pay attention and im falling asleep. 

So their solution to the problem was ""well you can sleep in you car for about an hour."" I was so flustered by this. And answered ""..what? No (boss) im not going to sleep on my car."" She said "" why not? Ive done it, while i was pregnant too."" I was even more confused by this. So juat because she does/did it, i should too? On top of that, we get out at 6:30 am. Traffic start dying out at 9am. 1 hour sleeping in my car will just cause me to drive for longer. 
My friend doesn't have a license so i wont let her drive. She relise me on me to drive her to and from work. She does give me gas money. Her car a is broken down too and is not insured. She makes enough to pay rent and food on this job but thays it.
Bottom line is, Im not going to sleep in my car for a barely living wage without pay. 

Should i quit?",28Feb2019,1
583,"So I had a coworker whom I saw as a good friend. We would go to lunch together, she would text me outside of work, gossip to me about other people, etc.

Then recently I found out she had been badmouthing me behind my back to other people. She says I am unprofessional because I am always walking around, that I swivel in my chair, that I always come up to her to chat, that I don’t pay attention during meetings,  and that I’ve looked up people’s salaries (we work for a public university so our salaries are posted online on public government sites). 

The thing is we never argued, but according to my manager she had been complaining about me behind my back for quite some time and it had gotten to the point where he wanted to let me know not to be too close to her because “some people are here just to do their work, not to make friends.” Our boss said he knew I did a good job and worked hard, but I wasn’t “playing the game” as far as work image goes and since we were at a very prestigious university I needed to watch how I act even when I’m just sitting at my desk.

Anyway, after my coworker complained about me she’s been “not talking to me.” She walks by me and pretends she doesn’t see me, she invites the rest of the team out for a team lunch but doesn’t invite me. She has a best friend in the office and if she needs anything she will tell the best friend to talk to me rather than talk to me herself. There was even an assignment where she didn’t talk to me even though she needed to, and instead just did her work wrong.

To me it is so childish, she is 36 years old and has a PhD. But our boss just allows it. He says “I can’t make you two talk to each other, you’re adults” and just “she is just one person, don’t let one person’s opinion bother you, just keep up the good work and good ethics.” He even changed our schedules so we don’t have to see each other.

It’s made me unhappy at work, knowing she is badmouthing me to other people. I had never insulted her, to her face or behind her back. IF she had been my friend, then the thing that would have turned things sour was I told her I was working on a dirty romance novel outside of work in my free time, and maybe she thinks I am gross for being capable of writing something dirty in the first place. Either that or she never liked me and saw me as competition because we are both on the “advanced” team at work.

TL;DR: coworker acted like my friend but was badmouthing me behind my back, manager just turns a blind eye.

587,"Long story short, I stopped denying I caught feelings for my friend (let's call her Ashley) when I was 17. Ashley and I got a lot closer after high school (we met at 14) because we go to the same college. We're practically best friends by now except she doesn't know I secretly have feelings for her. Ashley has only had one ex-boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for a really long time, but they broke up 2 years ago. Anyway we're super close, pretty affectionate with each other (cuddling, holding hands, etc. mostly because of me though), often have sleepovers, stay up late at night talking, etc. which is normal for best friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The things that make me sometimes feel like maybe there's a chance she might return some interest is (not limited to):

• she always gets super jealous whenever I pay more attention to this guy (let's call him Alex)  and especially when we playfully flirt

• she constantly accuses me of liking Alex or someone else if not him / is so concerned with my love life

• i often catch her looking at me whenever i look over at her or she catches me looking when i look first

• i've seen her eyes linger down at my lips(?) idk but definitely not my eyes

• she always does full body glances at me

• she created a spotify playlist for me full of old throwback r&amp;b songs (my fav) and i found out through our other best friend that Ashley has never done this for her or any of their other friends (Ashley has a little squad of friends that i'm not in)

• she remembers the tiniest things about me even after only mentioning it once

• i've seen her face turn kind of reddish at times like when we're singing love songs together in the car

• we have stayed on facetime overnight at times

&amp;#x200B;

but at the same time:

• she doesn't initiate with me much; i do most of the initiating including initiating hugs, hangouts, texting, and even facetime

• back in high school we would play flirt with each other sometimes but we hardly do that stuff now

• sometimes she ignores my snapchat stories and takes a couple hours to reply to my texts

• i asked if she has a crush on anyone and she answered no

• she changed her makeup style not too long ago and it looks more similar to mine which makes me feel like she sees me more like a friend?

• there were rumors about me liking her back in high school. i brought this up to her again recently and she sounded hesitant to talk about it or like she didn't want to hear it again

i told my other best friend (who's also Ashley's best friend) about my feelings for Ashley. she keeps encouraging me to tell Ashley how i feel, saying that i'd never know if Ashley might feel the same way. however Ashley has a history of ghosting people who are interested in her if she doesn't reciprocate interest so i'm super hesitant about confessing. not only would i be confessing my feelings, but i'd be coming out to her too and i'm still in the closet right now.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: sometimes i feel like my best friend might return feelings for me but sometimes i feel like she just sees me as just her best friend / sister. our other best friend keeps advising me to confess but she has a history of ghosting people she doesn't reciprocate feelings for plus i'm still in the closet. i need more confidence in how she might feel about me before making a decision. would appreciate some help/advice. does she seem like she might be interested? what should i do?",28Feb2019,1

591,"Right after high school I joined the Marine Corps for five years. I started as a maintenance tech, what I call glorified Jiffy Lube because I did oil changes, tire changes, remove and replace stuff not too complicated. I worked very hard and studied hard to master my job. I quickly moved up and was happy with the leadership roles I was in for the last three years. I chose to have a personal life and got married and had a kid with about a year left in service. I decided not to re-enlist because family was more important and we wanted another kid.

While in, I got an Associate’s degree in Business from a local private university. It’s regionally accredited, but is basically a degree mill. I was young and stupid to waste my time there, but I continued going there through their web-based program because I thought a BBA would help get a job and I would be able to spend time with my now two kids for a year or two. 

Well I was wrong, come to find out that people with degrees from real schools are having trouble finding decent jobs, so how the hell am I supposed to stand out. I’ve sent about 100 applications in the last 8 months and have had 1 interview which I blew because I was beyond nervous, it was a good learning experience though. 

Financially, I don’t need a job thanks to my husband, but I want to be successful. I’m thankful that I get to see my kids, but being a stay-at-home mom is not for me. 

I recently began searching for jobs that are $15/hr, but would also give me room to grow and so far nothing. I can’t realistically go lower because I would be losing money due to childcare. 

This is where I’m looking for advice: I have about half of my GI Bill left and am looking into local colleges and universities. I’m very embarrassed about reaching out. After researching a little bit it appears that only about a third of my credits will transfer, which is fine, but do I even have a chance to do this? I’m afraid they’ll just scoff at me and laugh because I was fooled by the degree mill. Is this a realistic option? And if it is a would business be my only option, I don’t hate it, but I would much rather study in an engineering or science field if I had to essentially start over. 

I’m located near the California Bay Area if that matters. ",28Feb2019,2
592,"I’m a transgender man, pre hormones and pre surgery, I’m able to pass generally if someone doesn’t  take too much mind of me. But I’m not really sure that’s enough to brave the men’s locker room.

A little background on the locker rooms, they’re in my uni’s gym and they generally are gender inclusive, I say this from experience but I don’t know what their protocol for locker room/bathroom instances. Now I’ve already used this gym, I’ve started going swimming a few times there, even while transitioning. When I did I always chickened out and used the women’s locker room. These were terribly uncomfortable, I felt I didn’t belong, my hair is cut short and I wore board shorts and a rash guard so I didn’t look feminine enough to be there. No one caused a scene but I do remember this one instance.

It was after I had done several laps in the pool and was showered up and leaving, I can confirm that’s both lockers have individual stalls, and was dressed and ready to leave I was just gathering my things before leaving. While putting on my shoes this one woman, most likely another student, just appeared out of nowhere and stood next to my locker. She didn’t say anything or acknowledge me really, but she really didn’t have much reason to be there. Now where I was situated it was well away from anyone else and closer to the locker room’s exit (I promise you the last thing I want to do is cause any sort of scene I just want to swim and shower and get dressed with no issues) so she really didn’t have much reason to be this close to. She didn’t talk to anyone, appear to be doing anything but just standing there. I couldn’t really bring myself to look up at her, as I said I don’t want to cause a scene and I was afraid she would start something if I acknowledged her. 

I may be overreacting over this but I really hated it. It made feel like I was doing something wrong, I promise you I just want to go swimming, she didn’t say anything and  I left but what if she did? What am I supposed to do in this situation? It fairly clear not everybody is as accepting of trans people in locker rooms and bathrooms, apparently even if they are in the ones appropriate to their sex.

So I just wanted advice, not just from trans people but anyone. What locker room do I use? I want to use the men’s locker room but I don’t think I look masculine looking enough to use them. But I’m too masculine to comfortably use the women’s locker room. So any advice would be helpful

TL;DR: I’m an ftm trans lad who’s too masculine for women’s locker room and too feminine for men’s and need advice on which to use.

594," For some context I have an extremely rocky relationship with my stepmom, she's very judgmental and controlling of what I do, such as while my dad granted me getting a job, she won't let me get one until I graduate high school ( I am 18.). Recently my dad discussed with me we would look for cars for me to get, and he'd pay for it, since I have no money, and he wants me to have some in dependency. I am EXTREMELY grateful for him, and try so had to find a car that fits my needs and what he wants in my first car, since he wants it to be reliable. Usually he gives me useful feedback, like whether it's old, or has iffy mileage on it. My stepmom, who is unemployed and uses my dad's money for herself is trying to say she's helping too, what she does is restrict me to specific brands, and even the color and style of the car. To her I'm not allowed a truck, or SUV, only a sedan because it's what SHE likes. There have been multiple times where she looks for cars and doesn't show me but possibly  shows my dad, because she likes it and it's cheap. She'll also tell me something is too expensive, even though it is UNDER my budget. This is extremely frustrating and when I find something I like she tries guilting me about it either with the gas mileage, or because it's not the brand or a sedan. It may be that she wants something best for me but she gives me no real useful information. And not only this but I have a feeling the second I get my car, she's going to try and use it as her daily car, she gave away her old car for free, and took my dad's car ( a 2001 ford focus) , which she took terrible car of and it is now molded (We have told her countless times it's an easy clean and fix.) and my dad ended up having to get a used car ( A really nice 2013 Nissan Leaf, he loves the thing.) After awhile, she took that car from him claiming the other car is just unreliable and she needs to use the Leaf, so after my dad spent so long saving money he got a truck, that she hates and refuses to use, she also uses the excuse we have no car that can get her anywhere that's an hour away, when we really do because the Ford still works perfectly fine but she only ever mentions this when me getting a car is brought up. I just feel like she's shopping for a car for her, and not for me. She's very narcissistic and this has been bugging me for a while.

Basically, I feel like I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. I feel like I’ve spent the last 6 floating around around America and Mexico doing nothing but surviving like a stray cat.

I hate my job (I’m a mechanic). I hate leaving work covered in grease and oil; I hate when we’re busy and I leave work sore and tired.

I’ve been to almost every part of this country (the US, if that matters), and you know what? None of it appeals to me. I’m in California right now, and although I like it, it’s too expensive to be a long term place. I make $50K/yr, and that’s not buying a house here; on the other hand, I have no interest in buying a house in Kansas or Pennsylvania. Otherwise I’d be there and not here. 

I have no family, and I’ve moved around too much the past few years to ever make real friendships. I’m never going to marry or have kids.

Honestly, I’m about ready to quit my job and just live under a bridge. I have no debts to repay, and at this point I don’t have anything to lose either by not having any money. And what’s the point? Every penny I have is going... no where the moment I die. It’s just goes wherever money and property goes when people don’t have heirs.

I’d go back to school, except that, frankly, I’m not interested in paying for it. I doubt I’d even get in (I graduated high school with like a 1.8 GPA) and I don’t have the patience.

There’s a couple of monasteries I’m gravitating toward, but that’s a pretty big step to take, and I’d like to at least look at other possibilities before that (though truthfully I’m not sure there are any).

600,"Hi, I’m a first time poster in this subreddit so if Im in the wrong place I apologise and will direct the post to the correct place. 

Let me start off by explaining the situation. I live in a house with my girlfriend and a roommate in the 2nd bedroom, we are all students. On the same property there is a separate flat which another guy lives in (he’s the one I’m seeking advice about). 

Let me describe him and his behaviour. This guy is in his late 40s. He’s a friendly guy and easy to talk to. He’s incredibly thin - more in an unhealthy, doesn’t actually eat anything sort of way. He’s unemployed and his mom is paying for his rent and everything else for him. 

I’ve noticed whenever I have a conversation with him (maybe once every 2 weeks) we always talk about the same stuff as if he has no recollection of our previous conversations. This was the first thing I’ve noticed about him. 

Recently there was absolutely no movement from his flat for about a week and me and my housemates think he slept for the entire week straight! His doors never closed at night (extremely dangerous in South Africa to not lock your place at night) and pretty much remained open for the entire week. When I say no movement in his flat I mean no movement - dirty dishes stayed in the same spot, no extra dishes, nothing. His mom couldn’t get a hold of him during this week and got a hold of our landlord who then asked me if everything was okay with him. I went into his flat to wake him and my verbal attempts of waking him up didn’t work. I had to go and physically shake him to wake him up and when he did wake up he got a huge fright. 

Another time that was a big flag was that he kept setting the alarm for our premises off at like 3am because “he kept seeing people having sex on the balcony of our neighbours house”. At the time we were house sitting for the neighbours so we know for a fact that nobody was home and there alarm was armed so had anyone been out on their balcony the alarm would have gone off. On top of that there is nobody to be seen in the camera footage from the cameras on the premises. 

He keeps disappearing for days on end and coming back as if everything is normal. He’s gone through about 4 phones this year and we know for a fact that this last phone was sold. He’s also sold everything in his flat the only thing left in there is his bed. 

The other day we noticed a letter in his flat (we weren’t inside his flat we could just see the letter from outside while we were talking to him) that said something along the lines of “don’t enter unless you’re a paramedic “. Very disturbing imho. 

Tonight he was arrested for eating at a restaurant and just walking out without paying. We were all alarmed because he just let 4 men into our premises (after calling the police and private security company we were able to verify it was a car belonging to a detective) but in South Africa you don’t just let people into your house because that’s how a lot of people get robbed. All of us were very shaken by this because these 4 unknown men now had keys to open all our gates and had access to our alarm as well so had they not been cops they could stroll in and take whatever they please and nobody would know. 




Here’s the advice part. As you can see from my description of him he’s showing some signs of addiction/drug abuse. Does anyone know what drugs he may be using or if there is a combination of drugs he could be using or if maybe he’s just mentally sick? Both us and the landlord want him out but if we know what he’s using we might be able to help him or help his family get him the help he needs.

Her husband has been ignoring her sexually for about three months now and every time she and I get together we end up teasing each other and leaving each other needing to masturbate, on our own at our own places, to try to calm stuff as much as we can.

We talk about our dreams and fantasies we have about each other. I rub her back because I know she need it. She carries her stress in her lower back and shoulders. Well, today we got a lil more handsy than normal and she and I tried to just leave it at a tease, but it progressed just a bit farther and I got her off. Then, she was visibly upset and had to leave all of a sudden. 

While I want her back with all of my heart and soul.......I know it will never happen. I am completely in love with her and I just need advice on how to keep it platonic, but at the same time not let the sexual desire we have for each other die. ",28Feb2019,1
603,"so i've been having suicidal thoughts recently. i don't really know why or what to do about it. i've told a friend and she's suggested counselling however that would require my parents knowledge and i don't feel comfortable telling my parents anything like this, which doesn't seem very healthy i guess? i don't know, i've just not been feeling great recently.

i have also been self-harming a bit more recently, but i have been trying to stop and have been trying to talk to friends about problems rather than taking it out on myself.

feel free to ask any questions (they'd probably help honestly) and advice would be really appreciated, i just don't know what to do about any of this i guess?",28Feb2019,1

So I used to hang around with this guy ef he was ok but he was crazy about ma bf that’s the 1st reason I dint like him 2nd reason he was gross like I mean crazy gross he’d talk about crusty private parts,rape,insest etc I found out bc he followed us it made other people not like hanging oot with us cause they’d have to hang around with him too 3rd reason he was crazy annoying like unreal annoying he was annoying to everyone like they all hated him 

We put all this aside bc he dint have any friends but then he hit a girl then (I don’t encourage this) we beat him up in his rage he hit a hole crowd of girls I talked with them and they all say it hurt so we tracked him down and bet him up last time it was a 2v1 but he told more people and it was now a 5v1 he cried and we stopped we all said we wanted nothing to do with him 

He then follows me and bf every where we tell him to get many times and make some new friends he always says I have friends they just play football he’s chubby btw we hit him swore at him and every time we ignore him he just hits us we hate him so wit do we do? He’s just sad and a bit crazy but the horrible part is bfs mum has tuberculosis she’s from another country and he likes taking to me about it he says it helps but he can’t cause ef mocks him about it

608,"This is my first post on reddit, I’m pretty new here and on mobile so please be gentle. 

So for context, I’ve just gotten hired (2 weeks ago) to a car dealership in the finance department. Two other people around my age (early 20s with no relevant work experience) have been hired around the same time, and we all have an assigned senior in the department to work and train under. My senior (let’s call him R) is the newest to this dealership, but the oldest guy there. My car has recently broke down, so I started my job by walking to work. This alarmed my coworkers as I’m a (I guess fairly attractive) young woman walking alone in an iffy area. Cue the dilemma. 

After hearing that I’m making a 20 minute walk often in the dark wearing dark clothes, R offered to give me rides to and from work which I accepted. This went on just fine until last night. 

Last night we had a hell spawn of a customer who kept us at the dealership until an hour after we close, at 9pm. R gave me a ride home as we were the last two people there, and it was late. This is normal, no red flags. After I’m in his car and he’s driving towards my house, we start bitching about the customer together and he suggests we stop and get some drinks. In the conversation, he mentioned how I have a great body and that’s all guys are concerned about (to which I reminded him... the concept of lesbianism). I laughed this off, he’s an older man, from a different time, whatever. Then he starts talking about how if we went out to drink, he’d get me so drunk he’d “end up carrying me to my bed.” Red flags, sirens, warning signs are all flashing in my head. I kind of laugh it off again, tell him my girlfriend is bigger and stronger than me (which she is, I’m barely 5’4” so it’s not that hard lol) and she could take care of it. 

Today, we were moving up furniture to our recently renovated upstairs office. I was somehow managing to get a file cabinet roughly my size and weight up the stairs when he offers to help me. I tell him I got it, he’s an old fella missing a finger so it’ll go just as fast if I do it myself and he laughs and says “well, good job!” and walks away. As he walks away he gives me a light tap on my ass. Again, I don’t react to this. 

I confided all of this in my coworker (the only other young woman in my department) and she’s immediately offered to give me rides to and from work, which I’m super grateful for, but she starts her job an hour after I normally do and I have to tell my boss (one of the three seniors in my department.) How do I go about this without putting myself in deep shit? This is the best job I’ve ever been fortunate enough to have and I don’t know what to do. I can’t avoid him at work, and I don’t want to get him fired. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I feel like I was dealt a bad hand and there's just nothing that can be done about it, other than to just accept a sub-optimal life and wait for death. It's all over. It never began. The only reason I'm not dead now is because I'm religious and I know I'll go to hell if I did kill myself. So I don't want people to talk me out of dying, that's not the point of this post.

612,"Ok long story, 
( I’m Dutch so I’m sorry if I make any mistakes.) 

I’m a 15 year old girl and I like my boy-best friend.
Let’s call him idk ehm John. 
He’s my best friend for 3 years and I think I like him for 2 years. (Idk exactly,because around that time people fucked with my feelings a lot) 

It’s really complicated, because in my friend group it’s a really big thing if you like someone for some reason. ( I know it’s a bit childish, but our group is toxic as hell, story for another time;) So he liked my at the time bff, and I didn’t really know how to feel about this him. I supported John, because he got Friend-zoned by her. (He cried in his bed for two days no joke) I talked with him about his feelings and that is when we became really close.

That was around 1 year ago and I game and FaceTime with him everyday now, first it was nice (Attention I guess?)but now I don’t know what to talk about anymore and I feel that I’m doing something wrong.  Lately he is a bit toxic and a bit grumpy/ less enthusiastic ( he doesn’t calls me or join my party) and I’m scared that I’m become less close to him.  I’m trying to figure out what’s going on, but John doesn’t say what’s wrong. 

I want to build some distance between John and me, but it’s hard you know! I want to be his best friend but also something more and I don’t want to ruin the friendship (basic shit what I say:) 

I don’t want to be rejected and that everybody in my toxic friend-group knows about it. (A lot people know already, because I talk with some friends about it a lot, but not 22 people needs to know that I like him) 

WHAT CAN I DO! 
I would like to here your advice!

I (18F) have been dating my boyfriend for 8 months now and all of a sudden his ex girlfriend, who lives in another state, texted him this morning and told him that she got pregnant with his child and had an abortion (about a year ago probably?). She also said she told his best friend, but not him. He’s obviously extremely upset right now, and I’m doing the best I can to support him, but I can’t help that I’m a little suspicious. This girl has made it clear that she wants him back for a while now and reaches out to him whenever she’s going through something. I just don’t understand why she would bring this up now? He no longer lives in her state AND he’s obviously in another relationship so why did she feel the need to mention this almost 10 months after they broke up? I feel like he should ask her for proof, but I don’t want to bug him about that while he’s mourning what could’ve been his child. Normally he doesn’t really respond to her messages unless she texts him about her issues, so if she was using this story to try and get his attention again, it’s definitely working. I don’t want to seem like a bitch, but I’m worried about what her intentions are. The entire story just doesn’t add up to me. I don’t know how to bring this point of view up to him without looking like a total asshole.

623,"Hey lads and ladies,

&amp;#x200B;

Recent college grad here. I did not really enjoy school, ended up with a 3.3 GPA I think. I am now working as an intern where I have been for the past year. Over the last couple months there has been very little for me to do (interning and graduated in IT). I have many days where I literally just sit and watch YouTube or Netflix. I am going a little crazy and I wish they had something for me to do, but every time I ask my boss he says there is just nothing right now. 

I know I should be spending this free time learning new software or skills, but every time I sit down and try to figure how to work a Palo Alto firewall or learn the ins and outs of graphics cards, I just can't stay focused on it and get board and go back to whatever show I was watching. 

Possible reasons for this: 

I am just a lazy fuck - very real possibility

I have ADD - also possible

I just don't have the mental fortitude to make myself learn - possible

School left a bad taste in my mouth and I need to take some time before I try learning things again - possible I guess

Maybe I am more of a hands-on learner, so reading manuals online is not a good method - true to a degree

&amp;#x200B;

It may be telling that I am also overweight. Not morbidly so, but its there. I have tried getting fit many times but I just haven't been able to stick with it. So it could be just that I lack stick-to-it-iveness. 

I am trying not to get down on myself about it, but its hard when I get home and realized that for the last 8 hours I literally just sat and browsed reddit, watched shows and generally did fuck all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I realize this this situation sounds nice to those who have a shit tonne to do at work and wished it was slower. I am not trying to make it sound like this is the worst. I get paid to sit and do nothing. Not a huge paycheck, but its something. So those of you saying ""Fuck you you fat fucking fuck, don't complain about getting paid to do nothing"", I agree, fuck me.

If it helps I am quite young in my early twenties and the other person who just started and got a other position immediately is a decade older than me. If someone could please give me some of there wisdom I’d appreciate it I’d don’t know if this is just me being impatient or if I’m on to something here. ",28Feb2019,1
634,"Does anyone have any experiences with CBD and how/if it affected you/how you used it?

I have anxiety and depre$h and its been getting worse bc its winter, cold, and gloomy. I’m also a college student and my anxiety gets a lot worse before exams and when I have a lot on my plate. ALSO i have TMJ and it hurts like a bitch so I was wondering if anyone has felt the effect of CBD physically as well as mentally.

I have my medical marijuana card and I smoke weed and it helps, but makes my anxiety worse in public and I don’t wanna be high all day so I was thinking about CBD.

636,"This is dumb but for a while I have been depressed and anxious, and my dog is very empathetic, tries to comfort, then, as a result of a tense house along with my depression my brother moved out, for various reasons, and my mum has also been depressed because of the whole situation/being 50 and divorced twice and just struggling in life, we don't get along very well me and my mum, I try and talk but she rarely listens and spits stuff back on my face, I love her but find it hard to talk to her without being judged, and at the moment my anxiety has just made it hard to talk to anyone.

638,"(Posted this elsewhere, but, figured here would be good too?)

Hey guys,

I am actually debating writing this question, because I honestly think its a very stupid question. But it is something in general i would like to improve, so, i figured i would take the shot that someone might have some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things I would like to change about my life, and like most people (I think) I set goals, maybe do good for a little bit, and then fall off.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I have a good life I think, but that does not mean there are not things I want to change and make better.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance i want to lose weight, not just for looks but also for my health. But I still end up eating a candy bar most days at work because I am bored and its something sweet to reward myself with. Or I will make up some other excuse. I don't have the willpower to just.....not do it I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

Or sticking with weight loss, going to the gym. I will do it a few times. But then as it starts to get harder, and my body starts to get sore, i will stop, i also find it extremely discouraging to see the numbers. (like, a half hour of waking is 90 calories, almost anything i eat will put that right back) and I know I can't just skip to heavy work outs, I need to build up first, but, i never get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Or things like wanting to brush my dogs every day so my house is not always COVERED in hair.

Or, just simple things like that I guess.

I WANT to do these things, better myself, and the place I live, I just......start, and then I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if its the lack of discipline or willpower to do something that is not ""fun"" or '""easy"", or if maybe it is something else. But does anyone understand what I mean, and have any ways to help?

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I know it all needs to come from me, but, how do i start, and stick to it. (whatever it ends up being)",28Feb2019,2

640,"I am going to try to keep this as short and uncomplicated as I possibly can. To begin with, I am 18 years old, have not had a real job, and am living with my girlfriend and her family. A short period into my relationship, my girlfriend and her family (mother, grandmother, and a female cousin) moved to California. During our relationship and in the long friendship leading up to it, my girlfriend and I have gotten to know one another very well and the relationship seemed healthy. As a result, I decided to find a way to move to California. In a decision that I now somewhat regret, I decided to get my GED rather than finishing my senior year of high school. I partially made the decision because I had some bad people that I was associating with during my high school years and wanted to distance myself from that, and also because I wanted to be done with high school and move on to college sooner. But I also made the decision in order to spend more time with my girlfriend, prior to any knowledge of her leaving, which was a poor reason in my decision making process. Rather than beginning at a community college, I moved to Bakersfield, California from Phoenix, Arizona. 

I made the move with around $4,000 that I had saved up from my lifetime. A few months in paying for rent and gas money, I've spent almost $1,000 and have yet to find any jobs in Bakersfield. As someone who wants to pursue a degree in Finance and become a financial advisor, as well as get started investing into the stock market, I feel as though I'm wasting my money living here and I may as well flush it down a toilet. 

Getting into the overall picture, my girlfriend's family wants to move back in about a year, because they're stuck in the lease until then. They also need my rent money, or they won't have enough to make the rent every month. This is a big reason as to why I haven't left, I don't want to leave someone in that situation. However, I can't start community college living in California unless I want to pay the exponentially higher out-of-state tuition as I have only lived here for a few months. I hate the fact that I am basically putting off college only to find a mediocre job and be wasting $300 a month. My family in Phoenix would have no problem with me continuing to live in their house, as long as I am attending college and making something of myself. So I could be saving an extra $300 every month as well, which is a lot, especially when I have no income as of right now. My girlfriend and her family are understanding about how I feel, but are also making me feel like I am stuck here. I knew I would have to pay my fair share in being here, but I don't find it fair to be upset with me when they are the ones who are relying on an 18 year old. 

At this point in time, I do want to go back to Arizona. I am very much in love with my girlfriend and would hate to leave her behind, but I feel that staying here is a horrible decision for my future. I know our relationship would likely remain intact, especially since they plan on moving back at the end of the year. I know that purely from a realistic, goal oriented viewpoint, that I should go back, but I don't know if it would be the worst thing to stay here until the end of the year. I just want to see what the opinions are from some outside perspective. Feel free to comment with any negativity and display any immaturity and insecurities, but I will greatly appreciate the few people out there who may take their time to reply with valid advice. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time. ",28Feb2019,1

648,"Okay. In case the title was a bit confusing, I need help to figure out my life. Let me give you some backstory first.

I made this account right now, just to ask this question.

TLDR below, **but** I still ask you to read the whole story for full understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

**-------------------------- INFO---------------------------------**

For people in IB(me) or AP, here are my courses and scores 

&amp;#x200B;

Geography HL / AP

Computer science HL / AP

Chemistry HL / AP

Math SL ( a bit harder than a normal highschool degree)

German SL ( a bit harder than a normal highschool degree)

English L&amp;L SL ( a bit harder than a normal highschool degree)

&amp;#x200B;

IGCSE (only did two in the end)

German - B

English - A

&amp;#x200B;

PSAT: 1200(no studying at all + I didn't really try, as it is just a PSAT)

&amp;#x200B;

I have German and American nationalities(If you want to say something with colleges and prices)

&amp;#x200B;

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a German household, so excuse some gramatical errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a **VERY** smart household. My father is an orthodontist, and very good at what he does. He has a very good reputation in his profession, and on top of that, he has a few more masters just for show (Math, etc.). His entire family tree is made up of Doctors, university professors and engineers. So like I said, he is super smart and logical. Because of this, he has a huge ego(important later).

&amp;#x200B;

I go to a private school, with again, smart people. People that aim for the Ivy league colleges.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like I really ""fit into"" this life. I am not that smart. I enjoy art, music and writing. I don't care about money. I would rather like to live by ""liking your job and never working a day in your life"". My dream is working as a Character designer, game dev. or programmer for a gaming company. My biggest dream is to develop and manage my own game. Everybody else has such high goals, like becomming a world renown doctor, or someone rich. I understand why people want that, but I don't enjoy being with people like that. It feels like they look down on you, like some filth off the street. I have friends that I have similar interests with, don't worry.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I said I go to a private school, it is not a good one. Since the Director of 15 years died last year, the school went down hill. Teachers leave for months, and we have no substitutes. For anybody in the IB program (currently IB1), you can probably understand why this isn't so nice. Also during my IGCSE's, my math teacher left for 4 months before the IGCSE exams, making our entire class self-study for a course that covers about 300 pages of math alone. Our school just tells us that we have to study our selves anyways, and for the price we pay (€18k) a year, this is honestly the most shitty thing you can do to a stressed out student, who is told that their entire life depends on this degree, force us to come to school early, participate in the classes where we do nothing, and then make us catch up on our own in the time we should be able to relax.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad thinks that you can't achieve literally anything without school. I agree to a degree, but not as extreme as he does. He thinks of me as the black sheep of the family. Like the small boy who can't think for himself. I tell him that I would be way happier, if I could just drop out of school and pursue my dreams, and complete online degrees in coding, and complete my portfolio. He thinks that someone can literally not live with a normal job, because they don't pay enough.

I tell him that I don't care about buying meterialistic things, and just want to do what I like. He basically forces me to pursue some STEM subjects, and I hate those. The only science I like is Computer science, and he is ok with that, however he basically makes me do a second HL science. I absolutely hate Chemistry. I understand it, but I would likely only get a 3 or 4 in the IB exam, so it just damages my score. He thinks artist are still the same ""starving"" people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes he is a Baby boomer.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, I have developed depression, insecurities and serious trust issues, because my dad doesn't acknowledge me at all. I have suicidal thoughts more and more often(multiple times a day at this point). I act more and more like I don't know my parents, and honestly I begin to dislike my dad more and more, with every word he says to me. The way things are going right now, I will probably cut ties completely with my dad as soon as I turn 18, and I don't really think my mind needs to be changed, because he isn't such a great person, even if he would support me.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I mentioned before, I want to be a character designer, programmer or game dev. I don't really want to attend college, unless I absolutely have to, because I started to hate classrooms. Not some edgy hate, I genuinely get sick sometimes when I think about school, classes and all the stress related. Another reason is that I don't want to pay like $160k for a degree. Is it possible to get into my dream positions without going to college? Can I get companies to see me as a good and hardworking employee? Will I be able to even get a legitimate degree online?

&amp;#x200B;

Please still read the TLDR 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I don't want to go to college, but still be seen as a viable employee. I work hard, and like to offer all my time to what I enjoy, but would still go to college, if I **absolutely** have to. Can I work as a programmer, character designer or game developer without a degree, and if yes then how? Is it worth to go to uni, and what can I do in the gaming field(work) without a degree? Will a portfolio be enough to get hired by a company as an artist? ",28Feb2019,1

662,"Throwaway. As my title said I am working this middle management job that I absolutely hate. I work bare minimum 50+ hours a week, the atmosphere is just terrible. I have always been a lift yourself up by the bootstraps kind of girl. I always thought that I would make something out of myself. I moved out kind of young and worked my way up through jobs, always working at least one most of the time two at a time. I had set goals for myself that I was going to get a house by the time I was 28, I ended up buying one when I was almost 26. 

I don’t want to get into it, I did not have anything when I moved out with no parental support so I was working a ton instead of going to school. I always thought money would make me happy, that once I got a decent paying job and could comfortably pay my bills I would finally settle down. Nope, I am so unhappy. I don’t make a ton, I made $54k last year but it makes it hard enough to find something to compare. 

I always wanted to go to school, but the amount of people I know with crippling student loan debt terrifies me. I pay most of the bills myself as my SO is in the student loan debt as well. He went and got a bachelors degree, and he couldn’t find anything in his field so we make the same amount of money. Neither one of us have any children.

I am not sure how to fix this, I can’t take a long term pay cut. I don’t know if I should take a temporary one and go back to college and use my loans to help pay for things. I know that’s not a great idea, but the amount of hours I work would make it very hard to go to school. I feel so trapped, I have accumulated bills to my income and I don’t know how to make something better of myself. 

I’m sorry for the rambling whiny post, and thank you for all of you that took the time to read it. I really just feel lost, and I have never been at a point where I didn’t feel like I would be able to fix it. All I ever wanted was a career that didn’t suffocate me, a happy marriage with children and a little house in the suburbs. I just wanted to live comfortably, to be solid middle class. I am starting to be afraid that I won’t be able to get it. He works the same amount of hours that I do, and I don’t want to have children with both of us working this much. 

TLDR: Stuck in a job I hate, I don’t know if should go back to school to make more money.

663,"I’m on mobile, bear with me please! 

First, some background. 

My mother, my father (who currently serves in the navy, my sister (14), and I (16, disabled &amp;ill) are living in naval housing in Virginia. The housing office is garbage to begin with and we’ve had a plethora of other issues that go without being addressed (such as the time our ceiling literally almost caved in) so we’ve come to accept that we won’t really get anywhere with them. 

Our houses are like townhouses, we are on the end, then the shit neighbors, then another family on the end. 

Our neighbors have always been nasty, their house is gross, according to my sister who’s walked inside our own house while their front door was left open. Their garage door is constantly open and based on the state of it I entirely believe what my sister has said. 

They began to throw bags of actual cat shit over our fence, along with cigarette butts and more recently rubber gloves, among other things. We’ve caught them doing this. Other trash ends up coming from underneath the fence. We have two dogs and cannot let them outside, let alone unattended for any amount of time, without checking constantly because we wouldn’t be surprised if they were throwing poison at this rate. 

Recently they got a dog, maybe around December? It’s a beagle. Which is fine, but they’re leaving it outside for HOURS at a time while it barks and howls as if it’s being murdered, desperate to come inside. They totally ignore this. It happens several times a day. 

It has woken me up every day at 5:20 AM for the past month, and kept me up late because it’s left out there at night too. As a chronically ill teen, I need all the sleep I can get. Again, it’s out there for HOURS. Not only that, but the temperature is reaching the low teens. It’s a fucking BEAGLE! We have a Siberian husky and would never leave him out there like that, despite him being BUILT for that weather. 

We called the housing office once after the first few weeks of this. They left a note on the door, to which the wife responded by posting on the housing Facebook group, “Did anyone else get a responsible pet ownership flyer on their door?” Of course when other responsible tenants responded no, the neighbor on the end of our unit goes “I haven’t heard any noise at all”. Clearly, they’re friends or something, because even Helen Keller would be able to hear this poor shithead of a dog and these people shouting at it. 

Nothing has changed and we are all loosing our minds. Housing will not be any more help. We looked into calling animal control but aren’t sure on that. The husband is a major douchebag- my dad has had a chat with him before the first time they began throwing things, and by calling them out in any way, we are putting our pets and ourselves probably at risk. 

As we’re in the navy, we’ve not been in Virginia for long and aren’t sure on laws or what exactly we can do about this. They’re clearly trashy people but their asinine behavior is causing harm to us and putting our pets at risk. 

Anyone got any new ideas? I might go over there and hit these two with my cane if this doesn’t stop.    ",28Feb2019,1

My mom (40) has been a housewife for six years (because of my 5 year old brother). She is looking for work, but there isn't any. I am afraid she might be depressed - what can I do to help her? 

To put some context: My father is going to be fired before the summer. He is the only one who has a job. If he doesn't find anything in that time, we will go back to our country (we are basically immigrants). 

I am 17 and have never been in this kind of situation before, so I am pretty scared. 

As I said, it is getting worse: my parents won't stop arguing; we yell at each other more often. I go back from school and just... can't. I believe my sister (13) feels the same. 

What should I do? ",28Feb2019,1
665,"Hello, 

  I'm American and my girlfriend in a Chinese native working in the U.S. on a work visa provided by her current company.  Over the last several months, her company has been losing more and more employees,but instead of hiring more to replace them, they have just been dumping all the extra work on her and the other few people left. It has gotten to the point where she gets home from an 8 hour work day and then has so much backed up that she has continued to work at home all the way past midnight.  I feel like her company is abusing the leverage they hold over her by sponsoring her work visa. Finding another company that would sponsor her visa is becoming a very difficult and time consuming task.  While we are doing everything we can to find a new job for her, in the meantime she is exhausted and in my opinion, being treated like a work horse.  I want to help her so much but I'm not sure what else I can do.  Any advice would be much appreciated.   ",28Feb2019,1
666,"Im only 14, and an image of my face was leaked in one of my discord servers because one of my friends were angry at me and wanted to get revenge. i just found out that one of the people on that discord that hates me used my image in several videos of his small youtube channel. I asked him kindly multiple times to take the videos down but he refuses to. what should i do 1: i can pay him 10$ and have a chance of getting scammed, but also a chance of him taking all of the videos down with my face in it

2: i can have youtube take down the videos for violating my privacy, but then theres a chance he might re-upload them on a new channel, or make new ones as revenge",28Feb2019,1
667,"I’ll make this short. I seem to have problems making friends. I was bullied a lot throughout elementary and middle school and I never seemed to make friends with anyone who genuinely cared about me and being nice in these situations really had its downsides.

I was never the arguing type, and I always tried my best to get out if problems or things that disturbed me pretty easily. I used to be friends with a girl I thought I could trust, but she would gaslight, verbally abuse me, and threaten to kill herself if I didn’t talk to her immediately. This created trust issues and I eventually became so depressed that I refused to eat or go anywhere. I was eventually diagnosed with anxiety, which to this day, I’ve improved on dealing with it.

I do have a boyfriend who understands me, but I don’t want to always go to him. Even if he does care about my feelings, I don’t want to overload him. I never understood why after conversing with someone once, no matter how great the conversation goes, they never seem to initiate contact again, even when I go to them and try to initiate, it still has no results.

I’m tired of this lonely feeling I constantly have and I hate being misunderstood. Almost every “friend” I’ve had was either a bully or a manipulative person.

People have even trashed talked me, saying I’m too reserved and I’ll never make friends like that. It takes a lot of time for me to open up because of my past experiences, so I’m sorry for being too reserved.

I’m emotionally exhausted at this point and I want to feel like I’m advancing towards something. Maybe people don’t really see me showing my personality or maybe people think I’m intimidating (I’ve gotten this a lot too). Please, I just want some insight on how to improve my social skills.",28Feb2019,1

669,"So my older brother has this one friend that is really annoying and I mean really annoying. When you are doing something he would just run in and take something from you and run away, pull out his phone and start recording you for no reason and when you try to say something about is he would just say, ""Dang, why are you so butthurt?"" Whats worse is that this kid is a senior in high school and still acts like a child. His parent invited my parents to stay at their vacation home for a week and they're bringing me along. I know that he vapes and his parents would probably get mad at him and hopefully cancel the thing so should I snitch and make a good prorevenge story or not be a snitch and have to go to their vacation home.",28Feb2019,0
670,"So a few months ago my mom had made the decision to divorce my stepdad. He didnt take it too well and has been a total dick these past few month (more than usual). For a while now we've suspected that he might be listening to our conversations somehow- there has been a lot of weird coincidences.

We ended up brushing it off as us being paranoid, that is until we found out he ordered a camera that can capture live audio and video. We ended up finding it up on a shelf -inside of a box with a hole cut out of it-pointed at the spot that my mom sits and hangs out with her friends when they're over and talks on the phone...ofcourse we confront him and he trie to throw it back on us saying that we're crazy for thinking it's weird. He even took it out of the box and has it sitting out in the open now to prove his point (???) . Basically acting as if he didnt just have it hidden in a box.
 Ever since the beginning he has always had this thing with cameras. (such as setting them around the house when we were out of town whike my aunt would come there to keep an eye on the animals, my mom had to tell him how creepy it was and made him turn them off.) 
After this discovery, our suspicions dont seem so crazy anymore and now we think there are probably more. Maybe not cameras but recording devices? 
Is there any way to look for them? Maybe some kind of bug detector?

671,"If you had asked me 1 year ago what kind of goals or activities would make me satisfied with life, I would have told you being married and taking care of kids. I guess I have strong paternal urges. But being that many of my relationships have gone to shit(some my fault), it's come to my attention that my happiness is highly dependent on events that I cannot control.  So... I'm sort of lost. 

I'm 24, exiting college with an electrical engineering degree in 1.5 years. I love my major, but I think it lacks that sort of guidance or passion like my original goals. 
 
I'd love to hear from some of you redditors what you have to say.

672,"TL;DR at the bottom...

I've been living with a girl for about 5 months now. She is very nice and cooperative. We created a system on how to clean the flat: I'm in charge of the general cleaning of the kitchen and hallway while she is on the living room (our living room is spacious). If she cooks, I clean (which is always the setup bc she likes to cook and she doesn't like much my food) and If I cook she cleans. If both of us cooked, we're gonna do our own cleaning. It's a good arrangement. 

I don't usually wash the dishes and kitchen at night because I'm tired from work (I arrive at 9-10 PM) and she is a messy cook. I'm okay with it because she has a handicap (she doesn't have one complete hand). So, I usually clean the kitchen during the morning and I include her stuff she used for breakfast.

 But I really dislike that she takes advantage of my habit to clean stuff when she's going away for the weekend and holidays. She dumps her stack of plates in the sink, the counter and stove are very dirty after she cooked, and the living room is a mess. And she's always in a rush to start her holiday while I'm alone to fix and clean the mess in our shared space. I don't want to see pests in the flat.

During the Christmas holiday, she rushed again to her vacation and I spent 2 days very exhausted, trying to pack my stuff and cleaning her mess in the kitchen and living room. I also removed her laundry because she forgot to remove hers and I need to use it. I didn't finish it all because I was so tired and I want her to do her part. She arrived first to our flat and our very clean-freak landlady was pissed at us for not cleaning. I have a language barrier with the landlady so I spoke broken Spanish apologizing to her and my flatmate was trying so hard to be not so pissed at the landlady. After the landlady left, she ranted to me. According to her, the landlady should not rent the flat if she's afraid that it'll be dirty.  I tried to calm her down and told her that we should just clean more to avoid the landlady's wrath. 

So what I did is to always remind her to clean, especially when she's going to her weekend trips. She agreed and apologized to  me. However, it happened many times this year that she left her mess in our shared areas, after specifically reminding her about it days before leaving. Today, she napped and watched her drama while eating. And she rushed again to her weekend getaway, leaving her stacks of plates in different areas of the flat again. Now, I'm planning to leave her dishes for 5 days so I can pack peacefully for my trip. And I began to not clean her mess anymore unless she's cooking for me.

Sorry for the long post. It's been a rough months for me. I tried to understand and helped her. But I'm at my full. Only 4 months left before we both leave but I can't stand it anymore. I decided not to clean her mess but 

TL;DR: My handicapped Flatmate (she has only 1 complete  hand) and I had a system of cleaning. However, she leaves her mess for me to clean especially when she goes on her weekend trips twice a month. I cleaned the flat because I'm afraid of pests and I want to help her since I'm more abled. I was tired so I talked to her about it. She agreed but she did not change. I decided not to clean her mess but I'm afraid I will leave the flat infested. Should I try to talk to her more? How long can I not clean before it gets infested? ",28Feb2019,1
