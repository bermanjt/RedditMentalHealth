I'm in my 20s and my lack of self confidence in anything I do/want to do is starting to feel like a pair of shackles, stopping m e from doing what I actually want to do. Because of this, I was hoping the members if this subreddit would be able to help me out in any way possible. Anything and everything is much appreciated. Thank you!",17Dec2019,1
2,"I mentor several teens who are in a bad situation at home. They want to move out once they hit 18. From my own experience, I couldn't find a good job in my teens at all.

4,I’ve been with my boyfriend about 4 months.  He loves the Lakers so I thought I’d get him tickets to a game against our local team.  Timing is perfect since I know he’s off work.  They’re way more expensive than games against any other team so I wouldn’t be able to get great seats.  I’m not a sports fan so I don’t know if it would still be a good gift if the seats weren’t great.  I’m also not sure if it’s over the top anyway.  What do you think?,17Dec2019,1
5,"I'm a college student taking a Materials Science course. I've done alright so far, and I just took my final exam. I definitely just bombed it because it was the hardest test I've taken, harder than calculus 2 (which I took 2 hours ago).

I asked my professor last week if I could take the final exam tomorrow, because my mind would be melted from calc 2. He said no because he bought plane tickets and he leaves tonight. I believe it's a University rule that students have the choice to take their exams at a later date, and he didn't give me that option.

8,"I already posted this in the lgbt subreddit but I’m putting it here for more responses. If you are gonna be an ass because I’m a lesbian then please just leave.This may be a long post I’m sorry but this year I became really good friends with a girl I’ll call Erin. She’s practically my best friend now and we’re both lesbians, which is great. We’re both very affectionate people and we platonically kiss and cuddle sometimes. I once gave her a hickey and licked whipped cream off of her on a dare and for another dare she took off my bra with her teeth. She also “jokingly” made out at my birthday party last month. I really like her but I feel like because of us being so physically affectionate already, my flirting will come across as playing around. Because my flirting probably won’t be viewed as flirting, I’m gonna have to directly ask her out. I know she will probably say yes if I ask her out because she once told me she’d totally date me, so I’ve tried asking her out but every time I do my stomach I starts hurting and I get so nervous I can’t bring myself to do it. She’s pretty popular so I’m scared if I don’t act fast she’ll get a girlfriend because my school has a lot of gay kids. Also both of our parents are very supportive of us being gay and our classmates all know so I don’t need to be secretive. Can I just have some general advice?",17Dec2019,1
9,"I will try to make this short and sweet. 
I’ve had a friendship/relationship with a guy that I went to college with going on 3 years now. We have been friend’s throughout our internship, entry jobs and now we are joined together again at our careers. I got him a job with me at the same location I am in. In the past, we have been sexual. When we first talked, it was very cute and was dating type situation. It didn’t work out simply because it was just a bad time. I had a lot going on, so did he. We remained friends, obviously. However, we do still have sex from time to time. Usually our encounters happen at work after hours as we are getting ready to leave for the day. 
Anyway, of course there are still feelings there. Unfortunately, I have a lot of feelings for him (go figure) that I get jealous if he talks to coworkers. I get jealous if he speaks to other women and doesn’t speak to me. If I feel like he goes out of his way to talk to others and not me, I get anxious. I wonder why he wouldn’t talk to me because I think our relationship is different. We text a lot but never really speak. We don’t have much of an opportunity to just talk unless it is before or after work. I haven’t told him how much I have feelings for him. I have been scared to tell him because I feel like his carelessness of it would just hurt worse. I think he knows I have feelings, but we don’t really talk about it. I keep telling him that I wish he would just do something so shitty that Id let it go. I wish he would do something terrible to me so I can just hate him instead. I’d get over him easy. He just says he refuses to intentionally be hurtful to me. However, it hurts more for him to hide things from me, rather than just blatantly doing something shitty. I hope this makes sense. 
I know this is dumb. 
So what I am asking, is what should I even do? What would you do? What can I expect?",17Dec2019,1
10,"I find myself seeking attention without even realizing it. I'm sure this makes people not want to give me attention in the end. For exemple, I will talk about my problems way too early, and talk about the worst things I've gone through just to get people to pity me. This makes people feel like their problems are 'less important', or like my problems are not real.

And I wonder if this is really bad to seek attention? How much is too much? For exemple, if I talk about my problems to someone, I'll ask myself ''am I just seeking attention right now?''. I'm trying to be self-aware. But I would like to not have this need for excessive attention in the first place? How do I stop that?

13,"What should I do about my job that I now hate?

So I work at a call center. I was originally hired as an inbound sales person, so my job was to take calls from incoming callers who wanted to purchase things, and I would obviously sell them with the standard attempts at upselling them into things they didn’t want. I actually liked this job, as it was simple, relaxing and fun(sometimes). 

Well recently, I got moved to a new campaign (very stupid reasons in which issues happened where I was the only one punished). The new campaign I absolutely hate. I’ll point fingers too, the new campaign is commissioned by Directv. 

This campaign is an outbound campaign, which means now, instead of taking calls, I’m placing them. My job now consists of me calling random Directv customers and trying to convince them to add a premium channel package onto their account, for example, HBO. 

Not only that, but instead of just talking to the customer like a human being, I have to follow a strict script. I’ll give you an overview of the script (prepare to physically cringe):


*Hi my name is ______ calling from directv and I’m sure you are busy so I won’t take to much of your time. I’m calling to personally thank you for being such a loyal customer to our family at directv, and we wanted to thank you by giving you HBO! In the next couple of days you’ll see HBO available on channels 000-000! HBO is just 13.99 a month which is just 46 cents a day! Your first month may also be prorated!* (quick mention that despite saying it might be, it never is, and it doesn’t even matter if it is, all prorated means is that we just charge you for what days you use, but the call list automatically puts people at the beginning of their billing month first, so it’ll charge them full price anyway) *so for being such a loyal customer, I’m just letting you know those channels are 000-000 so you enjoy them okay?*

Notice that there’s no real attempt at a sale, per the instructions of Directv, all we need is the customer to say “okay” at the end when we say it for authorization. If the customer just says “okay” at the end because they’re processing what we told them, we immediately thank them and end the call, adding it to their account, so they’ll pay for it immediately. The wording of the script is purposefully made to make it sound like they’ll be getting their first month free, which it isn’t, and to make it sound likes it’s a special offer just for them, which it isn’t.

Yeah, pretty scummy.

Well I made it adamantly clear that I hate it, and obviously they said “too bad.” It’s not just the selling either, it’s the atmosphere. 

The previous campaign had a calm atmosphere because people called us, but now, since we call them, it’s absolutely chaotic. We have to keep up an average calls per hour of 60. If you sit idle for 10 seconds you get yelled at to place calls, and the managers are absolute kiss asses to the company (directv, not the company they work for). It actually gives me respect for the other campaign because whenever an issue occurred, those managers would have to kiss the client’s ass so they wouldn’t drop us, but they kept that away from us unlike Directv.

Now, I got suspended for 3 shifts and as I write this, tomorrow is when I go back. The reason for my suspension is because I got 3 calls in a row where old people picked up (in the training class we are told to always pitch hard to old people because they are the easiest to sell) and I just felt too guilty to do this to them so I hung up on all 3. They caught me (by sheer coincidence they were listening to me at that time) and I was suspended. I’ve been told if I do it again then I’m gone. I’ve brought up some of my issues with it but they’re always shot down because “we are getting their permission so it’s fine”. 

It may seem obvious I should quit or just shut up and and trudge ahead, but unlike the managers, I have a conscience, and I really need the job. It pays relatively well (we get hourly not commission) at around $12 per hour, and I’m in college, with tuition of $35,000, loans cover only half, so I owe $12,000+ by the end of next year, plus monthly phone bill, and insurance. This place works around my school schedule, as I can only really work 5 hours a day. My school is an hour away, and my job is 45 minutes away, so I also pay over $100 in gas every week. Quitting isn’t an easy thing to do but I’m starting to not see any other option. I can’t do this damn job, it’s driving me crazy and it makes me feel incredibly guilty to the people we’re doing this to.

What do you guys think I should do?",17Dec2019,1

16,"Apologies in advance for my awful English. I'm 17M in high school.

My friend and I have been friends for about 6 months, so not too long, but definitely a considerable amount from my viewpoint. Now there first 4-5 months were great, we could facetime for hours without getting bored (atleast I didn't), going out frequently, just regular friends. 

Recently, things took a dive for no reason. Left on read more often, barely any talking in general. I kinda got tired of it one day and got angry. I sent my problems over text, trying to avoid confrontation in person. Nothing really came out of the confrontation over text. She essentially said she just feels like shit all the time, and that I don't have to talk to her or be friends if I didn't want to. Now I understand that people b going through it sometimes, but I know she can function socially with other friends. I've seen her talking with others normally. I know that jealousy is a 'toxic' trait, but it pisses me off that we barely talk anymore, even on the weekends. Even when I do see her, she's always on her phone and seems to have no will or desire to talk. 

Also the whole 'you don't have to talk to me' thing pissed me off, because it just seemed like it made our friendship seem insignificant. Yeah, no shit I don't have to talk to you, but isn't that what friends do?

It's been a while since that, things have slightly mended but it still pisses me off. Things aren't much different from before, I'm still the one always having to talk and text first, and I feel neglected in a way. I have horrible headaches and mood swings constantly thinking about it, and I really don't know what to do. I miss the friendship we had before, and I don't want to lose a friend because making friends is tough for someone like me (anxiety-ridden, low self-esteem teen).

I don't want her to actually get mad at me if I bring it up again, but I don't know what to do. I care about her and our friendship but I don't feel the same from her. What do I do?",17Dec2019,1

19,"I am a 23F married to a 26M for a year and a half. I love my husband and I don't picture myself with anybody else but we are having some issues, or at least I am. Over the course of our relationship sex has lessened and gotten a less intense/interesting, I suppose. Usually we still have sex at least once or twice a week, sometimes it is good and other times it could be better, lol. 98 percent of the time I initiate, which bugs me and I've already told that to my husband, but nothing ever changes. To be honest, I myself have some sort of emotional issues when it comes to sex, and I believe I use it for reassurance in our relationship and affirmation that I am still wanted/loved. Most of the time we do it I don't cum, although my husband thinks I do. But a lot of the times it is okay with me that I don't, as I do take a while to finish and I am getting what I really want from the sex which is affirmation and intimacy. Anyways, my issue is this,

These past few months my husband has started watching and looking at porn, avidly. Not just once in a while... I mean like every day... Sometimes multiple times a day. He doesn't always jerk off when he looks at it, sometimes he just looks. I know this because I have seen it on his phone/computer. Mind you, I myself watch porn sometimes, and I don't think there's anything wrong with it to an extent. But it bothers me extremely that he watches it so often and even more so that he is lying to me about it. I confronted him multiple times and on multiple occasions he has attempted to lie. A week or so ago I had enough and confronted him again, because I feel like this is a issue and it's contributing to our sex life issues. Not to mention it makes me feel terrible and self conscious, and it is causing me to be distrustworthy and resentful of him.

Long story short he acts exasperated and like its no big deal.. But says he will delete reddit (which is what he mainly used) and not watch anything at all. I told him he didn't need to do that, and that it was fine to look at it sometimes, but he's been doing it a lot. He deleted reddit and then said that even if he doesn't watch porn he will still jerk off sometimes. I said that's okay. It's normal.

Fast-forward to now.

He's obviously been watching porn again, so I again confront him. He attempted to lie but then told the truth and said he had only watched it once and it was a while ago. 🙃 He has watched it almost every day. 

I'm honestly at a loss for what to do or think? Is this an addiction? Is it my fault? Should we abstain from having sex for a while? Am I overreacting?

Please be kind, I am just trying to figure out what to do. I love my husband and I want our relationship to last.",17Dec2019,1
20,"Ive been really stressed out due to a fight with a friend that happened a while ago. This friend was someone I really loved. I had decided a while ago to cut them off but I can't seem to do it. Not without a proper conversation but they just wont talk. 

I'm trying to figure out if or how to stop this pain. They were my best friend and now they are genunly avoiding me to the point of not looking me in the eyes in the hallways. 


Here's the backstory:
About 7-8 months ago now they had cut me off and strung me along because the needed to think about something I had been accused of. I had an ex tell all of my friends I liked kids. There was no evidence, and no one came to ask my side. After a lot of begging for him to listen and me not getting any clear answers he stopped talking to me until months later when my ex fucked up and showed them a really bad side of themself (dog abuse, pissing in sinks, overly needy to the point of putting their life at risk) 

After that he apologized and came back. I already had a huge amount of trauma surrounding being ignored and not listened to and this situation seriously added on. 

Ive considered him my best friend after he came back because he genuinely would listen and we hung out a lot. 

After the whole event I had become a LOT colder and blunter. I had started boxing and a good chunk of that has stuck around. Even after stopping it. 

Important info to know: I started a discord and he was an admin. I was not planning on taking it seriously.

About a month ago I was extremely frustrated and in a bad spot mindset wise, I had just struggled through hours of finals work on a program I could barely get to work and I told him I was feeling like the discord was making me dislike him. No cussing no nothing, he had been doing a bunch of things in it that made me uncomfortable. I had tried to tell him but it didnt work out. He wanted so much done with it that with finals added on top I was starting to get very stressed out over it. 

He essentially said it was a stupid thing to fight over and brought up something I had said days ago. He had never said anything about it so I forced to assume he likely would have just never told me he was upset with it if it hadnt been for this fight. He said he needed space so I gave him space. 


After about a week or so I was starting to get signs he was no where close to being okay with talking. I had already decided if he took too much longer he was gone so I removed his ability to edit the discord. I didnt want him doing anything to it because of the fight and if I hadnt known him personally and he had done what he did on the discord as an admin I would have removed him a long time ago. He had extremely different views about the discord then I did. 

I told him calmly what I had done and that it was nothing personal and it was something I would have done. Very short and simple. 

He started cussing at me telling me I needed a therapist talking about things I had told him I was insecure about in confidence. 

He was saying I was bad at listening and couldnt handle criticism but ultimately I try to listen to cristisism but not all criticism should be followed. He wanted to set up the discord to be a huge server that was really popular. I ultimately would be fine with this but I was not wanting it to be that way unless it just kinda came around. If it never happened or the server died I couldnt care less. I was extremely busy and stressed at the time and was not looking to deal with anything more. I tried to tell him this at the time. At least that it was really stressing me out how fast we had been going on it and how much I wanted to slow down. 

Heres how I see it. He isnt willing to make himself uncomfortable in order to talk it out and is likely to continue to ignore me until he just feels like talking to me. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know just how much his views and business towards the server had bothered me because when I confronted him he said it was something stupid. 

I understand that I have flaws but he was only willing to bring them up because of a fight? And at that reacted so strongly to a few passive calm comments. I cant see any reasonable reason for him to be acting this way. 

Can someome please help me figure this out? I cant tell if I'm in the wrong or hes being unreasonable. I'm almost positive that hes not going to talk soon with his past history.",17Dec2019,1
21,"Tl;Dr : Broke up with someone because I was insecure. He has a girlfriend now after a year, but I still love him. It hurts to know I can’t be with him, should I talk to him about it? Or leave it be and see where it takes me.

I broke up with someone a little under a year ago because I was worried he didn’t like me anymore. I never told him the reason why I broke up, and he still doesn’t know.

I messaged him a few days ago though and realized how far from over him I am, and I still love him. 

I realized I got a lot more happier when he messaged me. However, he has a girlfriend, so I can’t be with him. It hurts a lot, but talking to him makes me happier. I don’t know what to do though.

He makes me happy, but what should I do about it... Him having a girlfriend hurts me too much, but I’ll be back to being a depressed sack of nothing with no motivation if I stop talking to him. Should I tell him how he makes me feel and why I actually broke up with him? He doesn’t seem to want to talk about our relationship.

25,"Hey all,

So I'll condense this as much as possible and you may ask for details in the comments. But anyways my father who is in his late 40s is very depressed. I (M22) currently live with my family which consists of my parents, and 3 younger sisters. Money is tight and always has been since we moved to the USA 15 some years ago. Hes currently very unhappy with his job and not only is he making problems with coworkers, but he is trying for a job that will cut his salary by 20k just for the sake of ""it will secure my future"". Now this is not why I'm writing. I'm writing because his depression is not just visible and seeping into the family, he has become extremely sensitive to a lot of topics. Today my 9 year old sister bought me a wallet from a school fair for 10$. My dad flipped the hardest shit on my mom for allowing her to buy it when she could've gotten the same one at Walmart for half the price. It's like he doesnt understand the value of a kid shopping on their own for the first time for her brother. I cannot stand a second of hearing him yell and argue with my mom, especially about shit like this. Also hes been taking meds the doctors prescribed to him which I largely disapprove of because I think trying to overcome depression by blocking it with drugs does nothing but dig a deeper hole. But I keep that to myself because i wont be the one to advise someone against doctors and have it go bad on my hands. My ask is, what can I do to help my father? I serisouly am growing to despise him and his reactions to things but I get it. I just came out of my 10th depression episode.",17Dec2019,1
26,"I met him when I started my first job 5 nights ago. Normally I can predict the type person someone is but he's a bit mysterious, but in a good way. And he's such a gentleman. He's also a gamer and we like the same music. 

I figured he was just trying to be nice on my first day and I was reading too much into it. He was off for a few days until last night. He bought me lunch and we went to his car, it was freezing outside and he put a blanket over me and tucked me in while we watched a movie. We live in the same direction and he gave me a ride home, said we should hang out. I like the way he looks at me when he thinks I'm not paying attention. He has a cute smile

But I'm still not safe. Not truly. I haven't spoken to my ex since I left him in September, I fucking hate him and I'm glad he's gone. But he was very possessive and controlling. And he's dangerous. He's won multiple fights with other guys and would tell me he would beat up any guy who tries to date me if I left him.

What do I do? I really, really like this guy but should I tell him that we can't date for his safety? If something happened to him because of me I couldn't forgive myself. I have a lot of emotional baggage also with ptsd, anxiety and depression and always worried that I would be abusive because of the ex and I was planning on staying single because of it.

If I choose to let him go I'll feel like I ruined something that could have been great. But I can't be selfish either.

It's been almost a decade since I've dated and I don't know how to do this. I know people hate when you talk about your ex but I can't let him walk into this blindly.

Throughout the next few years, they brought a happiness into my life that I never knew I needed, but kind of did, because my social isolation and anxiety told me to reject friendships.

After the program ended, we faced college admissions, so we toured universities together, sometimes hanging out with each other multiple times a week.  We rejoiced in getting into the colleges that we did.

About midway through college (so 3-4 years ago), I had a health crisis, a mental health crisis, that effectively terrified and shocked my friends.  They suddenly cut off all connections.  When I faced returning to class after a long inpatient hospitalization, I tried to reconnect with them but most of them were gone.  It was absolutely devastating, and I fell into another cycle of depression.

When I graduated college two years ago, I was lucky enough to land a decent job.  One of my friends reached back out to me on LinkedIn and we reconnected after maybe 2 years.  It felt much longer than that.  There was no explanation and no looking backwards, and we were happy to see each other again, or so I thought.

After I saw her for that one day two years ago, it's as if that were the final puff of air to extinguish that candle, and just a trail of smoke remained.  I have no idea why that happened, perhaps her SO was concerned for associating with someone like me.

For the most part, the friendships I made in that time, that pivotal time of my teenage life, have completely disappeared, with any attempts to reconnect like pulling at unsecured threads (except these threads lead directly to a lot of emotional memories)

I was entertaining the thought that this holiday season, I would send them a holiday greeting card.  I don't know if I should venture down this road, and what I would even say if I did do that.

Pretty much now, a few years into my professional life, I've lost touch with the few friends I had leading into college, and due to me commuting to college, I haven't made any friends to keep in touch with.  This leads to some maladaptive social personality traits, and just a general, perpetual state of being miserable.  I don't trust people and don't want to open up to my colleagues because deep down, I miss those lost friends so much that it almost drove me to kill myself.

I still struggle with alcohol and benzo abuse in line with my diagnosed mental illnesses, but I am for the most part, functional.  Inside though, I am incredibly empty, materialistic, and can hold a job just about as long as I can hold new friendships (answer: 2-5 months)

So...

tl;dr would it be a good idea to send holiday greeting cards many years after losing touch with the only meaningful friends I made?",17Dec2019,1
32,"I started working in a bowling in late September and I was (and still am) trying to be as nice as possible to the clients and my coworkers. 3 months later, I was getting along with pretty much everybody.

 Last week, I was casually talking with a friend of mine at school and he tells me that his girlfriend's brother also worked in that bowling. I didn't  really think anything of it at the time. Today, he came up to me and told me that my coworkers hate me and that I told one of my coworkers that she had a ""fat ass"". I was surprised and laughed because I tought it was a weird joke. It wasn't.

I feel like I have no purpose in life, no real driving force that pushes me to actually do something. Also I feel like I’m being forced in a career direction by my family that I’m not sure I want to do.
 
I live kinda far from my friends but they all live within 5 minutes of each other so I kinda feel like an outlier in my own friend group. They hang out all the time with each other cause they can just walk to their houses but meanwhile I only really hang out when it’s a big thing( I don’t have my license but that’s because of external circumstances).

47,"Building friendship with co-worker?

Quick story: work for a multinational at the HQ for one of the firms largest arms. About 1,200 people in this office. 

M23, F23-30

I’ve noticed this girl at the office gym several times. She’s just really cute and I’m interested. 

I found out she works at the same company but on a totally different team, with little to no interaction. Her desk is on the complete opposite side of the building. 

Turns out though she had emailed me about something last week, I gave her a buzz and discussed over the phone and WOW, she was incredibly nice, friendly and appreciative. This is the first time we have ever communicated and I looked her up in our company directory that’s how I knew who she was. 

*(Before anyone says creepy, jeez it’s just a way to see the team she’s on etc. I do this for every new contact that comes through, it also tells the desk location phone ext, who their boss is, etc.)*



I know this is typically advised against relationships in the workplace, *however* I am in the process of leaving the firm and joining a new company, which will likely be complete in 3-4 months.  This isn’t really an issue now as this is such a down the road matter, since I’m not even certain if she knows who I am aside from finding a guys email in the company directory and reaching out at the direction of her boss. 

I have officially met her in person, how should I act when I see her? We’ve spoke in person ONCE. Can I say hi when I see her around including at the fitness center? 

Any advice here? 

My objective: I would like to get to know her and let her know, in a non creepy, somewhat subtle way, that I am interested, but also have an easy non awkward “out” explanation whatever you wanna call it to defend my actions and act is if she just got a wrong read, in the case she’s not feeling it at all.

I will be honest she was super cool, friendly and kind on the phone and I even made her laugh. She was both appreciative of my efforts and apologetic of the extra burden of work.  The same is true when I met her! 

TLDR; 23M 23-30?F. Girl I’ve noticed at the office fitness center, happens to work for the same company (1200 employee), coincidentally she is doing work for her team on a mutual assignment, she emailed me for assistance/info. I called her to discuss, she was super friendly, laughed, kind and appreciative, I introduced myself in person to talk about the work matter.

51,"I'm 20 and my sister is 28 but in the last couple of years, I feel like she's younger than me. She has a bachelors but in her field it seems difficult for her to find a job. It's been about 4 years since she's graduated and she seems so comfortable still living with our parents. She just seems to wait until people around her help her like our hairdresser or a family friend. And when it comes to nothing, she just continues with her routine, browsing on her computer and playing mobile games. My mother tried suggesting taking a course for some extra certification but my sister gave up halfway-through.

Sometimes when one of my parents or I try to correct her mistake or try to give her advice, she gets pouty and quiet like I used to when I was younger or tries to blame something else not really relevant to our comment (like minor events in from years ago when she was in high school). Two days ago my mother had to throw out my sister's moldy chicken from the fridge and when my mother showed my sister what she had to throw out, my sister got quiet, stomped her feet as she walked back to her room, and locked the door. At the time, I didn't feel bad. It was such a non-issue that I just didn't care. She seems to old to be so sensitive and defensive over something so small and clearly her fault.

I used to feel bad for her but now I just find her pathetic and most of the time I just don't want to talk to her. I feel like she pities herself more than anyone else can. I used to be really close with my sister (and I know I've said harsh things already) but I don't want to grow up cutting ties with her like my mother did with her sister.

57,"i work in a place that involves lab animals for scientific benefit. most animals are ratchet but the rats are special. i feel close and loving toward all the rats. certain rats, there's a certain connection. my supervisor was fine with me keeping a small number of special rats in the workplace that we couldn't use for our company's purpose. we should have sent them out to be killed when they were obviously not useful for our purpose, but these particular ones there was a connection, so we've kept them for a little over a year.

i'm the main person who plays with them, takes care of them, feeds them, they really love me. i love them. i get nightmares about what i do with the animals at work. a lot of the time, those off the books rats are the only thing that make me feel good about my job, which is you know 50-60 hours of how i spend my life every week.... those rats save me from hating my entire purpose on earth. it feels like they forgive me.

over a year old is a long time for a rat, especially if they're rats that may or may not have been specifically bred as models for certain diseases. one of them, i've been having to wash her lately because she stopped cleaning herself well, i knew something was wrong. i felt a tumor in her today. that's normal in old rats, let alone an old rat that may have specific genetics to be extremely unhealthy. i'm devastated. what i should do is just send her out to be killed like other excess rodents get killed by our company. but i know how they kill rodents in our company. it passes welfare regulations but i've heard how it sounds. i think it's incredibly inhumane, i think most people would consider it inhumane. i can't vent to people about my work because even the basic day-to-day that's normal to me sounds inhumane to them, so i don't think i'm being melodramatic that if i think this is disgusting after years in the company.... it's definitely disgusting.

my company is supposed to have security but i know that almost none of the cameras work and all working are basically useless due to how old they are and that they are never checked. i know coworkers who have smuggled animals home who they couldn't kill. i know it's a regular occurrence.

i want to steal this rat out from the company so that i can pay a vet for proper euthanasia. the idea of this animal dying in such an awful way all alone, after everything this animal has helped me through, it sucks, bad. at the same time, i'm rising extremely fast in this company, i'm being mentored for a high position. i feel stupid risking it all-- and risking being sued by big pharma-- because i'm so sappy about how this rat dies. would it be stupid to make plans to do this?",17Dec2019,1

61,"So, I have an older sister who is succeeding in life and that is making me really jealous. Not only that, she used to make my life miserable because she used to be sad and miserable herself. My oldest sister and her would constantly back stab me, give me dirty looks, glare at me, look me up and down, make fun of me behind my back and they just hated me for some reason.

Now, what they did to me was horrible. They practically bullied me in my own home and that led me to feeling unsafe there and multiple suicide attempts. In fact, these two made fun of my bipolar disorder. Calling me retarded, ugly, a wh\*re a, a sl#t, a freak, a loser, a b\*tch and basically anything mean and awful that you could possibly think of. They would humiliate me in front of the family and disguise insults as compliments and my parents believed they would never do such a thing! I had to live this way, up until my oldest sister moved away. Now it's just me, my parents and my second oldest sister. 

About, 2013, when this whole thing started, my second oldest sister had turned my oldest sister against me. My second oldest sister would get really jealous of me and how did I know? She would project her insecurities onto me. At the time, I was too young to know what this was and thought something was wrong with me. I remember in fall of 2014, I got on honor roll. In 2012, I was the first of my sisters to lose a significant amount of weight. My second oldest sister would say I was stupid and I believed it in those times. When I lost weight, both of my sisters made fun of me saying, I was ugly behind my back and saying that I look like waluigi and had a man face in the nicest way possible in front of my face. (kind of funny I know, but that's what they had said). (also, I have been complimented by many people in the past, when I was skinny on how pretty I was, I was even asked why I never had a boyfriend) (I remember, I went to the school when I was skinny and a boy started to approach me, now, my sister was pretty overweight and she intimidated him away from me)

Whenever I accomplished anything, my sisters made fun of me for it and ultimately discredited me for it. 

They basically tore down my confidence and I honestly think I made my sister stronger, while she made me weaker. My second oldest sister was never an achiever, she was a slacker and nearly failed in school multiple times. I know for a fact, that if it weren't for me, she wouldn't have gotten her act together and started to get good grades in school. Now, she's in her college of choice, moving on to be an engineer and I don't have a job because of social anxiety and med problems. I never had one and I don't even have a driver's permit. I'm 20, going to be 21 next month, years old and don't have a life!

I just feel so upset because I remember that I was a high achiever and it's as if she took that away from me by tearing my confidence down and saying that I was stupid and worthless. I am good at writing and now, she's trying to take that as her thing! she was never into writing! She has stolen many personality traits from me, it's insane!

I really just want to focus on my life and my goals, but It's as if I can't do that because I'm so focused in on what's going on in her life and it worries me, maybe because I'm jealous and I HATE that emotion, I wish no one had to experience it! My problem is, If I see someone, well anyone really, doing better than me, I will want to give up because I think that I can not measure up to them. I really want to move on in life.

When we first started dating, we agreed upon the rule that neither of us would watch porn. He’s held up his end of the deal (as far as I’m aware anyways), but I recently crossed that boundary.

I explained myself and told him the whole truth without leaving anything out, I don’t think he believed me.

I am black.

I can’t get myself to do things I enjoy, like working out, taking walks outside and exploring the new city I just moved to. 

I feel like my career is what’s really triggering all this. I’ve been an ICU nurse for about 3 years now. I have thought about going to grad school but I can’t get myself motivated to start applications, which makes me think I really don’t want to go back to school and that I’m only considering it because it’s what I feel like I’m suppose to do next.  But I also know I don’t want to be an ICU nurse (maybe even a bedside nurse) forever. 


I just feel really lost and don’t know how to get myself out of this. Or to convince myself that if I don’t go to grad school, I’m not a failure.

Has anyone ever felt similar? What did you do to get yourself out of it?",17Dec2019,1
72,"- [ ] I went to my job  adviser of one month she had chose me forward for a job interview.  and she asked me do I need interview clothes ( polite/bubbly  tone of voice) i said ‘no thanks iv already got them’ and her response was ""oh, have you got all that? (Bubbly as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me assertively , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) she went on to say ""well don't forget, shirt pants and shoes....make sure you cut you're nails make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that, make sure you get a shave"" then she paused a bit looking at her computer and said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing, she said it nicely but probably was thinking sinister but Idk. i was hurt about it but smiled  along with her quiet as I am. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) next interview she chose me for again  I had the next week she never said anything like this again",17Dec2019,1
73,"i play in a rock n roll band and we just wrapped up our recording session for the next EP and we're going to open the EP with a song about sexual assault. i fear the lyrics could be triggering. also the band is comprised of three males who have never experienced sexual assault. the lyrics are obviously not at all condoning it, they are essentially saying its not okay. 

ultimately the question here is do we, as three males who never experienced sexual assault, release a song tackling that subject? would that make people mad or trigger victims?",17Dec2019,1
74,"He was never really around growing up. Mainly because he’s a terrible father. The last time I even seen his face was 6 years ago at his sons (my half brothers) funeral. I’m 21 now and don’t really think about him as my father. He’s just a stranger. 

Anyway, I got a random call. I never would have thought it was him. He was never abusive or mean to any of my siblings growing up. He just struggled with his own issues and addictions and made life hell for my mom. It was his birthday today and him and his girlfriend he had 3 kids with are breaking up. I feel bad for him as a person, but I’ve accepted that I don’t have a dad. We’ve never had that relationship. 

I go along with whatever he’s talking about and at the end of the call he says “I love you” and I say I love you back out of pity. It felt so wrong. I don’t love this stranger, but he sounded so pitiful. I didn’t want to make this person feel bad, but I regret saying it. I’ve given him so many chances in the past and after I decided I was done with him when I was around 14 he calls me.

80,"this ones a weird and LONG one and im ready to go either way. ill tldr it at the bottom. sorry for complete lack of grammar, its 2am.

Im demisexual, i know this because i have had 2 crushes in my life and they were after spending over 2 weeks with the person locked in a situation. this bits not up for debate

in may i spent a whole month working at a club with a guy, and we really connected. we got a bit involved and when i had to leave back home (an hour away) he distanced himself immediately. he didnt reply to any messages, and still doesnt regardless. i got the feeling i was just a fling for him. a week after i left, another coworker said he slept with the girl i said i was intimidated by (because shes beautiful and confident). im pretty sure i felt heartbreak over the summer. we didnt see each other or talk again, both not working at the club when i returned.

i was out clubbing on tuesday and he turns up at the club. later he tells me its because he knew i was there and that he missed me even though he put no effort into contacting me. he came back to mine because he missed the last train and i said he could share my double bed as long as he didnt try anything.

he looks at me like he is infatuated with me. i finally have someone i am attracted to that likes me back.

he has massive issues and wont tell me anything or send messages. we havent talked since tuesday, no matter how hard i try.

im sick of feeling heartbreak for a week after we see each other.

tldr; i find a guy that really likes me, but i keep getting hurt and going back. chances of finding someone else are slim.

DO I

1. call him, tell him to meet me somewhere, tell him how i feel and that we need to cut it off

2. say nothing, never invite him back again, separate myself from him quietly

3. say nothing, see what happens, if we end up in the same bed again then so be it!",17Dec2019,1
81,"I (30M) broke up from a pretty soul sucking, depression spiraling, life stopping and all around boring long term relationship about 2.5 months ago. I'm currently in a very depressed state. Everything is becoming hopeless in my mind. I don't do anything. Most days I wake up, smoke, shower and head to work, come home smoke, play video games, go to bed and do it all again. My diet has been shit. I work in a kitchen so I'm usually grazing all day on not the healthiest fare. 

I have an opportunity to change careers and get back to what I was originally working towards my undergrad degree for. The position is similar to a camp councilor job, but the kids there are there as a last resort. They're usually addicted, or getting into gang stuff. This place is the kind of place designed to remove the child, quickly, from their environment, often coming late at night. This sounds like the set up to a horror I know, but I can't drive home the point enough that these kids usually have three options, death, jail, or survivalist camping/nature therapy until they're ready to go back. It's not boot camp or anything you'd see on Maury or Dr. Phil or something like that. It's actual therapy, group and individual, it's just set in a primitive camp site. It's in the Blue Ridge Mnts, about 20 miles from a cell phone signal. 

Anyway, like I was saying, I would have jumped all over this in my early/mid twenties. It combines my love of nature and passion for helping others. My fear is though that I'm now severely depressed and want so much to find and feel that passion again for this, but I've got nothing. In fact, I get fear at this point. Fear that I won't be able to help the kids, that I won't be able to pull myself out of this etc... However, the pros are also pretty sweet too. I'm overweight and currently living a rather sedimentary life when I'm not at work, so this would force me to be active and eat healthier. Apparently the staff often gets just as much therapy in the woods as the kids so I'm thinking that's obviously positive. I'd have a much better schedule. It's something I wanted to do in the past. 

There's a bit of a deadline too. My lease is up in March and if I were to take this job, I'd have to move. So I have to make a decision soon.

My question is, what do you all think? Should I stick with what I'm doing, and keep working at my mental well being where I'm at, or do I throw caution into the wind?",17Dec2019,1
82,"I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m 20, soon to be 21 come January and I feel as if I’m not allowed to slowly become more self sufficient. 

The thing that really was the last straw for me was what happened today. I had spilled pure acetone onto my phone and luckily it still works but I’m not sure for how much longer. I asked my mom if she could release my number (something that I’ve mentioned to her multiple times over the year) and she instantly turned me down because she doesn’t wanna deal with my phone issues. I don’t know if she understands that all she has to do is call our provider and after that call it’s not her problem anymore. And it’s like this for other stuff too for example, teaching me how to drive, getting me my own copy of the insurance card, pretty much anything I ask her to do that allows me to do things on my own without bothering her. 

However, she gives me crap for not acting like an adult and doing things on my own. I don’t get how I can do things on my own if she’s preventing me from doing so. I’ve tried talking to her about it multiple times but she just gets an attitude and blows it off like nothing. I feel stuck and I love my mom to death but she is the biggest stressor in my life. I’m trying to get my shit together before they move out of state next summer and I’m on my own but she keeps basically cockblocking me. It’s not even “she doesn’t want one of her babies to grow up” anymore. It’s really ridiculous at this point that I’m not allowed to be an adult when I’m trying my best to be.",17Dec2019,1
83,"My (M16) Girlfriend (F16) is very flirty with other boys at school. We’ve been dating for almost a year now, and this has been a problem throughout the relationship. I think it’s the biggest problem, since other than that we’re doing really good. 

By flirty I mean she’s very touchy, (poking guys butts, play fighting with them, calling them cute, letting them flirt with her or touch her without telling them to stop, etc.) It’s to the point where she does something to a boy that’s flirty and several have done the same thing back to her, because well, boys are boys. I can’t even really blame them because the majority of the time she’s the one instigating it.

I’ve already talked to her about it, our best friend has already talked to her about it, her older brother has already talked to her about it, and she always says to us that it’s hard because she doesn’t know if what she’s doing is flirtatious or not. That sounds like a lie, but I honestly believe it because she has done those things right in front of me before. I don’t mind her talking to other boys at all, but if she’s flirting with them, or they’re flirting with her, I do. 

Recently we had a situation where she started talking to a guy who she knew I didn’t approve of, and he ended up getting her to send him nudes. It hurt a lot, but I have a huge tolerance to bullshit like that, so I forgave her, and she’s been a lot better about flirting with people since, but I still notice it a lot. I’m not going to break up with her because I truly have hope for her and I, even though that would be an easy answer. I care about her too much and I’d rather fix these problems than just end everything, because when we’re not at school everything is great. So this is less for me, and more for her. I want to help her stop being like that and she wants to too. Thank you!!",17Dec2019,1

85,"Hey Reddit,

This started as a vent, became a confession and after I wrote two huge posts about my life and how fucked everything is I decided to delete them all and just ask on the biggest issue I currently have.

I have been enrolled to my bachelor programme for over 3 years now and aquired exactly 3 out of 180 required credit points and let me tell you why. 

It was always my ambition and dream (or so I thought) to go to university. I finished school with 17 and the highest degree possible in my country and decided to go work jobs for a while until I feel ready and confident enough to go to university, as I felt I had so much time to figure out what I want and I wanted to make the right choice (although my father advised me just to start doing something).

I worked in gastronomy for 2 years and did an apprenticeship in wholesale and export for 3 years, making me a certified salesman. After I finished that I was ready to study. I applied to many universities (denmark, sweden, netherlands, spain etc.) but was rejected from all of them. I had to sue myself into my local university, but it worked out and I was not thrilled but happy I got a spot. I started with immense motivation, the only problem was that the process of sueing myself into the bachelor took so long that the first semester was nearly over when I finally got a student ID and access to the networks and stuff. There was probably a way for me to just go and start studying without the certainty of getting a spot, but I wasn't aware of that possibility tbh.

So the first exams were right around the corner and I haven't been to a single lecture, no notes, no colleagues I could ask - nothing. I was quite frustrated to say the least, but I thought I can just give it my all in the next semester. So it all started.

The second semester was going well, I found a very nice student job at a prestigious tv and radio company where I fell in love with a girl who was working with me. To make it quick, she  fell for me too, got scared of her feelings and dumped me. I was devastated, turtled in my appartment and smoked weed all day long playing video games with a broken heart. Second semester - fucked.

We got together after that and it was the most toxic and unhealthy relationship I have ever been in. She was incredbily jealous and insecure and made my life an anxious hell. I loved her so much though that I wanted to try and make it happen, I thought that if there was ever a partner for someone to overcome their jealousy/insecurities than it was me, because I am a very loyal person who never even thought about stuff like cheating. I was ditching university to be with her, she ditched hers as well and we had a codependant relationship for the 3 years to come. In this time I did nothing at all. We spend our time eating, smoking and just clinging on to each other and rarely left our appartments. Every time I was doing something else without her she would get suspicious and we started fighting again.

As much as I loved her, the constant accusations of cheating and the fighting that followed made me depressed and brought out the worst of myself. My whole life went to shit, I went from a happy young guy to an emotional wreck who had anxiety leaving the house because I was walking on eggshells the entire relationship.

I broke up with her last december and still am a pile of steaming doodoo. I have exactly 3 credit points, so I still need to collect 177 so I can write my bachelor thesis. Here is the reality.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I feel like a complete failure. I fear the day I have to come clean with my parents, telling my father how much I fucked up. My parents did everything for me, they are the best and I love them more than anything. They gave me opportunities I just didn't use. My older brother became a fucking doctor with suma cum laude at 28 years old and his working his ass off but living his dream. Without their financial support I couldn't live in my appartment or feed myself... and I am 27 years old ffs. I am currently even working for them, which happened by coincidence as I had to quit my old job (because of ex gf) and they had a long term employee quitting after 12 years. When I am at the office I behave like I am currently studying and have my life in check, but it won't be long until my cover blows (or I blow it myself, mom already feels whats up).
2. I have a severe problem with addiciton. I am addicted to video games and cannabis, the best combination to waste your best years if you ask me. It is not that I smoke more than anyone else, in my group of friends I am actually one of the less heavy smokers, but I smoked regularly for the last 10 years (buying 25g for myself was nothing special for me) with maybe only 4-5 months where I was actually 100% sober. I have no problem with taking a break, but I always ended up at the same consumption levels and above. It started as a ""cool"" philosophy and ended as my only way of easing my mind from all the negative emotions. Deleted all numbers from my phone the day before yesterday...
3. I miss my fucking ex so much. I am well aware that she was not good for me, but fuck man I loved that woman more than anything else and since I broke up she haunts me in my dreams and in my daily life. My only wish for the past 4 years was for us to be happy together. I wanted to marry her, no one in my life made me feel like she did. I would have moved mountains, cut off every limb only so she would trust me, only so we can be happy together. Maybe it is the competitive person in me who just hates to accept the fact I failed and lost and therefore can't let go... But dammit, how can life be so fucking unfair? First I lose my girl, then my grandfather dies, then my grandmother... All in one fucking year. I just want to hold her again and feel this incredible emotional connection we had, not everything was bad in the relationship you know... It was real love, no matter her problems. There were very sad reasons for her behaviour I will not get into right now.
4. I think I have depression. I know it is because of the circumstances, because I am usually quite a happy person who loves to make other people happy. But these last years made me miserable, cynic and depressed. I went to a therapeutic session ones and never went back, although I felt better after the first session. I know that I should probably start that again, but it actually takes a lot of strenght to do that...
5. I have extreme anxiety about my university, as it is connected to so many bad memories. I procrastinate a lot, but I don't even know if I could do it. As always, my fear of failing keeps me from even trying. I don't even know if there is a time limit, if I will just be expelled at a point... I could be already expelled and wouln't know...

I know that I am by no means in a bad spot in general. As I said, I have a family that loves me (although I have the classic daddy issues because I am just a big disappointment to that man), I found good friends I can trust and count on, I am financially secure, although completely dependant on my parents and I am physically strong, healthy and not exceptionally stupid. If you would meet me on the street, I swear that you wouldn't expect me to be so miserable. You would think I am a confident, charismatic and polite young guy who just hasn't found his way yet but has emotional intelligence at the very least. But fuck, I feel so lost. The last 4 years I have cried more than in my whole life combined, including my childhood (I am not joking).

I find myself crumbling under my thoughts, having regular emotional breakdowns I cannot control anymore (sometimes at work, often when I am drunk but mostly in my car or at home on the floor). The loss of my grandfather gave me the rest, seeing him suffer so much with all the tubes and cables in his body after years of health struggles is burned into my memory. Seeing my father, my biggest critique and my role model, breaking down and crying for the first time in my life... Having my friends and family come up to me to tell me they are all worried about me. I am just a mess..

There are things helping me atm. I am currently quitting weed for good, although I am just a few days in. I am a passionate cook/baker/eater and am currently back at it, I love making music, although I just can't bring myself to write songs right now because I cannot write my thoughts down without starting to cry. I have a new dog, after 7 years of missing my old one (rip my big boi) and she is the sun of my life . She is the cutest and most pure being in existence and I can finally love someone unconditionally again... She makes me smile everyday and comforts me when I am feeling down, I do not deserve her. But nothing can keep me from feeling this dark despair. 

Although I wanted to make this post about my studies it still ended up being a confession and a vent for much more. I would really like to see myself with a bachelor in my hands, but I want to know from you guys what you think. Should I quit and try to chase happiness another way? Should I get my shit together? 

Thank you for reading so far, it means a lot to me. I rarely speak about this anymore with my friends. I hope someone can help me with some experience or different perspective. We all live under the same sky in the end, I don't think I am the only one with problems. But damn, I need some words of advice right now... I will go to sleep now and hopefully wake up to your responses :) 

Thank you for your time and have a great day wherever you are :=)",17Dec2019,1
86,"I am male(24) and she's female(25)

A little About the context:

I have known her for almost 3 years.

This was her last Letter to me,

""Dear ...... , I hope that you are doing well... just wanted to let you know I got married. And I’ll be living out of the country.. I hope you are ok. just don’t text me so I don’t get in trouble."" and she then blocked me on twitter.

Things to mention she's really close friend of mine at least from my personal side. She didn't block me on snapchat and on my other twitter account but both of them are female names and she knows about them. I created those account because she would be in trouble if they found out she's actively chatting with males(We're from Middle East, so their is restriction.) and I only use them to talk to her.

I wouldn’t say my life has COMPLETELY gone to shit yet, but I’m looking for some advice because my addiction to the internet is really taking away from me. I’m not doing as well as I could in school, because I procrastinate WAYY too much and always put off assignments to the last minute, and I also can never pay attention in class because I’m always just scrolling Reddit or Instagram or Facebook during class.

I have pretty big aspirations such as I want to start a YouTube channel and a business centered around one of my hobbies which is photo and video production, but I put this stuff off way too much and I can never bring myself to actually start this business because I procrastinate.

90,"A little background information; this is my second class with the professor, I would say we have a strong professor/student relationship, he's given me career/academic guidance and we often talk about things non-school related, joke around, etc, so, we're pretty close, I guess. Last semester, I was on top of my game and excelled in all assignments/exams. This semester, I've been doing great on exams, pretty good on assignments, except for the fact I missed the deadline for 2 homework assignments, which brought my grade down. My prof has a strict no late work policy and didn't allow me to submit the assignments for partial credit and I ended up getting two 0's. Currently, I'm at a 87%, 3 points away from an A.  If I was able to make up for the two homework assignments, that I got 0's on, I could bring my grade up to an A.  Or even with some extra credit where I could provide high quality work, to allow me to improve my grade, would be super helpful..  
I would like to explain my situation to my prof as to why I haven't been performing as well as last semester. I've had ongoing issues with my marriage for the past 6 months to the point where we were on the verge of divorce twice. Also, my depression has resurfaced (that I'm getting treatment for), which has caused my mental health to decline significantly, amongst other things going on in my life. All that personal shit has really taken a toll on me and affected my academic performance. I'm going to email my prof tonight and see if he's willing to allow me to improve my grade, I'm not sure if I should straight up send him a long email explaining my situation to appeal my case, or keep it brief and not get ""too"" personal. Given that we're closer than the average professor/student, I feel like it might be okay to share personal details of my life, in hopes of him considering allowing me to improve my grade.. Any thoughts?",17Dec2019,1

95,"So, I've never been on here before. But something has really been bugging me recently. Me, (M18), and this girl, have been pretty good friends for the past 3 years. I liked her on and off, and I recently found out from her, that she also liked me on and off throughout the time as well. The timing just never lined up. 

However, this year, something changed for me, and I realized I REALLY like her, and she feels really different then any other crush or attraction I've had to someone before.

Thing is, she got a boyfriend last year, and while me and her have become the closest we ever have this year, nothing will happen between us because of that, obviously. 

The situation is that 1, she knows I like her right now, and 2, she continues to talk to me ALL the time. While she didnt shut me down when she inevitably found out I liked her, it was clear she didnt want to change anything in our relationship. She also told me that she felt I was a friend she wanted to keep for the rest of her life. 

Now that probably means that I need to move on and carry on with life, but it is so so hard to. I cant help thinking about how awesome she is, and how perfect she is for me. But that just makes me feel horrible about the way things are.

So I guess, if anybody bothers to read this, my question would be, what do I do? Do i continue progressing in our ""friendship"", even though it hurts me knowing we arent more? And if I need to break myself off and move on, how do I do it? It seems so complicated and hard :/",17Dec2019,1

During the time I was doing well in my classes, my parents were out of the country and I was able to freely do what I wanted to do such as study with friends, go to tutoring sessions, and sleep over to take exams the next day.  I wasn’t at home much since the commute from my university is about 50 mins, so I mostly just stayed over since I had a lot of 9 am classes. 
But recently as the term ended my parents came back and told me that I can’t do what I am doing anymore. They told me that if I kept acting this way , I would be in big trouble. I’m frustrated because my parents just want me to work for them since they own a business, I am just scared that they will stop paying for my tuition and I can’t afford to attend this university by just paying for it myself.  I never really wanted to go to this university since it was my most expensive option but my parents said they would pay for it, if I went. 
I don’t know what to do anymore since they are basically forcing me to be a certain way. Which also takes a huge toll on my mental health, since my parents are toxic and they always tend to neglect me.",17Dec2019,1

101,"Alright so my close friend (B) is having a party and my other good friend (A) is coming along with a bunch of other popular girls. So I’m 14 and in 8th grade. One of the girls they’re inviting Is not a very good 8th grade. She juuls, smokes, drinks alcohol, has sex with 18 yr olds, etc... we‘ll call her (F) And she’s being invited. Now B and A are very close friends. They went behind my back without me knowing and they bribed F to give me head for alcohol. Now why  they did this I have no idea and I don’t really condone this, but today at school she told her friends about it and now I feel as if people will hate me as I’m being viewed as ”The guy that bribed a girl to give him head in eigth grade” when really I’m stuck in a situation that I don’t know how to get out of.

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",17Dec2019,1
103,"In the past year I've had two encounters with strangers that have me wondering if I'm \*that\* rude/inconsiderate person or if it was an overreaction on their part(s), or maybe both.  I get a lot of social anxiety when I have these sorts of interactions with people, and I mull over the situation forever and get really down on myself so I wanted to ask you all to see how much of it was my/their fault and thus nail down how I should adjust my behavior (stay the same, be less rude, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

In the first one, I was at a concert with some friends.  We were in the crowd when I went to the bathroom and came back.  As I came back, I had to wedge my way back in since it was getting pretty packed (the headliner hadn't yet come on), and as I was squeezing by people I was either saying ""excuse me's"" or just angling my body through tight spaces.  I finally got to my friends and there was some space to their side so I slid in.  After a moment of standing there I started hearing an angry voice from a couple feet (3-5 feet) behind me along the lines of ""I can't believe this girl is just going to slide in right in front of us like we haven't been here this entire time"", ""she's blocking the view"", ""honestly, some people are terrible""--things along those lines.  I turned around because I had figured the group of ladies was talking about me and when I apologized and shifted over, they huffed and said something along the lines of ""finally"".  Part of me thinks that they were just being petty/rude about it given that (1) the floor was sloped and they were taller than me so they had more than a few inches to see over me, (2) one of the ladies ended up squeezing herself in front of me for the rest of the show with her camera up the entire time, and (3) that they could have tapped me to let me know instead of talking loudly until I heard.  But I also understand that I probably should have checked behind me first before I came to a stop.   
 I'm just torn on if I was actually super rude or if they were the rude ones about it (or maybe both) so I can figure out how much to fret over it / change my behavior!

&amp;#x200B;

The second time I was at a club and I was heading to the bathroom.  My friend was in front of me and as we were walking we paused to figure out a path.  As we paused, some guy in front of us seemed to notice and moved forward to give us space so we went by him.   On our way back from the bathroom though, his girlfriend started gesturing angrily at us and then told me that we should have at least said excuse me and that we had been really rude.  I said apologized for not noticing but then my friend just pushed me along.  

&amp;#x200B;

In both instances I honestly didn't think much about what I was doing so I definitely could have been more considerate, but at the same time I have definitely been on the opposite side of interactions like that (having people step in front of me at a show or moving aside in a packed club to let people through) and have just gone about my day afterwards since it's such a common occurrence at those places.  What do you all think?",17Dec2019,1
104,"I (f 21) will graduate next year. I already have a job that I will continue working at after my degree, and I've been with my boyfriend (21) for a year now. We're as serious as exchanging rings at some point in the future and growing old together. I may be too young and naive to say this but I do believe it. I want this with him.
So, I'm quite of an overthinker. And I'm overthinking about the future. The more I introspect, the more I see myself in certain situations, the more I feel like I will never be able to handle a family life, or be responsible. Culturally, I come from a society where females are expected to know and be skilled at such stuff and I am not.
I don't know what to do and I'm just scared all the time because I keep screwing up all the time and I'm so afraid he'll get tired of me and leave. Moreover, my response to me making a mistake is an extremity in itself, I hold myself accountable to a high degree and be really mean to myself as punishment.
I just wish I knew how to stop being the way I am and be more adaptable, be someone who meets expectations and knows how to deal with stuff.",17Dec2019,1
105,"So I’m a young adult woman. My boobs have been kinda saggy for as long as I can remember, since my breasts came in, basically. My nipples don’t totally point downward, but they’re certainly not perky. The only thing I can think of is that I’m a little overweight, but I’m on a weight loss journey. Once I lose some weight &amp; my boobs lost some weight, do you think my nipples will start pointing upward?  I don’t want a breast lift to be my only option. For reference, my boobs are pretty big, not enormous, but pretty big. Could this also be the cause? My boobs are about a DD-DDD. But I’ve seen plenty of girls with really big boobs and their nipples are still perky.",17Dec2019,1
106,"I am 20 and have been a volunteer firefighter for about 3 or 4 years in the northeast. Most members are men about 30-60. 

A lot of their jokes revolve around homophobic/sexist remarks. ""Wow, almost looks like a woman did that!"" ""Oh, I bet you liked looking at my ass"" ""Oh, I bet you like sausages in your mouth"" ""Nice pink pants, better turn around and bend over!"".

We are getting a new member; she is in a relationship with one of the existing members. Both are mid-late 20s. Tonight was one of the first times I've seen her in the station, and as our truck was pulling in, the driver says ""And look, I have a cute girl in my mirror"". He is 30 years older than her. She is in a relationship with the Captain's son, so everyone is clearly aware of who she is.

A lot of the guys, including officers, make nasty comments about the few female members we do have. ""This sexual harassment training is a joke, who would harass [female member] anyway"" ""Of course the women make up the sexual harassment committee!"".

107,"Today I saw a post on LinkedIn about how someone dropped out of college because they were getting all C's and now they run a multi million dollar company. 

I made a comment along the lines of ""so everyone should drop out of college and starting selling chicken?"" (The selling chicken is because the company he created is a chicken company) 

We work in an office that is a large team but broken off into smaller teams. One of my co-workers on another smaller team took a screen shot of the post and my comment together and sent an email to just 4 people on his direct team with the caption ""this is how you should use LinkedIn, according to Alwaysbesaving"" 

Two of the people he sent it to are close friends to me and one of them I have known for much longer than the co-worker who sent the email. He called me over and showed me the email.

I was a bit confused that he was trying to make me the butt of a joke that made no sense. And I wouldn't have minded the joke if I was included in the email. I am here trying to understand what he meant, should I confront him about it or let it go?",17Dec2019,1

109,"We have been dating for 5 months and had made plans for the holidays and future dates so this came as shock to me. When I asked why she wanted to break up she said it was because of her bad mental health and because her friends didn’t want her dating me. She told me she wanted to isolate herself but that sounds like the opposite of what you would want to do, the whole thing was very confusing and was over text, I at least wanted to call because it makes things easier. I was never told she went through mental periods of isolation. She didn't want me to worry for her , but how am I supposed to not worry about her and be there to support her. I wanted to take a break at most but she didn't want me to wait on her, but I was willing because I care for her.

I was very open and honest in the relationship her and shared information about my family that maybe shouldn’t have. I told her about my brother who was 19yrs old and talking to a 16 yr old and told her about how weird it was and how I’ve been trying to stop him from doing anything and just leave the girl alone. She helped me through the problem but one day let her friends borrow her phone and they saw the messages about my situation. They then hated her for dating me because I was somehow “enabling a pedophile”. I would hate to be seen as someone doing that but he's my brother and the whole situation is tough for me, I've tried to talk sense into him about it and ended the whole things they had but her friends still talked about me like that and did it all behind my back. I don't know why they can't differentiate me between him and me because we are polar opposites, and just because he did something like that doesn't mean I'm somehow responsible, it makes no sense and I'm embarrassed about it all.

Her “close friends” then blocked her and me, and stopped talking to her because of me. I felt incredibly guilty about having interfered with her friendships but can’t also help but feel as though her friends are toxic and are having a negative effect on her. I would hate to see someone I love go through that but as of now it looks like she chose her friends over me. I wanted to at least keep in touch with her because I genuinely worried for her and also care about her even as a friend. She told me that that might not even possible, and it feels like she's only saying that because of her ""friends"". I now don’t know how I should feel about this and if this girl really loved me. If I was in her situation I would've defended my name and told the friends they're wrong, but maybe she didn't have the courage to or something else. At the end of the day I want whats best for her but I don’t feel like her friend group is a good place either and seems toxic :/ .I'm going to talk to her in a few weeks just to ask how things are going but nothing else. Should I mention anything?what do I do? If anything?",17Dec2019,1
111,"so recently over the past few months, i closed a very toxic chapter of my life. i sought help through therapy &amp; got on medication for the trauma i was left with. the medication i was put on has caused me to gain a few pounds, &amp; gaining weight is something i very much run away from due to my recent-ish past &amp; how i was treated for my weight. i hate that my medication is causing this side affect since it’s working out very well for me (finding a medication that works for me is like finding a needle in a haystack). so i’ve lowered my doses without even consulting with my doctor because it seems she takes months to get in touch with. lowering my doses is causing me to get ZERO sleep at night because my mind will not stop racing. anyways, i see pounds &amp; pounds added onto my body daily though no one else seems to think so. when i eat, i feel very nauseous &amp; it takes all of me not to throw up what i’ve just eaten; this has been ongoing. i love food, i always have; but i’ve always done very well with controlling my portions &amp; keeping a close eye on my fitness. i’ve lost so much confidence in just a week alone, i don’t like to leave the house anymore. i’ve restricted my eating more than i should. i’m aware that depriving myself of meals won’t cause me to lose weight or maintain where i’m at now, but it’s almost impossible to stomach what i’ve eaten when i do eat so i refrain from eating much at all. i’m developing all the signs of a eating disorder, &amp; i don’t want to go that route. i don’t want to stop my medication all together because of how much it does help with my trauma. i guess i’m asking for advice on how to control the psychological path that leads me to believe i’ve gained 6 lbs over night, or the path that leads me to believe that i should not eat. i hope not to get negative feedback on this, i feel very mentally weak as it is. &amp; yes, i have gotten an appointment with my doctor to speak on this but it is not until February. tl;dr i believe i’m gaining mass amounts over night &amp; it’s hard to stomach food even when i’m starving.",17Dec2019,1

I struggle to find gifts for them and when I have gifted in the past I know it doesn't measure up to anything they are able to gift one another. They like to brag about the material wealth and I am not in the same economic bracket as a teacher living on teacher salary. I feel like I really try to give meaningful gifts but they are not gifts that anyone likes and it is later somehow pointed out to me. Last year I made gifts and it was as if I brought garbage to their gathering. It makes me feel so badly and like I don't really want to be there because it doesn't feel like holiday spirit, it just feels like a crappy day of keeping up with the Joneses. Comments made make me feel judged too, like looked down upon because I can't afford what they can . It would be better without gifts honestly but they would never do that. What are some good gifts for people who already have everything and do not really value cheap things that I can afford on my salary?

118,"Our class average was 52%. I got 100%, but I cheated on the last two questions of the quiz. Here’s what happened: Went to math class, took the quiz, there was not enough time to finish, then we went to fourth period, where I asked my friend how to do the last two questions that I was completely stuck on. She told me how to do it. I went back to finish the test at lunch hour and I took her advice and got 100% because of those last two questions that were worth 4 marks. Had I not asked for her help, I would’ve gotten somewhere from 50 to 70%. And the worst part of this all is that my friend got a lower test score than me because of a little mistake in her other questions, even though she is much more skilled at math than me. And now I feel really bad because the rest of my classmates have to take another quiz if they want a higher mark and are forced to do math homework because they got a lower score than me. Now I feel really bad and idk how to fix this. I can’t just go up to my teacher and say “Hey I cheated” yknow?? Because she is just not an understanding teacher.

121,"So my relationship with my older brother has fallen apart. To start, about eight years ago we were in college together. A friend of his showed interest in me and we hung out once. We drank and I wasn't able to drive home. I was clear that I wanted to sober up and then drive home. He said that I could spend the night (in his dorm) and then tried to take advantage of me, to the point I had the push him off of me. He got angry and left. I later heard from a dorm mate that he said some nasty things about me, that he didn't like me personally and he just wanted to ""use me and lose me."" I was so angry I stole his football tickets on his desk and threw them away. I mention this because when my brother found out about this he was mad AT ME. Blamed me and obviously I felt humiliated. He was more concerned about his relationship with his friend than me. Never asked me if I was ok, just wanted to know if I took his friend's tickets. It's worth mentioning this friend is not a close friend of his. At this point I believe they've known each other for 1-2 years.

Fast forward six years, my brother is getting married. His wedding party doesn't approve my date, so they deny me a plus one. This is someone they've never met. But my brother invited his friend that tried to take advantage of me. So I had to deal with that alone.

Also, we live in different states. Over the years I have made the effort to visit him. I believe I've traveled four times and I've planned most of my trips to see him. He has not once visited me. 

I don't understand why he treats me so poorly. I don't know how to address this because he never listens to me. I feel I need somebody else's words because mine are always rejected.

127,"Ok guys so I'm in a tough situation, I've asked multiple people for advice and everyone says the same thing. 'Do what makes you happy'. Some background, I live in a city where I recently quit my job. I started looking for other jobs and so I just started grinding really hard putting out applications. I recieved multiple replies from people wanting to interview me. One place is in Florida which is a 15 hour drive from where I live. They off  a decent wage, almost what I could be getting from other places. The place in which I'm residing and where my Camper is {where I live} is having a hiring process in January 14th. I told the place in Florida this and they are totally cool if I want to wait another month to do orientation but they stated that they are going to give me 3k less of a sign on bonus. In FL it would be hard for me to find a place to park my camper and live but they have a lot of rooms for cheap from what it looks like on C list. And my pops live here so i can crash at his place for a month while i find a place. and I can store my camper for 60$ over here in the meantime. So my dad is leaving to go up north and I have two cars, So i was thinking maybe I should go with him north so I can get my truck and camper and bring it down so I have all my stuff in one place so I can go ahead and take this job and move on with my life lol. I have a few potential offers but this company in FL is offering a decent chunk of change and they're being the most up front and punctual with the Hiring. Everyone else is govt jobs so they want to wait until the new year to start interviews, including the place where I live. What would you guys do if you were in my shoes. I could potentially work in a children hospital which I have never done. I could continue interviewing, or I could just move on with my life and take this job. I really am distraught looking for an answer, but thats what big life decisions will do to you. As much as I'd love to stay where I'm parked now because I'm setup at a friends house and have things figured out there, I need to make a decision before this Thursday or else I'm going  to make life more difficult.",17Dec2019,1
128,"This is probably a bit of an odd one.  
The long and short of it is that my grandmother ruined my family. To grossly over-simply, instead of helping my mentally ill mother take care of me and my two brothers while my dad was out of town she took advantage of my mother's vulnerable state to convince her to leave my father because he was ""abusive."" They flew back to New England (from the South West) 2 weeks before my father came home. She didn't take us boys with her. My grandmother just wanted her baby back home. Consequences be damned.  


Let me be 100% clear, I *do not* blame my mother for what happened. She wasn't in a great spot mentally, and wasn't really able to make her own decisions.  


My father ended up trying to raise us boys for about a year before he couldn't manage. He married a work friend who was also recently divorced, but she was never much of a mother to the kids who weren't hers. The lack of a real mother figure (and presence of a mother who didn't give a shit) left me and my brothers a little broken. The first time I ever really experienced what it was like to have a mother was with my girlfriend's mother, who's a saint. I still have a lot that I'm working out about the whole thing.  


I look back and all I see is the damage this woman caused and definitely don't want to visit her grave. The trouble is that my family doesn't even know about my feelings toward my grandmother. In fact, they all almost worship her as the perfect mother, going so far as to make an annual event out of visiting her grave every Christmas. They are being *very* pushy about me going, but I don't want to make waves this year. My girlfriend will be meeting these relatives for the first time, and I'd rather not cause more drama than will already be there. I've told them no, but they keep insisting.  


I'm just at a loss at how to handle this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",17Dec2019,1

148,"It’s bit long, so please bare with me. 
My anger issues began when I was 11. I live in the US but my parents are from a conservative Third World country with a very traditional mindsets. My mother came here when she was quite young, around the age of 18. But my dad came here and his 30s. When I was 11 years old my dad threatened me with marrying me off for the first time. He came in my room and said “if you ever have a boyfriend, I will take you straight back to my country and have you married no matter your age.” I remember in that moment looking at my feet as he left the room and in that age all I could think was, “I’m just a kid I don’t even like boys like that.” 
That’s when the marriage threats first began. I started to get depression from that age, my therapist tells me it’s environmental depression but I don’t care anymore. 
When I was 13 my grandma tried to get me engaged to my 30-year-old cousin at the time. My mom stopped it because she knew I was way too young, but even so, all I could think was why do I have to deal with is no one else around me has too, I want a normal life. 
It was around this time when I first started cutting myself. It was the only way I knew how to help myself because I was angry all the time I had so much emotion that I didn’t know how to handle, I still don’t. Then threats to marry me off right after high school started. I wanted high school to last forever because I was so scared to graduate, I didn’t want to go through the same thing my mom went through, she was raped on her wedding night but won’t acknowledge that it was raped because she said it’s normal there.
My dad‘s friends told him that “your new wife will fight and won’t let you touch her the first night she’ll want to get to know you, just force her.“ I really don’t want that for me. 
But that’s a whole other thing I’m sorry. Once I graduated high school my dad saw that a lot of people were letting their daughters get degrees so that they can marry off their daughter to someone wealthy because the wealthy family was wanted an educated girl who can also bring in some money.
There’s just so many more other instances, honestly I don’t even feel like going through them because I’m like crying as I’m writing this and is just making more money more and more sad. Yesterday night I got sick of it and I told my dad that I would run away and be with whomever I wanted and live my life the way I wanted because it’s my life, and he started giving me death threats again. He said that money can buy anything, and bye hitmen as well so I’ll have you dead before you can even have kids. I argued with my mom today as well. I’m just so angry like I used to be when I was younger, so frustrated, I have a plan on how to escape, just have to be patient but my patience is wearing thin.
I had stopped cutting at the age of 15 but I just broke my streak two months ago, I felt so guilty I stopped again. 
My therapist said that it’s because I’m not giving in to the role that many other girls in my position do. I’m fighting against it and it’s taking my energy. She said it means that I’m strong to be fighting a mental war like this, but I just don’t see it. 
She tells me that I’m way too hard on myself and need to give myself more credit, but I’m at the point where I’m thinking about ending it because I don’t wanna fight anymore. I’m so frustrated, I’m so angry. I’m so done.

Here's the thing: I can't get therapy because my parents won't let me (I'm a minor). And yes, I have asked many times over the past 3 years. Yes, we can afford it, and yes, we have time. They've given me a number of excuses that I can't remember, but none of them held any substance. Whenever I ask, they end up upsetting me through screaming or mocking me. 

I don't want to put all of my problems onto my friends, I don't want to talk to my family, and I *really* dont want to talk to an another adult that isn't qualified. I've talked to one adult, and they told me to get therapy because they didn't know how to respond, which I can't blame them for.

School counselors are also off the list since I'd eventually have to bring up the fact that I was sexually assaulted by someone that attends the same school. There's also the fact that they're not really meant for that and more for planning out academics, and that I've had bad experiences with counselors in the past. 

I'm sorry if it sounds like I've built up a bunch of walls of why I can't get help and complaining about it, but I would like some ideas here.

Most girls like will say no to me in my childhood days and when i say why
They responded"" that thing on your face""
So time went by i started to see a pattern
out of all that time i had sex with none of them that i actually went out with (but i was still young so yeah) 
When i was 12 to 15 years old i had my fair shares of girlfriend but it was all bullshit.
1.My first girlfriend dated me cause people forced me
2.Second girlfriend felt bad to say no she give me a chance out of pity 
3.Thrid I didnt really liked her but i still asked her out broke up days later
4. The fourth one went out with me based on a bet so i was upset 
5.i when i was a fresh in high school and 8th grader and i dated,we made out in her house it was the best time of my life until her dad came in and start yelling at us and we broke up the next day because she didnt want to see me

Growin up
At age 16 to 17 most of my ex-girlfriend always seems to like my brothers or my friends only
they would have sex with my of one friends.
At the time me and a girl from my building liked each we went on a valentine date and in the end she went for my friend Luis.He kept a secret that he sex with her on my bed when i was outside,my brother let him in my home when she was there and he was hooking them both up.Too bad i found he banged her when i friend moved to Pennsylvania the details were disgustin that was told by my other friend,that when luis finish with her he Jizzed on my bed and pilliow on top of her.
I wanted to kill myslef,my other ex banged my brothers friends a dominican short white girl from there i never want to talk to her again.

I when was 20 years old there was one girl that liked me but we randomly stop texting each other she kept stooding me up so i gave up.
After that i dont want nothing to do with girls.
In my mind Women are foul species that goes for perfect guys that hits them and treat them like trash. Age 16 to Now 28 and im still single i hate females mind games,i wasnt gonna waste my time being out there looking like a fool,now my mind is fucked up,i lost my virginty at 25 in Vegas from a drunk girl because thats the best i can do.I Masturbate 3 to 4 times a day to keep my mind out of the real world of messed up women and it took a bad toll on me and my life.Everywhere i see in Instagram i see my ex girlfriends with a husband,a child,a new life and thats something i always wanted.

Now the messed part of my story
 i was talking to a girl shes 21 when i was 25 i thought there was something between us she said i was cute and i was hesitant because my screwed up past.Days after i was gonna tell her how i feel and then that same day My brother and his girlfriend was fighting because he cheat on her with the 21 years old girl i was talking too and my heart stopped.My brother is 32 and he slept with her?!At that point i was like screw it no point of living.My brother he 32 and has a girlfriend and have a kids together and after everything they get back together but he still bangs the 21 year old girl on the low while im in the house.Like come on when he was 22 that means she was 11 that age gap is too far.

Now the main part topic for you guys to judge me and please dont look at me as a evil person for what im about to tell you.
Warning disturbing Topic....................................
After Drinking alot and being depressed about single life and what will be my future.I was doing
 alot of drugs.When i was high and drunk One of my friends little brother who was age 11 to 13 logged in to his Instagram in my tablet .He went home and never logged out and when i was gonna log him i saw 2 girls in bikini one was 13 and the other was 12 and i started getting a erection and in my head i was like 'well my brother likes to fuck girls who are 13 years younger than him'.
So me all angry thinkin what he did i was like screw it.I dropped my pants next thing i know im masturbating to a 12 and 13 years old girls after that night my head was all messed up because i really enjoy what i did.
Ever since then i havent the same i cant seem to enjoy porn,and have thought of girls my age.
Mature girls are dumb,evil, and likes guys with only a fast cars,muscles,and love getting punched by their mans
In my state of mind girls my age want nothing to do with me so i hold out grudges.So i started masturbating to girl 12 to 16 and from there it never stop.
And 27 years old me use to think probably if i had real girlfriends i wouldnt have the thought to do this since the last girlfriend i had were 15 or 16 when i was 16 was my last road of relationship.My brain hormones is struck on the minor girls ages of 12 to 15 to my attraction.Since my last girlfriend that was age 15 thats the high i would go for attraction toward a minor and age 12 would be lowest.
I have been masurbating to young girl for 2 years and i feel no remorse and the feeling is good.And i wish i felt remorse but im too far gone im getting out of control as i get older im still attracted to the age of Pre-teens and Teenagers and those were the ages of when i had a girlfriend so it never felt wrong because i  never had an adult girlfriend my age since i been single for 12 years.
12 years single
Im 28 years olds
I masturbate to young girls 3 to 4 times a day
I blame my friends,every female in my life,my brother and myslef the most.
What should i do ? 
And the way i look at it is Since my brother has no remorse banging someone 12 year younger than him.Why should i feel any different towards masturbating to Pre-teens and Teens

My biggest issue is school, I find it really hard to just sit still and listen to the teacher without feeling the need to look out the window or draw on the side of my paper. I lose papers and do horrible on tests. It honestly makes me feel stupid because of it. I’ve told my parents this and they completely ignored me. Saying how I’m just not trying hard enough despite the fact that I try my best to study or focus when it just doesn’t make sense. 

I’m too scared to go to a school councilor, my mom as already laughed at me for asking for help on school related things. I don’t want to go to another person for help with the fear that they won’t take me seriously. 

I’ve asked my parents for a therapist because I haven’t been feeling like myself recently. Reddit cheers me up though so I guess that’s cool. Anyway, my parents have called me retarded for bringing up anything related to me having issues. So getting a therapist probably won’t happen. 

Help:
Whenever I bring up the topic of me needing possible mental help, my parents either yell at me saying that I’m a retarded attention seeker, or guilt trip me into thinking that I’m overrating. 

They say how they’ve done everything to help me when they haven’t. All they’ve done is laugh at me. My parents yell that I never tell them my problems and how I don’t appreciate them, when I try to tell them my problems at least once a week, but they don’t listen. 

I need advice on how I can bring up things that bother me without my parents yelling at me and calling me an attention seeker.

168,"( sorry, this is my first post; forgive me if my grammar is off. )
Anyways, I’ve have been having some problems: my ex hates me, my crush likes but dislikes me, and overall everyone seems to hate me. The reason I say this is because my ex is one of my crush’s friends and I’ve been hearing from my crush ( we are extremely close friends) that everyday she’s been talking about me behind my back. Every.Single.Day. My crush has been saying this to me for the past month and honestly I believed her. Not because I like her, but because she has PROOF of it. I have seen snaps from my ex to my crush talking about me, how she regrets ever seeing me and how my crush shouldn’t be hanging out with me. not to mention also that SHE HAS A NEW BOYFRIEND. She has shown everything to me and that’s how I know we are really close, but today I was reconsidering everything about her. 

For some reason this morning I seemed to have gotten tired of the drama and snapped. I guess it was too much for me to handle, me always trying to be a nurturer to everyone. I was at my house with my homeboy and it seems she was texting him about me too. My homeboy didn’t even tell me anything until today when a notification popped up on his phone and I saw a snap from her. I was tired and asked him if I could send her a quick message since my phone was  lost at the moment. I sent this, “ hope it goes well with Peter.” Of course she didn’t know who told him so she asked him who told him about this “supposedly” Peter. I sent back, “ So you’re telling me you “supposedly” didn’t tell your gossip group about this new ‘boyfriend’ you have? Who do you think told me? Maybe ( I won’t say names so I’ll put anonymous names) Bella, or ( my crush) maybe Meghan told me? Yeah, you choose. And, btw, good luck with Peter. He’ll need it.” 

A few minutes later my phone vibrates and I check it. “ Can you plz stop bullying her?” My crush says. What? She’s been bullying me since we’ve broken up, she deserves better or something? So I wrote, “ she’s deserves to be treated like a queen while I get treated like trash? I’m tired of trying to make everyone feel at ease, give them the world, and always get a slap on the face afterwards. Im tired of feeling like trash while I make everyone feel like Kings  and queens. I really thought you understood and I get it, everyone has different perspectives, but I don’t get why you are still friends when they treat me AND you like we’re nobodies ( forgot to mention, the group doesn’t  like my crush). At this point I’m not even thinking about dating her because of how confused I am with her. I then write, “ I understand this is harsh, but you would protect people who don’t like you, versus the people who are excited to see you everyday, like you for who you are, care about you, and love to spend amounts of time with you more than I would with others? I just don’t get it, and sorry, I’m just so tired of this.” 

( I’ll cut it short and get to the point) So we argued for like ten minutes and eventually made up. She says she is going to end the friendship with my ex tomorrow but I don’t want her to if she doesn’t want to. If she ends it, we could probably get together, but once again I am a nurturer, I want what’s best for her, and I don’t want to force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do. If we have to be friends, I guess we have to be, and being friends with her would still be the best thing ever, dating or not, hands down. 

What should I tell her to do? Should I let her or should I tell her not to? Should I try to become more than friends or not right now? I have so many questions, so some advice would help.",17Dec2019,1
169,"Sorry for bad english it is not my first language and my phone is acting a little weird lately.

As the title say I’ve know since sunday : I (M18) was cooking while she was in the garden watching Instagram or what not (it was an app with the stories format) until in on of the stories someone says (and loud enough for me to hear) 
« (SisterName) did something with an older guy » and then she shut the volume down
 Now, we live in a spanish talking country and so to be more precise with yall  the girl in the story said something that couldnt tell what she did and what age was the guy. So I started having doubts since she went to a party the day before. (My parents allow her to go to parties, even if I a male was not allowed to go out until being 15 yo)

I decided to not being paranoid and to ignore it. 

Now, 30 minutes ago I was going to my room after coming back for the day and heard her on the phone with some friends of her and I (might) have heard that one of her friends say that she blowed a guy (i’m not sure)
still I’m 100% sure that then she says it was a 19 yo guy.
Now I’m almost sure that something happened, again I might have heard wrong so I decide to aproach the room where she was enter in the most normal do something and say something and get out, when I got in she shut up and removed  the speaker mode  from her phone.
Asked how was my day and how was my medical check today. I awnsered “ah yeah it was all right. I even got the chance to do something with and older guy today” 
The look she gave me confirmed all of my doubts, And instead of trying to make as she didnt understood she just run to my (16M) brother room and asked “quietly” if he had told me...

Not only she confirmed it verbally but besides it my brother also know about it and judge to not to say anything.

Now, yes its her body and what not but from what I know this shit right here is illegal and beside she is not even old enough to be legally consentant...

181,"Greetings everyone,

My wife recently picked up some picture frames from Walmart using the app. Its pretty cool you dont even need to walk more than 10 feet once you get out of your car. Once my wife gets home she starts unpacking her items(they come in cardboard boxes) and suddenly she finds a Xbox One S that we didnt pay for. It was a mistake on Walmarts end. I have no issue whatsover with Walmart loosing 300 bucks for loosing an Xbox my only issue would be if the person who manages the orders financial situation. Does anyone have any experience here loosing inventory while working? Does it get docked from your pay? Does it usually result in termination? If it does i would happily have my wife bring it back. Or is it one of those situations that if you bring it back the Xbox much more people get involved and ultimately the person responsible will be reprimanded? 

Any responses negative or positive are welcomed! Thank You in Advance.

183,"I go to college out of state in NYC. I’m a junior, so this coming summer is my last chance to do absolutely nothing and enjoy being with family before I graduate next year and have to start working a full time job immediately. Back home across the country, I have a 14 year old brother who I’m great buddies with. 

I feel like this is my last chance at being with him as a young childish buddy, and my last chance before I’m sucked into working the rest of my life. I’ve worked full time every summer since I started college, so this would be a strange move in my career to just willingly deny internships just for the sake of chilling all summer. 

To be more specific, I’m an artist. My career has really been taking off lately, in fact last summer I was making more money than I ever saw in my whole life working as a metal technician for a sculpture studio... I’ve been looking at jobs in LA lately and it’s tempting to just go work there because I do enjoy my work...

187,"""You won't ever be happy, no matter where you go."" Those were the burning words of my mother, after sitting down with her one night and talking about work. It cut deep....And made me wonder if it was really just me?

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory on me and where I am now:

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated a two years ago from Uni and the moment I did, I realized that I didn't know the world or workforce to know what I would be happy with. So I went on the job hunt to hope something would relatively fit with my background and what I knew how to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first official job was in Recruitment. It was an interesting job, it taught me a lot about the medical industry in that sense as well as different medical disorders and the type of treatment that was out there for people. I definitely would take that job as a primary experience all over again if I had the choice. I stayed there for about a year and a half... Why didn't I stay longer? My manager, or course. Someone that haunted me day in and day out. Someone that hounded me to do more and more for the company and yet publicly shamed me in front of my team members for not doing enough. Someone that never took their team's side no matter the abuse and maltreatment we faced from the other departments. Someone that very clearly blocked me from moving forward into any other department in the company despite every manager respecting my dedication and work, or so they eagerly told me. Someone that made us stay late over and over again to obtain patients, no matter the costs or legality behind it, threatening us with our jobs. Someone that even threatened downsizing our department should we not make our quotas, at every. Single. Meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

That someone, I no longer wanted to work under. To have crawling into my emails and messenger. To have stopping me in the halls to speak to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I moved on. I went with a start-up company working with elderly people. Of course, like many, I feel the universe has a cruel sense of humor. Guess who also made their way to that company. Yup, the manager. They were there... all over again. It was like some sick joke, seeing them again. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I hoped... I hoped for a change. I believed, foolishly believed, that a change in environment would surely remedy the mistakes of the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything, it was worse... Now I know longer had several team members to support and talk to about what was clearly happening. Now, that same abuse was happening more silently, behind the scenes. And it only got worse when that seed was sown and the rest of management slowly followed suit. 

&amp;#x200B;

One final threat over the phone of ""it being my best interest to listen to authority,"" sent me spiraling. Sent me overboard. I couldn't take it. Not this again. Not this ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left soon after, not but 5 months in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this place.. another start-up that had masqueraded as a company that had been running for several years. Experiencing incredibly rapid growth and growing pains at a level no one has ever seen before, even the most seasoned of workers. It was difficult, at the beginning, acclimated to this environment, the expectations for project deadlines, and constant miscommunication or even lack thereof, each individual essentially having to figure out on their own. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I made it thus far, four months shy of a year... I proved myself as a vital asset and even friend to many here. But I'm exhausted of the constant twists and turns, the constant orders, change of those orders, and then original orders. The back and forth and missing bits of communication. The lack of communication at times. The taking ownership of projects that involve more than just me to do so. Taking the lead over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the night...quietly knowing this is not what I want but not knowing anything else to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'll never be happy right? Even if I change? Is it just me then? Is this just the way things are and I haven't finished growing yet?

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know anymore...",17Dec2019,1
188,"so i was broken up with about a month ago. nothing ugly or personal- his parents are super homophobic and split us apart. this also means they’ve forced him to cut off all communication with me, including texting, dm, snapchat, hanging out, etc. we’re both in high school, so we see each other in the hallway very occasionally, and it’s nothing more than a smile and wave. 
this really really sucks if that’s not obvious. we were insanely happy together. damn near perfect. he and i had such a strong bond that was blown apart, abiding by his parents’ rule out of the sheer fear of them striking down on him even harder. 
i’ve started to notice him become more and more distant. not just to me, other people have said they’ve noticed too. he deals with a good amount of depression and anxiety as it is, not including the setbacks he’s facing because of his parents. 
i haven’t talked to him in a long time. even just general conversation. i think the last time we’ve sat down and talked was two weeks ago, and it was only for ten minutes. i really miss him, but i don’t want to bother him. i don’t know if he wants to completely move on and forget about what we had or if he still wants me around. 
i wrote him two letters over the course of this month, but he never replied to any of them. i didn’t expect him to, but having a response to some questions i had would have been nice. in both of them, i made sure to highlight the fact that i’m always going to be there for him no matter what, and he can always rely on me.
i honestly don’t care if we go back to having a relationship. it would be wonderful- i miss it with everything i have in me. i just want to be in his life and offer him some sort of stability.

It’s the same girl from my most recent posts if you’d like more background.

Long story short, we used to work together until she left.  Before she left, I asked her out but she “wasn’t looking to date” aka rejection.  After she left I went to church with her once, but after that we only occasionally replied to each other’s stories on IG.  One week we got the talking and she invited me to her  birthday get together (only like 8 people).  Afterwards she texted me and said “Thanks sooo much for coming!! I’ve missed you and hope to hang again soon!”.

Since she said she wanted to hang out sometime, Saturday I texted her and asked if she wanted to go to a Christmas themed amusement park (where we used to work together).  I said “Hey 👋 Are you busy next weekend? If not wanna go to (park name)?”  She replied “YES”, then “What day?” I said “Friday or Saturday?”.  She didn’t text back for a couple hours, then she said “Let me check my calendar”.  That was at about midnight.  I know she likes to plan out her days, cause a while ago she showed me her calendar/planner.

She didn’t text me yesterday, but I do know that she was busy with church and work.  But, she watched my story/posted to hers today.  How long should I wait for a response?  When should I remind her and ask if she still wants to go, if at all?  I’ve never planned a hang out with a friend before.  Also, she has anxiety, so think that may have something to do with the way she’s acting?

Thanks!

I’m in the Yucatan. Alone. I know, not smart. But I’ve traveled alone before and I was fine. But now my phone is no longer charging. Idk If it’s the phone or the charger.

194,"So she basically knows I have a crush on her, found me cute attractive, but still doesn’t see me as physically her type. Is it even possible to know someone is interested in you find them cute, attractive, but they still not be physically your type? 

Not physically being her type, wouldn’t that mean she isn’t attracted to my appearance at all? So it doesn’t make sense. Unless what is meant is that she basically found me attractive in knowing I may like her, but not attractive enough to date? Which is why I’m not physically her type?

I understand I’m also shy and the “less popular guy” so that is also a reason for why she wouldn’t cross the line or a boundary she would be willing to cross, to be interested in going out with me, someone different, to what she normally would date. And go out with. 

So In summary I’m not the type of guy she would go for based on being shy less popular etc, and even though knowing I like her, makes her find me cute, she still doesn’t find me physically her type which is the bit I can’t understand.

I’m young, dumb, so this may seem like a simple answer, but your help could be very needed to give me clarity and make me understand it.

I am not seeing an increase in my grades but because of the stress I put on myself, I practically live off of my grades and therefore cannot help but study.

I know many people may say to drop down on my classes but I do not feel this is an issue. I just want to know if anyone out there experiences this same issue and has experience in one of these three topics:

1. Stressing when there is no work to be done because of a feeling that there is incomplete work

2. Feeling that studying is getting you nowhere because you feel experienced in content, yet still know the consequences of possible failure. This causes excessive studying that feels like a waste of time because you feel that you are not learning anything new

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going very well until around a month ago

She suddenly became very subtracted, she didn't want to talk as much or she would duck and weave me. On some days it would be brilliant but on most other days it was hard. 

This was long before she ever said she had depression, so to someone who doesn't know you have depression, it felt like I was losing her. Her affection levels dropped dramatically too. So i felt as though I was losing her. I do have anxiety but I usually control it very well but of-course, when someone changes drastically, my anxiety flared up a lot. I began to have panic attacks for the first time in 5 years and I went to some pretty bad places. 

After around 2 weeks of feeling more anxious than i ever have, she finally told me she was in a depressive episode and it all clicked. 

I spent a good week bringing myself back to baseline, I stopped blaming myself for her doing all this stuff, I went to therapy and went back to being happy again 

I was also releasing my first book during this time so yah, I was under a fuckload of stress which didn't help with my emotional availability, this has now subsided as the book is almost done. 

We hung out twice since I went back to my usual self and things seemed Great, I could see her pain and sadness but I was making her smile and laugh, and I was there to give her whatever affection she needed. I felt I could be a rock for her once again and apologised refusely for not seeing the signs prior. And for taking her actions so personally, it's hard to not respond that way when people don't tell you but now I know, I'll never forget it.

I assumed stuff would be fine from this point.

Approximately 4 days ago, she came to me after a full day of hanging out and laughing / smiling, honestly was a good day and said she believes she ""doesn't love me as much as I love her"", this then turned into her saying "" I don't love you anymore"" which then turned into ""I don't love anyone at the moment"" 

This seems very odd considering 3 weeks ago we planned and payed for a worldwide holiday together and wanted to move in with one another.

I asked if she wanted to break up with me and she said she didn't know. I then asked if she still wanted to go on the holiday we booked a few weeks ago and she said she thinks so. I also asked if this feeling of her not loving me anymore all started when she became depressed and she agreed it did. 

I agreed to give her time to think, as much time as she needs, I sent her a letter after the discussion, detailing why we got together and why we're together and that I would be infinitely patient with her, I apologised for my anxiety episode over those 2 weeks and assured her it has passed and that none of what she did was her fault and to let herself feel what she needs to.

She said she would get back to me within a week. So I'm still waiting for my fate. Being in limbo like this is hard but honestly I don't feel all that anxious, at-least not compared to how I was a few weeks ago.

In my personal experience, if you really wanted to break up with someone, you do it. We were in the discussion, the sadness was already there. I asked her if she wanted to do it and gave her a clear out and she didn't take it. This to me heavily points to the idea that she is just overwhelmed and confused But I am understandably nervous.

My question is that, should I be worried? If this actually the end, or is this her depression taking over and trying to cut off all ties with loved ones?

I literally am head over heels for this girl

No one has made me feel love like she has and she said felt the same about me. 

I am terrified at the moment, terrified that I'm going to lose the love of my life because of this vicious disorder

We were going to see the world together, and a mere few weeks ago we were fine.

What do I do? Do I just give her as much space as possible? Do I check up on her once a week or something? I just don't know what to do. 

I am just confused, I just want to be there for her. I don't want to let our love go because of something I know isn't permanent. 

I just hate myself for not seeing the signs sooner, I am so angry at myself for acting the way I did and not being more understanding. 

Has anyone been through something similar, any positive stories about it would help infinitely",17Dec2019,1
214,"I’m 17, can go to most colleges of my choice, but have little clue on what I want to do with life.

Title says it all. I like reading, and math, but I don’t know if I could see my day job involving calculus all day. My parents work around 60-65 hours a week, god I do not want this to be me. I see the stress they have. 

What should I do?

When I was younger I always wanted to make a ton of money, is it worth it? All that work and effort. It seems schools drains me of my energy. I try and try, just to see the A on the report card? 
 
Should I just join America’s Youth and mindlessly join a college praying that the dice decide a happy fate for me? And that I find something I like doing?

Are there jobs that provide good-high-substantial income without that work ethic of 65 hours? Seriously I can not emphasize this enough. It seems all the things I like do not bring income. Basketball, Religion, History, Politics. Or if they do, not to a high degree or have limiting options on what I can do with it. 

Economical security almost scares me as much as failure does. Yet life is knocking on the door. I want to have a game plan, but I don’t know game.  

(Idk if this post relates to this forum, but I have seem similar post)

I don’t see this as pessimistic, I just need help finding a passion, or something I want to do. Motivation. How do I go about finding a job that bring economic security and little stress, that makes me happy?",17Dec2019,1
215," I’ve  been at the same job for 3 and a half years, and I am close to a  promotion. The only thing is, I work long hours mornings until 8pm and  don’t get home till 8:30 or later, I work weekends, and the pay is  terrible. Only commission and it is 40/60 (me 40). I have been miserable  for years at this place and I have been wanting out forever. I have  constant anxiety and I feel hopeless. So not only do I want out, I want  to change careers.

This past week I  was hired for a new job, I am just awaiting the offer email (it is  official I was hired and I said yes at the interview). This job was a  referral and they gave me the job on the spot which they never do  according to my friend that referred me. The place is great. Normal 9-5  hours, weekends off, benefits, and a lot of team building and fun  activities. The pay is guaranteed but it is lower than I anticipated.  But still, I want to take it.

I have not put my 2 weeks in at my current job. Not until I get the official email and begin the on boarding process.

The  thing is, I am scared. I have worked 3 years as an apprentice to get  this “promotion” of moving on by myself. It’s just the money isn’t  guaranteed and the hours suck. I am on my feet all day and my back is  taking a huge toll from it. This new job is in an office. Also, my  parents are super disappointed in me even though I am an adult and I can  make my own decisions, their opinion still makes me hesitant.

If  I take this new job, me and my fiancé can finally have time together.  He works 9-5 with weekends off and I’ve never been able to do that. We  can actually budget and know our fixed incomes.

But  I’m scared that if I leave this current job, I am missing out on making  money in the future? Once I build more of a clientele...in a few years.  With this new job, I get my foot in the door in an office setting and I  can only go up from there.

She has always had a little peach fuzz on her top lip and over the years (I’ve known her since we were 16) it has gotten more pronounced. How do I tell her that it’s noticeable and she should do something about it??

She makes any and every decision she can for him.

There has been a ton that has happened with her that has gotten everyone involved upset because she tells everyone a different version of the story so they see it how she wants them to see it. We recently got engaged and she did not respond well. On top of that we have some things we need to get in order before the wedding and she insist that she be there for one of the things that is very private and when my boyfriend said no she went off asking why not. He explained that he was a grown adult and did not have to explain why not and that he just did not want her there but this made her even more mad. What do we do about her? She gets hurt when we don’t talk to her for a while after this and cries and says she’ll change until the next time. She said that she felt as if she had to compete with me for his love.. I talked to him about it and he says I haven’t done anything that should make her think this way. I think she views the day that we say “I do” that I won his love somehow?? He has been distancing himself from her because we always somehow end up in stupid drama when she’s around. We just want her to get that he is grown and everyone grows up, goes off and starts their own family and makes their own decisions but she just can not accept that.",17Dec2019,1

Okay I’ve been needing to basically get this off my chest / needing advice 

So basically I’m in a deep dark abyss of a friend zoned hole where I told him how I felt about 6 months ago but he told me he doesn’t feel the same ( he is my best guy friend who I’ve been talking too basically everyday for the last two years we met through a mutual friend blah blah) even after I told him how I felt he didn’t treat me different. We still talked everyday and occasionally hooked up. Before you get on my back about this after I announced my dumb lame love confession I gave myself some time, stopped snapping him and just gave us space. After a while, we started up again as if none of it mattered at all, my feelings started to fade. But unfortunately they’ve started to return and now I feel like I have to choose between losing him so I can get over this or suffering through the pain of my own constant pity party.

I have a super conservative and involved family but they absolutely do not keep my kids. Theyre not ""kid people""( their words not mine)

I know i need help. I am stashing vodka in dasani water bottles and lugging them around like I have the intention to stay hydrated...

 Its sneaky and i feel completely defeated. My family truly believes that addiction is about mind set and i don't agree. I have three children and I dont want this problem to perpetuate into something my kids have to heal from.. I wish that thought were enough to keep me grounded 
but like self sabatoge I stab myself in the back. Every.single.time. I want to go into a treatment center and get to the root of the actual problem so I can change the way im living.

I've been friends with this guy, let's call him L, and we always have such a good time together. He's hilarious, talented, and I find him really attractive.

A few weeks ago, he started dating this girl, M, and she. Is. So. Boring. Whenever they're together, they're both just on their phones and don't ever talk to each other. I didn't like her before they started dating because I found her generally rude and super judgmental. She isn't very pretty either, so I genuinely don't understand why they're together.

I think I'm developing a crush on L and I'm terrified of it. He's a great friend and we click super well platonically but I can't stop myself from daydreaming about him on occasion. I really don't want to get a crush on him because I don't wanna ruin our friendship, but I can't help it because of what an awesome guy he is.

So, I guess the problem is that I might like this guy and I don't want to crush on him, but I also don't want to distance myself away from him to prevent it. 
The other problem is M. I objectively think he can do better, something most people in his friend group think so as well. I want to say something, but I don't want him to think that I'm trying to get with him. Maybe I am subconsciously? I really don't know. 

Wow this is a lot lmao. I just don't know what to do with this situation.

235,"Some context, im 21, female, and very high functioning autistic. Among other symptoms that aren’t relevant enough to bring up, I also tend towards hyper empathy, and tend to care really deeply about things. I also have the emotional regulation skills of like a 13 year old, due to spending the majority of my pre-teen to teenage years in such a deep, dissociative depression that I kind of stopped feeling anything. I only started having emotions again in the past year, around last January or so, when I was finally put on an antidepressant that worked. I’ve been playing catch-up on the whole emotional regulation thing, but it’s been pretty difficult, what with the poor social skills, several social anxiety, and cripplingly low self esteem and what not. i also used to work at a place doing quality assurance before this job, so i tend to be hyper aware of potential hazards. 

Context for the job; I work at a hardware store chain that i will not name just in case. i’ve worked there for about 3 months. two months ago, i reported a potential safety hazard to one of my managers, who ill call Billy. I was worried about the fact that the cleaning products with ammonia and the ones with bleach were on the same shelf, and if anything were to happen to that shelf, we’d have a chlorine gas issue. Billy passed it along, and it turned out to be fine, as the actual concentration of the chemicals was too low to be an issue. i was like, “alright,” and that was the end of that. It was a really quiet thing; Billy and a couple cashier coworkers were the only people I told about it. 

A few days ago, I noticed that we sell hummingbird nectar, the kind with the red dye in it, that’s reportedly pretty bad for hummingbirds and can cause liver issues. I told my other manager, who is at the same level as Billy, about my concerns about it, and he told me to call the customer care line for the company and to let them know. Note, this wasn’t him brushing me off, he actually did seem pretty concerned about it. I, being a forgetful person, forgot completely about it until i got to work today. 

when I went to clock out today, after we closed, (everyone who is on the closing shift clocks out and stays around the same area until a manager lets us leave), I saw Billy there. I don’t really know why I said anything to him, since I had already worked it out with the other manager, but I’m not known for my self control, and I told him my concerns about the hummingbird nectar, and about what the other manager had told me to do. 

Billy then, very loudly, and in front of all of my coworkers, proceeded to ask me for proof, which i of course couldn’t pull off the top of my head after a long day doing retail, and then berated me for “believing everything you read,” and said that “all of the merchandise on the shelves is decided on a corporate level, and is vigorously safety tested,” and that “Reporting anything as being unsafe could cost the company a lot of money in lost product,” and that i shouldn’t use the customer care line because i’m not a customer. He then proceeded to make fun of my previous safety hazard report, and called it “ridiculous.” 

I’m completely mortified. I couldn’t even look up at anyone the whole time. I’m so embarrassed i honestly cried once i got to my car. I’ve been picked on in the past for caring about dumb things and admittedly blowing things out of proportion, but never in the workplace like this. And like, it’d be one thing if he’d have pulled me aside and told me this, but this was said to me in almost a yell, in front of the entire shift. How do I deal?",17Dec2019,1

He is extremely manipulative towards people, tosses people to the side and is extremely violent towards himself and others, as he suffers with severe depression. He said things to his ex which include: “I’ll bleed you fucking dry you bitch” and “one day you’ll feel a nice point in your throat and know who it is”.

This is a really long post so props to anyone who reads this!

First, I am 19F. My life right now feels like it’s in shambles but I know it will get better. I was raised by pastors in a very christian church. If anyone knows what pentacostilism is you know how crazy my environment was as a child. 

My parents were always really strict. I was banned from watching many television shows,movies and books. I never got to go to sleepovers. I also was an only child so I was extremely sheltered. 

I am also a lesbian and I have known since I was 9 years old. My parents are homophobic so obviously they don’t know yet…..

I guess the real story starts here. Once I got to my teen years my parents didn’t really let me do anything. I didn’t notice it then but my mom started to display severe symptoms of anxiety which I thought was just normal. I sort of absorbed those fears myself because it seemed so normal in my household. 

This summer I worked at a summer camp and I fell in love with a girl and it became really hard to stay straight after coming home. Also, I completely lost my faith in God.

Since I’ve come back I’ve been more aware of the unhealthy parenting from my parents, especially my mom. I have tried to gain more freedom and they brush it off and attribute it to my camp friends. 

I also go to college in the city where I am from so my parents expect me to go to church every Sunday. My mom is overly worried about me losing my faith and I’m only acting like I believe in God not to upset my parents. My mom can sense that I’m drifting away and she’s become irrationally controlling of my faith. 

Also, about a month ago my dad said that my mom got a word from God that i might be gay. But she regularly looks through my shit without permission so she probably found one of my old journals. 

For my whole life, my mom’s controlling behavior has been masked as “love” but it makes me feel like I’m drowning. I hate the way she makes me feel. She does;t even let me cry in front of her. I want to gain independence but she gets extremely emotional when she can sense that I’m pulling away. I love my mom but it is becoming so hard to be around her. Now it’s winter break at college and I have to liven my house for a month and I was so anxious about it I threw up.

So i guess the main question is….. how do I break free from this toxic relationship between my mother and i?

TL;DR: How do I begin to break free and set boundaries with my controlling and anxiety ridden mother?",17Dec2019,1

It seemed like nothing was wrong with him until the first day we hung out. He was asking really deep and personal questions. I figured he was just trying to get to know me but most guys I know what to bring that stuff up. 

Then he began to talk about his childhood and it was kind of depressing. After that, we went on winter break and we have just been talking on the phone and texting because he’s 7 hours from me now.

And the more i care about people the harder it gets with this issue.

one of my friends always has his phone turned to silent for whatever reason and even though i know that i could turn into hulk when he takes forever to reply.

The thing is she does that with all people so it shouldnt actually bother me that much but if im not hardcore grinding games during that time, im checking my phone way too often

I sometimes even check their insta/snap activity to see if they ignore me, so i feel like that might be a self confidence issue or something similar.

I’m feeling stuck because I am already 4.5 years in to getting this degree, and I am not finding any jobs that I actually want to do. I don’t enjoy coding or designing.

If I even went into an interview for electrical engineering, I don’t think I could portray enthusiasm for the job. I don’t want to lie myself into a career I hate just to pay the bills.

I am starting to feel that I don’t even want to go into a career in the engineering field. I did have an engineering internship early on in my degree, and I HATED it. I felt like I did not add anything into the team of engineers, and I dreaded going in every day.

I am very good in mathematics and that’s the main reason I pursued engineering in the first place. I enjoy solving math problems and writing technical reports.

245,"Backstory: We go to church together and don't really talk but she seems really nice. I want to get to know her but I'm introverted and shy. She's kinda short, cute, she has brown hair, smiles a lot and just seems nice. I've thought of talking to her about my feelings but just kinda backed out of it. At church every Sunday everyone has lunch afterward and talks and gets to know each other better but I almost always sit at a different table than her. (twice my friends and I sat at the same table and I sat right next to her and it felt soo amazing.) 

Anyway, we were at a Christmas party, I saw her there, and I was talking to my friend. I said something along the lines of ""I'm antisocial"" and she butts in and says ""Yeah you are"" with a laugh and I go ""Yeah I am"" and I laugh. It just felt like she was kinda flirting with me but idk she coulda been being mean lol.

I've also caught her looking at me, smiling while doing it, and idk it just seems like she likes me back. I also don't know how my parents would react if I went up to them and told them ""I have a girlfriend.""If you guys want you can ask me more questions and ill answer them but for now, that's all.

Thanks, Justin.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm 18, a college student, and I need a fucking job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to more places than I can count, but no one wants to hire me and I don't have a clue why. I've applied to all the low experience jobs too. I've applied to every fucking Fry's, McDonalds, Walmarts, and everything else you can think of in my god damn area, and even as wide out as 20 miles. I've managed to get only three phone screening requests, which were all denied. THREE. It's. Been. 3. Months. I don't know what to do. My Dad covered the last couple car payments, but he can't cover the next one. I was hinging on being able to use the remainder of my school financial aid to help cover next month's payment, and pay him back in full once I am able to. But he can't help me at all. I have less than a month to get a job, and I don't know what to fucking do. I've applied everywhere I can fucking think of, I've talked to everyone I can, I've talked to recruiters and they can't help me, and I'm just so fucking lost. I need at least 200 dollars to cover the car payment for next month. I need a car to go to college and I need to go to college so I can use the financial aid payments in order to have a car.

249,"Hey guys! I (22f) have a younger sister (16f) who I have been worried about a lot lately. 
So long story short, my little sister has been smoking weed very often. She has smoked casually with her friends in the past and always told me about it, but now its different. I actually have to ask her now if she is high when she comes home from hanging out with her friends-and half the time she’s lying about it! Last week I caught her smoking weed outside of her bedroom window while everyone was home. My parents are pretty oblivious and think she is doing very well in school, when in reality my sister has told me she skipped out a couple times to smoke. 
The whole thing is, I don’t want my sister to stop telling me things and I want to be there for her but I am really worried and don’t know if I should tell my parents. My main anxiety stems from not knowing where she’s getting her weed like it could be laced with something and that really scares me because there have been some cases of that in the area we live.

253,"First of all, I know this is kinda petty—I’m posting in hopes of finding a constructive way to deal. I live in a 6-unit apartment building, right next to another 6-unit apartment building (so, total 12 units and therefore minimum 12 residents), and we share 10-11 trash/recycling bins.

In mid-August, which is the traditional lease end/start time around here, I noticed that my new neighbors didn’t bother to break down their moving boxes before shoving them in the recycling bins—this meant each bin could only hold a couple of boxes, and it was unnecessarily difficult to fit regular loads of recycling in them.  I’m ashamed to admit I wanted to post a passive-aggressive note, but said nothing, and resolved to help out more in regards to taking out the waste bins to make sure they were being emptied regularly.

Fast forward four months, and I am now, for some reason, the person mostly responsible for taking out the bins on our pickup days. I usually get home at 10pm, and except for a couple of times someone took ONE bin out, I have to take out all of them. I have only witnessed two neighbors helping with this task in the last four months. In fact, one week I decided to sit it out and see what happened, and sure enough, the bins did not make it out and thus, overflowed with garbage.  Each week, at least ten bins are over halfway full. Again, theoretically, I should have ELEVEN people helping me take out the bins we are ALL responsible for. Whenever I take them out, there are at least a couple of neighbors who are CLEARLY home but do not offer help.

At least one neighbor still shoves intact shipping boxes into the recycling bins, and at least one neighbor—for some godforsaken reason—thinks it’s okay that their dog’s shit bags land on the ground NEAR the trash bin but not IN it.

To make things worse, I live in Wisconsin and very soon we will inevitably be facing VERY cold weather and snowfall, and I’m going to feel even less okay with doing this chore on my own.

(TL;DR my neighbors—equally responsible for taking out the waste—are inconsiderate, selfish, and gross. and for some reason expect me to deal with all of it.)

Sorry this is a rant. I want to write a passive-aggressive note, I want to email my landlord and tell him my neighbors are assholes, but I’m trying to approach this in a way that doesn’t end with ME being the asshole. How can I do that?",17Dec2019,1

This year was just like the previous one, but a couple nights ago, as I was trying to masturbate, I found myself crying as I came and I am confused and angry at myself because as I did, I saw the face of my ex, how he made me cum, and how it felt, and it just fucking ruined sex for me now. I no longer want to touch myself and have sex with anyone because I don't want to remember him while having sex.

263,"tldr: New tenant is moving into the upstairs unit and was (erroneously) promised exclusive use of our shared backyard by the landlord. How do I compromise with her to make it fair for both of us? 

I’m not looking for legal advice but rather the best way to approach this situation with the new tenant from an interpersonal communication standpoint, so I figured I would try here.

I moved into the bottom level unit of a duplex two years ago. My unit has two points of access to the shared back yard, which I use daily for my two dogs. I chose this apartment entirely because of the yard access and communicated this to the landlord. For the first two years, someone lived upstairs, and we easily shared the backyard with no issues. Then he moved out. The landlord e-mailed me to say someone was interested in maybe signing who also had two dogs and that she told the potential tenant that I do not use the backyard and that my dogs do not ever go out there. I immediately wrote back that I do use it and to give my contact info if the potential tenant signed the lease. The landlord confirmed she understood and would let the potential tenant know. 

Well, I met the new tenant tonight, and she was shocked to hear that not only does my apartment have two separate access points to the backyard but that my dogs go out there on occasion. She said the landlord told her she has exclusive use (clearly the landlord never corrected her misstatement based on my reply email). New tenant said that she leaves her dogs outside 5 days a week while she’s at work and can’t have anyone (dog or human) going outside at that time. Her work days coincide with my off-days when I would spend the most time in the yard. Then the landlord showed up to give the new tenant the keys while I was still standing there. The new tenant immediately got upset with the landlord and said she only signed the lease because she was promised exclusive use of the yard. The landlord said she had no idea I used the yard and thought I used dog walkers. I said I do use it when I am home and never leave my dogs unattended out there. I offered to work out a schedule with the new tenant, but this did not appease the new tenant. New tenant said that she had tried hard to find an exclusive backyard because one of her dogs has bitten a person before and would bite me if I walked into the backyard. Landlord basically said she had to head home and left us. Clearly it is the landlord’s responsibility here to fix the situation/misunderstanding, but assuming she does nothing, what is the best way to compromise with the upstairs tenant in a manner that is fair for both of us? Should I just relinquish access for those 5 days a week, knowing I won’t use the backyard on the other 2 days anyway because I am at work? I want an amicable solution besides just “It’s shared, so I’ll use it whenever I want” because we have other shared common areas and have to meet to exchange mail, divide up utilities, etc., but it’s hard for me to approach this from her point of view and imagine what would make her happy besides just “exclusive use.”",17Dec2019,1
264,"Back in 2017 I transferred to my college in hopes of getting into their Veterinary Technician program. It was a two year program that at the end would lead to an internship and  a certification. Upon my first appointment with a counselor I was told the program was full I would have to wait a year before I could to join again. I did some of my generals, came back the next year to find out they got rid of the program. I figured I'd continue and get my generals done. Last spring I found out that they had only CHANGED the program and now had a Vet Assistant program that was a 16 week course that contained an internship and a certification (not the same certification though and it would be a different job position). So after some planning I figured this last semester I would finish up my AA and AS then in spring 2020 do the Vet Assistant program. 

I just got a call today saying that the program has been dropped for the spring semester and they'd call to let me know if they are going to have it in the fall. 

I live in a small working part-time at a corporate retail store. I was hoping this certification would lead to better things or at least a job that would eventually let me stable enough to move out of my parents house. I've put three years almost into this and feel like I've gotten nowhere. I still have my FASFA for the spring, and unless I quickly enroll in whatever classes they have left I'll lose it. My current plan is to take the one class they are still having for the program (it's a online communications class that's a requirement for the program) and easier classes to boost my GPA yet still leave my availability open for more work (which hours will probably go down once the holidays are over). But I still feel like I'm not doing anything for my future.

I've considered going away to another school, but I don't want to get into debt. I feel stuck and trapped and it's really been messing with me mentally. I went from having everything planned out to having almost nothing. I could really use some advice on anything at the moment.",17Dec2019,1

267,"So I'm very new to Reddit. I discovered it maybe 6 months ago. I finally made an account 4 months ago. And I immediately fell in love! I am not one that enjoys social media. I have an Instagram that I only use for groupchats and occasionally posting a funny story. But Reddit is really cool. People mostly seem to have civil, genuinely nice conversation. I learn a lot, which I really enjoy. And once I finally figured out Karma, I really liked it. My first account had 31 Karma, which I was bragging about to my wife (who knows nothing about Reddit.) Then some unfortunate things happened.
 
Due to some mistakes in judgement, I ended up in an awkward and slightly confrontational social situation, which rarely happens to me. I mean.. I frequently think about a time 6 years ago when I accidentally interrupted a cashier at a gas station and they got mad at me. Things like that really hurt me. Well, in this situation, I felt like while I wasn't right, I was less in the wrong than the other guy, so I decided to post the story to a very popular subreddit to get other people's opinions. 

And boy, did I make some more mistakes there. I posted all the facts that I knew, not chronological, and didn't justify myself in the least. Well, people in that subreddit turned out to be pretty mean. Like...very excessively mean. I was agreeing with most people and being very nice, and yet everyone was downvoting every comment I made. Within minutes my 31 Karma I was so proud of became 1. I guess it can go into the negatives, but by that point I was so distraught that I just deleted my account completely. 

Some info about me: I like to think that I don't care what others think of me; but the fact is that I do care a lot. I have a really good reputation amongst my peers, and I'm very proud of that. I don't consider myself a role model, but I do like to help people with the knowledge and experience I have.

So anyway, I still like Reddit a lot. So a few days later, I made a new account. And got back into the swing of things, but getting as far away from that particular subreddit as possible. I've built up a little bit of karma again, but I've made a few comments that people downvoted. And I genuinely try to be nice/helpful/generally good. I realize I can't make everyone like me, and I understand I'm not always right. And that's kind of the point of discussing things, I think. If I'm wrong about something, I want to learn what is correct. And if something is asking for an opinion and people don't like mine, I'm happy to agree to disagree. I won't argue with anybody, in person or online. But I'm obsessing over the whole karma thing. If a comment gets downvoted even once, I'll delete it. And I'm paranoid about it. I'll probably check five times a day to make sure one of my older comments wasn't suddenly disliked and downvoted. And again, I'm not a social media person. I check Instagram at most twice a day, and I only look at DMs, not what people post.

I just feel like Reddit has really kicked me in the chest. I don't want to be obsessed with what people think of me. But I can't stop thinking about the things some commenters said about me. And I just feel awful about myself. The only thing I can think to do is try harder to say or do things people like on Reddit, and hopefully I can get to a point where I care less. But that doesn't seem like a very good emotional plan. I don't think it's affecting the way I act in person. But I don't know. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for specifically. Maybe just empathy? What have others done to help them care less about the whole karma thing? Or should I just delete my account and become solely a reader and not take part in the discussions? 

Sorry if it's all a little jumbled. I've been thinking about this all day and tried to fit in as much as I could.

TLDR; I'm new to Reddit and am now obsessing over Karma. I feel personally hurt if I get downvoted, even if I know it's not a personal thing. What helped you get over that when you were new to Reddit?",17Dec2019,1
269,"I’m 14, she’s 23. 
For some background info: we lost our father to a paragliding accident when I was very young. She was in year 12 at the time and refused to take a break off of school because she didn’t want to be held back a year. I don’t think she ever took the time to process things. She never gave herself a break, always studying and taking care of us. She didn’t want to talk to anyone about it, said she was fine. I wonder if she felt responsible for all of us, since she’s the older sibling? The same thing happened with my older brother, too, who became judgemental and parental, thinking he needed to become the man of the house. 

My sister was the family’s perfect child. Mum had no problems with her during pregnancy and birth, she never needed braces, got straight A’s, and didn’t go through a defiant teenage phase like most of us do. In the past three years, however, she’s become a totally different person, for better or for worse. We rarely see her now, even though we live together. She’s always in her room, playing some game or sleeping, usually with the curtains closed. She eats dinner far later than us, gets up late everyday (1-3pm usually), and goes to sleep late too (early AM’s)

She’s always been extremely cautious with money and her property. She never let us touch her phone or games without washing our hands, and doesn’t like to spend money at all. Just the other day mum and I were throwing ideas out about getting a pool, and she immediately said “it’d cost too much” and “no one would use it anyway” going into the statistics of everything.

Anyways, sorry for the long buildup, but here’s the point of the whole thing. 
Mum had asked my sister and I to measure a vehicle we were tying to sell, my dad’s old motorhome, to be specific. She was getting mad at me because I wasn’t going the full way with the tape measure. It stressed me out so I replied in a regretfully harsh tone that it wasn’t working and wouldn’t go any farther. She got super mad then and chucked her phone, that she herself paid for with her own money, down onto the ground and stomped off, slamming the door behind her. 

Today she bought the both of us a meal from McDonald’s. I was eating some chips out of the bottom of the bag on the way back. There were two chip boxes in the bag. When we sat down to eat, she noticed that one of the boxes was less full than the other. This started an argument, with me trying to defend myself and insisting I didn’t eat her food, and her yelling at me that I did and it was unfair. I got fed up and dumped some of my chips into her box, saying “there, it’s even now.” Some fell out and didn’t really land in the box at all, so it made it look like I was mocking her. I wish I handled it better. Even so, what happened next was super out of character for her. She threw her drink at the wall and yelled “there!” Then stormed off, leaving her chips and half eaten burger on the table, and a rather big mess for me to clean up. She hasn’t come back yet.

She’s never thrown things before. She’s never yelled or mocked anyone. And she’s certainly never mistreated something she paid for herself. I am so, so worried for her and I wish she would tell me what to do to help her but she closes herself off from the world and hides in her room. When I go to check on her she tells me to leave. I don’t know what to do.

My mum is a mental health worker, and thinks she has PTSD. 

I would just like some help to understand her more and understand what to do when she gets like this. I’m scared that I’ll lose another family member. She won’t tell me how to help so I’m asking you guys.
I just don’t know what to do.",17Dec2019,1

271,"This is a throw away account, sorry for the long read.

I (19f) was sexually abused by a family member when I was 7 and he was 14, but it didn't come out until I was 14 because I had it mentally blocked away. At the time, and ever since, my mom has been moderately supportive, but some of my family members refuse to acknowledge that it might have happened, particularly my grandmother, who's house it happened in, while we were supposed to be under her care. Now, that particular cousin is living in my grandmother's house, along with his girlfriend, and their (4f and 1m) children. This is 1200 miles from where I now live, so visits are few and far between, so the issue isn't raised very often, but on the occasions we do visit my mom is pretty particular about me not being alone with him, and my mom and I stay at my aunt's house while my dad stays with my grandmother, as she is his mom. My mom has always been good about keeping distance between him and me, until he had kids. 

Yesterday, my mom asked me to pick up some Christmas gifts she had ordered online for in store pick up, as the location was far more convenient for me to pick up on my way to work. The problem is, that order includes a gift for my cousin and his girlfriend. I was going to pick up the order anyways and not make a fuss about it because I had something to pick up for myself, too. But today, she asked me to wrap the presents she got for his kids. I didn't say anything about it and just wrapped everything else and left. Now I'm conflicted because I don't really know a polite way to say ""I don't want to wrap Christmas presents for the children of my abuser"" that won't upset her and send her into a shame spiral of thinking she's a bad mom, and ruin our relationship that has taken a long time to be in a good place.

""Don't ever tell me to calm down again. I have been working this job for five years and I was basically forced to take on the role of manager and train other employees far too early. That's just how I work run the show now so you have to stop taking it so personally.""

me: ""I understand... I just want you to know that you can trust me to do my job.""

""I hope you realize that (employee x) has worked here far longer than you have. You can't do what she can do and I still have to train you on so much."" 

It's worth noting that I'm the ""newest"" regular employee there as of six months ago but I've been working there over the rushes for the past two years already. I'm trained enough to be able to train my own batch of new hires as I have done before.

Despite this fact, and being trusted by the other employees in the store (including employee X), she will follow my every move and try training me on things I've long since made habitual.

Even today she commented that she didn't want to go to the bathroom for fear of leaving me alone. There was NOTHING I was untrained about that needed supervision and if the store got busy in those three minutes all I had to do was call another coworker over from another part of the store to hop on a register. It was not a big deal.

The worst part is, while she was lecturing me, she started bringing up my anxiety and pointing it out as the reason I take everything personally.

""I know you get anxious and I know you are so sensitive about how other people act around you but you can't take it so personally. This is a work environment.""

This is really hurtful because about a year ago I confided in her about my anxiety after I had a panic attack at work. Since then I've been working hard to get better. At this point, after not having an attack in ten months, I now just want to go to work and forget about my anxiety. I want to show myself I can do my job well.

It therefore doesn't help when she brings it up unpompted. If anything I find that to be far less professional and a breach of trust. I was just really caught off guard by her pointing out my anxiety.
(by bringing up something so personal she is the one who made if personal)

 I know I can't hope to vouche for myself but I'm really a pretty chill person now. In fact I have a tendancy to *under*react to precieved slights. She gets mad at things that I just see it as part of the job. 

Despite this If I do even the most innocent thing like rub my eye out of boredom she'll stare at me with wide-eyed concern. When I look back at her and ask her why she's staring, she'll respond,""I thought you were crying.""

or if I seem to be in any mood other than super happy she'll lean in and ask what's wrong and if I need a moment. She acts like she can read my mind at every moment, and it's frustrating when she is so entirely off-based.

 another example is when one of our coworkers came to work feeling bad about something. she seemed upset but I didn't for a second think she was mad at me. a long time ago I might have questioned it but I've since gotten good at separating myself from other people. 
suddenly she comes up to me and says,

""oh btw, so and so isn't mad at you. she's upset about [explains situation].""

O... kay? I didn't show any indecation that it bothered me so what is her deal bring it up like that?

My other coworkers see how she treats me too and agrees that she's totally out of line. They say she has a superiority complex and none of them like working with her because of it.

I've tried talking to her about it but she often just steam rolls the converstaion with what I've already mentioned here.
(i.e. stop taking it personally, I'm basically a manager so shut it.)

I'm so frustrated. I just have no idea how to handle this situation. Should I try harder to confront her? Should I write her a note? Should I bring HR into it? should I just ignore it?",17Dec2019,1

278,"I want to give a important detail here. Our family is undocumented. Asian-descent. I know many of you reading will get mad and want to say we deserve it, etc. But I want to point out that we lived here for over a decade and my parents are the most hardworking people ive ever met. Even though we are undocumented, due to my parents I was able to thrive here in America and Ill forever be thankful. If you want to call us out, do so. But I do have some rights to post on this sub and look for an advice.

About a year ago, my dad hurt his hand during work. After he left that place, he was fired multiple times due to the reason. My dad is a sushi chef, and his hand is essential when it comes to his work. Its like a life line. My dad just told me that he might get fired from his current job. He cried front of me. He never did that before. It just breaks me how stressed and worried he looks, as everything hes doing is for the best for this family. 

This has been breaking my family apart. My mom and my dad hate each other's guts and refuse to talk to each other. My mom keeps blaming my dad but in a situation like this pointing fingers at people is pointless. I guess its more easy to say that. 

We don't have money for surgery. We cannot afford to fix his hand. I wish I can do something but I cant get a job. I am already 19. I really want to do something. 

I am just really sad and scared. There is really nothing we can do. As we are not citizens there is no protection over people like us. We do not have a single family here. I really wish sometimes we stayed in Korea and we never came here. My parents wont have to bust ass for me and get physically beat up by all the work theyre doing. They used to work at high paying offices in korea. Now my dad is a sushi chef with a broken hand. I fucking hate everything. I can't stop crying.

I’ve seen her several times and randomly in the office, we are at a large firm doing unrelated work. Seeing her in the office was recent. It’s a huge company. 

Anyway, fast forward to now. She emailed me about one of my matters and needed help. All coincidental. I ended up calling first to get more detail, then even swinging by in person a few days later to discuss briefly and introduce myself. 

She’s a sweetheart, yeah, she’s probably just nice to everyone at work, I get that.

All I got was a bunch a basket of candies while all the other people in the secret Santa got the actual things they wanted. I didn’t even really ask for much either. I gave them some stuff that I really wanted, and some cheap stuff incase they were on a budget like socks. 
    The gift exchange with one of my friends was a blowout as well. They wanted an AirPod case with a certain character and i got them that, but all i got in trade was some printed out homemade stickers and a printed out drawing if a character they did. All i asked for was just some keychains or pins of a certain anime character or some colored pencils since I needed some. Maybe it was a miscommunication, but I’m frustrated and sad that i spent money and time thinking that they’d get me something that i wanted too.

282,"I adopted a sweet 3 year old boxer mix about 3 months ago and I am so in love with her, but this has been the hardest experience of my life and I am just running out of options.

I live in a city in a high rise apartment building.
I work a full time job and she would freak the F out when I left, every time I left.

I also quickly discovered she is afraid of moving cars/trucks/anything loud so going on walks near me is completely impossible. Luckily there is a large “dog park” in my building where I would take her. It was frustrating to not be able to go on walks but she seemed happy in the park so I was okay with it. As time has gone on she has made more and more enemies in the park and when we see them she is instantly aggressive. I am always able to pull her out but she has bit me a few times during these times. It seems like every few days she suddenly hates yet another dog. Riding the elevator and even leaving my apartment at any time with her makes me so anxious, if we run into one of them who knows how she’ll react. It’s strange though - she goes to daycare and is a total princess there and has 0 issues whatsoever. I don’t know what it is in the building she hates them so much.

I have her on anti anxiety medication which hasn’t made a difference in the aggression but did help her separation anxiety.

We went to Petco classes but that hasn’t done much obedience wise and I just hired a 1:1 in home trainer to begin in January (I am traveling for the holidays) and I am told that she will be able to help with the walk fears within 3 months (of course I need to do the “homework”) which is promising.

Tonight we went down to go to the bathroom and when the elevator doors opened there was another dog and she immediately went at him and almost bit him. Now I am crying in my apartment at the end of my rope - I can’t live like this, so anxious when I step outside my door with her. I know she feeds off my anxiety but I can’t be calm o am always on alert for other dogs. I can’t afford to move and i honestly can’t wait the 3 months the training will take. I am scared for her safety, other dogs, and my own when I have to intervene. I don’t know what to do and I am terrified that my living situation just isn’t conducive to her. I have wanted a dog for so long and I am just so heartbroken about this failure. Has anyone had to rehome a dog? Does anyone have advice? I don’t know what to do and this just feels so terrible.

284,"Bit of a throwaway for this don't use reddit a lot but think its the best option for this situation.   
I go by gender-fluid online despite my actual gender, because of what I like to do online which is, roleplay. I never do relationship roleplays and so I don't think it matters as much for what gender I choose.   
I was online as one of my Male characters and ended up finding someone really good with roleplay.   
We started and ended up roleplaying for over 4 months, but now she has started calling me her 'Guy best friend' even though I played Female and Male (I will admit it was primarily male) characters in the roleplay. I absolutely love her style and I want to keep the roleplay going but something happened that made me look at her another way.  
 I stated at the start that I was both genders but it seemed to just go in one ear and out the other for her, and recently I decided to bring it up again for some reason. She ended up brushing it off and giving a basic response to any coming out (Even if I was just restating this)   
But at this point, it started to feel that out of roleplay (when I chatted with her and played online without roleplaying or just hanging out) I was still acting and having the personality of the male character I played and I wasn't being myself.   
So when I confronted her again, I took this to be able to be myself and acted like myself. She said 'I was really in a mood today' and so I said I would tone it down and apologized. But I feel like a totally different person around her and I don't like it anymore.   
Of course, things really started to add up past the point of when I re-stated myself. Things from her being 'afk' for over 30 minutes twice every single time we roleplay (the first one she says her guardian stepped away and she can't get back on the computer) to things like her constantly forgetting what happened in the roleplays before or having to explain it or give her a refreshing.   


  
I really love this roleplay and I don't want to just stop it. I love her style. It feels like we match up perfectly and still roleplay the same and awsome way from day one.  
But I'm starting to hate her as a person because of the way she acts out of roleplay.

287,"Bit of background - My brothers and sisters always have Christmas with our parents. We all get on very well usually, save for my two sisters who are polar opposites and sometimes argue. I will not be at my family Christmas this year as am overseas. 

Sister 1 is married to a guy we all love, but he is going through seriously bad depression (think suicidal). Sister 2 is with a guy we all hate, but because she will not leave him, we tolerate him at a distance so as to not push her and my niece away. She literally has no friends left because everyone hates being around the guy. 

Anyway, sister 2's partner has not been at a family Christmas for the last 4 years, first because they lived overseas and when they did move home, he wasn't invited because of his behaviour. That year, she cracked the shits and refused to come without him, meaning no one saw our niece and Christmas was a bit of a downer.. 

This year, sister 2 has indicated partner may come, if he can get time off from home detention (yep, he's a winner). He has not been to any family celebration since 2014ish. No, no-one invited him but sister 2's view is hes her partner so they are a package deal. In the meantime, sister 1 is upset because her husband refuses to be around the partner and she doesn't want to make him spiral even worse and therefore is saying if partner goes, her family won't be (which will devastate my parents). Sister 2 doesn't know this and sister 1 doesn't want to upset her because they only recently repaired their relationship after a fall out and she doesn't want another drama on her plate

I am the only one who knows how serious it is with sister 1's husband's mental health and the only one she has talked to about any of the Christmas drama.

So reddit, i need your advice - should I take it upon myself to call sister 2 and potentially (likely) upset her but asking that her partner not go to Christmas, explaining where sister 1 is at? My parents are old, dad is just recovering from serious illness so I don't want to put it on them and sister 1 is busy trying to make her sure her husband gets through the day.

288,"The past year has been rough for me. My SO, the best friend I ever had, abruptly became extremely distant from me, then broke up with me just before Christmas last year. I was a complete mess. I've never been so devastated, and nearly checked myself into the hospital a few days later out of fear for my own safety. Instead I pulled it together enough to get started in therapy. Four months later my dad became terminal and died within a few months, after a lot of suffering. He was one of the greatest people I ever knew, and the only thing that allowed me to keep it together was the fact that we'd had a great relationship, and I have good memories to lean on. 

Just recently my work decided to make some changes to my department, that essentially led to my demotion, though no one called it that. Now the people that used to report to me are basically equals, and simply do not listen to me anymore. They've pretty much ostracized me from any decision making about projects in my department. On top of that, some of the people who I thought were friends at work have openly started to mock me in certain situations. I really haven't felt like I belonged with the group I work with for quite a few years, and it seems that many people have jumped at the opportunity to kick me while I'm down. I absolutely dread going to work. I've failed to make any real allies there, and definitely don't feel like I have any true friends there. I actually haven't made any new friends in years, save for one girl that I've been dating. I'm pretty sure many people at work despise me, based on how often I get the cold shoulder from many of them. I've never been disrespectful to anyone, but I think people perceive me as weak, or maybe I'm toxic in some other way I'm oblivious to that turns people off. My therapist insists that it's just my own reinforced belief structure, and that I can change my way of perceiving what's happening using CBT. I'm starting to think that's bullshit to a large extent. This whole process has happened before at past jobs and I feel like I need to exchange my personality for another if I can ever hope to be accepted as part of a group. 

I've been so depressed off and on for so long that I just haven't had the will to find another job. Every time I sit down to put together a resume or search for a job, I get severely sad and discouraged about the prospect of the it all. I've never felt so lost, or so incapable of mustering the will to accomplish a task. I feel almost paralyzed. 

I've been feeling like an outcast at work for a few years now, and this whole 'not' demotion has pretty much convinced me that my gut has been right all along in telling me that I am. I'm ready to just quit and never look back, but am terrified of burning through my savings and losing my home if I don't find another job fast enough. I've got enough saved up to coast for quite a while, but I also don't want to deplete in months what's taken years to squirrel away. The dread I feel towards going to work has finally come close to overwhelming the fear of going broke, and I'm seriously considering putting in my two weeks with no plan for what to do next. Some part of me feels like I can salvage the relationships at work, and prove my worth. I also feel that working as a total outcast around a majority of people who have no respect for me is more damaging to me at this point than any stress I might encounter after quitting, and my time would be wasted trying to salvage my career at the company I'm with.

In the back of my mind, I know that what I've been through over the past year pales in comparison to some of the problems others are having to face. Despite that, it's been extremely difficult for me, but through it all I've managed to stick to my athletic hobbies and avoid falling into drug addiction, or disconnecting from the friends I do have. I also feel like if I don't get out of this work environment where I've been shunned and disrespected by my peers that I'm going to lose the grip on the sanity I have maintained this long. I heard recently that one of the most stressful things humans can go though is feeling banished from a group, and having no 'tribe' to belong to. That's how I feel, and I don't know how much longer I can bear this. 

I feel like if I quit, the burden that's been holding me down will be lifted so I can regain the will to look for new opportunities in life. I also feel like I need some sort of socialization therapy to avoid getting myself into situations like this in the future, but don't know if such a thing even exists.

Let me get this straight. I've done fairly well throughout all of school, and have always excelled at almost everything I do. I started smoking weed a few months ago, but then have since waned off and only do it at parties every few months now as it was getting destructive.

I've lived my whole life feeling like I was different for some reason, and I could never figure out exactly why. I still dont, and I still feel the same way. It's just something I have always lived my life thinking, whether it is true or not I have no idea. 

A few days ago one of my buddies gave me some adderall for a study session. I took it, and words cannot describe the immediate relief I felt when it kicked in. I didnt get the adderall-ish rush that you see in movies, I just felt normal. I felt grounded, and I felt like I could think straight. I was more positive all day, and I felt more confident in my social interactions. 

What I am trying to figure out is what my next move forward needs to be. I have shown that I can function fine without it. I'm an A and B grade student, but my studying habits are unsustainable. I cannot get myself to sit down and focus on more than 15 minutes of work.

So I guess this post is kind of a confession and a question in one. I really feel like I want adderall, and that it would genuinely help me from day to day. I'm confident in my ability to exercise self control, but I know how bad adderall can be and am aware of how it has destroyed lives.

I can't get tested for it because my mother would accuse me of simply wanting an adderall prescription, which is understandable given the fact that I have never needed it before and gotten along okay. I genuinely dont know if this is something I should pursue once I turn 18 or If I should just forget about it.

295,"
Lots of backstory to get the full picture.

TLDR: Girl I was acquaintances with in high school is pregnant and wants to keep baby. She doesn’t have a job or any way to support herself.

So me (20F) and my friend went to high school together for a year. Then I graduated and she was still attending high school (junior). Her family had just moved into the area and this girl was not happy about it. She decided to take it out on everyone else. I was pretty much her only friend. Compared to other friends, I was the “mom” friend. Helped her out with homework, boyfriends, job applications, etc.

After I graduated, she was having issues with other kids at school and with her parents. She was always threatening to run away from home but never actually did. Earlier this spring she and her boyfriend at the time got arrested for public intoxication at the local Walmart. She was only 17 when it happened but she still spent the night in jail. I tried talking to her about it and talking some sense into her but she was very dismissive and nonchalant. Comments like “why bother changing my attitude? It’s gonna happen again.” and “I made jail friends for next time.” The school half-expelled her. They told her they would give her the diploma if she did all the work from home. She didn’t want to, so she never graduated high school. Eventually she moved out of her house and in with a boyfriend.

After that I began distancing myself from her, over the summer she called, wanting to hang out. She told me that she had basically kidnapped a 14 year old girl we went to school with. The 14yo didn’t tell her family where she was going and just left. My acquaintance was ignoring the police’s calls when they got ahold of her. Eventually she brought the girl back. I don’t think the family pressed charges. Again, she was very dismissive and nonchalant about it all. The “so what?” Mindset. Also, she told me she had to take Plan B because she could be pregnant with her boyfriend.

After that, I stopped texting her and picking up her calls. Fast forward to today, when she posts a picture of herself pregnant “10 weeks” on her Snapchat. I texted her and she told me it was real. I’m (possibly stupidly) assuming she’s telling me the truth. I asked her what her plan was and she said it was to keep the baby. She didn’t respond to my text for how she’s going to do that.

I don’t know what to do, if anything. This girl can’t take care of herself, let alone another human being. She didn’t graduate high school. She got fired from her job for not showing up for a week. She’s moved out of the father’s house. I realize I’m sounding very judgmental but it’s a child’s life now, not just her’s.  

Should I contact one of her friend’s who could talk her into adoption or at least getting help? Is there another route to go? What can I do to help? 

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this, and responds.",17Dec2019,1

My brother let him in while I was upstairs and he immediately told him to put some pants on which was right. But i didn’t like his vibe. She told me a while back I guess when she was mad at him not to let him in the house but I wasn’t gonna do that regardless. 

He told him he should wait outside for her and he wasn’t acting like he been knowing me for years. I wanna say that I do not know this man anything he know about me he got from her.  

He kinda pissed me off when he brought up how he used to come over when my grandpa was still living and everything was cool with my grandpa sitting downstairs with him. 

My grandpa is dead now and he told me himself do not let him in this house if nobody not there and I told my brother that too. 

He got a attitude and left and was saying stuff like your mom wanted me here which is correct but don’t you think it’s inappropriate to be here when she not?

My dad and I have never been that close because he's always lived in another country, but we keep in touch regularly, mostly via Whatsapp. I'm sure he would gladly help me financially, because he feels like since he is not physically here that's his way of taking care of me. But that makes me scared that he would not tell me if helping me out would put him in an uneasy situation, and I really do not want that. I clearly do not want to be a burden for him. 

So I don't really know how  to ask him if he could help out and at the same time make sure he's not helping me out 'too much' if you see what I mean.",17Dec2019,1

300,"I was walking through a crosswalk when I was hit by a car. All I remember is crossing the street and feeling like I was in a dream and waking up on the ground with people surrounding me. I got up and I thought I was fine, just a little sore, and I didn’t end up filing a police report or even ask for the drivers insurance because I thought we all make mistakes and I’m not seriously injured. I kept going about my day and it just hit me all at once tonight that I was hit by a car and my whole body feels like it’s in pain. The worst part of it all was when when I talked to my dad he was first really concerned and after I kept telling him I was fine, he said “maybe you just bumped into a parked car and fell” since I said I was fine and I didn’t need to go to the hospital. I also feel like it could’ve been my fault, I was 100% sure I was at the crosswalk and when I opened my eyes right after the accident and looked the crosswalk was 1 steps from me; and first I thought that made sense since I was hit by the car I would’ve moved forward, but now I can’t stop thinking like I did something wrong and I hurt the driver. I can’t stop crying now and i got a text message of someone saying they saw what happened and sent me a picture of the car but I don’t remember giving anyone my number. I just can’t stop crying and I feel so empty and I feel so guilty.",17Dec2019,1
301,"When I was in my teens I was pretty self sufficient. I had a vision for my life, I believed in myself, I didn't care what others thought of me, and I just lived my life. Now I'm nearing thirty and I feel like a failure, even though I'm not. I make decent money, I have accomplished a couple of my big dreams, I have taken big risks, I've had lots of sex and am in great shape - all things people think of when it comes to shallow success but I am almost completely empty inside and like I've failed myself. I care what people think of me. I care how I measure up to other people my age - if I'm making as much of them, or if they're having kids and I'm still single, or if I keep following my other dreams and don't have a solid day job like them that I'm branded a failure. I'm scared to voice my opinions because they may be unpopular. I also ask others way too much for their opinions when I make decisions instead of trusting myself, and I tell people what I want to work on or what my plans are instead of just executing.    
  Basically, I feel like I'm living for everyone else (or, their expectations) and not for myself and I'm miserable. The funny thing is probably no one gives a fuck about all this stuff I worry about, and I shouldn't care... But I do. I don't know what happened. Help?",17Dec2019,1

305,"My \[19M\] mom \[50sF\] told me earlier this evening that she's planning a trip this February. It'll involve a flight to and  from the destination. Allow me to weigh the pros and cons of going vs not going.

&amp;#x200B;

The pros of going:

It will be my younger sister's \[5F\] first flight. It'll be nice to experience that with her.

This will be the first (and maybe last) time the family goes to this specific destination. If I don't go with them, maybe I never will. That being said, it's not a place I particularly care about.

It's a free vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

The pros of not going:

I wouldn't miss three days of classes. It doesn't sound like a lot but teaching myself the material from those days + all of the makeup work on top of the assignments after I return is a lot of potentially unnecessary stress. 

Would be home alone for several days. I have a big family (I'm the second child of five). Having some peace and quiet would be much appreciated. Plus, I commute to college. So for a few days while my mom is out of town I'd have the independence I imagine most college kids get their entire 4 years.

I'd be able to spend several nights with my girlfriend. Silly reason I know. Basically, I commute to college to save money. I'm not allowed to stay out overnight and have a curfew of somewhere around 10 or 11. My girlfriend is a fellow college student but she stays on campus. So, if my mom wasn't home for me to ""check-in"" then I could stay out with her. Honestly, I could use some specific advice on this point. I know several other college couples and they basically live together (separate dorm rooms but always sleep together). Some of my high school friends who still live at home are able to stay out as late as they want. My inability to stay out is complicating the decision of participating in a family activity which doesn't feel like a healthy situation but I'm not fully sure how to approach it. Every time I try bringing it up to my mom it gets hostile so I feel kind of lost on how to approach the situation. I feel like she's violating boundaries but if she's paying for my expenses, is that her right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional points:

My family takes frequent vacations. It's not like this vacation is the only one for several years. We're taking a weekend trip after Christmas and we always go to the beach at least two times a year. Plus, we take several other weekend or day trips throughout the year. This isn't the only vacation on the horizon for us.

Everyone else in the family is going, including my older sister \[20F\] who also goes to college.

I had no clue about this trip up until a few hours ago. She wants to go ahead and reserve tickets for the flight so I have to make a decision relatively quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you were in my position, would you choose to go on a vacation with family or not go to avoid missing classes + getting some independent time? How would you approach getting more independence so it's not an unnecessary obstacle in decision-making like this?",17Dec2019,1
306,"My supervisor [M] and I [F] are both in our early 20's. We hit it off well and got along to the point where we talked so much only in the first few days of meeting. 

Next day, my other coworker asked me if I'm in a relationship, and I immediately said no. I had a feeling this was about my supervisor and I. She continued to say how he's making a move on me and how we look cute together (Dating is allowed  at my workplace). I laughed it off cause I didn't wanna start any more rumors.

Following day, him and I have a talk and at the end he winked at me. Now this threw me off cause I was like ok does he really like me or what? And his body language was really different from when he's around others.

During our next shift together he got mad at me for something, but according to my coworker he was already mad and he took it out on me? And hes bipolar?? Idk that's what a few of them said.
Anyway since then we didn't talk and ended up ignoring each other a bunch of times throught the 2 weeks. 

Yesterday during break another coworker of mine asked me if I have a boyfriend? Like this was the most random question at that moment so I was like ummm what's going on?? 

Surprisingly him and I finally exchanged words at the end of our shift and that was about it. 

Today the unexpected happened. All of my coworkers were teasing me saying ""you're so beautiful"" ""someone likes you..."" and how it's a secret between them and him. They kept asking me if I like him and I said I'm not going to answer that question because I really don't want this going around.

Anyway, when I asked how they found out, apparently the words went around...how great. Eventually my supervisor came around and tried starting a convo but I felt uncomfortable and nervous so didn't say much. And once again we avoided each other...

I don't know what to do because I like him but I don't even know if he actually likes me or it's completely a rumor. I feel like I should ask him privately in person but at the same time I don't know if it's a good idea. I just want all this to stop if it's a rumor because it's so awkward working together thinking he likes me.

TL;DR: Coworkers keep telling me my supervisor likes me. Should I talk to him about it?",17Dec2019,1

 We suggested we will take them under our custody when we can afford a house with enough room. She was happy and full on endorsing us, that is until we couldn't help them with their every need. Which was a range of things, such as... we dont always have the time to drive them around, we cant lend them money, we dont have enough money to buy a 5 bedroom house immediately, etc. 

Her latest outburst was about us not being able to cash their checks for them. We are not a bank... the bank told us we shouldn't be depositing their checks otherwise our account can look suspicious to the payee.  Her course of action was to attack my husband. Shoving, punching, biting and throwing items at our vehicle. Also today she drove by to yell at us. 

We are putting a restraining order on her. But I'm unclear of how it all works. What are some things we can do if we take her children in but she isn't allowed near us.

312,"My 25(F) fiancé and I 28M got into a stupid fight about a week ago. I honestly can’t remember what started it but I remember out of spite I said I was done and that maybe if she isn’t happy she should leave. I knew it was a boneheaded thing to say as soon as I did it. She left and ended up being really upset.

The next day she was acting a little weird and when I came home from work she said she was done and thinks we should separate. I asked her why and she said she was tired of bickering and is always being angry.

It’s true that we fight a lot but it’s always over dumb shit. Mostly because we have different standards of cleanliness (I’m way more picky than her) and also because sometimes we each say offhand comments that make the other mad. We have been intimate with each other in the past week’s regularly and there is no DV or infidelity on either side.

I have never seen her this upset and to be honest it’s 99% my fault. I get way too angry over little stuff and I tend to say things that I know will get her upset when we fight. When we get along it’s great but when we fight we can be pretty nasty.

The problem is I know we have something there and we also have kids in the mix.

I am trying to give her space but we live in a small apartment and it’s hard to just sit there and not talk when a week ago we were joking around. I honestly consider her my best friend and I have no desire to break up.

I am currently enrolled in counseling to fix my anger issues and learn to communicate more effectively. It just seems like nothing is working. She just gets more and more distant each week.

Every check, two weeks, I give my mother $300. I try to hold out until next check before I put any money in my savings, so that I do not have to turn around and withdraw it. 

Why do I give my mother $600 a month? Rent. She also makes payments on bankruptcy which she filed for a year ago, and we have 2 years left. She brings home much less than me, around $700 every two weeks. Sometimes less than half.

320,"I recently purchased tires online form a big tire company, they usually ship them out to an installer near you. The installer had issues and could not install the tires due to my car being too low (it's not modified, just low from factory). So I called the tire company and they referred me to another installed. However, they would have to process a return with the installer they sent the tires to and ship out new tires (that's how they work). For 3 painful days, they told me that they are waiting for a response from their big warehouse to see when they can ship the new tires.  I grew impatient and tired of waiting so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager told me he would refund my money and I can just go online, order the same tires again and have them shipped to the correct installer. I agreed. The manager did not mention the funds would take 5 business days to hit my bank account. Regardless, we proceed with the refund and I try to buy the tires again with my own money. I find that the tires are out of stock from the website. I call them again. The manager is now panicking and says my only hope is that they are in stock at their warehouse and if they are then they will be shipped to me. An hour later he calls back and says the warehouse finally replied to their original email sent previously and 4 new tires are on their way to the new dealer. The manager told me to call them after the tire installation and re-pay the money.

It's been 4 years I didn't see my mom (you should know how hard it is to get a US visa for Vietnamese people) so last month I got a visitor visa, my family just so happy we can enjoy Christmas together. 
But when I get here, my family wanted to keep me stay in the US illegally. Then they will arrange a fake marriage so I can stay. I heard the intention I claimed that I would not do that for sure. I told them that I will change the ticket and go back to VN but they HID MY PASSPORT. My dad kept it in his pocket and never let me touch it. I talked to them calmly, I explained, I cried, I screamed. But noone listen. 
Now I am in Atlanta, I dont know exactly but I live near the airport (40 mins drive). I am locked in the house, they tried to take my phone but I sneaked in and got it back in the night when everyone else is sleep.
I haven't got hurt or being starved, they still acted like nothing happened in the family, they laughed and they talked about casual things. And they laughed whenever I try to explain why I wanted to go back home. I don't want to call the police, They are famlily after all. I don't have a sim card in my phone. I don't know how to drive.

323,"I have been with my girlfriend now, ex-girlfriend for quite some time and I was and still am madly in love with her and I thought she felt the same but now I am unsure.  We both decided that we shouldn't use protection during sex and she had told me to just cum inside of her. I knew the risk but in the heat of the moment I decided to do it anyway, I love this girl. We had spoken about having children before but honestly we were and still are not prepared for it at all. Fast forward a month and I see the signs and confirm my suspicions with a pregnancy test and yes turns out that she's pregnant we both were excited but nervous about it but regardless I told my parents as soon as I found out. They were supportive they really liked her and told me that they have my back in this situation no matter what. On the other hand, my girlfriend's parents weren't thrilled at all they immediately started bombarding her with questions and causing her an enormous amount of stress, and because I still had to explain to my parents what I was gonna do and had a lack of transportation she was left all alone in that situation. I feel sorry about the whole thing I had left her alone in an important moment and the parents saw it as disrespect and I can agree that things could've been better. But what do I know I'm so limited on experience I just graduated from high school a few months ago she graduated the same time as me I'm young there's still so much that I don't understand and I get that. It was a really irrational decision but it was bound to happen one way or another they gave me so much alone time with her even letting me stay over at their house. The day after giving the news her aunt had taken her to the doctor to confirm whether or not she was really pregnant, and yes she was already a month and 4 days in. The aunt spoke to me about how I need to assume my responsibilities and man up and that I should be mentally prepared for when I speak to my girlfriend's parents so I did I spent a lot of time attacking myself because I already knew my gut feeling was telling me this was gonna go bad. I was feeling a lot of regret at the moment feeling like I should've put way more thought into things, and the talk went bad. After arriving at there house after the doctor's we waited a few hours and the moment came. Her parents called me outside and said let's talk. I was extremely nervous I didn't know what I could say to them to comfort them on the situation so I stood there getting yelled at by her mother. She kept asking me ""what now, what are you gonna do?"" I said that I was going to take responsibility for my actions and raise my child with her, but it wasn't enough for them. Regardless of whatever I would say it kept coming back to that question, the conversation continued going in circles for what felt like an hour and it was very one-sided. Finally, she gave me an ultimatum. She said ""either you move in here with us and raise this child with my daughter or you never show your face here ever again"" regret hit me instantly, they have a big family and eyes were already on me the whole time I was in the house. The spot she recommended we sleep wasn't big enough. Literally a corner of a room on a futon. I was given a week to think about what I was gonna do. But I knew that if I were to stay it would be constant bickering about me and how I don't have anything in check how I'm unprepared and immature and just a child, I was told that I am an adult and would be treated as such. If that was really true tell me why I had to make this decision? this should've been between me and my girlfriend I had options for better living and job opportunities already presented to me. Why would I pass up on these things? Why would I listen to her parents when they were both drunk and high telling me these things? Why would I ever in any situation want to raise a child in those conditions? And move far from these opportunities when I don't have any means of transportation at the moment and would lack the support from my family as well. Are these just excuses I'm telling myself because I don't want to live over there? Am I just a selfish piece of shit? Or did I make the right decision by not falling into that trap? and instead, looking for an alternative. I never once claimed that I wanted an abortion because I don't or that I was gonna run away from this all and abandon my child. On the contrary, I want to be with my girlfriend and raise this child I love her even if she hates my guts right now at this moment and sees me as some coward and I tried my best to make that clear to her parents too but there was no getting through. I need to find a way to raise this child even if it has to be without her. I swear I would do anything to support my child but I can't raise one in those conditions. I'm so clueless right now. My girlfriend didn't even allow me the week to give an answer. Instead, she texted me saying that I need to decide now. I told her to wait for me and she replied saying ""I need you here and you don't want that"" I told her that if she truly believes that I would do something like that to leave me. And she did I'm heartbroken I feel like everything I've had going with her has gone to shit and I want to blame her parents but I'm honestly unsure of whether or not I'm in the wrong here. I'm really suicidal about it all but I know I have to be strong for my baby and that there is no turning back. My girlfriend texted me some more saying some contradictory things like we need to speak, and then the next day texting me that she already told me everything she has to say when in reality she told me nothing. This leads me to believe that her parents are either influencing her or directly telling her what to say and I don't like it, she's like a whole different person she keeps blocking me and unblocking me on Instagram posting these pictures of herself on her story looking worry free. Telling me nothing just keeping quiet on how SHE feels. And if this really is how she feels I guess I never knew her that well to begin with. I made a HUGE mistake, I'm very aware what I did was wrong I don't deny it I want to become a better man for her and the baby but I'm not even allowed to see her so now what do I do? This is a long one I know. I keep going back and forth from this numbness to these suicidal thoughts and anxiety attacks. But I just want to know if my decision was the right one I've left out a few details and I will answer back if need be but I don't know how long I can keep this up every day without her is becoming more and more stressful. I can't even imagine how she's feeling about all this she's pregnant and has all these hormones flowing through her she's probably going crazy but I don't even know how to talk to her at this point. What do I say? What could I possibly do to make things better? I applied for two jobs yesterday one of which I had a connection so I'm more likely to get it. I got myself a debit card and an ID, I'm also working on my license. I'm really trying to become a better man. But I feel no real understanding of my situation and intentions from her parents instead I feel hated and misunderstood. And how am I expected to live in a house with those types of negative emotions going around? I would be even more miserable and stressed and maybe even take that out on my girlfriend which is toxic and not good for her or the baby. The parents expressed the fact that they have no real need for me and that they have everything set financially. That even without me the baby will have everything it needs. They also told me that she will not be able to leave the house unless I marry her. But how would I do that when I can't show up over there or get their blessing on it? And will that even be a good idea forcing a marriage like that? I'm so sorry for how long this post is I'm stressed and need to vent in some way but I don't know how. I thought coming here would be a good idea. If you've made it this far I thank you for taking the time out of your day to read all this. Please be as honest as possible with me if you feel my actions were cowardly feel free to tell me so. Please have no filter with me speak your minds on this matter. What would you have done different? What can I do to change things? I will answer any questions and respond to opinions on this asap. Thank You.",17Dec2019,1

325,"currently being considered for a promotion at my job. it’s a little above minimum wage and I’ve worked here for almost 2 years. 

recently got some new coworkers that I can’t stand who are also being considered for a promotion, the job is getting old and unrewarding, plus I kind of got screwed over on getting a pay raise. 

was looking for a new job and found an opening that I do qualify for but they might end up choosing someone with more experience (said in the qualifications a bachelors is preferred but not necessary, but I do have the combined experience for this job). This new job would be about $2.50 more than what I would be making if I got promoted. 

My thing is, I have bad anxiety. It took me a while to get used to my current job but now I’m a pro at the procedures and things. If I got a new job my anxiety would be terrible trying to learn my way around this new job if I got it. I don’t know how long the process would be for me to get my promotion but if I got the new job I would start in late February. I haven’t applied for it yet, though. Any advice?",17Dec2019,1

328,"I really shouldn’t be whining. I just got accepted into my dream school with an incredible scholarship. So, why am I not really feeling it? Sometimes I kinda grin to myself and imagine how great it’ll be, but I feel like I’m envisioning my undergrad years differently now that I am actually about to attend. I feel disillusioned, but nothing happened to make me feels this way. Nevertheless, I still know it is a great university. I just don’t understand how my brain, as soon as I got accepted, decided to stop fantasizing about the university..

Haven’t lost motivation or anything. Just.. why am I no longer happy from things that I’ve worked very hard to achieve? Not necessarily materialistic things, either. Like, getting a good grade or making a friend smile, or reading the types of books that I’ve run to throughout my teenage years. Hanging with friends is fun while it lasts, but I feel like the collegiate chapter of my life looms over me wherever I go. I can’t find joy in my high school now that I know I will definitely be at an amazing place in only a few months.  Also, just saying, I have had an INCREDIBLE experience in high school. My public school is one of the best things to ever happen to me. 

I have a stable number of friends, and I most definitely haven’t lost motivation to succeed in school. I’m thinking that I’ve become less invested in things, such as books, video games, and (sadly) friends, because I know that, in a few months, we will be scattered across the country. I will have to move on and meet new people, have a new best friend. And, I will not have much time to keep up with my hobbies because of the rigor of my college’s academics.

Those are just my thoughts, I guess. Not really sure what’s wrong. Is this just.. growing up? Lmao. Sorry. Any advice, insight, or anything, really, would be amazing. Thanks, you guys.",17Dec2019,1
329,"I am 30 years old, and am feeling kind of discouraged at the moment. I was addicted to opiates for half my life, but got myself clean 6 months ago. I even finally quit smoking weed almost a month ago now. For the first time since I was 15, I can pass a drug test. I also have a clean record, somehow. The only work I have done is some independent landscaping for family and friends, and also did some work on my grandparents wheat farm in the summer for their harvest. 

I finally feel ready to get some steady employment, and have been filling out applications off Craigslist since last week. No one has gotten back to me yet though.  I can't blame them either, my resume is almost non-existent for someone my age. I just don't feel qualified for anything, to be honest, and I don't really have any references either.

I am close to a large city in the Western Washington area, so it is not like I am in the middle of nowhere or anything like that. I guess I was wondering if there was a place that could help someone like me find employment and maybe get comfortable with the interview process? I could really use something to keep me busy right now, and I do think I would do well, if I was given the chance.

336,"I recently had a boss at work snap on me, he began raising his voice at me over things he later admitted he knew nothing about (I’ll get to that). What it boils down to is he was essentially telling me I’m useless at my job and (without directly saying it) suggested he doesn’t want me there. I told him firmly that “you don’t talk to your employees that way” to which he replied with “what do you know about being a manager”, I gave it to him straight and told him that no matter what my experience is, he has no right to talk down on me for simply not liking me (another thing I’ll get to in a minute). He said he wasn’t dealing with it, and that I could take it up with another boss

After spelling it out for him, I went back to my assigned task, and continued it. Not 3 minutes later, he calls me to his office, where he, and my supervisor, are waiting. I’m fairly confident that the call to the office was a way for him to cover his back, as he literally just went off on me and said some pretty rude things that no boss should ever say to an employee. I believe this is the case because he’d drop these little apologies while I was in the office and said he’d treat me better in the future. we spent the next 45 minutes going back and fourth about how my work ethic is bad and listening to my boss contradict himself numerous times. At one point, he looked to my supervisor and spoke like I wasn’t even in the room and says “I know one thing I can say that will resolve this whole issue right now”, like he was threatening to fire me. even though I give it my all, and then some (for example: working on thanksgiving, staying past my clock out time when asked, being respectful towards them, going an extra mile here and there, and so on), nothing I do is ever good enough. I admit that I’m a slow learner, but some of the things I’m getting accused of just don’t make sense. They’re saying I don’t listen to what I’m told, I have a hard time believing this because in every other thing I do, whether I’m on a call with the volunteer fire department, helping family or friends with something, or just being there for someone when they need a person to talk to, I’ve always received complements on how good of a listener/hard worker I am (I’m not trying to boast, I’m only mentioning this because it’s important here). 

I’ve heard from a few fellow employees that this boss and supervisor can be rough to deal with, but no one seems to get it quite as hard as I do. Since I’ve started, this particular boss (there are 4 that work random days throughout the week) has always had it out for me. Anytime I have a question, or need to tell him something, it’s like I’m being a huge bother to him. One night in particular, shortly after I started, and was still training, the supervisor wasn’t there, so this boss was directly in charge of me. He orders me to do something, and while I’m in the process of doing it, he approaches me and says something along the lines of “I expected you to mess this up, but it’s not that bad”, yeah bud, that’s a great thing to tell your new employee, really makes them feel good to know you’ve got no faith in them whatsoever. When I brought this up in the office, he denied it, and then said “I can ask anyone who works here, and they would tell me I don’t talk down to people like that”, of course they wouldn’t, but you should hear how they talk about you when you’re not around, completely different story. He apparently knows very little about what I do, because during the “meeting” (more accurately, an argument) he admitted as much, saying that he doesn’t have time to look after each department, because his day is too busy. The supervisor on the other hand is an alright guy, it’s just that no matter what I do, it’s never right, even if I’m 110% confident I did the task right. I thought maybe I was just a bad listener, until a co-worker told me that he gets the exact same treatment. 

I can’t go to another boss about this because they cover for each other, I know this from a past experience. long story short, when I was hired, my availability was never covered, weeks later, I asked a boss about setting up my availability which he said should’ve been covered in my interview, i told him it wasn’t and that I was told it would be taken care of at a later date, which is the truth, and so he talked to the boss that hired me, and he said I told them “I am always available”. These two bosses in question are separate from the one this post is about. If I go to another boss and say hey, this is what I’m dealing with, can you help me? they’re going to run to the boss I’m having trouble with, and go with whatever he chooses to say because they are all friends, and take whatever each other says as gospel. My concern is that corporate will have a similar approach, taking their side on the situation.

I don’t know what to do. I can find a new job, but I don’t really wanna go through that headache. There’s other reasons why I’d just rather not leave, the pay is good, My only friends here work there, and probably won’t talk to me if I leave for fear of the bosses finding out they hang out with “that guy who quit cause he didn’t like the boss”. but this guy is gonna make it really hard to stay, he even said in the office “I can tell this is going to be an issue that lasts a long time”. What am I supposed to do? how do i get around this? Would this be considered abuse of power? I should also point out that this job makes it very clear that we don’t have a union, and that we won’t get support from them on issues we have with the occupation, plus, I’ve heard a few horror stories of what happens and how much worse you can be treated after getting the union involved. What should be my next course of action, and how should I approach this going into the future, I’m expecting a battle I have no chance of winning, but I’m just holding out hope that someone has advice that could help this situation.

Most of my time after high school has been spent in isolation without a social life. I've got two friends but I only go out perhaps once every three months or so with them. My only hobby for the longest time had been gaming, literally nothing else. What's worse is that for years I'd been content and happy with that.

I have never been able to hold a job for long periods of time as I've never been motivated by money. Being at work contributed heavily to my anxiety and depression to the point of having to quit.

I've seen multiple therapists and taken many different medications but to no effect at all. I no longer find happiness in the few things I do usually enjoy.

340,"Sorry for my writing I just really want advice and I’m typing fast.

So I have this friend, let’s call her Jane. We got really close this year, but I know recently my personality’s changed. I’ve become more negative and pessimistic. And I’m trying really hard to change that. I’m on the wrestling team and whenever you miss a day of practice and if you say the reason why you missed was because “I was sick”, if you were hurting where you couldn’t really use the part of the body (like your arm or leg) or if you were playing another sport you’d be criticized so much. Automatically people on the team will say “so, I cracked my ankle and I still wrestled”, “it’s wrestling season why you in track”. I used to say those words to underclassman whenever they missed practice because that’s how much I loved the sport and I never understood why people would do other sports because wrestling was that fun at the time. I was pretty reckless. I would still wrestle whenever I fractured something, if one of my limbs hurt so bad I would still continue. I would come home cut and bruised up (I’m easily bruised) and be lazy and not ice anything. I would go shower then go straight to bed.but now I’m trying to put my body first and heal because people that do wrestle like that don’t wrestle to their full potential because they don’t ice or stretch whatever’s hurting. I was on the grind for many years, it’s my senior year and one of the wrestling coach that everyone liked reassigned and wrestling isn’t fun like it used to be. I’m trying out for sprints and throws and honestly practice is really fun. But whenever Jane asks where I’m at whenever we have practice, I tell her I’m at track practice and she’s so against it. She’s always like “smh”, “it’s wrestling season” or “tracks lame”. I get really sad because I get criticized whenever I’m not wrestling. I don’t understand why they want me to wrestle, in my opinion I’m not even good at wrestling. There are so many other wrestlers that are way better then me that are on the team. Now I understand why people with experience with wrestling don’t really do it in highschool because it used to be a passion but you grow up, yah know? (It’s because whenever I would try and recruit people and meet other fellow wrestlers they would always tell me they were just tired of the sport) I feel like I’m unable to do things I want to do. She’s one of my only friends I talk to outside of school but I just want her to be supportive of what I want to do but I cant force her to be that way. Whenever I try to stand up for what I like she tells me “ok” and just reads my messages. I end up saying sorry in the end and also say “I’ll go to wrestling practice tomorrow” or “sorry for being a bad friend”. Am I a bad friend? Am I too weak to be doing this sport? I usually support her if she chose to do another sport. She’s in waterpolo and sometimes she tells me that she might do waterpolo again. It upsets me because i want her to be there with me at tournaments and duals but if she wants to do that I’m all for it. My mental health has gone way down hill too. I haven’t been happy recently. I’ve broken down a few times recently. And I can’t talk to Jane about it because she awkward I’m those types of situations so I don’t go to her. I don’t really have that support system so I usually cry to myself. I know it might sound dumb or you might think I’m lying but I get seasonal depression. I usually get depressed in the winter. I’ve just been so unmotivated and unhappy and to hear things like this on a daily basis, it’s just weighing on me. I don’t know what to do. I think I might quit wrestling all together. There’s a part of me that still wants to do wrestling because it’s my last year but the team is kinda toxic (Theres a lot of problematic people on the team) What should I do?",17Dec2019,1
341,"Context: 
A year and a month ago, my 2 year relationship with a girl who was severly depressed ended. Our relationship was too much for both of us to handle properly and we ended up causing a lot of suffering for one another. We went through rough times and from what i recall, it seemed that we would agrue more often than being on good terms. It felt like there was so much negativity abd toxicity in our relationship. Apart from that we were irresponsible because at 15, we were expecting a baby. We made the choice of having an abortion and it was something i feel like she wasn't able to come back from because from then, our relationship became more and more unstable to the point it was no longer salvageable. Breaking up was inevitable as we would argue a lot and it got really tense and hurtful. She hated me, a lot. Once broken up, it was about a couple months later that her and my best friend began to date. You could imagine the pain i felt. I became incapable of dealing with so much baggage that i sought out a therapist. This happened earlier this year in january while we were 16. Fast foward a couple months to april, both of us now 17, she tries to come back after everything that has happened. I was still very hurt but felt like we could work towards getting on good terms. That only lasted a week as she wanted to be my friend and his but i couldnt. I gave her an ultimatum and she proceeded to go back to my best friend, no longer my friend btw. Then during june she leaves him and on the same day gets with another friend of mine. Their  fling only lasted a month. However, she then attempted to go back to my ex best friend but failed as he no longer wanted anything to do with her as she left him twice and he was upset from that. A week after school commenced, she once again began to date the other friend and has been to this day. I don't know if she still hates me but sometimes i hear things that make it seem she still doesnt like me. I no longer need therapy because ive been able to overcome most of the trauma or emotional abuse/pain that i suffered. 

About me: 
I was really naive entering into that relationship. I wanted to save her from her depression but during our relationship, i was too inexperienced and immature to understand that its simply not how it works. Because of that, i realize there are moments in our relationship where i see how that affected our relationship. I tried protecting her as much as i could and trying to change her into being ""strong"" ""kind"" ""happier"" more ""mature"" like ""me"" but that was selfish and poor of me because i didnt understand what it was i could do to help her. Now, i think the best i could have done would have been to allow her to figure it out at her pace without pressuring much and pushing her too hard. 

We go to the same school and its really small, at almost any corner of the hallway, you can see pretty much everyone meaning I've lved this entire year seeing her with someone else. It was incredibly hard because i couldn't focus in my classes where she was in them too, walking by and seeing her and her boyfriends was very difficult, and trying to put myself back together by learning how to become a healthy individual was really tough too when i was constantly facing adversity. With all that being said, i cant help but feel like i want her to stay in my life. I know by now that i do not love her in a romantic way, but i do very much care for her and wish to be her friend. I notice she is sad and practically alone as she doesnt have many other people with whom she is close too except her bf but judging by her history, that probably wont last long. Her relatipnships with her parents have always been tricky as they are seperated and unfortunately for her she lived with her toxic parent who is at fault for many of her insecurities and bad habits. Some of the things he's done are awful and no kid should have ever dealt with that. So i still empathize with her even though we fell out, but Im unsure of what to do. I also miss talking to her, sometimes a lot. I wish we can hang out and get along but i also just want to no longer have to deal with the repercussions of her actions. I understand it is unhealthy to go back and its risky which is why i haven't attempted anything because im tired of this and want to be happy. However now i feel good about this and have wondered if i should do it because i care deeply about her, as a friend.

Any advice?",17Dec2019,1
342,"Throwaway account. For the record, we are a family of 4. Mother(51), father in law (63?), me (27M) and my sister (29.) Now that that's out of the way, here comes the big question.

&amp;#x200B;

My father in law is *very* emotionally abusive to the family at times, more often my sister though than anyone else. We've lived in this household for almost 4 years now, and since that time, my sister has been having some severe mental breakdowns after FIL has one of his sessions of 'you are not intelligent, you have no clue of what you are doing, you can't comprehend anything,' ect. My sister works, my mother works, FIL does not due to illnesses. My sister has been working her ass off to better herself and help the family, because despite her having depression for a while she knows she wants to improve. But any single time she makes an improvement, it always seems like he's there to kick her right back down.

My mom isn't home often given her job, so she isn't ever really around to give her insight. But even when she is, he will always find a way to berate her in some shape or form. I feel like the only reason why I don't get this treatment is because I don't even talk to him in the first place. I keep to myself, I only do things that need to be done around the house, then I'm back to my own business. 

But today, today was a real bad day. I woke up to my sister screaming about wanting to end it all, with scissors in her hands and knives strewn across the floor. 

Cops were called because FIL said he wanted them to take my sister to a mental hospital, and after she told the cops about all of the abuse in the end that she had received from him, I found out later that he's been texting/talking to my mom and trying to spin things to go back into pitying him or some such. 

I want out of this household, I want to protect my sister, and my sister doesn't even want to come home unless he's gone or we move houses. My mother seems to be pretty firm about moving out now when I talked to her, but I'm honestly afraid of what's going to happen to us if we do. 

I've been sitting in my room riddled with anxiety and unable to move ever since the cops took my sister away to a hospital. I hid the knives just in case, but the second I heard him come in the house I immediately hid in the closet and had 911 ready on the dial. We have guns in the house, and ever since we got them I was always afraid that one day I'd wake up just to be shot or not wake up at all.

The question is, how do I go about this? How can I get my family out of this situation that doesn't end up in us getting literally hurt in the crossfire? Because I'm afraid that if this happens one more time my sister might finally do the deed and I won't be able to stop it.",17Dec2019,1

350,"I got a new receptionist over the past year and she's really been great. She always goes above and beyond to follow up on things, take the initiative, and make people happy. I couldn't be happier with her. She's in her 20s and is married with a young child.

I make around $280K CAD before taxes.

I was thinking of giving her a $100 CAD gift card for a large chain that sells clothing for all ages and household things (I figure she can spend it on herself or her kid). I honestly can afford more but I don't want to be too extravagant and make it seem weird. I could give $200 CAD quite easily. I wouldn't want to go higher as I think that would be too extreme.

What do you think? Is there any etiquette I should follow? I'm thinking $100 is safe but still clearly ""nice""? Or $150? Might be pushing it?

I have never given any of my prior receptionists anything as frankly they've all been pretty lazy and I have never felt the need to thank them in this way. But she has really been exceptional and I want to show my gratitude because it's made my life easier.

I'm in a moderately sized organization where most people in my position just give their reception teams a box of chocolate to share. But I'm not into that sort of thing. Chocolate isn't even good for you. There's no formal rule for or against gift giving. Either way, I would ask her to just keep it to herself that I gave her that as I don't want anyone else to get jealous. She's good with discretion so I don't think that would be an issue. Because that's the other risk of being generous - I don't want people then gossiping about it or for people to think I'm making a pass at her which I'm not.

Any thoughts appreciated.",17Dec2019,1

354,"Hey there, I'm just exploring men and their psychology, I don't wanna appear rude lol. I noticed that men usually think about banging you in the first conversation. Some of them might not even be interested in the conversation but they act along and agree just to get in sync with the woman. It's like they know everything about a girl's weaknesses, her likes and dislikes, her insecurities, etc, and they can instinctually act like they care, and we do fall for it thinking that the man actually cares for you, but that isn't true. How do you know when a guy is just acting to get in your pants, and how do you know when what he is saying is genuine?

357,"So, to sum things up. This semester, I failed two college courses: Programming Fundamental II and Calculus 2. I withdrew Programming 2 while trying my best to pass Cal 2 but ended up with an F. So I admitted to my sister, which I live under her roof, and she is very disappointed. Now she doesn't pay for my courses, financial aid does, and since I'm an orphan I still have to pay for my car insurance, phone bill, and food.  


So today, I admitted to my sister that I failed (for simplicity, let's say that I failed both of them) both of my courses. She has a policy that I can keep living with her as long as I keep attending college. Anyways, I have until Friday, 12/16, which is 4 days to think about what I'm going to do next. After I figure out, I have to let her know what my next step is because she also has to know because people will ask her ""Why did you kick your brother out?"". I want to leave my sister because I can't stand her. She's your typical, fearmongering, negative reinforcer sister. I'm 20 and I still have a fucking bed time because I live under her roof.  


I have no job experience, ever. At the same time, I just want to put a pause on college. Maybe spend a year or two off. But if I do, my whole family is going to look down at me. I will be a disgrace because I live in an Asian household. Also, I have no where to move into if I wanted to move out. I used to live with my half-sister for 4 years but she has intentions on moving to a different city in a couple of years once my cousin graduates. If I choose to live with my half-brother, hes going to have high expectations because he's a FOB. Plus, if he hears that I ""quit"" college (a year or two break of college) he's going to berate and belittle me. I don't know what to do. Not only do I not know what to do, I don't know what to pursue in college. I thought I'd enjoy coding but I don't so I have to find a new passion. I also need a job.

Just a bit a go she messaged me that her favorite bar tender asked her out to coffee.

At first she posted a status that read, ""He's cute Af"" then deleted it.

I asked how she was doing and said infatuated

When I asked with what or whom she didn't want to reply. Left me in seen. I usually don't mind but she seemed off

I let her know that she seemed off and said she doesn't know how to feel about anything rn.

Then changed plans we made. 

After that, we go back to the beginning, that the bartender asked her out to coffee and she asked if it was ok with me.

I love this girl. I know it seems to soon to feel this way. But, I said it was she said it back. It felt real. 
No one has ever appreciated me like she has. And now I'm very afraid she's gonna break it off... It's been kinda looming in the background lightly but I noticed.

She got off a bad relationship 5 months so she's been having a hard time showing me emotions but she insured me that she felt the same about me. But at the same time she seemed a little more happier when talking about going to the bar.

I gotta let her go if I love her right? Like a break and if she comes back she wants to continue and if doesn't guess that's all the love she had for me... There's still hope but I gotta brace for losing her when ever right? Don't wanna hold anyone back... May just be in my head... Any thoughts out there?

362," I'll keep this as brief as possible. I struggle with what I assume is chronic depression. I constantly think about cringey moments from my past, and I have a constant inner monologue running all the the time that tries to reconcile certain events with who I am. I am a 24 year-old alcoholic, and I drink to excess everyday. I first started having suicidal ideation at 9 years old. I remember talking to my friends in 3rd grade about hanging myself.
 I grew up in a strict Fundamentalist-baptist household. Most of the extremism was fueled by my former step-father. It was rough. He threw me around one time, but that was after I ""bowed up"" at him when I was 18 after he started to to take the door to my bedroom down.
 I don't want to blame him for everything because I was somewhat of a little shit. I do want to add that he and my mother have been going through a divorce for 5+ years now. He was diagnosed with NPD(as far as I know), and my mother still spends some of her time watching videos about Narcissistic Personality Disorder to this day. These are just facts. He tried to show me some practical things, and I wish I would've been more receptive to the knowledge he tried to pass to me.
 He could be a nightmare sometimes. I'm drug addict too btw, even though I don't do those things much anymore because I find maintaining relationships with drug-dealers to be too tedious. I find almost every relationship to be too tedious now. I love my family and the 2 friends (they're a couple) I live with. I've only had 1 relationship with a woman, and that ended with her cheating, and I've struggled to get back in the arena since. In a way, I'm thankful, but I'm convinced I'm only attracted to most women's bodies, while finding their personalities repulsive. This fact is probably moreso how I feel about people in general than just women. The eternal ""score-keeping"", y'know? It sucks because I know I'm not better than they are. I just want things to be as simple as possible. I don't have some porn addiction btw, in fact I haven't done that in a pretty considerable amount of time. 
 God, this was supposed to be brief. In conclusion, I think the solution for me is to be heavily medicated. I feel like I've been self-medicating with the only means available to me for so long. I want to let go, but my fears drown me. I've ran away from the opportunities given to me, whether they were from universities, the military, or just lowly management positions. I work a shitty delivery job now, and I only stick with it because if the limited human-to-human interaction. Here we are; I guess I'm just gonna let it all hang out.",17Dec2019,1

372,"There is a too long didn’t read

For some background information.

We’ve all been friends since seventh grade, and I moved away in ninth grade to be homeschooled in a three hour different time zone. Up until this incident we’ve texted multiple times daily since then. On the rare occasions we Skype (3 years of long distance ). They are great compassionate empathetic people and have never treated me poorly on purpose in any kind of way.

Occasionally, we play video games with each other while we’re on Skype and sometimes they do cancel or reschedule. School out there doesn’t get out till 3ish which is 6ish my time, and some of them have afterschool activities, family matters, spending time with other friends, Any other prior obligations that you can think of teenagers might have. So when they cancel plans or they can’t make plans for that date I’m understanding and I don’t bother them about it. Yes, it does make me a little sad but they have their own lives to live in things to study for. I on the other hand, graduated two years earlier worked a few jobs (not anymore) and now applying for colleges. So other words, I have a lots of free time in the very little socialization with anyone other than them

The story (It’s short and probably stupid)

Thursday:So in the group chat (Messenger) we always chat on. I’m just gonna refer to them as BD and AG. In the course of several text I propose that for an exchange of in game currency I would use their help to further my advancement in the game.

AG Explains that she will be busy for the rest of the day due to school work she needs to catch up on but the next day she will be free. BD Who was also in a similar situation, also agreed that they need to catch up on work themselves, but Friday sounds great.

Friday:Conversation goes back to usual. At 9:22 my time I sent “Btw tell me when you guys are ready to play (game)” I specifically did this at this time because it is around 6 their time and I don’t really like to immediately text them right after getting out of school. I kind of feel like after school you should unwind a bit and to me it can just seems a bit...aggressive(?) to text them first thing they get out “hey let’s play now. ” Anyway the message was shown a seen by both of them in less than minutes. I wait for a response. 10pm....I start doing the dishes to keep me busy........ 11pm I’m waiting for a response....... 1am....... OK so they probably forgotten and went to sleep. (I checked my phone multiple times then what has been typed) Whatever they will text me when they wake up because sometimes you just fall asleep by accident. I understand that I do that all the time. I stayed up till 12:27pm Saturday. (I’m kind of a night owl) BD sends a link to some funny video if she found...... My text would literally be the first thing you see when you open up the group chat at the very bottom. 

AG: sends a meme template and my text would still be visible. And it continued on like that for the rest of the day and the next as if nothing happened. With each text in a notification popping up on my screen I began to get frustrated and sad (I turn off notifications )

I was heartbroken. I continuously made excuses for them in my head. Maybe they fell asleep? Maybe I read the text wrong and misunderstood? Maybe they meant next Friday or the Friday after that? After all of those thoughts I started blaming myself. Maybe I was too pushy? Maybe they’re tired of me? In my head I was the problem I was just being too petty and I need to get over it. Maybe when I have calm down a bit I can talk to them. It’s been four days since then and I am still in my feelings. Because along with those questions in my head I had many rebuttals that I did not like. Even if they fell asleep or forgot they would’ve seen your message. You read the text over 15 times it’s not wrong. Perhaps I don’t matter as much as I care for them. Maybe they’re just tired of me. Maybe it’s wrong of me to think that I deserve the same? Maybe I was just so insignificant to them that it didn’t even matter if they replied. And this sort of self-hatred kind of continued.

TLDRI thought that I have been considerate, respectful, and understanding of their schedule constantly. Maybe I was wrong in expecting the same. We made plans that day and either: they forgot about it or fell asleep. if that so am I that insignificant to them that I don’t even get a reply. I don’t know what to do or how to talk to them and I’m afraid of slowly drifting away never talking to them again. Them hating me or just afraid of any answer that they give because I know I will still be upset. That’s my problem right? I don’t know anymore. They all live close to each other and go over each other houses to have sleepovers but I can’t do that.  I really treasure any amount of time they call me but maybe they don’t feel the same way.

Part of me is really scared that I’ll just wait and have no friends because they’re the only ones I have. And I want to keep them

A part says that I can’t let people treat me this way because it will just continue happening. Cut them out.

Am I overreacting or being petty?

375,"Hi all, 

I've been kind of avoiding making this choice but since deadlines are coming up soon I will have to decide within the next month. I have been given the opportunity to work for a year as an IT project manager at a sizeable company (10000-20000) employees. On the other hand, I have a bachelor's degree in physics and am looking to start my masters soon, where I'll focus on quantum computing. I have to decide whether I'll wait for a year with doing my masters degree so I can work the job, or  I'll start the degree in February. 

What I like about going into my masters degree is that it seems much more interesting to me. I love quantum computing and I would really like to learn more about it. Im excited to start this masters. On the other hand, I have quite a study debt so doing the master right away will only increase it. This is not that much of a problem though since I'll earn it back right after. My gut feeling is telling me that going to uni is the right choice. However, this may just be because of cold feet for the job, I've never worked full time before.

What I like about doing the job is the fact that I'll earn money and the nature of the job seems somewhat interesting to me. It's by far not as interesting as quantum computing - or anything really technical for that matter - in my opinion. I'm afraid that at the job I won't learn any new technical skills. I like the academic world because thinking and intellect are appreciated, whereas I'm afraid that in the project management position it will be more about status and money. I really enjoy learning hard skills, programming, physics, using my brain, etc... I don't know yet whether management will satisfy me. One of my main concerns is that the experience as a project manager will be useless when I'll go into research or something technical in the future. I really do enjoy leading people, but rather as a lead developer, or someone who is still very much focused on the technical aspects.

Ask this question from you, what are the things you will do if this will be your last day? Write down those things on a page and start doing those. Some of you will be thinking is this guy mad then I am gonna reply Absolutely “ **no** ”. So let’s start…

“ Tomorrow is a blessing, not a right.”

So the thing towards which I want to draw your attention is basically living in the present moment neither in the past nor in the future. Why? You will never lead a happy life. So try to be in the present.

And think about this what will remain in your life when you will get to know that this is your last day on this earth and you were just chasing your dreams in the past, was not living the present moment. Was just thinking about your future more than your present.

Think about your future but don’t completely immerse yourself into it. It will just drain your energy and make you weaker from inside and move far away from society. ",17Dec2019,1
377,"My (22) best friend (18) has recently started smoking. She had smoked in the past, but about a month ago, while fighting with her girlfriend (22), she started again. Myself and her girlfriend are extremely worried about this for her health, but us worrying seems to bother her. She keeps telling us that she's smoking only 1-2 cigarettes a week, but I know for a fact that it's more than that, and steadily increasing. She says that she's only bought one pack and I do believe that. Her girlfriend asked if she was going to stop when she finished the pack and she said she was going to, but only to avoid the confrontation- she isn't planning to quit. 

It's a very sticky situation. She wants her own autonomy, but her girlfriend and I are very concerned for her. She has been in abusive relationships in the past, so she has a hard time understanding/accepting/believing our concern, and gets more annoyed than anything about it, because she isn't used to people caring about her. She's aware of the dangers but just doesn't care. We don't want to force her to do anything but we both really want her to stop, or switch to a less harmful alternative like vaping. 

What we've been thinking of doing is talking to her together if she gets another pack. We want to be a unified front but the problem is that neither of us are willing/want to force her to do anything, we just want to get our concerns through to her.

381,"So basically me and this girl are in a friends with benefits situationship sort of thing. As soon as we met eachother, we had sexual tension, and we both picked up on it. So we kind of started off that way. It kind of messed up the speed in which we got to know eachother, because we were going really fast, and there were a lot of boundaries that were crossed early on.

Fast-forward 6 months after knowing her. We’re laying in bed together and it dawns on me; it kind of seems like we’re a couple. Like, we hang out almost everyday, we cuddle, we say I love you, and a bunch of other lovey stuff. And immediately after coming to this realization, I felt worried that I was leading her on. Those were not my intentions, and i didn’t have any real feelings for her. 80% of the time, we don’t really have anything of substance to talk about. I often dont like how she makes me feel. Our humor is very different. When we go out,  I sometimes wish I‘d stayed home. Like, we just aren’t compatible in that way. I’ve been in love once in my life before, and so I know how it feels. Not saying I expect love to always feel the same way, but i’m pretty darn sure I do not feel that way for her. Even the fact i have to question it says enough.

Anyways, so I felt obligated to talk about it with her, and it turns out, to my genuine surprise, she HAD caught feelings for me. She actually cried about it, which hurt a lot to see, and the whole thing kind of fucked us up. Fast forward another month or two. We’re on good terms now.  The deal is that we’re regular friends (for now at least). We agreed to just get to know eachother normally and get closer.

Now here’s what’s messing me up. The other night we’re on facetime and she’s telling me about some guy she thinks is cute. Why is it that I got this horrible feeling when i heard that?? Then, recently (on facetime again) she tells me that she hooked up with some guy. Why did my heart sink to my stumach?? I swear i’m not in love with her, so am i just possessive? selfish?? Why can’t I stand the idea of her being with someone else? I want to be happy with her but I can’t help it. Is it my ego? Am I jealous?? Logically I know that there’s no reason for me to feel this way, but I still do? 

Is it possible that I do actually love this person? And if so, why am I so in denial?? I’m just lost. I spend a lot of time convincing and explaining to myself why I don’t like her (which sounds dumb, I know) but whenever she says things like that it just really annoys me.",17Dec2019,1

I know this seems pathetic and stupid for me to feel ""hopeless"" over something so small. but I've always been a type A person and grades have always mattered to me. last year I almost got a B in my math class and I attempted suicide. yeah. I know I'm not mentally stable right now but I can't get help. not right now. I had an A in one of my classes, but today we got back our essays and my grade dropped four percent, bringing it down to a B. I was basically crying throughout the period trying to hide my tears and sniffling. I'm not one to cry very much, and so when I do, it's hard for me to contain it. I went to talk to my teacher about the essay and what I did wrong, and I just started balling. after that class, I was an emotional wreck. I couldn't stop crying. I just felt like a failure. my parents just expect so much from me and they've been asking how my grades were and i kept reassuring them that they were all As, and now if I tell them I have three Bs idek what they're going to think. god, I'm so scared. I've never gotten a B in my life before. this semester is going to ruin my gpa &amp; my chances for college. i'm trying to focus and prepare for my finals but i can't stop thinking about how I'm going to fail. i just feel so overwhelmed right now and at any second I feel like I'm going to just completely break down.",17Dec2019,1

This H person I started liking her before I knew A. The A became my friend in the last month of the university. And I've known H for like 4 months.

388,"My roommate [30/M] and I [F/30] initially knew each other because we were dating for a year and a half.

We’re both non monogamous, and dated other people. Eventually my roommate said we didn’t match on sex, but wanted to still date and I told him no... I’d like to just be friends.

I do not want to get back together with him, but now, it’s just... every time I get involved with someone new I just think I’m going to disappoint them.

Sometimes when my roommate’s gf comes over (a friend of mine), it makes me feel extra bad about myself. It feels like I’m being reminded about how I wasn’t good enough, and it makes me feel ashamed that I tried.

Recently, I met someone new who was really awesome, but I just kept thinking, “oh they like me now... but that’s because they don’t know me”.

389,"Just warning you that this gets really dark. I’m 18 and I’ve gotten myself into quite a toxic relationship. At first I didn’t really like him. I wasn’t attracted to him and to be quite frank I thought he was annoying. I rejected him a few times and mostly wanted romantic and sexual attention without any labels but he kept poking me about the label situation every time we were together. After awhile I gave in. After all we were doing everything a couple would but without the labels. At first the relationship was very cute and I grew to really really like him but he started to become clingy. At first I really liked this considering all of my past boyfriend were emotionally distant but it got to be too much. He started asking me a lot of questions about my past relationships and sexual experiences and became really disappointed when he found out that I had dabbled in the dating world quite a bit and had a few sexual relations before him. My “body count” is a bit much but nothing out of the norm. In the single digits. But for some reason he made me feel really bad about it. As time went on he started controlling me. He told me what to wear or who to talk to. He monitored my activity on social media such as comments or pictures that I have liked. If I liked a picture of a man that was attractive then he would instantly point it out and it would turn into an argument. He told me I wasn’t not allowed to have any celebrity crushes and that I wasn’t not allowed to find anyone else attractive but him. He would go on to forbid me from watching porn, or purchasing any sort of sex toy. He would ask me if he was the best I’ve ever had and things along those lines and if my answers weren’t what he wanted to hear, it would result in a huge argument. Lately it’s been getting really bad because when I try to leave his house he physically holds me down and takes away my phone. His grandparents are normally downstairs and these altercations tend to get a little loud (only on his part) and he refuse a to quiet down. They never come upstairs and he claims that they are hard of hearing but it still worries me. He uses this to advantage and scares me by getting loud when I tell him to be quiet. He uses a lot of manipulation tactics to get his way. He even threatens to kill himself. There was an altercation the other day where he was asking me about one of my past partners but I didn’t want want to talk about it since we have talked about it several times and it always ends in the same situation but when I refused to talk about it, he started to get loud and he pushed me down onto the bed and held me there. He listed off all of the names of the people that I’ve been with and ridiculed me for my past sexual experiences. He twisted my arms and hit my head with his when I tried to break free. When he let go I made the mistake of slapping him which is the first time I’ve ever fought back. He continued to wrestle me and really injure me and and ended up slapping my back which left a huge handprint mark. He always apologizes and cries and seems to feel really guilty. He claims that he wants to change and even got a therapist when I told him to but things have only gotten worse. I can’t tell you why I’ve stayed after all this time. I’m afraid of being alone. He said a really nice guy sometimes and I’m really attached. I feel like no one else will find me beautiful. I know most of you will tell me to leave but I want some last minute advice on how to make this stop before I make a drastic choice.",17Dec2019,1
391,"So tldr, been wanting to try make a relationship happen with this girl for nearly 4 years, when I first met her I was terrible at socializing, stuttered, awkward silences and generally had issues with myself that would've stopped someone from thinking its a good idea to get into a relationship with me. 

Now roll on today the past month or two I've been speaking to this girl quite often planned to go out this weekend and have went out in the past together more frequently. 

Now I hate this about myself but I cant help thinking she is just feeling sorry for me and talking to me for the sake of it. I pieced together last night when her friends posted a meme of a girl being carried by lads and she comment no comment with the shush emoji. On top of that I saw she was commented in on a cute dog gif which she replied to the guy cute. 

Idk what to think I've never done anything with anyone nor had a relationship which I think could be putting people off me, or maybe people think im weird and just generally too nice idk what to think anymore as my paranoia is driving my mind crazy. I keep pushing it back but the thoughts keep rolling on in about how this may just turn out with me getting strung along. Feel like breaking down because this girl is the only girl I feel like I can talk too properly and have the same goals in life. 

Am I being stupid? Is it normal for a girl who's not in a relationship but possibly starting to talk to someone to also be talking to other lads possibly on the side? 

Suppose I just hate the feeling once again my efforts are for nothing and that I'll be back down a road of depression from this of everything blows up in my face. Need some outside advice as I have literally no one to talk to this about, parents are too old to understand this generation and my few friends would probe try say something to undermine me doing something good for myself or that their interested in the girl im speaking too so I cant rely on them for advice. 

Thanks folks",17Dec2019,1

My man and I don’t seem like we’re getting along anymore. He’s a great guy when he wants to be, but since his brother passed away 5 months ago he’s been a different guy. He undermines me and makes me feel like my feelings are invalid. Constantly. 
I love him but I don’t know if I love him enough to stay with him and keep putting up with this. We never go on dates we never go out or do anything ever. We hardly ever have sex unless I initiate. It’s never him it’s always me.  Always. It sucks and it hurts and my eyes are starting to wander.

394,"Hey there. So, I'm a 29 year old guy. Come June I'll be 30, which suddenly, out of nowhere, absolutely terrifies me. One issue with this is that I have spent my time after high school doing almost nothing when it comes to changing my job. This is for a couple reasons.

First, I hate work. I'm a good worker; my former bosses constantly call me back because I put in an honest day's work day in and day out. But I hate work. I don't hate it because I'm lazy, but because my self confidence has always been really low, and I am terrified at the thought of screwing something up. This extends to my trying to find a new job. I'm absolutely terrible with my hands, so when I hear ""Learn a trade"" I get even more terrified. And just in general, looking for and starting a new job is like trying to climb a mountain. This is exacerbated by the fact that I've never truly had a job interview. All my jobs have been friends that worked at the same place, recommended me, and the boss brought me on with almost no interview. So, even just a job interview scares the crap out of me.

Second, I have something else that fulfills me in life. I won't go into detail, but it's a volunteer work I try to take part in 4 days per week: 2 weekdays and on the weekend. This is another big reason I don't get too wrapped up in looking for a job or career or anything. I have been taking part in this volunteer work for well over a decade, and I could do it for the rest of my life. The thing is though, it pays nothing. Like, literally $0 per hour. But because of it, I don't feel any desire to pursue a career I love; all I want is a job that gets me enough to pay bills.

I'd describe my current living situation as fortunate. I moved in with my grandfather 5 years ago, intending it to be just a brief few months while I looked for a place. But, while I was there he had a massive stroke, and he wouldn't have gone in to the hospital had I not been there to witness it happening. This led to my father and aunt requesting that I stay with him. I do pay him rent, but it's pretty damn cheap. Aside from that though, I buy all my own stuff, including food, internet, car, everything. Problem is, this place has stairs, and they're starting to get to be too much for him, so he's probably going to move out by next year to some type of senior living. This would leave me with no more easy rent payments.

As regards my current working situation...it's not the greatest. I started off out of high school working at a pizza place, and soon after a friend of mine got me a job at a carpet cleaning company. Later, I switched to a different carpet cleaning company that someone I knew owned, but then the boss of the original carpet cleaning company called me back and wanted me back as he always loved my work. I took it, because I had recently moved and it was now closer. I've been working in carpet cleaning for nearly 10 years now, but don't have a particular desire to stick with it. I considered trying to start my own business doing it once, but yet again, crippling fear and doubt stopped me dead in my tracks.

For a time, I was making what was for me ok money at this job. I worked 4 days a week and my bi-weekly paychecks were close to $900-$1000 pretty regularly. This is plenty for me to live on (even if I weren't in a fortunate living situation), if I'm being honest. The main thing was I had at least 1 weekday in which I could participate in my volunteer work. Now though, my boss sold the business after basically retiring, and the new boss that came in can't seem to find work for me to save his life. Over the last year, I've seen most savings I had plummet. I was near $10k savings, and now I'm under $2k. This new boss gives me the schedule I want, which is great, but I'm only making like $300-$400 per bi-weekly paycheck, which is pretty terrible.

Something I should mention: One reason I'm not in panic mode is that I came across a windfall of money 5 years back as well, about $33k. So, I know I won't become homeless anytime soon, but I also try to pretend that money doesn't exist when it comes to paying every day bills and whatnot. It's currently making interest for me, about $40 per month. It's a nice chunk of money to have obviously, but I can't just rely on it when my current job is making me so little. That's why I pretend it doesn't exist, as if I did, I could see it diminishing very quickly.

So, with this very specific life situation in mind, does anyone have any advice for me? All I'm really looking for is a job that can get me enough to pay for my frugal lifestyle and have a little left over, while also giving me some free time to pursue what the volunteer work I really enjoy doing. Once again, the main issue is that my current job is paying so, so little, and I have this crippling fear (that I really can't describe) that prevents me from even thinking about looking for a job somewhere else, and I have no real skills which adds to that fear. Part of me wonders if I need medication or something to deal with that fear. It's so overpowering. Anyway, let me know what you think here. Sorry this is such a long post, and thank you for reading.",17Dec2019,1

397,"Throwaway first obvious reasons. I work two jobs, one I have to travel a pretty long distance for. I have one day a week off, the rest I work pretty all over the show shifts in both of those. 

Christmas is never a good time for me. Lately, I haven’t been my “cheery” self, I’ve put my head down and did the work, and occasionally mentioned or asked for advice on what to do with my pretty narcissistic, selfish and overall toxic parent. I’ve asked one of the ladies for advice, maybe complained a little bit while performing various of tasks but whenever customers came in, my cheery self kicked in. It’s a retail job, minimum wage. The second job is health industry based. 

I have to go to the second job as I have to see the parent I mentioned above. It’s a long story that is probably for another post all together and if it was as simple as me just not going to see her, I would’ve opted for that. But unfortunately it is not an option at the moment.

402," 

It's FINALS SZN! I'm trying to get the most out of my stimulants since I've been and will be pulling all nighters from Sunday night to Thursday Morning (Strategic naps are key). Morale is pretty low right now, and stimulants always help in these high stress, high absorption of large volumes of information situations that come with being a Mechanical Engineering major.

So after my adderal (prescribed) started wearing off around midnight, I decided to buy a pack of Marlboro NXT's, popped in a fresh Menthol pod (I know I have a serious Nicotine problem), and chugged some redbull. While trying to maximize and elongate the effects of all of my addictions to stimulants (amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine) I remembered something that I learned in my middle school health class, but I cannot seem to be able to adequately verify it online. Maybe I just don't have the time to do adequate research right now due to current time limitations and priorities, or maybe, like most things we learned in our middle school health class, this was also bullshit. Regardless, I am turning to you, the most intelligent people on the planet (reddit users), to try and get some answers (seriously, I made this account just for the answer to this question).

PROBLEM STATEMENT -- I remember learning about how nicotine can act as both a depressant and a stimulant, something about taking long drags of a cigarette vs. taking slow drags (an obvious correlation to dosage). I am a very heavy nicotine addict, as you probably gathered from reading this far, so this is definitely an important consideration if I wish to achieve my desired result (i.e. dopamine release, treating withdrawal, dependence, etc. all certainly have an impact in the way my body and mind respond to nicotine). For some reason when I chain smoke it does not necessarily stimulate me, but I feel slightly sedated (this contradicts what I found on google). In conclusion, I am trying to maximize the stimulation of my brain by abusing the chemical effects of nicotine. How do I achieve this? Should I intake it through slow large drags or quick small drags? Perhaps slow small drags or quick large drags (i.e. should I aim to intake a large dosage of nicotine quickly, a small dosage of nicotine slowly or vice-versa)? Has anyone done apt research into this phenomenon? any suggestions/tips/recommendations?

P.S. I am open to any other suggestions in regards to stimulating my brain without substance abuse, so if you know of any I am more than willing to try them.",17Dec2019,1
403,"Hi! I (19f) started a new job as a department manager at a grocery store by my house back in August. I love my job. I'm paid well, I have wonderful hard-working coworkers, and I have plenty of responsibility to keep me busy. The only thing I don't like about my job is one of my coworkers.

My coworker (29f), who I'll refer to as Stella, is absolutely awful towards me. She's very passive aggressive, demanding, rude, and acts very high and mighty all the time. She ignores me when I speak to her, invites the entire crew when she goes out to lunch aside from myself, has removed me off any social media she had me on, etc. She demands random acts from me as well. For example, tonight we had a vendor come in (which it is her job to check them in. I'm trained to do so if she isn't available like on lunch or covering the front end and whatnot). So I let her know, and she told me ""you go do it for me."" and walked away from me. On top of this, she's repeatedly tried to make me look incompetent for no reason. She exaggerates the time I take to get my stuff done because I don't immediately come to help her when I get to work.

I was warned when I first started that she is territorial around other women, but I never expected this. It's a constant every day thing that I can't get away from because I often work directly with her.

Normally, I'd simply brush it off and go about my day. Petty people aren't worth my time. However, she's recently been promoted and now is technically my boss when my actual boss goes home at night. She takes full advantage of this.

I've had two other coworkers (both 18m) complain to me about how rude Stella is to them as well. Once you're on her shit-list, she is just awful towards you.

I don't know what to do. I can go to HR, but if they speak to her about it she will know it was me who complained and I'm worried it will get worse. I can quit, but I don't know where I can find a job near me that pays this well and I'd need one lined up immediately. I can talk to her, but I have no idea what I would even say.

Any advice is welcome. Thanks for the read.",17Dec2019,1

He just got off of me slowly and looked shocked. He asked me if I was sure and I said yes. Then he asked if he baby was his and I got upset and screamed yes at him. I got upset and ran out the door.

2. My family might not accept me because my mother and father is very homophobic, so does my grandparents.
3. My current school thinks gay jokes (like paying hot guys for sex etc) is funny. My class really jokes about me being gay. (since my actions are sending them a ""gay vibe"" and my best friends are girls) I'm scared to come out since they might be encouraged to actually use my gayness as a weakness and as a reason to bully me.

I'm having trouble when I should come out. (Sorry for the bad English for it is my second language)",17Dec2019,1
415,"A little background info: my father and me are not close. Never have been. In fact, I hated him for years for being mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive towards me and my family. He left my mother several times, cheated on her several times, triggered addiction problems and mental illnesses in my siblings and me resulting in the suicide of one brother and almost decade long incarceration in the other. I no longer hate him, though. In fact, I feel nothing towards him. I don't even get angry when he tries to pull new bullshit with my mom or brother, bc one:it's almost expected at this point and two: he's never going to change. 

    I know, you want to know why I'm not nc with him, right? For the sake of my little sister. She has no idea who he really is. She is 25, autistic, and developmentally delayed. We've been able to hide a lot from her bc we wanted to give her as spotless a childhood as possible. And bc she's the only child of his who has regular contact with him(when he remembers to call her at the weekly scheduled time, but even she sees through his excuses bc she's actually quite intelligent), he puts forth the minimum amount of effort to be part of her life.

    So here it is. My dad recently invited me to Mexico with him and his girlfriend ""bc I'd never been out of the US and I'm x years old"". He didn't even know my age, lol. Then he asks if I think my sister would come if I was going. He asked if I could talk her into it bc I'm really the only person who could bc my sister and me are very close and I can reason with her where she normally shuts ppl out. I already knew there's no way she's getting on a plane, but he thinks if I tell her she's going to ""see her daddy"" that will change her mind, lol. It took me longer than I'm proud to admit to realize the only reason he asked me to go is bc he really only wants my sister there but needs me bc he has no idea how to take care of her, what her routine is, her daily needs, etc. Obviously my sister is not going to go. My issue is, while I'd LOVE to go to Mexico and have ALWAYS wanted to, I'm not comfortable being around my father and having no exit plan and being stranded in another country with him for all the reasons mentioned above, as well as several others. This is a great ""gift"" he's offering me, and has been trying in his own shitty ways to be somewhat decent, I suppose, and I don't want to destroy that. So how can I tell him I'm not going to be going without telling my direct reason for not wanting to go? I don't want to sound ungrateful, even though I sort of am after realizing his true intentions for my invite. I don't want to give any sort of true reason bc he really doesn't know me that well and I don't want him to, so trying to open a dialogue about the past is out of the question. I try to keep a professional relationship with him. Any advice?",17Dec2019,1
416,"A little context : I come from a really frickin poor background with a large family. I moved out at a young age and made it a huge point to be completely independent, both because I had to be a role model for my younger siblings and cousins and I didn’t want more financial hardship on my folks. Asking for money is a a huge deal for me, I haven’t done it since I moved out. 

I won a competition recently through my college, and was given an opportunity with a scholarship to go to a school in Ireland for an intensive in my program. It was a lot of money, but a rare opportunity so I told myself I was going to get there no matter what.

I knew I wasn’t going to be able to get the money together by myself in two months, I barely had any savings. 
So I swallowed my pride and asked an older relative to help me out, she sent me a check for the cost of the program. I immediately used that for a plane ticket and passport, because those are the most expensive things the longer you wait to get them. 

I also paid my deposit on the program. 
That was half the check.
Then I lost my job, and I had to pay rent
That was another half.
Then my car broke down, and how can I get a new job without a car?

So I put out the bat signal on Facebook, begging for help, and a few folks sent me a couple bucks here and there.

I was told by the school I had an extended deadline about a month ago, so I thought I had another week from now to get the money together.
But of course, I got an email today saying if I don’t cough up the full amount in 24 hours, they’re taking my spot away. 

There’s no way I’m making 1000 dollars in 24 hours.

I now have a plane ticket and a hotel and no school to go to.

My options are, tell my whole family I screwed up and wasted their money and go to the summer program, (if the school lets me even go to that one). 
Or I just go to Ireland for the week I already have paid for, and hide out from social media for the next three weeks and pretend like I went?

I’m so embarrassed. I’ve never asked for money before, and I did it publicly while telling people on Facebook where I planned to go. I told my professors, took time off classes, all this planning. Now I have to tell all those people I’m not going. I feel like shit.

How do I tell people? Do I tell them? Or do I just go and act like I went to the school? I already told my mom because we are close now and I knew she wouldn’t judge me but even she just said “email them asking for more time and give me time to think”. So I emailed them but no response. Idk what to do. I was about to sell my car today just to make up the money. Asking for more from anyone else just isn’t an option.",17Dec2019,1

They are not allowed to tell me what the principal said, but from what I've heard, they had a chat with the girls and that was it.

For me that's disgusting. I have seen the way it has affected them emotionally. And because of all this, I want to bash the kid. He is a pretty prominent guy at my school but has no friends who would back him up, but I do if really necessary. I plan on just punching him super hard, knowing the coward won't fight and going straight to the principle. Just handing myself in, and telling them I did it because he is abusing girls and will keep getting away with it. 

It's not about me being tough, it's about him being punished by a fellow dude for what he has done, and also a way to make the teachers HAVE to do something. Some additional things, he's tall, but so am I, also I'm much bulkier and would punch hard. I am not a violent person but this jerk deserves it. I am in my senior year of school. And his mum has a lot of power over the school as the head of the Parents and Community organisation at my school, also, tomorrow is the last day of the year.

So should I punch him? And how should I do it? What sought of consequences would I face?",17Dec2019,1
423,"When I turned 18 my dad made me start to give him $100 of each paycheck, and when I turned 19 he doubled it to $200. This is where recent issues started. With working one minimum wage job (I got a second job last week but won't be processed for payment there for about a month) with no set schedule, my lowest pay has been $230 and my highest was about $385. With giving dad $200, about $30 for gas, $25 for insurance, and $30 for my phone, I'm left with maybe $15 to myself, more or less.

Here's where my friends' start to get a bit outraged. If there's a large purchase that I have to make or any other reason that I'm not able to make rent, he makes me sleep in my car until my next paycheck. Then he gives me grief about making a budget, but I can't exactly budget if I'm giving him 3/4 of my paycheck. 

As well as taking my money, he also has me take care of the house's landscaping and has unrealistic expectations for such, the most prevalent being removing EVERY LEAF from both the back and front yards, despite the fact that our back yard is almost entirely woods. I try my best, have even called out of work to complete, and he doesn't reciprocate any of this with gratitude and only points out what I've done wrong. This is only the most recent incident where his behavior has upset me, but this has undoubtedly been going on since I was a kid, with punishment that didn't fit the ""crime"" or not acknowledging my success or something I'm proud of and only pointing out shortcomings. He didn't even congratulate me on getting a second job to make paying his rent easier on me, seeing as it will be doubled again to $400 per paycheck if I'm still not out of his house by June.

I don't know what to do, I really need some advice on how to get through this and what both me AND him are doing wrong in this situation.

It makes it worse as my bipolar is causing me brain to throw out many situations where she will leave my and it makes it worse, i try to occupy my days and keep busy but its not always successful.

It was the right choice for me, it's been draining me for a long time now and there have been many instances where I nearly would have gotten myself fired for blowing up on people, but I wish I had done enough job searching before I quit rather than now. 

I have enough saved up for the next few months of rent, so I'm not in a desperate time crunch to find something, but I'd still like to find something soon, in the next few weeks most definitely. I have already started looking and have applied to maybe a few dozen places, but I'm not having much luck hearing back.

433,"I didn’t really know how to put it well in the title but the gist of it is this. My old friend and I used to be best friends in elementary school, always hanging out, in and out of school, and then we sort of drifted apart because he hung out more with another group of kids I knew, but never really associated with their “gang”. We were still “friends” technically but I never heard from him or got any communication. And of course I blame myself for not reaching out as well. 

But in middle school my present group of close friends came together, and I appreciate their friendship, but one of my closest friends in that group came into contact with my old friend because of me. Which is great if I’m able to create a new friendship, but what seems weird is that even though we’re hanging together as three, I never know when he gets back from college (he lives away so comes to visit sometimes) and never hear from him, but I guess he tells my new friend every time he comes back from school. It just makes me wonder why, and part of it is my fault of course, but it should spark something in his brain as well no ? Like, maybe I should reach out to my old best friend instead of only talking to his new best friend that he’s in constant contact with...
It just seems weird to me.

Here's what I posted:
&gt; 
&gt; Rarely will people in the sub give actual heart-to-heart advice. It saddens me when I see a day old post where there's a real person having a real situation, getting real advice from someone who is clearly unqualified on this website.
&gt; 
&gt; The replies always are NTA, justifying the OP, but also discarding and not acknowledging the other party, often a parent or a close friend.
&gt; 
&gt; This post got to me.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ebjcyh/aita_for_demanding_the_same_christmas_present_my/
&gt; 
&gt; This kid clearly has a dad who loves him very much and made a mistake, but all the top comments are not addressing this and almost implying that his parents are assholes, like every other parent on the sub. I can't get a word in because the post is locked but the advice is so bad. Everyone is so quick to point fingers and say ""you're not an asshole, how dare your parents show favouritism"" while completely ignoring the dad's obvious tries to make up for his mistake. My dad never admitted his mistakes, so to see this man's attempt to do right by his son be completely ignored really hits me hard. Like determining who's being an asshole isn't the point here, it's to give some good advice to a kid who's confused during christmas.
&gt; 
&gt; Both parties are people and have their sides of the stories, and people should focus not on whether or not there even is an asshole present, but just what the best path forward. I know redditors get off on being judgemental but there are consequences to what you post here.
&gt; 
&gt; I really think the sub needs to be rebranded. These are real people, real problems, and real lives. Redditors in their current state are not fit to give emotional, life changing advice with real consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; I..um..AITA?

Maybe it's none of my business but as I said, these are real people dealing with real consequences. It's really not a safe place for mentally unsafe teenagers which clearly make up the majority of the sub. I've already posted to /r/unpopularopinion and /r/amitheasshole without any traction.

454,"So I became really close with my crush in these last 3 months and she and I showed clear signs of love towards each other. I don't want to sound like over confindent but like it was really obvious, so this saturday I declared my love to her in terrible conditions and everything happened in a catstrophic way. Now I feel that we are losing contact and I don't really want to lose it because we were like really close. I have'nt seen her in three days now, only talk via messages that were interrupted several times. Now I don't wanna force her into a relationship of course but I just wanna make things clear with her because I'm really scared atm and feeling terrible regret. Help me.",17Dec2019,1
455,"My partner and I have been together a few months but it's the situation where it just feels ""right"". We've both been married before, have kids, have had other relationships, and after just 3 months we've just moved in together, and it's awesome. 

He's had someone stalking him for ~2 years. They send untraceable messages to him, his loved ones, and his daughter (who was 11 when it started). It's believed this person previously hacked his accounts to get info from emails,phone records etc.

Police have been involved for a long time, he tried a private investigator, but this person remains anonymous. 

The stalker left a photo of him and me under my windscreen wiper 2 weeks ago - a photo from a public album that they would have had to do a lot of digging to find. And it means they know me and my car. They've messaged with my daughter's name, and messaged again saying derogatory things about me. 

I'm not too concerned safety wise because it's been this long and there's never been threats, just digging of info, and well and truly overstepping boundaries.

But now that I've been involved, it's affected me more than I want to admit to my boyfriend. We've talked about it and he's provided what reassurance he can and offered to do whatever it takes to make me feel safe. It's affected his life so much - friendships, relationships, and his general emotional well-being, I really don't want to add more to that if I can avoid it. 

I finally meet someone who I really connect with, and it comes with this - typical! I don't know how else to just let it go.

Any advice? Anyone been through similar?",17Dec2019,1
456,"Why is it girls seem to not care for guys who try their best and are overly nice? This has been my issue for years and im sick of being second best because of this.

Is it just where im from? (NE England) My friends(distancing from them now though) said one night that my efforts are being wasted on a girl I've liked for the past few years but self esteem and depression has stopped me from moving forward with her in the past on top of, I hate to say it but drug issues. Anyways my friends said im too much of a nide guy and will always be friend zoned. 

Idk what to do going forward as I dont want this last effort to talking to this girl to blowup in my face setting me back more mentally. I just keep hearing their voices saying im too nice. If any lasses are reading this please offer some advice on how you would view this. Im trying my best at the moment to stay positive but my mindset is slowly rolling back into negative thoughts which will fuck up my chances.",17Dec2019,1
457,"I'm the youngest in my family. I've been mentally fucked up and going home and staying with my mother I'm kind of just boiling up remember a lot of fuckery I've gone through while living here. My family is terrible. 

My mother is narcissistic and believes that supporting me financially to the extent that she'd give up using the money on herself makes her the greatest mother in the world. That basically accomplished nothing besides making me see how worthless money actually is. 

She didnt have the best life. She has trust issues and has been screwed over alot as far as I can tell. Recently I've come to the conclusion that her fucked up personality is the result of my aunt that raised her. They are both bad at admitting flaws or seeing themselves as being in the wrong. She also has this habbit of just working herself to the bone and then taking her stress out on other people. This just made me think hard work is pointless. Because she works super hard and isn't getting anywhere meanwhile with fewer smarter decisions everyone else is just flying past. 

My brother and sister.... Neither the best but I've moved past all their bullshit because I think they are actually becoming better in some regards.

But long story short. There are a few things I like about how I am today. I don't get emotional and I have an example of this but currently the flaws I've accumulated and the damage I've built up have started surfacing. 

I don't get emotional because I'm completely reluctant to tell anyone anything about what I truly think or feel. I have some friends from high school but I'm in college now so I don't think I'll have the same opportunities to form friendships where I truly trust people. I feel inadequate because my highschool classmates are finishing college or have already graduated while I'm here and the rewards I get from good grades are nothing more than people asking me for help. I like the interaction I get but I feel like if I don't do well there isn't a point to me and I'm failing at life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. At most I could tell my friends at highschool I despise my mother and her bullshit but that was that. I'd like to cry it out but haven't done that in years. I've actually been looking at ways I might just suddenly die by accident while out and about. I think I want to die accidentally but the things that keep me from fully wanting to die are some goals I've set for myself.

I don't like making people sad unless I'm in the moment after they did something to me. So as much as I want to tell my mother how I hated the years I've spent with her I won't. I do see myself telling my cunt of an aunt to fuck off for trying to use my family to inflate her ego, however.

While staying with my mother I either feel sadness, anger, nothing at all or like I'm floating emotionally.",17Dec2019,1

459,"I (20M) was friend with this girl (20F) for close to 3 years. We live far away from each other, we kind of met in a weird way, basically we had this friend, who ironically is not my best friend anymore, in common, we used to call each other everyday to talk about how this friend is a dickhead for stopping caring about us when he got engaged with a girl, but after our friendship with him was over we became really good friends, like really we would talk about any ‘x’ topic without felling ashamed or else. Then one day she told me that she feel worthless because she’s unable to achieve anything, she quit school because she could not afford paying it after her parents divorced, and a thing happened when she was a child traumatized her and that developed into a depression. After that our friendship became stronger because that time I was feeling very sad and stressed too about school and other stuff and having someone who I can talk too really helped me and her. Fast forward to 2019 our friendship was doing pretty good, but when summer started she disappeared, she would lied to me every time she can to avoid talking to me or calling me, we went in a second from calling every day to not even chatting, during the summer I was stressed a lot because I was doing an internship but one day she appeared and we talked a lot, she told me that she is having a bad time and her disappearing was needed, that made me feel a little sad because when we were having a problem or anything related, calling each other was the first thing we used to do. I gave her the great news that the internship was over and that I had enough money to go where she lives, we would often fantasize about going on a date but could not because neither of us could not afford it, that made her very happy. Our “date” was planned on september but on august she blocked me for no reason at all, honestly at first i didnt feel anything no anger or nothing, but after some days I started feeling really sad and hopeless question if I’m really going to be alone for the rest of my life. I remember one day listening to this song called “Limbo” and felt really sad and scared for her because I thought her blocking me was because she killed herself, on stressed situation I would usually have hallucinations about her hanging in front of me so I decided to create a fake Instagram to kind of make sure she’s ok and doing good, but honestly I don’t know if I should reach her since a lot time passed since. 

Any advice ?

460,So me and my girlfriend have been together for almost 4 years now and I know her pretty well but sometimes I feel like I don’t. She is diagnosed schizophrenic with audio hallucinations but I’ve never seen her have an episode even when she’s withdrawing from her medication if the doctors can’t fill her scripts fast enough. This concerns me because I know she’s had episodes because she’s told me and I couldn’t tell the difference. She’s also pretty obsessed with true crime stuff. Like it’s all she watches. The combination of the two and her confining in me that she’s thought about killing people throws up red flags in my head but I’ve never seen her be violent outside of the one time she hit me when we first started dating which I shut down real quick by telling her if she ever layed a finger on me the wrong way again she’d be single and out of my house. She’s such a gentle person yet I know the kind of thoughts she has I just don’t know how to feel. Should I be genuinely concerned or am I just over thinking things?,17Dec2019,1

Later that day I get a text from his brother (who’s 15 or 16) saying I have to apologize when we start school again which is in January. I told him the only way I’ll apologize is if he apologizes first (because I’ll get called a pus**y by everyone if I do it first and also because he said fu**k your mother first) but I know that he won’t apologize first and he’s gonna try to get his friends to jump me and they’ve tried that in the past before.

I've told these things to my mother but she dismissed everything I say because she thinks I'm mentally weak so my opinion doesn't matter.

But right now i have a problem, a mindset problem and i need an advice. as we know in every field or subject, there will be always someone whose better than us right? because of experience or talent. There's a person that i really admire, his draw is so good. he can do any pose or scene that i even can't think about. But that's what became my problem, i really love his draw but not so long it made me feeling salty / envy. i try to push myself to improve so i can be like him but he keep getting further from me. when i ran for 1 miles, he ran for 5 miles, i can't match his speed.

i want to be as good as him but i just don't know how. i tried to learn and research every pieces he made, but i can't get it how can he made it, how can he get the idea, how can he can think something that i never think about. the angle, the pose, the storytelling, everything.  
There's a video i watched where one of the side-character said that its normal to do worse than someone who has talent and by accepting that. they lower their expectations and protect their pride, self-respect and sort of things, but not with the MC, instead of lowering himself he just keep pushing himself and that's his power.

i want to be like that MC, where i can push myself instead of lowering my expectation. but its a video not a real-life, at first i believe that i can be like my admired illustrator but now i start to doubting myself. am i be able to be like him? should i keep pushing myself? or should i accept that i cant be like him because he's more talented than i am?",17Dec2019,1

Someone from r/amitheasshole told me to figure this out here, I think it might help.

So, about a week ago my boyfriend (19M) and I (20M) were doing something and my younger brother walked in on accident. My little brother, as we'll call Wii (a nickname) has school, and often goes over to friends afterward. I work early in the mornings and get home at about 2 PM, leave at 6 AM. My boyfriend and I get private time from when I get home to when Wii does at 4 PM or whenever he comes from a friends.

He and I grew up in an abusive household. I did a lot better there than he did, unfortunately. So as a safety precaution he texts me when he leaves the school, gets to a friends and tells me what friends, is coming home. Then he comes and finds me to tell me he's home. If his phone is dead because he didn't charge it or overused it, he ALWAYS texts me from a friend's phone or said friend's parent's phone. 

He texted me saying he left the school, and was going to F1's until 5:30 PM so he'd be home at about 6 PM. He was going to text me when he was on the way home, but not when he gets to F1's. I'm okay with this because I at least know where he's at and when he'll be home. 

So, my boyfriend and I have sex. Whenever we're done, he has a kink of being spanked and shamed for being aroused. I want him to feel good so I'll 'punishingly relieve' him as we call it. Well, Wii came home early from F1's without telling me. He has a house key so he came in and came into my room without knocking. Normally we have some loud TV show or movie on, and it was some stupid show on we didn't care about, so he figured it was okay and didn't hesitate to walk in. (I don't have a lock on my door for again, safety precautions.) 
He saw what I was doing to my boyfriend well we were both totally naked and heard all the words. 

It upset him obviously and he ran away to his room. We got dressed and I went to talk to him and apologize for him walking in on us. 
I told him I was going to punish him, and he thought I was going to spank him. (Someone from AITA mentioned it could've sounded like a threat, what makes sense seeing as he is an abuse victim.) He freaked out and cried, apologized and even begged me not to spank him. I told him I was probably only going to take his phone for the night but he didn't listen. 

If the phone thing isn't reasonable, what sort of punishment can I give him without scaring him? Tips to calm him down in the future?",17Dec2019,1
474,"So, I’ve been pretty upset with my new job. I’m working at a certain chain bookstore and at first I was pretty ecstatic. For one, I love reading so I thought that having this job would be kind of fun since I get to recommend books. I wasn’t expecting this to be an easy ride however since I’ve worked at a couple of other retail jobs for numerous years and retail is retail no matter how you paint it.

Anyways, I was hired during the Christmas season and due to the store being busier than usual, I feel like they really skipped out on the proper training I should have had. I’ve run across some problems while working the register and there’s certain procedures that I was not brushed up on so I feel out of the loop most times. I’ve been pretty frustrated with it since I’m used to being a top performer in my other retail positions, however that doesn’t stop me from trying my best and having a good attitude.

Well, the last couple of nights that I’ve closed with this one particular manager, I’ve over heard her say some pretty nasty things about the “new people”. An example would be the other night, she was upset because she felt as though we didn’t get enough books donated to our book drive... for charity. Now, I get that we should strive to get good numbers but I feel like charity is all about, well...charity. If we get it cool, if we don’t then that’s okay too. This is coming from me, someone who grew up in shelters and churches for most of their childhood and young adult life. I understand that life happens and sometimes people can’t just afford to buy brand new books to donate to kids. Most people tell me that they are donating used books and I think that matters and counts too.
Another thing this manger complained about was go backs. I was out recovering the store for almost the entirety of my shift, barely being at the register. I hear her tell me over the walkie to grab go backs and reply with an “okay, I’ll be right there” to which she says “you should have already been here doing it. It should have never been left like this in the first place”. Her tone was definitely not happy. I go to the front and realize that the cashiers have been placing their go backs on my register so it looked like it had been me when really it wasn’t. I was going to say something to my manager later but I overheard her telling another older employee that she doesn’t know who hired me and “what were they thinking”. Honestly, I’m a pretty sensitive person and it hurt my feelings. I was emotionally abused as a child by adult figures and so I’m a “people pleaser” for sure so when people get upset with me, I get emotional and sad. This manager has said some other things, but the gist is she doesn’t care for me as an employee. 

With that being said, even though I’m an emotional person, I don’t mind sticking up for myself and have done so in the past. The reason I haven’t done so with this manager is because she hasn’t said anything directly to me. She pretty much “whispers” it to other employees so sometimes I wonder if I’m just hearing things. I don’t want to say anything if I’m not 100% sure and the only way I could be that sure is if she says it directly to me about why she thinks I’m doing so poorly. The whole situation sucks and I wish I could just quit but I really need the money. 

So my question is is how should I deal with this situation? I don’t want to not say anything but I’m not sure if saying anything will help in my situation. Should I talk to my store manager perhaps? Should I ask a co worker if what I heard was true? Any advice (and kind words) is helpful at this point because I’m just not sure what to do....",17Dec2019,1

476,"So basically I came across this Instagram account:
https://instagram.com/perfectlyperverted__?igshid=bsmf3ft5uwhl
They post pictures of women, teenagers and little girls, which I found kind of weird since their name is perfectly perverted. 
I had a look through and honestly the whole thing gave me major creep vibes. There are pictures of little girls in swimwear, hotpants and yoga clothes, some doi g poses that just seem a little age inappropriate. On top of that every picture, whatever age, has a love heart or love heart eye emoji underneath and some come with comments like 'yum' 'so sexy' 'look at her legs'
I find it really unsettling but I don't know if I'm overreacting. There's nothing sexually explicit on there but it makes me u comfortable. I'm not a mother but if I saw a picture of my niece like that, with those types of comments I'd be sick.
Anyway, I need advice, seriously am I overreacting and if not, what can I do? I tried to contact Instagram about the page for advice and they've been useless. I just keep getting automated emails with instructions on how to report bullying and harassment. So what can I do? (if I should do anything?)

My friend isn’t at all annoyed that I’m missing his big party; he’s been my best friend for 20 years, he’s just proud of me. But I still feel bad! It’s his 21st, which is kind of a big deal, and I haven’t missed a birthday party since he was one!

We’re both students, so not only do I not have the money for a flashy, expensive gift, I also don’t want to set the precedent that that’s what’s expected if he ever misses my birthday. I’m planning on buying him a shirt (he had a Washing Machine Incident this summer, in which 90% of his shirts got destroyed), writing a nice card, and leaving them with his girlfriend to give to him on his birthday.

The most important things in the world to him are his girlfriend and food (fortunately for her, in that order!) so I was planning on making him a red velvet and vanilla oreo cheesecake when I get back, but this isn’t that unusual, as if I’d been home I probably would’ve made his birthday cake anyway.

I was thinking I could invite his closest friends round to watch his fave film, or have a video games tournament, or just order take out and watch TV, but we’re students: we already do stuff like this all the time!

I’d just really appreciate suggests for a ‘sorry I missed your birthday’ gesture. Thank you!

(p.s. I know some of you are going to say, ‘you don’t need to do anything; if you were really friends he wouldn’t mind.’ And I know that. He doesn’t mind. But I want to do something, especially since he’s moving away at the end of the summer, and God knows when I’ll see him then!)",17Dec2019,1

I am in a LTR and my fiance decided to  retrain and returned to University. During this time our landlord decided to evict us because I wasn't working and neither did my fance as he is studying. I wasnt recommended to work for some time by the therapists. When we got evicted, we moved to a small town near my finances University. It's been two months now I was trying to get a job. A month ago went for an interview and got accepted for a role, but by the time the recruitment agency finished with my security clearance, the company told them, they are not taking me on, because they dont know what they are doing so they dont need me. This was a pretty big blow especially because it happened in a very bad time. It's one week before christmas and there isn't a big chance of me getting into employment in this place. Right now were are living on benefits, because even though I have relevant years of experience for the jobs I apply for I keep on getting rejected for every role. My fiance is annoyed that I am at home and my presence is apparently disturbing his study and he starts bitching at me about finding a job, like I haven't done anything for it. I even tried to go for jobs like in a warehouse but everytime I get told they dont think I'll stay because of my experience. I dont know what to do. It's so bad that I cannot sleep and cry at night. I hate this place so much. My fiance is under some strange impression that I have time of my life here with my PTSD and no employment. In a year my life turned into a living hell and I have no tools to change it. What would your advice be?",17Dec2019,1

486,"I finished grad school two months ago, which I was doing while also working two jobs, publishing my work, presenting at conferences, and going on job interviews.  I knew it was too much for me, but I hate my current job (toxic workplace), so I pushed myself to get the qualifications I need to get a job I really want as soon as possible.  I have to say, I was extremely successful and did very well in my program, and I managed to get a really good job, which I will start in a few months.

That problem is that I have felt extreme burnout since finishing school, and it shows no sign of abating after two months.  I am like the opposite person of who I was while in school.  I'm extremely lazy, don't care about my work, can't be bothered to go out, etc.  In my free time I just stay at home and stare at my computer or play video games.  I have no interest in talking to anyone and just want to be alone all the time.  Small, mundane tasks feel overwhelming, and I can't imagine how people have the energy to do things every day like cook proper meals or go to the gym.  I do exercise a little at home, but I'm really forcing myself to do it.

obviously its my own fault, but i think the main reason i act so passive is because the person i spent and still spend the most time with, my dad, is someone i constantly have one sided conversations with. he never really asks me questions or my opinion or anything, most of the time im sat there listening to him explain something or describe something. i laugh and play along since i love him and am just fine doing that, but its a really bad habit ive come to realize. just laughing, nodding along.. im actually paying attention, and in this situation it works, but i feel like in reality that just makes me look like a pushover and or like i dont care about what the other person is saying. its like i have to remind myself i can say something sometimes, like, if a customer goes ""yeah i wanna make this grilled cheese"" i cant just smile and laugh, but rather i should say a good anecdote or something

497,"Hi everybody. 
I experienced bullying in high school.
It was pretty bad (nearly abuse, I’ll explain in italics)

*had a gay friend since middle school, he was really jealous of me because straight boys that he had a crush on liked me. He would molest those boys that had a crush on me and throughout the years have me hang out with their ex girlfriends. The gay boy would tell the guys’ ex girlfriends rumors about me and they’d all make comments about me, threaten to fight me, call me ugly, stupid, crazy, not let anyone sit next to me, start rumors in my face, and I’d go weeks, months, and even years without having a clue that there was so much animosity over me because that’s how covert it was. The gay boy would even get involved in my relationships with people he didn’t know, get information, and tell everyone I know my business (he’s even gotten naked pictures of my partners and showed my friends). Even today in our adult lives I get shit over what happened in high school even though I have screenshots of the gay boy admitting the things he’s done.* 

I often feel like I am less than. I know black girls are expected to be strong and stick up for themselves so I really feel like the worlds biggest pussy for nearly 6 years without fighting *anybody*. I never got justice and people still think I’m the bad guy. I want to move out of this town now that I’m old enough, but letting people “chase” me out of my home makes me feel like even more of a pussy.

The fact that I’m having a hard time exposing the gay boy also concerns me because he’s doing the same thing he did to me, but to one of the guys who he molested’s new girlfriend. He’s still a predator and an abuser out there living freely only he does hard drugs now to top it all off. Even if I were to warn the girls they wouldn’t believe me and would hate me more (yes I tried and it went awfully wrong. I just sounded jealous and crazy).",17Dec2019,1

499,"I (22f) have been going out with this guy (24m) that I matched with on tinder back in October. We talked for about 3 weeks before meeting. At the start, he was showing a lot of interest in me, saying things like “I want you to be my girlfriend” and “You’re gonna be all mine” and other things along the lines of being in a relationship. However, since our 3rd date, I feel that things are different and that he is not showing as much interest as before. He hasn’t mentioned us being in a relationship since then either so I don’t even know what we are. We have hung out twice since then and still talk a lot but I still feel like things are different and that he is losing interest. He did say that he deleted his Tinder account but that was before we met. 

I don’t really have a lot of experience in relationships so I am not really sure if this is typical in dating or not. I am not sure what to do or how to talk to him about it without coming off as needy or desperate. I’m starting to get the feeling that he was saying all those things in the beginning just to get me to like him and didn’t really mean it. 

Something else that I think I should mention is that I’m a virgin so we haven’t had sex. We have talked about it and he said that he’s ok with waiting till I am ready but I have a feeling he was just saying that. I don’t know why I just do.",17Dec2019,1

Obviously our world won't end if I use it and clean it and put it back (as is the kind thing to do). BUT if she were to even jokingly be like ""hey that's my cup silly!"" I immediately start feeling terribly guilty and kind of like ""oh shit I got caught"" kind of feeling. I know I'm not doing anything wrong. But it FEELS like I am and the guilt and fear I feel when I'm called out in a situation like this is almost enough to make me stop doing whatever it is in doing in that moment.

We are currently renting and we’re ok financially speaking and both in full time employment... we’re also looking for a house to buy but none seem to be fitting for us at the moment. 

I’ve said to the wife that I’d like to start trying again when we are in our own home... but she constantly tries to convince me otherwise and it seems it is creating distance between us. 

This all stems from when we were renting and we just had our 2nd child and we were given notice to leave - we struggled to find somewhere and it ended up me getting stressed and depressed.
Also another reason for this delay is because our 2nd child doesn’t sleep very well on a night... which is super tiring! Like he gets up, cries, shouts for attention and tries to sleep in our bed... this happens 4-6 times a night.

515,"So, I have to be out of my present house by this Friday.  I've been to viewing after viewing and have one solid offer and one \~maybe\~.

The solid offer is honestly a much more practical solution but not my ideal place. It would be a sublet (As in I wouldn't be on the lease which is not ideal). The people in the house all know each other well (two being brothers) and seem friendly but I would definitely be coming into *their* home with their own ways of doing things. Price wise its about the same as below and I would be able to move in immediately.

\~Maybe\~ is, while not a 'dream home' is pretty damn close considering the renting market where I live. It's about 15 minutes from my work. I'd be moving in with a close friend (who I've lived with in the past and we get on well) and a third person. I'd be on the lease and the main point of contact to the landlord. And as silly as it is, the house is similar to the place I grew up in and I could really see it as my home.

He was more behind than me, and about a month later, he as all his credits to graduate. so, since I am behind, I go and ask my principal If I can go to stubblefield. He yelled at me saying ""do you know how many people want to go to stubblefield to graduate early, you are not special"". I then explain to him that I'm not trying to graduate early, that I am behind in credits. He tells me that I am not and that I'm going to graduate next school year so I tell him that I'm supposed to be a senior. He tells me I am on track because in texas, 18 is the average age of students in senior year, and next year I will be 18. My parents then tell me the next day that we will be moving back to California in febuary 2020. So I go and talk to him again and tell him that I'm gonna have to move again mid school year, and lose more credits, and when I'm back in California that's a whole extra school yea I'm gonna have to do with lost credits.

They should just not put him in all my classes if he doesn't understand what he is learning because the school thinks that giving him assignments in Arabic is going help when he can't understand what he is learning.

to give an idea: some of our teachers divide the class in two to take tests separately (i always do the test w the first group and he does w the second group) two weeks ago i ended a test earlier and when i left the classroom i started giving some of my answers to my friends that were going to take the test next. then he shows up with 2 other guys (that i know better because they actually come to class) and one of them starts asking me the questions, i give everything i remember (questions and answers) and the 3 of them are really listening but he doesn't talk much  to me, isn't even looking directly at me. the other guys when they didn't know anything, they would ask me but he would ask them. idk if he's just shy, or if he just doesn't like me, or if he has a girlfriend. but how do i approach him?",17Dec2019,1

He kept saying he would get it back to me as soon as his next payment comes. In fact a few days later he needed a bit more money and he said the same thing, that he would ""110%"" get it back to me. 

Unfortunately he simply then forgot about it. When his payment did come through I asked him what he did with it and he said that he had to pay off other debts. Now I naively could not ask him about my debt. It has now been almost a 1.5 years and now a month ago he called me up for more money. I said to him that I am still owed and that I spoke to my friends as I was really concerned that he was getting me my money back.

At this point he got incredibly offended and emotional, how could I ask somebody else as if he isn't going to get it back to me. I said to him that I did not want to put pressure on him because he has a lot of on his plate but this debt is really affecting me. I was being as nice as possible because I am very thankful for what I have and realise his situation is difficult. Yet again and again he was acting like I had done him wrong.

A few days later I even apologised to him for asking for it at a time when he is need. He said that he would pay it monthly and finish by summer but had a tone as if he didn't want to know me. I did get a mutual friend involved and he said exactly the same thing, that he always borrows money, pays it back MUCH later but then asks for more eventually. 

I am trying to contact him just so we can resume our friendship as we have known each other for a very long time. But he is completely ignoring me. I still don't understand how on Earth someone can be angry with me for doing them a favour. He clearly does not seem to grasp that he is the one who owes ME and yet acts like he is the one who has been wronged.

545,"I’m going through an internal battle with the decision of cutting off my friends or at least distancing myself from them. 

Issue 1:   
I have a really low tolerance to alcohol (1 drink is a hard limit) and I have recently started taking an anti-depressant and a stimulant (both prescribed). After taking both of these into consideration, I strongly prefer to just not drink at all.   
 

I’ve clearly communicated all of this to my friends on many occasions, however, whenever we get together, I’m always pressured to drink more. It gets super annoying and I usually order 1 drink to sit. My friends will comment on the fact that I have yet to drink my cocktail and urge me to “chug it”. In some cases, they will order me another drink when they’re getting their next. In addition, they would also order a round of shots after all the drinking is done. As someone that's always been excluded from groups, I appreciate the inclusion, but I try to firmly explain that I’m on medications. That is met with “you’ll be fine” or “stop being a wuss”. 

Issue 2:  
My friends do a lot of drugs (weed, coke, MDMA..etc). I’ve tried weed once years ago and decided it wasn’t for me. I’ve explained this to my friends, yet my protests fall on deaf ears. They frequently do these drugs in front of me and it’s honestly so uncomfortable that I end up leaving. In addition, one of my friends tends to smoke weed in my car when I’m driving. Not only does my car end up smelling like weed, but I could potentially be arrested if we get pulled over. I’ve repeatedly communicated that she needs to stop. She has stated that she won’t do it again. Recently, we were in the car, and she pulls out a joint and lights it up. I couldn’t pull over, or stop as we were on the highway. I was incredibly infuriated as an arrest or conviction record could ruin my future.

Obviously, I have boundary issues and I am currently in therapy to work on my issues. The drugs and alcohol aside, my friends are generally good people IMO. My therapist said that I have a propensity towards “black and white” thinking, which is true. That’s why I’m so confused about what to do in this situation. I don’t want to feel like I’m judging my friends as the “wrong crowd” for their lifestyle choices, but at the same time, I don’t appreciate them violating my boundaries regardings those choices.",17Dec2019,1

563,"Hey Reddit,

Interesting one I think. I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable.

I had a accident a few years ago, a severe one and I'm permanently disabled and wheelchair bound. My school which I went to from the age of 4 years old to 18 very kindly raised a few thousand for physiotherapy and equipment I needed shortly after the accident. This was amazing of them and dramatically improved my rehabilitation. I will always be grateful for what they did. 

It's now a few years down the line and after a long legal battle I have been compensated for the accident as it was someone else's fault.

Since I received the compensation I rang my school and expressed my wish to return the money to the school and allow it to go to another good cause. I also mentioned that as the kids of the school were the fundraisers of the money that it was my wish they should have a say where or who the money goes to. The school were surprised and said the headteacher would get back to me.

A few days later the headteacher contacted me, we had a short chat and I stated again I think the children of the school should have a say in the cause the money goes towards as they raised the money. The headmaster then said he wanted the money to go to improving wheelchair accessibility around the school. I wouldn't have a problem with this except the school isn't horrendously inaccessible and is a private school - you pay for your children to go there. He mentioned they have a new teacher who is a wheelchair user and the school being a very active sports school, injuries during sport aren't uncommon.

To sum up my problem with his idea.
This is a well funded private school, if they needed wheelchair access they would have done it already. Secondly if their employee has access issues they are obligated by the government here to make reasonable adjustments and government funding is available for this too.

I told the headmaster I didn't like his idea and he has said he will have a think about it and get back to me. He also mentioned he could involve the school student Council about it. That's currently how it's been left.

Am I being unreasonable?",17Dec2019,1

571,"Some background about me I’m a 19yo Male. I recently moved from the city to the suburbs of Chicago. I’m a introvert and I’ve been told by numerous people that I’m very mature for my age. I’m a virgin not because I’m saving myself for marriage but because I can’t bring myself to just have sex with randoms or manipulate to get in too someone’s pants. I’ve also never been in a full real relationship but you probably figured that by now. 

When it comes to women I try not to be picky. No one is perfect especially me, but I do look for woman that are mainly introverted, sweet, and focused. These personalities seem to not be very common. No offense to others but the social media type women just aren’t my type which is fine because I’m most likely not there type but it seems that every girl is like that and it’s becoming difficult to not adjustment my standards because I do want a relationship. I also over think things a little which can be hindering me to an extent.

What should I do? Should I try to engage with more common personalities or broaden my preferences?",17Dec2019,1

He just needs to be in Intensive Care for 24 hours -standard procedure-. Then he can be released from hospital. My dad told his friend to told me to never talk about this to our relatives which he doesn't speak to them for months.  I live 10 hours drive away but only transportation option is bus and there aren't many which goes to where my family lives. Actually there is only one per day and around this time it's full. I'm super worried about my dad. Want to call some relatives but he really doesn't want to speak with any of them. And his friends says my dad is okay.

574,"I have been pretty okay with my sex life after my boyfriend and I broke up last 2017. We ended it on really good terms so there was no bitterness. We both moved on, although not serious enough to warrant marriage or babies, but we saw other people. We are on speaking terms and catch up time to time. 

As 2019 is ending, and I have been busy this year with tiring stuff and fun stuff as well, I just realized tonight after a rude awakening while I was masturbating (TMI, but relevant) a couple days ago that maybe I am still harbouring feelings for him. I cried as I came. Felt really angry and frustrated with myself as I did because it felt good, but disgusting because I shouldn't be feeling this way.

I can't stop thinking about him now whenever I feel hot and heavy and I have declined invites from my fwb because he pops up as I cum. Never had this issue before. I also haven't been in a serious relationship after him because no one sparked that interest in me.

It's not that I want him back, I LOVED the guy but I don't really want to force something that ended already. We respect each other's lives.

I really am just wondering why now, after all these years? Is this my mind telling me that should I try again with him just to see? Do you think this is wise? Advice?",17Dec2019,1
575,"I started a new job about a month ago and am still learning the ropes. I share an office with someone recently promoted from my level (not my position, but she was and still is doing a lot of the work that I'm expected to take over). I'm still being oriented and trained, so am definitely not operating at 110% like I normally am and prefer to be. I've asked this person what I can do for them, and how to do the things, intentionally trying to lighten their load, but am aware that I don't really know what I'm doing so am not a lot of help at the moment.

Things seemed to be going fine, and then, all of a sudden, this person got cold and short with me. It's really obvious that they're ""shunning"" me or whatever (because they're doing the same thing to someone else in another department who I guess kinda deserves it - clearly some misogyny going on that is not OK), but I have no idea what I've done to earn this response.

My question is, should I A) directly ask this person what's wrong? Or B) ignore their (IMO) immature behavior? I've already asked, ""Is everything OK?"" and got a really generic response, so if I go with A, it'd probably be something like ""It seems like your upset with me.

578,"I (M16) had a thing with this girl (F17) and lets call her Jen. We talked for a few months, and she is my best friends’ cousin and we will call him Logan (may sound weird but there’s a longer story to it and Logan was fine with this relationship). Jen and I started off as friends, but quickly grew closer because she became attracted to my kindness and care towards her - which are things that her exes never did (she told me how they would abuse her mentally, cheat on her, sexually abuse her etc.) and so she quickly fell for me.

I was happy to be there for her and support her through her mental issues at the time, and I gave her nothing but my 100% care and affection. However things ended for reasons, but we eventually got on good terms again, sending eachother memes and asking eachother how we were going etc.

It was 2 days ago when Logan stopped replying to my messages, and Jen told me to “get fucked” I had no clue what was going on and so I called Logan and left a message. Today he called me and I answered, I asked him what his problem with me was and asked to sort it out. He replied with “I don’t think you have been honest with me about Jen” I asked him what he meant by this and these were the points he brought up:

• I had both of them over as a group of friends to smoke weed. I messaged Jen to come and sit on my lap, and so she came over and did. But apparently what Jen told Logan the other day was that I kept asking her and asking her to sit on my lap even when she said no, which is not the case. She was actually the one that wanted to fuck while we were at Logans house and I always said no.

• later that same night, Logan was passed out in the lounge room, I said to Jen “we should put him on the couch and we can go to my room” she promptly agreed and we had sex. What Jen told Logan the other day was that I asked her and she said no because “Logan was still here” which is not the case, she practically dragged me to the room.

• the last thing that Logan brought up was a party that Jen and I went to. Jen is bisexual, and said she was going to the bathroom with her girl best friend. I said okay, but she was gone for about 10mins so I decided to check if everything was okay. She came out and later that night told me that her friend kissed her on the lips, I was really high and just sorta said “oh.” But what Jen told Logan was that she told me she was going to go hook up with her friend in the bathroom and that I was okay with it.

Jen has made all of these things out to be like I pressured her into doing something she didn’t want to do, which is ridiculous because she is the horniest girl I have met, and she was always talking about how much she wanted to fuck me etc. I probably sound like a tosser but its all the truth. 

She has tried to turn my own best friend on me, and he is telling me about how conflicted he is because he has to choose who to believe out of his best friend and his cousin (he is very family oriented, and would do anything for them). I feel so trapped, because I have a weird feeling that she’s going to accuse me of rape or something absurd like that, and being 16 that is not something that I could live with, knowing that there are going to be people out there that she has convinced that I raped her. Its all such bullshit and I have no idea what to do, I am helpless, and I feel like my friend will be more inclined to believe her than me. What do I do here?

TL;DR 
Dated best friends cousin. Ex accused me of pressuring her to have sex with me, and other things. She has been feeding my friend lies and he doesn’t know whether he should believe me or her. I fear that this will escalate to her accusing me of rape, and I have no control over anything. What do I do?",17Dec2019,1

On the flip-side, we're moving in together in a few months and I was thinking that maybe she could get some new furniture for him.

I think it's fair to note that he hasn't had a family Christmas is years (his family stopped doing it) and so this will be the first in awhile and the first with my family.

So, should I go for the warhammer carrier or the desk?",17Dec2019,1
580,"Okay, my partner uses reddit so they'll probably see this but I dont mind. I just need to know what to do.

So I'm 18, my partner is 17 (6 months difference). Earlier this year while I was still 17, I moved out of my mum's and in with my oldest sister who's 30. I just really couldn't stay in that house, but that's a complete other story. My partner moved in with me after a couple of weeks.

Everything was fine, I had a job, we'd spend £100 ish of my £400 wage on food every month (I wasnt paying rent yet, the situation was complicated but long story short as long as I kept the house clean and stuff I didn't have to). My partner seemed fine with it, I'd come home from work, we'd play minecraft, eat dinner, watch anime and sleep.

But then on the 8th of October, 2019, our house burnt down. Completely. We barely managed to escape. Thankfully no one was hurt [physically] and my partner went back to their parents, I moved in with my other older sister while I look for a job and find somewhere. We lost everything, my entire 17 years of existence including ID, certificates etc., my partner's laptop and phone that had a bunch of important shit, everything.

Recently, my partner has been diagnosed with PTSD from the incident, and I found my older sister's prescription and she's on the highest dose of her antidepressants. I'm waiting for a counsellor. So, basically it affected all of our mental states horribly.

However, since I turned 18 I've been waiting for the warehouses nearby to start hiring full-term (mind you I've applied to 20-30 jobs in the past 2 months, even McDonalds doesn't want to take me because of my coloured hair and piercings). The average wage from these places is around £1300 a month. With that, I could easily rent a small £7-900 place near here, and with the extra added help from my partner when they get a job, we could live comfortably.

But that's the problem. I know we're young or whatever, but for me personally, I want to move out again and do my own thing. I dont want to have to live off my family constantly, I feel like a huge burden. My partner, however, doesn't really feel the same. They always say how thinking about moving out and getting jobs so quickly stresses them out, along with their family being protective and overbearing because they're so young, and I get that. Most people around here don't move out until they're in their 20s, let alone 17.

I feel like a complete asshole, because we argued again just now. They say that they're worried about me because of my mental health and history of s/h and attempts (I've been clean since February though so that's a good thing!) and if I move out they want to come with me ASAP. Again, I have no problem with that. But they do. They clearly don't want to rush and move out so quick, but every time I say that they dont have to or they could move in later, they say they feel like they have to because they're so worried. They've gone to calm down now, but I feel so shitty for making them stress so much about it. I dont really have much control over the situation right now, if I move out they'll come with me even if they don't want to, if I don't move out nothing will change and I'll still be living off my sister who is trying to pay off debts my mother has caused. 

I feel like a leech on my sister and a burden to my partner. I know I'm going to eventually move out but I dont know what to do.

His girlfriend reminds me a lot of my ex, and is probably why I care about her so much.  She is planning on going to university in a month and has great plans for the future.  However she's been dealing with trying to help my friend for the last few months and I can see it taking a mental and emotional toll on her to where she's also always at home, they're getting into fights more and more, ect.

Right now he wants to start investing in stocks (guy barely passed highschool and is using his dad's money).  He bought a laptop to learn how to use computers.  He plans on this being his career.  I've known him for 12+ years and I know that this is gonna last about a week before he gives up and starts threatening suicide.

I know it's not a healthy relationship that's going to end horribly very very soon.  I'm also biased though cause I've started caring about his girlfriend more than I should.  I don't know what to do, part of me wants to tell her to take care of herself since just dealing with him makes me depressed, I can only imagine what it does to her.

She always keeps in touch with them a lot more than I do and I feel always feel like if I wasn’t friends with her would they even want to be friends with me. They talk to her more and barely talk to me. I don’t know why, but I always think in the back of my head that most people only pretend to like me to be nice, because we have mutual friends, or because they want something from me. 

Anyways my best friend thinks she has a crush on our mutual guy friend. They have kept in touch since the visit before and I haven’t kept in touch with any of them. Over the weekend though they would always pair up and they spent a lot of time together. Now as my friend tells me she think that she has a crush on him and it seems like it’s mutual I can’t feel a inch of happiness. I don’t know what I’m feeling but I just know I’m not happy.

She always has guys liking her, asking for her number, or telling her she’s cute. I think she’s beautiful, but I don’t think I’m bad looking either and yet the only guys that like me are 30 year old men and horny douchebags. Every time she hangs out with someone that isn’t me or has a guy she’s talking to I always feel jealous and I don’t know why.

Our mutual guy friend I do admit is cute but I don’t think I like him like that. He’s a good bit younger than me and he lived in a different state. I haven’t had a crush on a guy for awhile but I don’t feel about him like how I felt about my last crush. And yet every time I saw him and my best friend alone together I would get jealous.

I’ve never had a relationship or even a mutual crush on somebody. I’ve been pretty lonely my entire life and I’m pretty sure I have trust issues.

Hi, I need to hear what you would do in this situation:

&amp;#x200B;

Five years ago I was dating a guy. It was awful and it ended. Should be end of story.

   
 

Somehow this guy manages to get into areas of my life like a virus and I sometimes feel I'll never get rid of him. He's not even in my circle of friends. We are civil in public, it's just one of those situations where you've moved on so much, you sort of hope they will just disappear.

   
 

Anyway, recently I made friends with this really great woman and we've organised to go on holiday together next year, with some others. We got quite close one day in the Summer and shared some life stories. One of mine included this guy but I didn't mention his name. Later on that day, we bumped into him. Turns out she had sort of begun seeing him and seemed pretty disappointed to find out he was who I had been talking about. I back-tracked and explained that I didn't mind, it had been years and he’s probably changed and is much more mature now.

   
 

She hasn't mentioned him since, although *he* has told me they are seeing each other. He looks so sheepish when he talks about her and I have the following concern:

   
 

*He is not going public with their relationship and is telling her it’s because of me or another ex-girlfriend.* 

I really don’t want to lose a new friend just because this guy can’t be honest with himself. I know with certainty that when he was a teenager, he and his circle of friends were very cruel about her. I didn't know any of them back then and I only found this out a couple of months ago; I was with another friend and she became very drunk. I told her who I was going on holiday with, and she went into all this detail about how horrible people were to her (or at least behind her back) all those years ago.

Now, having spoken to him of late, it’s become apparent that my ex-boyfriend never matured, and has no integrity whatsoever. He holds himself well and can be very entertaining but he still lies like a schoolboy. I am 99% sure that the reason why he doesn’t want to go public with their relationship is because he believes people will mock him for going out with her.

This enrages me because he has no concept of what it’s like for other people when he does shit like this. She has confided in me in the past about her insecurities and I don’t want this moron to come along and make them worse just because he’s a twat.

Do I tell her I know and that if he’s said that I would fly off the handle, he’s lying? If she found out about what he used to say about her, it would destroy her.

Do I just let him use me or the other ex-girlfriends as excuses and let it run its course? I don’t want her to think he can’t be open with her because of me.",17Dec2019,1
599,"I work  in a charity  shop I’m a male quiet etc and there are 2 girls there on community service. One has very poor hygiene, looks like a drug addict and sometimes scavengers food and cigarettes. The other wears tons and tons of of makeup  it’s a mask and fake hair extensions and fake tan (iv never seen a girl so artificial) they basically both are quick to call guys ugly and think they’re entitled to a hunk. I once overheard the one wit tons of makeup say to a guy talking to her ‘go away, I only like big men’ and he was just passing conversation.

Basically there is a guy whom one of our mutual friends used to date, that has a picture of my best friends girlfriend and he has said he slept with her this summer. 

This couldn't be happening at a worse time and they live together which makes this all the worse. To boot getting my friend alone to tell him is a trying task in and of itself. As I am going to star wars with both of them on thursday then I have a dinner party with them on Saturday...

603,"I've had a shitty childhood, was bullied at school, had perfectionist parents that never really validated me and a father that used to beat me to the point that I'm now fucked over with PTSD, and for my whole teenage years I was forced on meds that made me unable to feel emotions but at least made sure my grades were higher. And now I'm an adult. And I absolutely hate myself.

I have a low self-esteem that I feel really hinders my everyday life, enjoyment in (former) hobbies and harms my SO, and I don't know what to do with it or how to make it become less.

An example; I used to really like this certain game, and throughout my childhood often clung onto it as the only thing I was confident about. I felt good at it, and I could only become better with the years, so it was my safe thing. Everyone could put me down as much as they wanted, but I would still be good at that game. Eventually, around age 17 or so, I introduced the person who would eventually go on to be my SO to this game. And even though I had a decade of experience in it and still frequently practiced, he got better at it than me over the span of only a year. Eventually, he exceeded me so far that I gave up and dropped the game entirely. I haven't touched it since and get kind of sad every time someone mentions it. Ever since, I haven't felt even moderately mediocre at anything. I know this probably sounds like the stupidest, pettiest thing, but it was a really important thing to me.

Art is another hobby that I kind of dropped. Simply because some random person said it looked bad. I didn't draw a thing afterwards for two years and only recently began to pick it up again. However, I often talk myself down for it and will gladly point out how terribly bad I am at it.

I hate my personality, too. Whenever my SO's family gets me something, I tend to thank them a lot, but notice that at some point, they're getting annoyed with it. I apologize for a lot of things too, but at some point they appear to get annoyed by that as well. When around people that don't have my full trust, I'm barely able to speak at all and I am stupidly avoidant of many social things. I often over-assess conversations I've had in my head to point out things to myself that the other said that may show that they hold different thoughts about me than they say, or otherwise things that show that the other person doesn't like me. I don't feel like I have any redeeming traits and often make sure to confirm that either openly or just in my head by assessing past conversations.

Tldr; i am a very dumb and stupid rat and I want to not hate myself, but how does one go about that when everything about them is kinda bad?",17Dec2019,1
604,"Tw: Suicide attempts. 

   Recently I've tried to end myself, twice. A week apart. And I \[M18\] just always think I'm not wanted. My girlfriend \[F18\] picked me up yesterday from me wondering off. When she did she didn't say anything to me. The only thing was her asking me what size shirt and pants I wear, only because I was soaked from the rain and I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts in 20 Degree weather. But that was it, that was all she said. Nothing else. I can understand if she's upset or whatever, hell I would be too.  


   When we got home, I went and showered and after a while I asked her what was wrong. Then she just lost it. She screamed at me asking me what was wrong. Asking me why I left and wondered off, why I jumped in a river trying to die, why I didn't come to her about things. I kept telling her I was sorry, and that I'm working on it. I just always feel like I'm not wanted even though I have her.   
   
 

   After I said that, she just stared at me for a few seconds. Then she threw the ring at me (I had proposed two weeks ago) and left. This was 10 last night and it's around 10am now. I get she might need space or she's blowing off steam but she's sensitive and suicidal. I also want to make it up to her in some way.

605,"I have a sinuses infection. My mom told me to use a saline solution to clear my passages and use boiled water to clean the bottle when i was i done. So heres where the trouble starts.

But i turned on the wrong eye and burnt a pot that didnt have water on it. The pot caught fire and my brother was the one who noticed. So in a panic almost put water on it which i just learned makes the fire worse. My brother blew out the fire and pot in some water.

606,"The other day my mom said she was gonna offer to help me pay off some of my student loans. I said okay, cool! Thanks mom. So the next day we go to the post office to make a money order that I can deposit into my account. She also has like three other money orders to make for other things. 

So we go and do the thing. While we're still inside the post office, she hands me one of the three money orders and I notice it isn't the amount that she said she was gonna give me. I non aggressively ask her if she gave me the right one and she starts going off: DO NOT QUESTION ME ABOUT MY OWN MONEY IN FRONT OF ALL THESE STRANGERS.  I'm like okay... sorry but I wasn't trying to demean you or anything, I was just making sure you gave me the right one. We linger a little longer in the post office so I can deposit the check into my account using my mobile app. My app isn't allowing me to deposit it so I say I'll do it later when we get home. 

As we're walking to the car, she says that I apparently didn't hear her the other day when she said that she was only gonna put about 90% of the total amount on the money order and the other bit she was going to transfer from her savings account. I said, okay yeah I must have missed that part, sorry for the confusion.

Once we get into the car she starts preaching to me about how I need to keep my mouth shut and not question her and trust that she knows what she's doing. I, again, repeat that I was not intentionally doing that and that I just wanted to make sure FOR MYSELF that I wasn't making a mistake. She says I need to be grateful for what she's doing and say thank you. I let her know that I said thank you when she first told me that she wanted to help. Of course, this turns into a whole 'nother thing about me not saying thank you enough and being ungrateful. 

Then shes like, give me the money back. Now she's being spiteful because I didn't respond the way she wanted me to. Im like sure, take it. This is something YOU offered ME. If you really wanted to help then you wouldn't be acting this way. 

The rest of the way home shes like YOU ARE A CHILD, YOU ARE NOT ON MY LEVEL, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO QUESTION ME, HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT ME. The whole ride I'm like... alright bruh. 

Then shes like, IF YOU REALLY KNEW, I TOOK THE CHECK BACK BECAUSE I WAS GONNA HELP YOU BY DEPOSITING IT WITH MY PHONE. BUT NO...I CHANGED MY MIND AND IM KEEPING IT. I'm like... really?? -___- the whole reason why you were just screaming at me for the check back was all just so you could help me? Right...

I'm so sick of this ""not being able to ask a question or have an opinion because she's the mother not me"" bullshit. I'm almost 26 bruh... I've literally lived alone and traveled the world alone for nearly 5 years now. And I'm not old enough to ask an innocent question?

I’m currently working a seasonal position at a retail store. When I was hired, I told them that I could work on Christmas Eve, but not past 4 pm. I stressed this point many times. The reason being, I leave for Europe for three months the day after Christmas, and Christmas Eve is the last time I’ll be able to see my extended family before leaving. If I work past 4, I’ll barely have any time with them. 

They scheduled me until 7 pm. 

When I asked them to change it, they told me that it was my responsibility to find someone else to cover my shift for me and that they would not change it otherwise. It’s Christmas Eve, so nobody that I’ve asked is willing to cover it for me, or even trade shifts for that day. 

I don’t know what to do. If I work the full shift, I’ll only have an hour with my family - if that - before leaving. My dad told me to just not go in that day, but it’s my favorite store and I’d never be able to show my face there again if I did. Not to mention, the guilt would positively haunt me.

611,"Hey all. I've been a pro athlete since this time last year, and have been depressed almost the entire time. The lifestyle is extremely emotionally challenging, and I decided I can't do it any longer.

I became a pro athlete after a couple years in the corporate world post-college and realizing my job was completely unfulfilling to me. I was indoctrinated into the ""jobs are for throwing your life away for someone else"" camp and as such, once I decided the athlete life was driving me insane, I figured my only option was to start a business. I worked on launching a cleaning business and hated every second of it. It felt entirely forced. I put it on pause just before launching my first direct marketing campaign (I still have everything ready and could launch the campaign tomorrow if I wanted to). 

At this point I'm about broke. I've been increasingly depressed since February and feel like I'm just in an existential void right now, unable to connect my life to any meaningful path. I just broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. I feel like taking a job would give me some relief, but I'm terrified of even temporarily committing myself to something I feel doesn't align with what I want in life (freedom/autonomy). I've considered transitioning to personal training as a middle-ground that leverages a passion+skill of mine but has a little more career structure to it. I'm struggling with the guilt that doing such a thing is a waste of the prestigious business degree I went to school for - which is how I also feel about another thing I think could be fun to get into, bartending. I'm also aware that as I sit here doing nothing I'm just about to be forced to start Uber driving to even have cash period.

I just feel that I can't connect the dots of where I am in life right now to where I want to be in life. Sometimes I look back on the nice corporate job I had after graduating and think I should just go back to that comfort. If I could make myself not want the adventurous lifestyle I dream of, I could be satisfied. I don't know if I can do that though. I've never felt lost like this before.

612,"We have a debate in English where we have to argue about a moral dilemma for our final. This is our debate:

You are on a footbridge above the train tracks. You can see that the train approaching the bridge is out of control. It is going to hit five people who are stuck on the track just past the bridge. The only way to stop it is to drop a heavy weight into its path. The only available heavy enough weight is a (very) fat man, who is also watching the train from the footbridge. You can push the fat man onto the track into the path of the train, which will kill him but save  the five people already on the track, or you can allow the train to continue on its way, which will mean that the five will die. Will you push the fat man (kill one) or let the train continue (5 dead)?

I have to advocate to let the five die. Here are some of the points I have already created: 

 

* By killing the fat man, you could kill more than 5 because of people on the train that run maintenance. It was never specified what type of train was out of control, so it could be a passenger train for all we know. When you push the fat man off the bridge, the most likely outcome is that the train will derail, killing more than just the man. Therefore, letting the five die is more merciful.  
* What if the fat man is a relative, or the five are wanted criminals/felons?  

There are no limits as to how this can turn, but we need to keep it safe for work. You could have Thomas the Tank Engine demand a sacrifice of human blood for all I care. Have fun! You can also advocate for the other side if you would like. Have fun!",17Dec2019,1

I think about her every day, and I fully acknowledge she probably doesnt think about me much when we are apart. 

My main issue is that I will text her several times and she will go days without replying. Twice it has gone 5-8 days and I literally thought she was ghosting me. It's not hyperbole to say both incidents drove me fucking insane. Then she finally decides to reply and gives a simple apology.

Im not one to dramatize much so I dont make a big deal out of it (but its a big fucking deal). I've accepted this is just her and I fight my anxieties just waiting for her to respond. I'm a big boy, I can deal.

The latest issue is that I sent her this multi text message about our next get together (kind of a special trip) and asked multiple questions and for her input. Days passed. I waited. I sent some memes and other mutual interest items in the interim.

She finally replies and doesnt reference anything I sent other than ""yes see you tomorrow"". So I know she at least got the first lengthy message.

I guess I can deal with the flippant ghostlike delays in replies but combined with ignoring 90% of the content and questions... driving me bonkers.

She is highly intelligent. But maybe it's a maturity thing or that she doesnt quite realize... She finished her finals last week so she is in between semesters (so would have less stress and things going on as an excuse).

627,"Hi everyone, I'm new to reddit and could use your perspective on the following. To keep things short, I think my mother is a narcissist. My father passed when I was 7 years old and my mother and I never had a close relationship. My father and I were best friends, two peas in a pod. Once he passed I even remember thinking, ""How are my mom and I going to get along?"" 

Growing up my mother was extremely abusive in every sense of the word. She wouldn't just hit me - the woman literally would beat me. She slapped, pushed, kicked, and pinched me as well. She would scream at me all of the time since I was a child. She worked nonstop, even on some weekends. When she did have free time, she would go on dates. There were men constantly in and out of the house. She would drag me to her boyfriends' homes where there wouldn't even be a functioning television. I remember being 8 or 9 and nearly crying because her and her boyfriend went off to his bedroom and I couldn't find the Disney channel. She often neglected me physically in this way, but she was also never emotionally present. If I cried she would lock me in a room or walk away. If I tried to speak to her she would scream over me or beat me until I stopped. 

Ironically the physical abuse stopped when she remarried when I was in the sixth grade. I say ironically because the same man who used to push her and emotionally/mentally berate me with constant chaotic screaming and demeaning behavior was startled when he saw her hit me for the first time and told her to never hit me again. So she stopped. And she leaned on me for emotional support from him. My mental health really spiraled despite appearing normal and healthy from the time we moved in with him to when we moved out when I was a senior in high school. We only moved because in one of his manic episodes where he used to destroy things around the house, especially in my room, and make me watch him beat my dog, I seriously thought he was going to kill me. I called the police despite my mom always telling me not to during previous fights because ""social services will get you and trust me you do not want to be with them. Those people will do horrible things and hurt you."" Which yes, I believe, but my goodness what a sick thing to say to a child who has undergone abuse her entire life.

Not even a month before graduating high school and she moved in with another man she met at a bar. I'm not kidding. She was divorced for probably 5 months if that during that point. I moved to college and stayed in the dorms for 4 years. 

My entire childhood is a blur. My earliest memories are of being beaten by someone who claimed (and continues to claim) that they love and care about me. I'm now 23 and I live in my own apartment. I graduated at the top of my class. I'm doing really well in my job and have started up two side businesses, but I still depend on her financially. She pays for my phone bill, one of my student loans, and contributes to 1/3 of my rent. 

 I have tried so hard to be close. I've tried so hard to get this unconditional love from her and I can't. My energy is so drained. She never admitted she was abusive and when I've brought up what she's done to me she cries and says sorry, ""but you don't know what it was like to have raise a kid on your own. Your father left nothing and I had to pay a mortgage. I worked so hard FOR YOU. Even to this day I work and live for you. I remarried for you so that we could have a house to live in. I'm living with my boyfriend now because it saves me money which I put towards helping you. Without him, I could of never sent you to college, paid your loans, or help with your rent."" 

She has gotten into buddhism and meditation and claims it changed her life. Yet she's just as superficial and ridiculous as she's ever been. She has literally no friends. None. She disrespects the boyfriend she lives with now and it reminds me of how she treated me as a child. Cold, distant, impatient, and anxious. He's a narcissist who didn't raise his own kid who now lives in another country and sees him only twice a year. They deserve each other.

I'm starting a new career full-time soon. I just accepted the position a few days ago. I told them I wouldn't be able to start until February because I have a cousin who is graduating from medical school in another country and I would love to be there to support her. Unfortunately my mom and her boyfriend are coming along and there is no way to avoid them during this trip. I have travelled with them before and it's an absolute nightmare. I despise being around them. Even visiting them at their home if I'm there for more than 2 nights I'm about ready to die. It's that painful. 

I wonder when I'll ever put myself first. To be honest the only reason I haven't told my mom I resent her and want nothing to do with her is because she's warmed up to me the past 3 years and she pays my bills. That's really it. I'm going to struggle severely financially if I don't have her help. 

I'm thinking of saying I can't make it to the medical graduation despite really wanting to be there for my cousin. The emotional and mental turmoil is not worth it. Plus I'm going to miss one entire month of work. 

I don't know what to do. Have you ever been in a similar situation? How does one distance themselves from a Narc parent while partially financially dependent on them?",17Dec2019,1

630,"Ok I’ve posted about this before....

Basically, I owned a discord server of 6,000 members. Decided I didn’t want to run it anymore and transferred ownership to a mod (this is a mod I trusted even tho no one else did. I always stuck up for him). One day later I realised I made a bad decision and asked for the server back. He said no and that “he would run it better”. This made me mad. 

As of now, I can confirm I do not want to run the server. But I’ve searched up messages and he has been talking shit about me. I’ve currently made an acocunt under a different name, and I’ve been made a mod on the server. I could literally delete all messages in the server as well as kick all 6.000 members. 

However, if this happens, he might think it was me (I’m a very paranoid person so idk if I’m being realistic). We did end on fairly good terms btw when we last spoke. 

But...he has info on me, and if he really wanted to, he may be able to doxx me (very very unlikely).

Do I just move on? Or do I get my revenge?",17Dec2019,1
631," I'm going to start with this. I do have schizophrenia and I do see a therapist regularly. Regardless of that, please don't just dismiss me as a crazy person, the things I say do have merit and there's real logical reason I believe these things happened, and that I'm not just delusional.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really quite know how to word this. I guess I will start from the top.When I was 17, (9 years ago) I guessed my friends recovery and hijacked my friends facebook and email, and made some stupid posts. A stupid thing to do without question. I eventually came clean a few weeks later and told him.

Before I told him though, he was trying to find out who did it. He had come over to my house and matched my ip to the one last used in his aol account, figuring out it was me.

Then, another time he came over, and he brought a flash drive. He then asked if I ""wanted a program that would let me watch everything on my dad's computer"" (I believe he just needed a back door to my network) to which I said no. Later that night he told me he had the old school duke nukem and without thinking I put it in my pc, tried to start it, a little cmd box popped up, and that was it.

This is where things began. Everything I did in my room, everything I did on my computer, or the things that were said in my house, my friends would refer to, on facebook, while hanging out, and in chats on xbox live. They were clearly mocking me. It might seem like they're just making fun of you online and to ignore them, but things got way more serious.

Maybe I can try and give some examples. If I were to wake up and listen to some music, they'd know, and they'd make fun of it. Here's an example.[https://imgur.com/xzY8IsA](https://imgur.com/xzY8IsA)\- the stealing childrens clothes thing. My friends kept accusing me of doing that after some of my sisters underwear had wound up in my laundry (in front of my laptop, as it was almost always open in my room) They even went as far as to stage an ""intervention""- the kesha part, rucka rucka ali was a big thing and I had head go cops and then wanted to hear the song it was based on

I took a shower and put the beatles on, and next thing I know the same guy is posting something along the lines of ""beatles and shower :)"" I mean, it's not just a coincidence, (however I cant find this post.)

Another example. I went to my brothers house and he had some friends over. One of them said ""hey, record him"" to the other one, and he proceeds to pull out his ipod, turn on the recording program, and stick it under his shirt.

They seemed to know everything I was doing all the time, everything I did on my computer was somehow known to my whole group of friends, constantly. And they would always mock me for it, I couldnt figure out how they knew, so I guess my mind tried to fill in the gaps. I started to think I was always being watched, I couldnt figure out how, and my mind just snapped. I started ripping my parents home apart looking for mics and cameras, eventually became psychotic, tried to tell the docs at the hospital and it was ignored, tried to tell the police and they just called my therapist. Every time I try and bring this up it's just ignored, but I know it happened and I'm having a very hard time living with it. These people basically ruined my entire life.

I really don't have any proof and I'm the only witness. Gangstalking is the technical term for this I guess. I have been diagnosed schizophrenic and I do see a therapist, but I swear to you I'm not just crazy and its frustrating that I keep getting dismissed so easily just because of that diagnosis. My therapist is the only one who's ever really considered it a possibility without dismissing me right off the bat. I have absolutely no idea how I would ever prove this. It is still ongoing so maybe I could trick them into providing evidence somehow.

My therapist has offered to take me to the local police and try and talk with them, but it was so long ago and I don't know what, if anything, they could do? She has spoken to a former cop acquaintance about it and he basically said because it was so long ago and because I dont have proof he doesn't know what they would do. Is it likely that they might go question this person? I have a feeling he might just crumple if the cops were asking about it. If I were to go to the police, is there anything I should say or clarify? (judging by this post? Its very difficult to describe.)

Sorry if this is confusing and for the wall of text. I am 100% serious. Please try not to dismiss this as just a delusion. I think my biggest obstacles are my lack of solid evidence and it being so long ago. I've read that the statute of limitations has exceptions if new details emerge, or something like that.

I guess my main question is, what can I do about this? how can I get these people caught, and how would I prove it or maybe get them to admit to it?

632,"I'll try to make it short:

Recently moved to Switzerland for 3 months to improve my French, which despite being good by my own country's standards, is about that of a child's over here. As a result I can't hold a conversation with people too long before they get frustrated; my co-workers usually give up and speak in English, plus I don't really know or relate to them as they're all quite a bit older than me. 
   This not only makes language-learning difficult (why I'm here); it makes me feel very isolated. I'm not much of a people's person anyway, but when I can't even express myself it's like... Having a disability I guess.
  Nevertheless, I met my next-door neighbour today; she's also new here, but French-speaking. She's also my age (which is handy), and above all in the brief conversation we had she didn't lose interest after it became clear I didn't understand a lot of what she said. In fact, she fed the conversation herself and laughed, which made me feel good (getting other people to laugh in a different language is extremely hard, trust me). 
   Anyway, what I wanted to know is if you had any advice on what to do next? I mean, she's the first person who's shown me empathy/interest since I've arrived (and I instantly liked her) - but I don't know how or if I should approach her. We live in an apartment complex - can I just knock on her door? The chances of us meeting again aren't too slim, but I feel like this is an opportunity I should take, and she's a person I want to know. I just don't know what would come off as too forward/stalkery, and I don't want to frustrate her too.

Suddenly she got up and came to us shouting ''shut up before I kill you both''. Right after that she went back to watching tv. Our mom isn't violent or angry person so that came out of nowhere. Over all we had amazing childhood and our parents were good to us so that incident kinda faded away.

  
I am 23 now and still to this day we haven't even mentioned this to our mom. No discussions or anything about it. As if it didn't even happen. That incident comes to my mind sometimes once or twice per year and gets me thinking about it.

639,"[TL;DR my coworker doesn't trust my abilities at work and, after confiding in her a year ago about recovering from a panic disorder, she will often bring up my anxiety unprompted and try reading my mood/ use it against me during her lectures.]


A few days ago my senior coworker and I were dealing with a rush of customers in the store. This coworker has a habit of getting pretty worked up and resorts to micromanaging the entire opporation even for something as totally inconsiquential as how specifically we should toss unwanted recepts.

I was getting a bit fed up about the way she was tailing me and I asked her to please calm down.

""It's okay. We both got this."" I said in an encouraging tone.

At which point she stopped pestering me for a bit. When the crowd died down however she pulled me aside and started lecturing me.

""Don't ever tell me to calm down again. I have been working this job for five years and I was basically forced to take on the role of manager and train other employees far too early. That's just how I run the show now so you have to stop taking it so personally.""

me: ""I understand... I just want you to know that you can trust me to do my job.""

""I hope you realize that (employee x) has worked here far longer than you have. You can't do what she can do and I still have to train you on so much."" 

It's worth noting that I'm the ""newest"" regular employee there as of six months ago but I've been working there over the rushes for the past two years already. I'm trained enough to be able to train my own batch of new hires as I have done before.

Despite this fact, and being trusted by the other employees in the store (including employee X), she will follow my every move and try training me on things I've long since made habitual.

Even today she commented that she didn't want to go to the bathroom for fear of leaving me alone. There was NOTHING I was untrained about that needed supervision and if the store got busy in those three minutes all I had to do was call another coworker over from another part of the store to hop on a register. It was not a big deal.

The worst part is, while she was lecturing me, she started bringing up my anxiety and pointing it out as the reason I take everything personally.

""I know you get anxious and I know you are so sensitive about how other people act around you but you can't take it so personally. This is a work environment.""

This is really hurtful because about a year ago I confided in her about my anxiety after I had a panic attack at work. Since then I've been working hard to get better. At this point, after not having an attack in ten months, I just want to go to work and forget about my anxiety. I want to show myself I can do my job well.

It therefore doesn't help when she brings it up unpompted. If anything I find that to be far less professional and a breach of trust. I was just really caught off guard by her pointing out my anxiety.
(plus by bringing up something so personal she is the one who made it personal)

 I know I can't hope to vouche for myself but I'm really a pretty chill person now. In fact I have a tendancy to *under*react to precieved slights. 

Despite this If I do even the most innocent thing like rub my eye out of boredom she'll stare at me with wide-eyed concern. When I look back at her and ask her why she's staring, she'll respond,""I thought you were crying.""

or if I seem to be in any mood other than super happy she'll lean in and ask what's wrong and if I need a moment. She acts like she can read my mind at every moment, and it's frustrating when she is so entirely off-base.

 another example is when one of our coworkers came to work feeling bad about something. she seemed upset but I didn't for a second think she was mad at me. a long time ago I might have questioned it but I've since gotten good at separating myself from other people. 
suddenly my coworker comes up to me and says,

""Oh btw, so-and-so isn't mad at you. She's upset about [explains situation].""

O... kay? I didn't show any indecation that it bothered me so what is her deal bring it up like that?

My other coworkers see how she treats me too and agrees that she's totally out of line. They say she has a superiority complex and none of them like working with her because of it.

I've tried talking to her about it but she often just steam rolls the converstaion with what I've already mentioned here.
(i.e. stop taking it personally, I'm basically a manager so shut it.)

I'm so frustrated. I just have no idea how to handle this situation. Should I try harder to confront her? Should I write her a note? Should I bring HR into it? should I just ignore it?",17Dec2019,1
640,"My little brother failed his first semester of college last year, I understand it happens to many many people, he then failed spring semester. The college told him he would have to appeal, a month or so later they approved his appeal and let him come back. 

Now this semester, I have access to his online stuff so I can check his grades, he’s been doing great. He’s been getting Bs and As on most of his assignment, I made to remind him everyday but he would get annoyed with me and so I backed off. 

Around November, his grades have been slipping a little and so I went to him and told him to talk to his professors and to visit the schools tutoring centers, he kept telling me he did all that and he’s going to be fine. Right now we’re on finals week, I checked his grades again, he has an F in every class, I’m freaking out and there he is just relaxing and playing games. He did the same thing last year, my mother isn’t going to help him because “he’s the adult, he made these decisions so it’s not my problem” 

So no he’s going to be asked to appeal again and there’s a chance they are going to say no. 

He’s always told me how exhausted he is going to school, but he only has one class on campus and they rest are online. I told him to take a semester or a year off and he yelled “NO”.

I was strolling through the city yesterday and when I came back home I found my room after a shakedown. My mother did it and she found a pack of ciggaretes, empty bottle of beer and empty cans of energy drinks. I was eaten out and it wasn't because I destroy my health. It was because I spent my mother's money. I got beaten up, I was hit in a face so hard that I couldn't see anything in one eye for a few hours. It wouldn't be this bad if she didn't try to ruin my grandma's opinion about me and if she didn't tell my brothers that I'm a pathological kid and I deserved to be beaten up. My life has been going like this since I was 7 probably. She kept telling me shit like: 'you are dumb' or 'you are a fucking retard' and when I graduated from primary school she started telling me that I'm a misscariage and the worst of her sons.

Not sure if this is the right place to discuss this, but I was wondering how to deal with a situation at work. 

It used to be a very casual environment. We'd come in in jeans and t-shirt, joke around etc. Everyone was friends with everyone and there were no real hierachial structures. 

Lately, my boss started to criticize my outfits as he deemed them too casual. I work in tech support and we all wear jeans and t-shirts really, so I shrugged it off as I am also too poor to afford ""nicer"" clothes anyway. I do however take care to look presentable and not like a total slob. 
But he kept telling me to dress up more, ""what will the clients think"", ""you represent our company so you have to dress the part"", etc. 

Then, he'd come by our office randomly and comment on my posture/behaviour: ""Elbows off the table, please"", ""Sit up straight, the clients can see you"", ""I can't believe I have to tell you this but please cross your legs"", ""You have to stop yawning, it looks bad"" ... 

It honestly took me by surprise and I am not sure how to deal with this issue. Is it normal that a boss criticizes how you sit? He seems extremely concerned that the clients will get a bad impression of our company, but I feel like I'm just being a normal human being. I'm not doing yoga in my office chair, if it matters, simply moving around normally. Just not gracefully enough, it seems ...

How would you proceed? Am I being unreasonable when I don't change my behaviour/clothes? My contract says nothing about work attire and everyone just comes in wearing whatever in tech support. We do have occasional contact with clients, but I don't see an issue meeting them in casual clothes as I am tech support, not a salesman ...",17Dec2019,1
647,"So to set the story I am very far along in my pregnancy. Me and my partner of 3 years are expecting 2 girls in February. So we had been fighting a lot. He has been distant and cold. In the beginning he was super excited and supportive. He is very excited for the kids so ik that isn't the issue. Also in the past he has cheated or had cheating tendencies. Like breaking rules I had set. So I am not vague and sound controlling after I caught him being flirty with a girl I told him no snapchatting her or any women until I can trust him. Come to figure out he was snapping her for a month and would delete the evidence. Regardless he kissed butt and I forgave him. I am his frist everything and he is young (not that makes it okay) but he seemed legitimately sorry. About 3 months pass and we are doing great.

Fast forward to now his best friend is now dating that girl. I get along with her because I am not one to make it awkward and it's not my business who his friend dates. I come to figure out the other night he was flirting with her (while I wasnt there) confront of him to piss his friend off. Again we have had some major issues just right before this due to him hating being strapped down so young. So I had a talk with him. I wasnt mean. I told him I loved him and I was more disappointed. I felt like he has been abusing what our engagement ring symbolizes so I gave it back in a nice way and told him he need to really think about what he wants. He ended up flipping out saying getting engaged was a big mistake, telling, threw the ring, and said he was going to sell it. (9 times out of 10 he lashes out if thier is a disagreement so I wasnt shocked) I just dont want him to do something he will regret and stay with me because its familiar and comfortable.

I have been cheated on many times in the past so this was a really low blow for seemingly no reason. I’ve been nothing but friendly and supportive of this person.

- I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Which is fine, I have to change my eating habits and other things in my life. But at this point I have IBS-G, PCOS and I’m lactose intolerant.

Basically, I owned a discord server of 6,000 members. Decided I didn’t want to run it anymore and transferred ownership to a mod (this is a mod I trusted even tho no one else did. I always stuck up for him). One day later I realised I made a bad decision and asked for the server back. He said no and that “he would run it better”. This made me mad. 

As of now, I can confirm I do not want to run the server. But I’ve searched up messages and he has been talking shit about me. I’ve currently made an acocunt under a different name, and I’ve been made a mod on the server. I could literally delete all messages in the server as well as kick all 6.000 members. 

However, if this happens, he might think it was me (I’m a very paranoid person so idk if I’m being realistic). We did end on fairly good terms btw when we last spoke. 

But...he has info on me, and if he really wanted to, he may be able to doxx me (very very unlikely).

Do I just move on? Or do I get my revenge?

Ps. Atm I’m thinking of just removing about half the members. Best of both worlds.",17Dec2019,1

655,"So last weekend i went out with my friends, so the one friend who organizes everything invited some girlfriends of his which i already knew prior to this evening because we had chilled before with these girls. 
So starting the evening everything was completely normal, we were all drinking and playing drinking games and stuff. When i started to notice that this one girl was looking more into my eyes and looked more at me then at the others, i noticed it however i didn’t think anything of it. Then suddenly an hour/ one a half hour before we would go to the city centre to go the clubs, this girl started to get pretty close to me(as in standing super close and stuff). Also when we started taking pictures with the group she wanted to stay next to me. And she also wanted a picture with just me. So at this point i was kinda drunk and still didn’t really think anything of it. So fast forward to the ride into the city centre, she immediately called my name and wanted to tell me something about her job(super random) which lead to us cycling next to each other. At the time i still didn’t think anything about it. I thought she was just being nice. When we were at the club she danced with me and talked with only me. I still didn’t think anything of it. Then she suddenly wanted to ship a friend of hers with my best friend. And talked to me about it the rest of the night. Which also led to us trying to accomplish something together and being around each other the whole night. Now fast forward to us going back to our bicycles i noticed that somehow she was a bit annoyed and moody. I didn’t know why and when i asked her she said she wasn’t. 

Alright so me and my best friend had the same route home and the girls had another route home so when we said our goodbyes to each other my friend immediately asked my why i never made a move on this girl. So i was like, what do you mean, she isn’t into me? And then he told me that me and this girl were with each other the whole night and that we looked cute together. He also said that the whole group talked about us during the night(including the girls friends) saying that we looked cute together. So my friend said that it was obvious that she was into me. Because she started getting close to me when she had alcohol in her system, which helped her be more social towards me and have less fear. And that the fact that she was with me the whole night also was so obvious according to my friend.

So my question is, did i notice all or most of the signals while thinking nothing of it because i was that drunk. Or was this girl just not into me.
If i’m going to be honest i must say that i do like her. And i wouldn’t mind getting to know her much better. I just want to know an outsiders opinion on this (especially girls). Was she into me or was she just being nice like i thought?",17Dec2019,1

I feel so fucking sick and depressed right now.

 Some context

 A while ago, I posted about my brother (great hardworking guy, but dumb) getting with his friends drug dealers cracked out girlfriend and then her pretty much forcing him to Mary her when she saw he was making good money. All the signs where  there not to do it, and I asked this sub If i should say anything or voice my concern about her. But the response from everyone was that he's an adult and can make his own decisions. 

About 3 years later there still married and he's making even more money and putting her through school. He's killing him self working more then 100hrs a week , while she uses his money to go and stay at the beach because it's therapeutic. She even recently made him buy a house near the ocean to ""save money"". So now that's where we are right now.

Today I was helping her pack her car with the stuff they left in our garage , while they waited for there house to be ready to move in to. We talked like normal while moving boxes and when it was full she interrupted me talking and said with a smile "" so you want me to suck your dick or...? "" I was so shocked, I called reply  ""what was that ?"" She repeated her self and I just said "" no that's okay"" and she started talking about the rest of her week like nothing. I stayed and talked for a good five  more minutes trying to hold a smile and comfortably continue the conversation until I asked when she was coming back for the other boxes and let her know I would be here later. This just happened 30 mins ago. 

I don't know what to do guys. I feel so depressed knowing that my brother is silently suffering like this and knowing he deserves better. Im working through my emotions right now trying to figure out what I should do, I know telling him is the right thing to do, but maybe this isn't the time to tell him. Since it might cause more issues when they just got a house. And maybe I'm not in the right state of mind right now either to act on this. This past month has been terrible and I don't know how much more I can mentally take with my job laying me off, my bed, computer and phone destroyed by water damage to the house, having to move back into my parents and now in have to decide to I'm going to make my brother suffer or take this information with me to the grave and be a terribel person just to give him an ounce of ignorant happiness. 

I feel like I'm entering hyper levels of depression right now and I just need any sort of advice to ground me.

She's cheating on him to compensate for how unhappy the relationship is, and even though I can't prove it there's evidence that he's cheating on her too. 

I've strongly encouraged her to end things because the whole situation is toxic and escalating over time. She knows that she has supportive friends who will help her with the process of moving out, give her a place to stay, and be there for her emotionally.

During middle school it wasn't that big of an issue because no matter how much I missed they couldnt hold me behind. Going into freshman year I knew if I didnt attend I could potentially fail. And that's what happened. I started going to school less and less and already failed a few of my classes for first term. I dread going to school everyday and it really takes a toll on my mental health. My guardian wont allow me to take online school unless I finish this school year, but there are 7 months left and I just cant do it. I'm too scared to go now because I feel like I'll get in shit with the school board and my teachers.

No matter how hard I try to attend I just feel like it's pointless and I'm just going to end up failing anyway.

I want to convince her to let me finish this school year online and let me get my life together and hopefully begin attending regular highschool again for next year.

I’ve met this girl through work and after I quit that job, since we were getting to know each other well, we started going out and we realized we both had been interested in each other for a while. We’ve met 3 times now since I quit my job so it’a still very fresh. 
There are things with her that I didn’t understand, because she’s definitely not like any other girl I’ve met. She’s kinda dorky, visibly insecure and not very good at socializing, and may say something that others my age would consider random or ”inappropriate”. Not in a bad way of course and I thought it was cute.

 It’s so difficult to explain over text like this but I thought the whole reason she’s acting differently is because she has NO experience with guys. Ever. She’s 19, I’m 21 and I’m her first guy, first intimate kiss, etc. It may still contribute to her behaviour but I started googling a lot and I came across Aspergers Syndrome. And the crazy part is that when I started reading the symptoms, I think pretty much every single symptom fit her perfectly. It’s like everything clicked and I got that ”ohhhhh” moment when I realized.

For example;
• Inability to express one’s own feelings; I’ve noticed this quite a bit with her, although sometimes she may get really happy all of sudden and tell me, but she has a difficulty expressing intimacy. Not sure if this comes with her inexperience too. 

• Often verbalizes internal thoughts that most would keep private; She’s been doing this quite a lot, even when we didn’t know each other that well.


• Appears to lack empathy; Not always, but she has a hard time showing affection and intimacy 


• Has a difficult time interacting with peers; This one’s my biggest sign IMO. She has almost no friends, maybe 1 or 2 that she sees once a month. She doesn’t really do anything, doesn’t go out. When we used to work together I did notice she’s not really making any friends, she used to be by herself a lot and she didn’t really know how to approach new coworkers or what to talk about. She has referred to herself as a loner even though she’s many times said she wants to know everyone. And I don’t think it’s social anxiety, I’ve had it and it’s definitely different from what I’ve noticed, she’s just more ”random” and it’s like she doesn’t understand some social norms? 

• May not make eye contact or may stare at others; She definitely avoids eye contact quite a bit, especially when I started to get to know her, but once we got comfortable she wouldn’t really have that problem anymore

• Heightened sensitivity and overstimulation to loud noises, bright lights, unusual textures, or strong tastes; This one surprised me but for some reason she’s really sensitive to bright lights. Her phone and computer screen are always at the lowest possible brightness and I’ve had to mention many times to turn it up. And my eyesight is pretty good.

• Poor coordination, Clumsiness; This doesn’t really mean anything because a lot of people are clumsy, but yeah she’s definitely this.

• Difficulties with changes or upsets in routine; She’s extremely strict with her routine and can’t handle change that well. She’s also showed some OCD-type behaviours when she’s cleaning, making sure the bed is ALWAYS made in a special way, gets frustrated by slight dust inside her ceiling lamp, cleans every day etc.

• May be unable to understand sarcasm or jokes, Lack of social skills; I’ve noticed when flirting in a sarcastic way, or flirting in general she usually doesn’t know how to answer, or how to flirt back. And as I said earlier she is lacking social skills which I’ve noticed quite a bit,

• May have one or a few very select interests that one is extremely knowledgeable about; Drawing and architechture, almost obsessed.

• Loneliness and social isolation, Lowered self-esteem, Tendency toward shyness, Anxiety, Moodiness, Depression; Literally all of these. Especially loneliness and social isolation.

 So, what do you think? I know there’s no way for sure, and these are pretty broad and could fit anyone but put together like this, it feels like it’s literally her. I’ve met people with aspergers before and I definitely notice similarities, probably just me, but you don’t expect attractive people to have it (didn’t mean to sound shallow).

And if it’s the case, what now? As I’m fairly certain she does have aspergers, how can I make sure I’m a good guy for her? We’re doing fine now, but I’ve been thinking about the difficulty of showing affection part, because it may become a problem? And leading the relationship forward?


Also I read these sites ([1](https://www.millcreekofmagee.com/disorders/aspergers/signs-causes-symptoms/) and [2](https://www.autismspeaks.ca/about-autism/what-is-autism/asperger-syndrome/) ) about more symptoms and I’d say atleast 90% of the symptoms fit in perfectly.",17Dec2019,1

Last month, I couldn’t one day because I was with a friend. My sibling contacted that friend to try to see if I was with them because they thought I was lying.

They ALWAYS assume that I am lying about not being able to babysit and will act so childish when I say no. I am never allowed to say no. I’m not allowed to be busy. I’m expected to just put my life and plans on the back burner. It is constant. I’ve been asked to babysit maybe the past five days in a row.

If I say I have schoolwork to do because I’m in college, that’s immediately dismissed because they think college isn’t time consuming or important.

Next week, right before Christmas, I was asked to babysit and I said no because I have so much to do for the holiday, which is true. I have plans that day to get together with a friend for christmas.

690,"Hello All. My lovely wife and I are newly married and volunteered to host holiday parties this year.

To keep it short, we have a family member who has substance abuse problems when it comes to alcohol. I do not know the full extent of these problems but I do know the individual has had legal trouble and no longer has a license due to operating while intoxicated. Alcohol is part of the culture in the area that we live so it is not uncommon for individuals to have a few drinks here and there. We have asked our families for advice and protocol for having alcohol at our party (there has always been alcohol at past parties) but have not really gotten an answer. Many of our holiday traditions involve specialty drinks and we always have a fully stocked bar and fridge for hosting guests.

At past family gatherings older members of the family have kept an eye on this individual but I have not seen any further action when it comes to this person actually drinking. It seems that the individual is just allowed to do it (obviously they are an adult) however after the fact the rest of the family is usually upset (at the individual or the host).

My wife and I are younger members of the family and want to ensure that everyone has a great holiday and is safe. The individual is in the generation above us and always gets a ride to family events so they will not be driving. That being said neither of us have suffered from addiction and understand that it is a disease and do not want to cause stress on the individual.

Do we need to put our liquor/beer away to avoid temptation? Do we need to monitor/confront the older individual if they do choose to drink? If so, how given the generation (think our parents cousin or a grandparent)? Obviously we will have nonalcoholic drink options but if they request alcohol what do we do?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",17Dec2019,1

Every family occasion it’s conversation about diapers and if his poop is solid? And what shoes size he’s gone up to, and when they’re not talking about that they’re talking about pregnancy, and I feel like there is no adult talk, it’s just kids kids kids, I’m in the army so I don’t intend on getting pregnant any time soon, so I feel left out of conversation every time.
If I try to change the topic, the kid will do something cute and then everyone talks about babies for another hour. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love my nephew, but I also enjoy conversation I can add input to, plus I just find baby talk hella cringey, I can’t stand it.
And I just feel awful trying to fake excitement for every medial thing the kid does, and trying to act interested when they talk about his potty training, or what he’s eating.
So I guess what I’m getting at here, is how do I connect with my family when I have nothing in common to talk about, and no way of keeping them interested in anything other than kids.",17Dec2019,1

696,"The lowdown on my current job: I have worked for a mom &amp; pop place since they opened a few years ago. Initially, I was being paid $12/hour as a bar manager plus I was making awesome tips. There was no limit to my hours really as he only had me and one other bartender. Then we opened for lunch, forcing me to work straight through (zero break to sit down) 16 hour shifts. I did this without complaining, not because I really wanted or needed to but because the restaurant needed me to. I really value the work I do in that it is a reflection of my abilities and aptitude. 
At the end of last year, he sat me down and told me he could not afford to pay me $12 an hour anymore, he was paying out way too much in wages and it was going to break the business. I was, and am, still making very good tips from great regulars so I wasn't too upset by then making $4.13/hr. However, I was upset when he suggested I could continue doing all the work I was doing (ordering, inventory, bar menu and design, social media, you name it). As if it was something I just did for fun and not because I was being paid to do it.
Over the following summer, he doubled our patio size and opened a walk-up bar window. It became impossible for me as a singular bartender to keep up with answering the phone, running food inside and outside, keeping up with my own guests, making drinks for the entire restaurant (now at like 85 seats), taking and preparing to-go orders, washing my own dishes (no dishwasher ever), and desperately trying to keep items stocked in our small space. It became very frustrating to never be able to give the service I know I'm capable of.
Another thing to mention is the owner, who is the ""manager"" is never there. Not only does this make things more overwhelming, but on the rare occasion he is there, he is completely useless and usually stands in the way of the bar and bobs up and down dancing. I can't make this stuff up. 
Recently he began renting a building next to us that is not up to code, part of our liquor license, etc. and hosting private parties in them. He wants me to work one with 50+ there by myself and there is no bar set up whatsoever, no sinks, nothing. I will also have to run next door to wash all my glasses/dishes/bar equipment and run food. It's not physically possible. Last night I overheard the guest telling him he really wanted two servers or bartenders because he didn't think it would possible for one person to cater the event, that they were having at *least* 50 people but probably more. My boss advises him, ""You know how it is, you bring more people in to work and then everyone just hangs out. No one will work as hard."" Like yes, it is true that I would not have to work as hard with some help, BUT IT WOULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE. On top of all of this, he wants me to clean up from that party while also ""watching"" the bar next door after 9pm. This is all supposed to happen Friday, our busiest night of the week. He is guaranteed to not be there, so again, no manager. Just me, one server, three kitchen staff, and two buildings with over 100 seats plus standing room. For $4.13/hr.
On top of all this, because that building is not part of the restaurant, I wouldn't be covered under the workmen's comp. I could get in trouble as a bartender for serving people there. I don't want to suffer through a shift like that or his lack of management anymore.
I have another job, not worried about that bit. But I hate confrontation SO much that I'm sweating thinking about telling him I quit, even though this biz is ripe with turnover. If I don't quit, I'm going to walk out or blow up at work. I have no doubt after how my last shift went.
Should I just tell him it's because I have another job? Because of his illegal practices that I'm not comfortable participating in? Do I need to give a reason at all?

tldr; I am ready to quit my job but don't know what to say to my boss.",17Dec2019,1
698,"Hello all, I want to get perspective, and figure out whether this is a normal amount of weight that most people have to carry around, or whether my circumstances are unusually bad, and might be a factor in my recent unhappiness. I will try to keep this brief:

I (25 F) was dating a guy I had known for several years, “Jose” (31 M). When Jose and I first started dating, he had a very close friend named “Maria” (30 F). While I am confident that he and Maria have never dated or anything, Maria was also best friends with an ex-girl friend of Jose, “Alejandra” (30 F). After about 6 months of Jose and I dating, it came to light that everything Jose mentioned about us/our relationship to his friend Maria, was immediately being reported by Maria, back to the ex, Alejandra. This made me a little uncomfortable, but I ignored it. Then, Maria tried making up lies about me a couple times, saying I had threatened her, or her kids, or Alejandra, etc. These were pretty quickly spotted as lies, but Jose never called out Maria on it. After a year and a half together, Jose had a huge career change for the better, but he needed to move 8 hours away. He was telling me that he wanted to get a house together and prepare for us getting married. I told him I would be happy to move with him, but that he needed to cut Maria out of his life completely if he wanted us to continue our relationship at all. This was after consulting several counselors and family members on both sides, who all agreed that we didn’t have a healthy relationship ahead of us if Maria stayed in our lives, and if Jose failed to stand up for our relationship in the future. 

That being said, Jose gave up Maria, we moved 8 hours away. I left my friends and my family, and started a new job, because Jose was my best friend and we truly loved each other. It was hard. I worked two jobs while being a student for most of that year, but we built a new life together and made new friends. In July I got an engagement ring, then in August it came out that he had been secretly calling Maria again for a month. At first he said it was just to say happy birthday to one of his God kids (Maria’s daughter), but he admitted that he also really missed Maria, and after that they just gotten right back to being good friends, this time behind my back. I told Jose how much I was hurt by the fact that he lied to me, by the fact that he had previously let Maria lie about me and try to break us up, and I told him that he was having an emotional affair. He just laughed at that last part. I asked Jose to keep his promise and cut it off, and he flat out said no, so I left. At first he acted shocked, but he still let me go, all because I wasn't okay with him keeping Maria around.

I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to go back to where I was from (Southern CA) or what to do. My parents had just move 3 states away a week before I broke off my engagement. My mom asked if I wanted to come stay with them for a few months and help them get settled in, so that’s what I did. Enter issue 2:

During ages 11-15 my step-dad sexually abused me. I told my mom about it several times, but she never wanted to believe me/deal with it. She went from “don’t make things up” to “I’m so sorry, I had no idea it was that bad” to “I’ve never heard of this before today” to “I really don’t think he’s attracted to you, you must have misunderstood something” to “Well, with the way you dress”. When I was younger I told myself she probably didn’t have the facilities to deal with what was happening because she was dealing with an addiction to opiates. Now though, having lived with my mom and step-dad for the last 3 months while I help them finish settling in, my step-dad is still a real creep, and when I’ve brought it up to my mom, she has the same type of reaction. I feel angry and hurt that my mom, to this day, will not acknowledge that my step-dad abused me, or she will try to downplay/ignore/blame it on me. 

All this being said, I am moving back to Southern California next month. Yay, good news! However, these last couple of months I’ve been feeling really down, unhappy, bitter, resentful, and lost at times. I feel like I’ve gone from one situation where someone I loved was happy to stand by and watch other people hurt me, to another situation where someone else I loved was also happy to do the same thing. My ultimate question is this: is this a normal amount of crap that people put up with? Do most people have to put up with a loved one watching them get abused as a child, or hurt as an adult? I’m tired of feeling like I am just a piece of trash, on the bottom of everyone’s totem pole. 

I don't mean to complain, or sound helpless. I work very hard at my job, and I'm getting a master's degree. I am always trying to grow as a person and empower myself. Thank you in advance for any insight you can give me.",17Dec2019,1

700,"Background context- I’m 20 and he’s 21 we’ve been together three years, we’re a pretty close couple, I definitely consider him my best friend and vice versa. We’re also pretty inseparable, we spend most days together (aside from work). He moved in with me about 6 months ago. I live with my mom still but all other three siblings had a significant other living with us at one point so when I moved my bf in my mom didn’t care, especially since she knew it wasn’t just a quick fling. 

Why we need to break up I think- so last month (nov 21st) my moms abusive boyfriend attacked my boyfriend because he was tweaking (on crystal meth) and paranoid my boyfriend was going to kill him because he saw him with knife while he was cooking. This was very scary as tweakers tend to be strong/don’t feel pain. Well we called the cops and he’s in jail now. I feel unsafe with my boyfriend here, I also personally feel unsafe as my moms boyfriend has also attacked me (sexually). So I want to move out as quick as possible but I have no job which I explained in more detail on another post on why I can’t get one. 
My bf however can still get a job, this has put a lot of pressure on him as he feels he needs to move us out. So I think we should break up because 1) I feel guilty for bringing him into my shitty life with all my baggage and feel as if he doesn’t need to deal with any of it, he’s barely 21 and doesn’t need the stress of getting a full time job and trying to move him and his girlfriend into an apartment ASAP. That’s a lot of pressure to ask a 21 year old to pick job or career they’ll be happy with long term and to start paying rent and to make those decisions in a months time. We also both have extremely poor backgrounds too so it’s not like his mom or dad can help us nor do they have these are my problems. I want him to live his life and take his time building a comfortable sustainable life, not fucking it all up because he’s in love with me.  2) the reason why I don’t want him just to move out and continue to date because then we’ll be on very phases of life. If we’re not living together then I don’t have time for a relationship, I don’t have time for something casual as well as this might make me sound like a complete shit person but if he’s not making a lot of money to help me move out then I need a way to make money and the only way I know how to make big money quick is sex work. I need a cash only job that’s why sex work seems like my only option. But that’s obviously not an option while I have a boyfriend...

Do you think I should break up with him, I want opinions because I mainly want to break up with him to take the pressure off of him..I want him to live his life and not be stressed because he fell in love with someone with a shit ton of baggage..is this a if I love him set him go situation or would be really fucked up to break up with him over this? I still very much love him, hence why I have all this guilt and anxiety. And I know he still loves me a lot..idk let me know please.",17Dec2019,1

In my country, some parents really disaprove the idea of teenage love, and my ""girlfriend´s"" parents are one of these complicated types, and she is affraid that her parents discover our ""thing"", to show you how weird it is, I am not even allowed to call her my girlfriend, because she is so paranoid about it.

704,"In short, he always has to have a reason so that he can decide for himself if it’s okay to change a plan. For example, every year my dad and my step mom wants us (my siblings and I) to go over to my grandparents-in-law’s house with them to make desert during the holidays. 

So this year, my step mom texts me if whether I would like to go over this year and I basically said “no, I am busy that day”. A week later, I get a similar text, but this time it was from my dad and the text was presented to me as more of a command rather than a question. So again, I said “no I would not be able to come this year but thanks”. Then I get a text if whether or why there was a ‘conflict’....the thing is, there is no conflict, I just don’t want to go. 

(Quick Backstory: The reason I don’t want to go is because I never enjoy myself going over to my step grandparents’ house and there’s always been this distance between us and I always feel uncomfortable when I do go over).

So, there has to be a ‘legitimate reason’ in his mind so he can agree for me to not go. I just turned 30 this year and I’m simply done feeling forced to go to things that I don’t to go to. I am an adult with other obligations and apparently that’s not clear to him. This doesn’t mean I don’t love my family, it’s just one event that I don’t want to go to and apparently he wants to make it a problem. 

Any advice would be amazing, thank you.",17Dec2019,1
705,"This will be a bit long winded and nicknames have been used to protect others identities. Sorry for being long winded in advance.

About 13 years ago me and my brothers mom passed away, leaving a significant hole in our lives on top of a house with a 50k business elan on it. After some back and fourth with the company that held the lean against it, they settled for 10k$. Both Me and my brother paid up 5k each as the place we were living at was currently purging people under a certain age(we were both 25/26).

The house had to sit in limbo for a year and we both moved in with Uncle Scams (not a joke). We had everything we had in what was effectively a squatter home. After a year, we moved in to our new home and had to boot out another brother, pickpocket.

He absolutely hated living here for the longest time. He has some severe mental issues with hating our birth mom. He initially didn't even want the house, but was left in a no win scenario if he/we stayed where we were at. He caved in to getting the house with me because at the very least it was a stable place.(I have a philosophy that to achieve anything you must have stable ground beneath you first).

A year passes and we have to go in for my brothers SSI reevaluation. My brother let me in on the meeting and it turns out there is a reason he always seemed a bit absent minded; he was legally retarded and effectively would never grown beyond the personality of a 13 year old.

The doctor actually pulled me aside and told me that under no circumstances is my brother to live alone. 

I knew for a long time that my brother was derpy, sometimes extremely careless and accident prone. I lost a couple of decent paying jobs in the past due to me having to rush home and save him from his own stupidity. I don't resent losing them, family always comes first and any job that puts work above family isn't worth keeping to begin with.

We lived here for the last 13 years and his mental health is starting to take it's toll on me. My brother has a nasty habit of dating THE worst of the worst in terms of men(something he inherited from mom). I am talking about everything from unstable homeless, abusive and even one that was pimping him out on the side (which I chased away with a hammer).

I will admit up front that I am not perfect, I have had problems keeping a regular 9-5 for a long time now, mostly relying on side work, mturk and selling things I pick up at yard sales. His income comes in at around 9k+ a year and mine caries at around 4900-7k. We have never gone hungry or lacked funds to get something fixed when it goes south. (this will be important later as it is a key argument he complains about) our bills comes to a bit over 400$ after food a month or about 550$ during the summer.

Over the years, whenever he would get into an argument about something petty (usually about breaking rules we both agreed to to keep people from taking advantage of him) He would yell ""I pay all teh billz!""

My brother is notoriously bad at math and while I may be true all the money comes from his account out of convenience, all the extra spending came out of me(fast food, house repairs, random crap around the house etc) usually to the tune of about half the bills or a little more.

About 4 years ago I got myself injured pretty badly working at a local farm start up. My feet have since degraded to the point where there are days/weeks where I have to crawl around to get anywhere or use a wheelchair. I can still stand, but I'm at the point that if I walk more than a couple miles in a day or stand for more than 2 hours I run the risk of being down for days at a  time.

This severely impacted my money making potential. I have been denied jobs solely on the basis that I just cannot stand up for as long as they want or that a wheelchair would not be becoming of the company. I was in a pretty bad depression and with sludge monster(his new nickname given to him by a 2 year old) constantly bickering with me I was just ready to lay down and die.

Then she came into my life. I haven't had a GF since I was 13, I even avoided it since said GF at 13 was killed in gas station robbery in NY while on vacation. However, she was a bit on an introvert like me. We both liked the same hobbies, were both trolling sarcastic assholes, the works.

She moved in at 3 months and the jealous side of my brother came out. At first he tried to block her, but lost on account that he had brought in HIS BF's in to live with him on multiple occasions way earlier, usually ending poorly.

He then moved to what I call the snakes bit attack. Sludge monster has a nasty habit of going around the area and spreading his side and only his side of a story to whomever will listen. Usually this is neighbors but also my brothers inner circle. I am the super villain in his life and frankly I can care less when it was done to me. I don't care for the opinions of neighbors and even less about his shitty friends.

Until he started doing it to her and me as a way to break us up. Everything from she's a retard(she has autism) and even that I'm fucking my sister(she looks kinda like a female version of myself in all honesty). This didn't do the damage he wanted, as the only time we have argued in the last year, was because I am adverse to accepting things from her.

Then Juggalo happened. Now, this character is a guy that pulled a knife on sludge monster 7 years earlier and subsequently ended up going to jail for 3 due to an assault.(on someone else, not sludge monster or me). Juggalo starts hanging out with sludge and they start semi-dating and he is here about a week and a half at a time.

One day I get home from grocery shopping with GF. She goes onto the porch to get better reception to talk with her mom and I go in to take a Yamcha(poop). I get to the bathroom and there is a  turn the side of my arm in it. I walk back and say:

""Which one of you nasty fuckers didn't flush?""

Side tangent: Sludge has refused to cover half the repair costs for many things and things have kinda stacked up on repairs, one being the toilet needs to be flushed with a 5 gallon bucket.

Juggalo comes out brothers room and says ""I tried to flush it (a lie, the bucket was dry).

I reply ""Well you failed, try again"" and point in the direction of the bathroom. He stamps off mumbling under his breath and says something ""little bitch doesn't tell me what to do.""

I say ""excuse me, I didn't hear that.

""You heard what I said"" Juggalo replies. I get closer and ask him to repeat it. ""I don't take orders from little bitches, I will beat your ass"".

I point to the front door. ""Leave, now."" his reply, ""bitch, make me."" While holding up his fists.

A hilarious fight ensues where he continues to throw the worlds worst mortal kombat low punches I have ever seen. I grapple him, lame him to the ground near the stove. See, I don't play fair in a fight. Fairs are for tourists and I play to win, so i puck up the frying pan on the stove and proceed to beat him with it. Jugglo somehow managed to get up while I'm wailing on him and we wrestle to the living room. He manages to disarm the pan and I reply with a box ears/headbutt and we lock up.

GF and sludge come in and break it up. Another fight almost starts again when after hearing all the evidence, sludge takes Juggalos word(which is actually exactly how I put it here, just he thinks he's in the right somehow). I retreat upstairs, i pulled my foot again.

juggalo leaves and hasn't been back for 6 months now, but sludge keeps asking me to say I'm sorry to him for beating him with a pan. He's been doing this for months.

Me and GF figure out an exit plan. We were going to save money and get a place. probably a trailer or something small. However, sludge went nuclear.

He comes into our room about a week ago. Emotionally compromised and shows me the Juggalo doesn't want to be my BF anymore because of me. I told him to leave and come back when hes not emotional. He refuses and starts to blame me for all Juggalos shortcomings.

I point out that Juggalo is a manipulative, shortsighted, unstable powder keg that wanted to Mcstab you 7 years earlier. He continues to bark at me, slowly raising his voice. I tell him to lave again, he refuses.

I say ""we were going to transfer the rest of the house into your name, but if you are going to act like a giant baby I'm leaving it in my name. For your own protection.""

He pulls out a fork and yells ""you will give me teh house or I will fucking kill you! This is my HOUSE I PAY TEH BILLZ!"" (nevermind half+ of them have been payed for 12 months now by me and GF)

Sludge tackles me wile I'm in bed, I'm in no condition to fight him due to a pulled foot. At this point, I'm just trying to disarm him as he tries to bite and claw at me to get a clean stab.

GF has had enough, says ""I'm calling the police"" He breaks away and rushes up to her, fork in hand, raising it above his head. ""Call the police bitch, I dare you!""

I don't think I have ever moved so fast or been so angry in my life. I suplex my brother into the hardwood floor then knee drop into 2 of his ribs, breaking them. I begin to choke him out, not even noticing he got one good stab in and the fork is now sticking out of my shoulder. 

The police come and do nothing because Cleveland Police are as useful as tits on a fish/solar powered flashlight etc.

Talk with GF's mom, and she says hold out till she gets her VA loan for a house. GF wants out asap, but we have little savings to get anywhere nor the income to qualify for a lot of places.(I'm currently fighting for disability). The  question is this: Do I leave sludge the house and let him fall on his own sword for once or do the brotherly thing and keep it half/half in case he fucks up?",17Dec2019,1

They are moving in together and I feel like he deserves to know? I seriously dislike people that cheat on their significant others and knowing that she's just going on with her life like nothing happened really pisses me off.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind the options are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I go to the dinner and just be pleasant and leave it at that. I have no desire to be friends with her and her boyfriend.

2) I send the boyfriend an anonymous message somehow - most likely will be traced back to me, assuming a limited amount of people know.

3)  I tell my girlfriend I'm not comfortable going to this dinner because of obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I also think it's not my place, but damn - i would want to know if it were me.",17Dec2019,1

714,"My girlfriend is nineteen years old. At 19 she is already renting her own place, working 35+ hours per week, studying for secondary qualifications and has no support at all from her family.  I am also 19 but am working part time, with good ties to family; making my life seem perfect in comparison to hers. 

She has had a tough upbringing. Her parents were abusive, mentally and emotionally unstable, and violent. She also spent much of her adolescence and teen years moving homes; eventually living with her uncle, her Nan, and finally renting her own place. This means she has rarely felt 'at home' which adds to her stress when she feels like she has nowhere to find solitude at the end of a stressful day.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering the circumstances, she has done extremely well in becoming an independent woman and beating the odds that usually follow such a tough upbringing.

&amp;#x200B;

But as of late, she has been overworked to the max. She is constantly given work on top of work at her job as a technical administrator, and is completing tasks that absolutely do not fall underneath the umbrella of her position. The issue is that she works with an agency; and despite her genuine mental health problems (BPD) she cannot say no to the work she is offered, as she feels she will just be replaced. 

&amp;#x200B;

If she were to lose her job, she literally could not eat or pay rent, and has no family to fall back on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have only been with her for a couple months but i feel terrible knowing she is this overworked and i have no feasible answers to her problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both I  and her NEED advice on how to deal with the stress of being overworked. She is already on a waiting list for therapy so that isnt an immediate option.

715,"ok so me and my parents are still living together. my parents are no longer a couple but living under one roof out of financial necessity. 

one is rather abusive towards everyone in the family. extended family included \[more so mentally than physically. but recently they did attack my other parent. something that went unpunished so is likely to occur again and again and again\]

now there are plenty of ways i could make things better at a great financial cost to myself which would ultimately separate us even though we would still technically be living on same property in close proximity so the abusive one would still be a threat to the rest of us but a bit less of one.  but no matter what it requires the cooperation of both parents and since the end result is the rest of us not being essentially trapped at the abusive ones mercy. obviously the abusive one has refused every option. 

so now i have no other option than to seek a new homw. i have to try get me and my other parent a home and sell the current home making the other abusive parent homeless \[not something i want to do but its something they have essentially done to themselves as a result of their behavior over my entire life and their refusal to work with me to just make things a bit better\] 

the problem is forcing sale of the home takes a long time and incurs various legal costs etc and puts us facing backlash from the abusive one in the time being and even after. 

the home is not worth market value. its likely to fetch a gross of 170k max incurring fees of up to 20k by forcing sale \[legal fees and regular agent fees etc\]. leaving 75k per parent max.  i can get 60k from a bank at very maximum 70k \[thanks to government rules\]. this gets us to about 135 - 145k maximum. not including what we had to borrow in order to live somewhere else while we forced sale. . . \[rent is more expensive than mortgage repayments\] . . . . .house / apartment prices on the poorer areas average 250 - 350k in my county and the surrounding counties.  \[rip off ireland lol\]  so im a long long way off affording us a new place

i cant publicly ask for help as the innocent parent would find that as me shaming them. .. . .. and publicly identifying myself asking for help puts us at risk of the abusive one lashing out.

any ideas on how to improve things. or any ideas about how i could go about raising funds without us being identified. \[id hate to be trying to crowd fund etc as hell there are far more worthy causes and asking for money would me feel like a scrounger but ultimately the situation is no longer safe and will only continue to get worse for us so i have to be willing to try everything thats safe to try. . . but to my knowledge there is no real way to crowd fund without being identified\] 

personally id happily go homeless myself. i could live in my car until i saved up enough to get a shed on a piece of land or a mobile home 2 counties away from where i work. . . id be living in constant poverty but hell id have peace and safety. 

but i just cant disappear and leave my other parent alone with the abusive one. so ive tried to offer every solution i could \[i havent written them here. would take me all day\] so now im turning to redditors to try find some possible solutions. literally any advice is welcome. i know its not the easiest thing to offer advice upon but cant hurt to ask.

and id welcome peoples opinions on me possibly trying to crowd fund. would i be wrong to try doing it?",17Dec2019,1

720,"I'm 15 and the oldest of 6. My mom was raped (while she was married) and had me. Dad found out before she could abort me, and he said he would raise me as his own. When he said that, my mom decided against aborting me. They had me, and my whole life I have been closer to my dad. I have always felt like he loves me more than my mom. Mom picked on me growing up, she called me names and I never remember her telling me she loved me. My siblings kinda picked up on it over the years, and we have never been close as a result. My dad did his best, he would try to get us to bond. But the damage was done by her. About 6 months ago mom and I started arguing, she revealed to me that she never loved me and that she regretted not aborting me. It was then I found out I was conceived through the rape.

Dad heard her saying all this, and he moved out and took me with him. He filed for divorce a few weeks after that. He still sees the younger kids, but I've withdrawn from mom, my maternal family and my siblings. Dad is trying his best, but I wish she had aborted me. I wish I hadn't been conceived like that. People never guessed over the years, very few knew, but I do look like my dad. Everyone comments on it, I'm the most like him, and that makes me feel special. I know that the man who raped mom didn't take everything away from me. I do feel like he not only took things from her, but from me as well. He took the man I would kill to share my DNA with. And I really mean that, I would do anything to be his biological daughter.

Anyway, my school counsellor says that I should forgive my mom and try to build a relationship with her. Apparently, because of the way I was conceived, I shouldn't expect to be loved the same way, but she's my mother so I have to respect her. She works in the school (the counsellor) and they set me up with her. My dad wanted to pay for one, but I didn't want to go. This counsellor says I can't expect to be loved the same way. But my dad does! He's not biologically mine, and yet people always referred to me as the favorite.

721,"I want to keep this a bit brief, since there are a lot of details involved but if there’s anything I leave out feel free to ask and I’ll add it back in.

So a couple weeks ago I found out my sister hadn’t really been taking good care of herself, physically or mentally. She’s a former addict so I’ve been super worried about relapse. To add to this, finals week at my university had been approaching and I needed to focus on that.

About a week ago, my family and I found out that my sister hadn’t been eating, and had dropped almost 20lbs which is a lot for her. At around the same time, another friend of mine began having medical issues and needed somebody to drive her to the hospital, since she’s attending university across the country from where she lives. For a while, I took her to the hospital and anywhere she needed to go, but with my sister in the hospital I had to stop and focus on that.

Now, my sister is checked in to the hospital and feels like she can’t talk to me about what’s going on. Most of my friends refuse to talk to me or see me, and I’ve tried to explain my side to the ones that are willing to listen. 

As of right now, I just want my friends to stop ignoring me since I really need to have people close to me right now. Any advice?",17Dec2019,1
722,"I'm a single child, so i crave for attention more than anyone. My mom gives me the attention i need, always cares for, so she's cool. My dad on the other hand is a problem. He never spends time with me, not even 10 mins in any given day. He's always either busy or pissed off or tired or watching TV. He just comes up with all kinds of excuses to not spend time with me. It's like he exists but also doesn't exist. 

My dad tbh isn't that smart, doesn't have much savings, doesn't know any trivial stuff, it's like he doesn't wanna talk at all. If you ask him about any simple stuff, the only answer i get is ""I don't know"" and then asks me to leave him alone. It's clearly hurting me and mom, and he knows that. My dad drinks every now and then (he never buys alcohol, because his cousins keep sending him a bottle every month or so) and knowing that alcohol is bad for health, me and mom asked him to quit, but he won't. We are sick and tired of his behavior.

This leads to screaming and shouting at each other almost every month. Mom gets caught up in the middle of this and is clearly tired. I confronted him about not spending quality father-son time, and all i get is - ""You're gonna question me!?"" I'm at this point in life where i'm losing close friends left, right and center, so i don't even care anymore if he spends time with me or not, because i'm gonna cut him out of my life forever pretty soon. 

I told my parents that since i'm in my early 20's, i'm going to move away somewhere far and cut contacts forever. This clearly hurt mom (sorry mom).

724,"I am a grade 12 student from Canada, more specifically Ontario. Here in Ontario, there is a math class called ""Advanced functions"" this typically is the credit students get if they want to go into a university. Now that you are all caught up let's get to the good stuff!  


When I was in grade 11 I finished the course ""Functions"" with 50% (Thanks for the save teach). This course was the prerequisite for Advanced Functions, so  I decided to set myself up for success next year by repeating it over the summer even though I didn't have to. I finished the repeat course over the summer with 85%.  


We kick-off to next year grade 12. I am attending every single math class and doing the work. We grind it out for the first quiz, let's get a high grade to earn a lot of room to slide for the final exam! Nope. 75% is the grade received for the quiz that I spent all that time and effort working for. The first and easiest mark of the year and I peak at 75%. Now the marks the ensue after in this math class: 68%, 60%, 52%, 49%, 44%, 40%, 33%. Wow, now at this point we have a 49% average, still haven't missed a single class.  


 I drop the class so it doesn't show up on my transcript and enroll in an online interdisciplinary studies course to make up for it. Now I only have 2 classes at school and 1 online. My life doesn't have any routine anymore. I'm starting to slip, coming in late for class by 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes!  


**What should I do after high school?**  
I am going to get all the credits I need to graduate but I am a below-average student and I don't have the credits for University. There is always a cheat in the system though, I could just take the math class online and easily get an 84-90%. Would there even be a point though? I am not finding high school to be a 'breeze' and it won't get any easier. Also, as I mentioned before I am a below-average student in all courses. I have never had an 80 average with all my classes combined. So even if I did get in chances are I'd have to concede and that would be that.  


I have been trading the financial markets for 4 years now, so I've been able to gain some good incites into how to find success there. For that reason, my parents suggested I went into finance. I won't have the math that is required after graduating this year and just, in general, my marks in other classes are probably going to be too low. It is such a compelling problem I face because as the famous saying goes ""If it were easy everyone would be doing it"" most people are going to university and I just get my ass slapped in a simple high school course. Sure, I could go to a college (community college for those USA'ers) but I thought I could do more than count change as a bank teller.  


The last thing I have to say. It's too bad that I just generally suck in all courses because I even tried the tip that every teacher preaches ""Read books and you'll be better"". I still write at an 8th-grade level and someone who hasn't picked up a book in more than a decade can produce something greater than I ever could.

This past year I've spent more than $1000 for corrective repairs and expensive engine repairs like timing belt and such. The car doesn't run well, it knocks and has a rough idle. It also gets about 15 MPG for a V6.

Lastly, and my worry, is that the power steering routinely fails. I've turned into the wrong lane and oncoming traffic because there is no power or the power gives out. Most recently, this week I spun out but didn't hit anything and routinely lose traction and start skidding. Antilock brakes have kicked in so many times as our road conditions are slick and the car can't stop itself. Even the transmission is not upshifting and lurching.

My parents who legally own the car won't allow me to sell it. I point out these concerns because they are a safety risk and they don't take it seriously. In the instances where it did cause an accident, they wouldn't let me repair the car and kept the payout money.

I'm at wits end because even posting to whatcarshouldibuy I got responses about being spoiled and such. I'm ready to actually skid into a concrete barrier or brick wall to show them it is not safe. It's an endless expense to keep fixing the problems on it

731,"Hello guys. I don't really know how to explain this, so I'll just tell you my story.
I moved here in London in September 2017 to study. I'm currently in 3rd year university and I feel a bit lonely.
When I moved here I brought with me my now ex-girlfriend, she left a year and a half ago.

If I look at my life here right now I have 3 ""friends"" . 

First friend. I met this girl at the beginning of my university course, and became friend with her, then drifted apart a little bit and now we chat sometimes.. She has a boyfriend now and we are doing different courses so we don't see each other very often. I haven't seen her in 3 months at least. 


Second friend. My current roommate has been my friend for a very long time. When I moved to London to study he decided we e wanted a little adventure and came to live with me. He is the only true real friend I have here, which is a bit like cheating because I've known him for 10 years. He is going to leave in March.


Third friend. As soon as my roommate came to live here, I was still living with my ex girlfriend, so he found himself a place to stay and became friend with this girl. Hanging out all the time with him, I got to hang out with her too, and we became good friends. We are a bit different so, yeah we do talk and go out together but she is also a ""friend""

That's it.

I've been living here for almost 3 years and this city is hectic and it moves fast and there are always things to do, and I can't seem *meet* anyone.
I would like to, really much.
I feel really lonely, and sometimes I just get out of the house and walk around expecting some kind of miracle like someone would start talking to me in the streets. It doesn't make any sense, I know.

I tried the usual stuff, going out to pubs. But I don't know, since I'm there by myself I kind of feel miserable, and the few people I got to interact with, just kinda forgot about me after 15 minutes.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. When my roommate is gonna move out in March, I will be all alone. Totally.

I was hoping for some advice on what to do, maybe from some fellow former lonely people. How do I do it? How does it work? How do I cheat the system to meet people and actually get to know them?

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Right now, I'm writing this post while on the Tube, trying to get back home, because I was around wasting time trying to meet someone. I call it ""exploring"".i trick my mind into thinking that I'm doing this for myself, for the sake of exploring the city and the buildings, while in reality I cannot wait to stop doing this.

I don't know who else to talk to about this. And I'm literally out of ideas, I just don't want to keep feeling lonely.
I've always been an 'alone' person. I like time for myself, I know that. But before moving to london, even if I wanted time for myself there was always someone ready to hang out if I wanted to.

I had a little group of best friends, similar to Ted's group in how I met your mother. We were awesome, every Sunday together and doing stuff.
I just miss having people like them. They all drifted apart, they all live in different places on earth and that's it. I'm lonely and I can't seem to meet anyone, even by really really trying. I must be doing something wrong but I done know what.

And by the way, I'm an ok dude. I think I'm fun to be with I mean I don't suck as a friend. I just don't get it. 

TL;DR I moved to london and I'm feeling lonely because I can't seem to find anyone to be friend with. Trying all the usual stuff, doesn't work.",17Dec2019,1
732,"Title sort of terribly explains the situation.

I, unexpectedly, met a guy who plays in a local band from the area I'm from. We briefly chatted about innocent things and we realized we have a super strong connection with a lot of similarities. To say the least, I'm super into him. I've been very closed off from meeting people and guys because I just got out of a 3 year relationship Jan 2019 and then was terribly screwed over by a guy I considered a best friend for over 4 years. Something just felt right with this new guy and I'm trying to keep my walls up but they're slowly coming down.

Fast forward a date or two later... he tells me he has a daughter and the baby mama is still in the life, at least co-parenting. It was an accident, they didn't even have a chance to develop a strong relationship. At this point, it's going through the motions to see the daughter. They don't live together and he only gets to see the daughter every few days of the week. I have a fairly decent hunch they're still technically engaged (her parents kind of forced it when she got pregnant). We both know at some point, he's going to have to make a tough decision: split with her to be with me (happily and in love) or stay with her unhappily to be parents together for their daughter.

I'm trying not to be ignorant to the whole situation in front of me. He's been super honest and upfront with me about everything which makes me feel better in terms of trust. He's also very communicative. Like I said, most guys I would've ran the opposite way from in this situation but I can't with him. Not yet at least. I'm really open to opinions on this situation.

So I'm 25 and married my high school sweetheart in 2016. Things were great up until 9 months after our wedding. She began using drugs and our relationship took a hit. Things have been up and down and we tried rehab and all that. I stuck by her side up until she fatally overdosed earlier this year. It took me a while to get over as I lost my wife and best friend. 

I started dating again and I've been seeing this girl for a few months now. She's my age and also experienced the same thing as I did in my previous relationship. We connect on all levels and things feel good. 

She wants to move in but her mom has this old school mentality of ""not until after marriage"" 

I would prefer for my girlfriend to move in prior to marriage and even engagement. I just want to make sure that I don't go through the same thing as I did in my previous relationship. Her mom basically told her that if he can't wait, then dump him. 

How should I handle this/her mom? I want her to move in with me in 2020. I just have no intentions for marriage right now. I want us to grow a little more and see how things go. I'm in it for the long run, just need more time.

736,"Apologies if this is gibberish, I’m straight out of work on to the treadmill to write this.

To preface, I work in a small team in close proximity with my colleagues and manager and have to spend 40 hours a week in what is basically a small room with them.

I joined this workplace eighteen months ago and had a slight crush on the girl who worked there. As I got more used to her I realised I wasn’t interested in her and it wouldn’t be worth risking the job, I nipped it in the bud. Although she fits my tastes, she is a few years older than me but seems to lack a bit of emotional maturity.

fast forward to last weekend, staff night out, she comes on to me hard, saying she’s liked me for months and me, against my better judgment and intoxicated, started getting with her, took her home and had sex. To spare the details, it was great. I did say at the time that it was exclusively a one night thing, I think that may have been brushed over in the chaos that ensued.

i was overcome with guilt afterwards, probably more than I should have been. I know how desperate she has been looking for someone,  She is always saying how lonely she is. However, I do not want a friends with benefits type situation nor a relationship. I don’t want to be what she is looking for nor in anything serious with her. I care too much about my own time and career to have them put at risk right now. 

I was back at work today and everything was fine, great actually. No tension. However, upon finishing work I get a message from her saying she’s happy it’s not awkward, however she wants to continue doing what we done on a more regular occasion. I’m freaking out. Am I an asshole to say ‘sorry, it was a drunk thing’? Every single situation that plays out in my head, that despite her coming on to me, it can be portrayed as me just wanting to use her for sex.

741,"Hi everyone,

I  need advice on some problems that are intertwined.

First,  I have a (huge) fear of rejection, which means that I feel like I’m  going to be rejected easily, especially when I experience an emotional  connection in a friendship. ‘Undertaking’ a friendship is quite  stressing for me, since I have the tendency to 1) put myself below  others and 2) become dependent on them (contact) to feel well. Friendships can be very infrequent (fading away, long time no texts for good reasons often), which happens to make me feel like I’m in a  constant position to be abandoned. I call them triggers. They give me a  very bad feeling. After a long time, I’m starting to settle and feel  okay with it. 

Emotional  connection is something I have control of, which sounds strange, but  it’s true: I can easily cut myself off others emotionally and still  socialize. But I won’t experience it emotionally, which means it's a  trick I’m performing, an act. However, socializing is usually fine. Not  feeling emotionally connected to the person makes me feel more  independent, emotionally stable but also more lonely. In this period of  time, I’ve learned to attach to the contact in which everything happens,  and not a person. This helped me. Secondly, I experience loneliness. I  frequently see people and talk to them, but that doesn't start an  emotional connection in me nor I feel happier or more belonging. I know  how to talk, participate in events etc. But how many people I talk to,  it always becomes a contact without a deepened layer, without seeing  each other in real life apart from ‘compulsory activities’ such as  school, without a wish to do things together. However, those people do  that with their people. So I don’t see where it goes wrong.

Getting closer to people makes me unconsciously very expecting. To slow this  down, I have to take the positivity with a grain of salt.

These  two items have a huge impact on one part of my self-esteem, which is  the ‘social’ side. I’m quite confident in myself, but when it comes to  social interaction and relationships, I immediately become very sad.

Other people have told  me ‘it will be alright’, ‘i will get them’, ‘i haven't met the right  people’, ‘i have to initiate more’. Apart from initiating more, which  gives me a wrong idea how to solve this one side, I can do nothing with  these advices.

A small features,  but I’m a bit passive and I feel sometimes some anxiety in initiating.  I’m quite/very social and that’s how all people know me. But very lonely  and disconnected in the inside.

Now  and then, I get an emotional outburst and I feel like I’m totally being abandoned. This takes often a day, then I’m fine until the next time. Sometimes I even feel rejected  when I’m not literally being rejected. For instance, when I feel a lot  of people people having fun together and I don’t, I will conclude I  don’t belong and will feel rejected.

My questions:

Where to start solving this?

Why am I nearly always the one who’s not being involved in social activities and I have to let people know I want to?

742,"Recently, my uncle eloped. My family was super upset about it, talking about how he should’ve told us etc. Finally I said I didn’t blame him, since no one ever gave his now-wife a chance. Suddenly that turned things into dragging his new wife and how she’s a b**** etc. and talking about how much our family disapproved of the marriage. 

Finally I admitted I was worried they’d treat me and my boyfriend that way if we ever got married. They said they’d support me and they just wanted me to be happy but that they truthfully don’t like my boyfriend, who I’ve been with for 3 years. They said they “don’t really know him” and only see him as a guy who hurts me (about a year ago we had some issues).But the thing is, they don’t know him because they’ve never given him a chance. He’s older than me by 6 years, and that was always a problem for my family. 

I got pissed because my family has never given anyone a chance. My siblings SO’s, other cousins SOs, my moms SO’s. In my families eyes, they’re all “bitches” “weirdos” or “assholes.” So I think this is less about my boyfriend, and more about some issue with my family? Might be important to add that it’s mostly my cousins/aunt/uncle who dislike him this much. 

I’m just feeling really stuck. My family is such a huge part of my life, but I intend on marrying my boyfriend. I have a hard time bringing him around to family events because of how they make him feel.

How do I go about things? Do I just keep insisting on bringing him to events til they get over it,  distance myself from family?",17Dec2019,1

752,"My dad died when I was young and my mum ended up remarrying an old boyfriend who she previously broke up with for being a ‘control freak’. This old boyfriend moved into the house my dad bought for me, my sister and my mum. 

They’ve been together for 12 years now and I’m 19, working a semi-decent job earning around £600-£700 monthly. I pay my mum £200 every month in keep and some other outcomes like driving lessons etc.

In recent years, some of the things my stepdad has been doing is starting to really get to me to the point where I feel like it would be just be easier to just to walk out and live on the streets.

It started off with getting a job. At the beginning after finishing college, it took a while to find a job. During this time he would demand to see my search history and even when I asked him why, he proceeded to say that until I start ‘acting’ my age, he had every right to. 

When I finally did get a job, he still found ways to pick on me. The hours I currently work are around 20-30 on a good week. When he used to take me to work, he would demand that I asked for more hours and if I didn’t then there was something mentally wrong with me and that one day he might leave without me and make me late for work. 

Since I only work part-time he makes me do all these chores around the house, which I understand and will do. Because I can’t drive yet, I have to get up around four  to get to work by cycling. He’ll purposely put the dishwasher on late in the evening and then force me to do it despite the fact that I have work the next day. He did this last night and I didn’t do it (having gotten up early that day as well and was whacked), and so today he told me that if I didn’t do it again, then he’ll burst into my room and wake me up by pulling the duvet off my bed. 

If I argue with this, he just says that he’s always right and I’m wrong. 

Recently, a hobby I like doing is playing video games and talking to some online friends. He didn’t like this, so he’s banned me from playing games and talking to my friends. Said if I kept on doing it, I’ll end up in an asylum and with no friends or family to care for me. He even brought up my aunt and uncle’s (from my real dad’s side) names, saying that ‘they’ll see the real me’ and ‘you may have them fooled’. 

Something else he likes doing is comparing me to his sons, something he would also do a lot when we were kids too. I struggled at maths when I was younger, so he would do these ‘competitions’ between me and my younger stepbrother with times tables and when my stepbrother bested me, my stepdad would mock me with them.

And so so so much more...

I’m really struggling with this. A place where I had so many fond memories of my dad in and have lived in since I was born, has turned into something I dread coming home too. Some advice would be really great right about now.

Thank-you.",17Dec2019,1
753,"Now I’m sure many of you will look at that title and say, “you don’t even have to say anything, it’s obviously the latter choice.” But hear me out...

There are many times throughout the day where I will be completing menial tasks that will be interrupted by a thought popping into my head. Let’s say I’m putting together an outfit in the morning. I’ll be about to choose a shirt, when suddenly, a thought will come into my head that says “No. If you choose that shirt, your best friend will hear something about you that will make her not associate with you anymore. Choose a different one.” So I’ll go through the closet, find another one, and then I’ll get a thought that says “No. If you choose that one, you will make a dumb decision today that will negatively affect your life for years. Choose another one.” So I’ll go through all my shirts again, find one, and then I’ll get a thought that says “No. It’s Monday so you can’t wear that shirt, or you will be cursed. Choose a different one.”

Every task in my day takes like 5-10 minutes longer than it needs to because of these thoughts. For the past six years, I’ve marked it down to “God is testing my loyalty right now. If I want to continue living as great of a life as I do, it’s only fair that I do this for him”. But I’m starting to think that maybe my mental health has been compromised, and that it’s not actually God talking to me? I’ve always been too scared of the consequences not to do what the thoughts tell me, so I’ve never tried seeing what happens if I don’t follow those orders. Another thing is that the thoughts are always consistent. Like certain actions I try to take will always lead to the same thoughts coming up. 

The reason I bring this up today is that for years I have had an idea to make really quick money really fast, and I’ve been held back by the thought that comes up every time I go to get started on it. “No. If you go through with it, your face will break out into extreme acne.” Last night, however, the voice was abnormally quiet and I went through with the beginning stages of it. However, I woke up this morning to, guess what, a skin breakout the likes I had never seen before. Is this just a coincidence? Can God intervene in my life like this? Should I keep listening to it or am I insane? 

The thoughts have never told me to harm anybody else or myself by the way.",17Dec2019,1

756,"Long story short, I missed an important exam after bringing my dad to the ER for what he thought was a heart attack. Fortunately, it was nothing and we were sent home. By the time I got to school the exam was already over so I asked for a special exam. However, a valid excuse was necessary and I ended up stretching the truth and saying that my dad had a heart condition. My dad signed a letter stating that I had to attend to this health emergency but now my professor is requiring a med cert. Unfortunately, when I went to the ER where my dad was checked, they claimed they don't issue backdated certificates and moreso those for people who weren't found sick at all.

757,"I’m wrestling with myself over this. In May I almost lost my eye. This was a horribly traumatic accident that made me really depressed, but I did the work and spent the whole summer getting better so I could return to school and graduate on time. 

In September, I got into a really bad car accident. Like my car caught fire, the engine was on the floor, and I had to climb out of the car through the trunk. Glass went through both my shoulders. They had to dig around in there to find the glass. My eyelid also got shredded by glass and I actually had to get my eye lid reconstructed (same eye as the last accident). It took 30 stitches (some of which were inside) and I was at a huge risk of infection. My cheek also had a lot of glass in it which doctors had to go digging for. I have a good bit of facial scarring. On top of all this I had whiplash and my knee was broken. I had to be on crutches for a month and then walked with a cane for another month. 

So my professor refused to give me the work I missed while in the hospital (only a week). She also refused to make accommodations for me getting to class even though the disability office on campus told her to. When I tried speaking to her about how it was hard for me to get to class on the crutches and asked her to make allowances for me to get their late (only by a few minutes) and to make notes using a recorder provided by the disability office she said I should just drop out. I was really struggling and started crying when she said that. (I have 4 classes left to graduate so dropping out was not an option). She told me that she wouldn’t make accommodations for me because everyone is struggling and she herself was disabled too. I spent the next 3 months struggling to get the accommodations I needed. I had to constantly go between the Deans office, Disability office, the directors of both her and my departments. You know all while still working part time, going to school full time, and making it to all my doctors appointments. 

I finally made it to the end of the class and I got a B- but now I’m wondering if I should tell my story with this prof on the course evaluation which becomes public to everyone in a month. I’m also not the only student who has had issues with her.",17Dec2019,1

761,"He's my best friend, however he moved out east so I've rarely seen him for 14 years.  I've known him for 30 years though, and when he lived in Seattle we gamed every week and were best friends.  We were also computer geeks and had network parties all the time.  Mostly for gaming, however we'd share music and porn...remember, this was back in the 90's when the internet was in its infancy.  Not child porn, and I never saw any indication from him that that was what he liked. 

He was arrested 6 months ago, was in the news.  I didn't find out until today when I was wondering why I hadn't heard from him.  I looked at his Facebook info and he hadn't posted since May.  I looked at his wifes FB and she had changed her last name, which looked at the time like maybe they divorced.  I messaged her and she told me what happened, and that they had divorced.  Their daughter is in therapy, and as of now I don't know if she plans on moving back here.  She says he changed and acted strange during the last few years.

I have several things I'm unsure on as far as what to do.  This is a friend who would drop doing things to help out and vice versa.  Last time I saw him, we went to the last Rush show that happened in his city.  Part of me wants to know his side, since I'd never seen anything like what he's accused of in his personality.  Do I find a way to contact him?  It's hard for me to picture him as he's being portrayed.  

I've already sent a message to the wifes best friend, as they were in more contact with each other than my friend &amp; I recently.  Then again, you move across the country and friendships fade.

Which brings up my second question.  I knew the wife and her best friend pretty well, as they participated in gaming as well.  I've already offered my support, though that's limited at a distance and in my current health (I had a stroke in February).  Because this was in the local news, I worry about how people in school will treat his daughter.  I'm wondering how much I need to push her moving back to her family out here, especially if the's getting confronted or bullied about her dad.  I don't want to open old wounds, however I also want to make sure they both do what's best for the daughter.

Lastly, and this is more of a legal question for myself.  I've amassed quite a lot of porn over the years.  Because a lot of this was from really early in the internet, it's possible that some images skirt the 18 year legal limit.  Many sites were clear that they met those requirements, however some was shared images from network parties.  In my friends case, it looks like there was distribution going on through a video sharing application...and that's definitely bad if he was knowingly sharing child porn.  My issue is more with someone like me that looks at porn, doesn't actively seek child porn, however unknowingly to me I might have a picture of a 17 year old that could get me in trouble.  I could delete the images, which I haven't even looked at for years.  These days I use Pornhub, and feel relatively safe that I'm not looking at child porn.  Should I delete my collection of porn on the off chance there are some images that don't meet the age restrictions unknowingly to me?",17Dec2019,1
762,"For reference: I’m 17 and he’s 22. We work together and are friends(?).

 Before this event he had never outright expressed interest in me. So anyways a few weeks ago we had a party at our work and I wore a skirt for practically the first time ever. I mostly sat next to him the entire night and when my skirt would gather at my thigh when I bounced my leg, he would pull it back up. I would intentionally pull it up to my thigh a few times just for a laugh because he kept getting really weird. 

After the party he knew I was hooking up with someone and told me to be careful. He told me I was going to catch feelings for the guy even though he didn’t know who it was because he “knows how feelings work.” So later on when I was done doing the do, he texted me saying something along the lines of “I don’t want to sound creepy. But I want to say something to you.” I told him to say it and so he said “just fucking turn 18 already.” To which he immediately started apologizing and said he was creepy. I told him no it wasn’t creepy he was fine. He told me he was drinking and that’s probably why he said that and I asked him how drunk he was. He admitted he wasn’t drunk at all and had only 2 whiteclaws. I told him he should bring me one. He said “worth the walk. Be there by 2am” and he was. He gave me the whiteclaw and kissed me. I, of course, kissed him back. We ended up making out a little and I went inside. He wants to be fwb when I turn 18 but doesn’t want “anything serious” when I asked him how not serious, (meaning seeing other people or exclusive without no relationship but I didn’t say that exactly) he got weird and asked me why I wanted to know and asked if I was okay with no relationship. Keep in mind, I’ve slept with one guy in my whole life and only kissed 3. I don’t have a great body and I’m not super attractive. 

Why does he want to fwb if he knows one or both parties always catch feelings? Why did he get weird about me seeing my guy friend??

For the most part we are compatible, and there is definitely some kind of chemistry between us. However, I think lately they have been branching out to see who else is out there in the world. They have been extremely distant from me. Our communication isn’t really the same anymore. Since they wake up before me for work, they usually send me a good morning text that makes my whole day. Lately though, we haven’t talked unless I am the one who initiates it. When asked to hang out, when we both have free time, I get left with a “yeah, but I don’t know when. I’m so busy.” This time of year both of our jobs seem to be quite demanding so I don’t really fault them for this answer. They recently confided in me that they have been struggling the past few days and I took that to heart. So this morning I sent them an uplifting text, but it wasn’t really acknowledged in the way I wanted them to see it. All they told me was that they were fine, just busy, and then left me on read when I said I was glad they were alright. Given that something like this has happened to me before, my gut says that they are possibly done with me. I know they are struggling with situational stuff, so I don’t want to jump to a hefty conclusion now. But the change I’ve seen in the way we communicate has left me to wonder all of this. I have taken the being left on read as a sign to not respond and to give them space, or possibly let them move along with their life without me. 

Tldr— I have been talking to someone who has shown obvious signs of pulling away and not wanting much to do with me (not responding to messages, not talking unless I initiate it, avoiding seeing me, etc.)",17Dec2019,1
776,"Basically, I asked a guy out a few months back. Our conversation went something like this-

Me: ""Hey, I was just wondering if you'd like to go see a movie sometime? If you'd rather get coffee or something that's totally cool too."" 

Him: ""Heyy, that sounds really fun but I leave for Florida in a few days. I'll be down there for about a week."" 

Me: ""Hmm, maybe let me know when you get back then?"" 

Him: ""I'll definitely let you know.""

Me: ""Sounds great! Have fun."" 

Aaaand, cue the silence. He went to Florida, had a great time, came back... and nothing. That convo was in July; it's now December and I've barely heard a peep from him since. 

Is there a possibility that he forgot? I feel like I couldn't forget a date with somebody I was truly interested in. Does it sound like he is simply uninterested? Maybe he was just trying to be nice when he agreed.

I've thought about messaging him about it, but if he is uninterested I wouldn't want to bother him any more. However, this has been haunting me for months. I really like him and want things to work somehow, but I don't know. Any advice or ideas would be very much appreciated.",17Dec2019,1

We are both 21 years old. She lives in a different state so we never met irl.

She is in a relationship with ""one"" of my friends but she is planning on leaving him because of how toxic he is, and i'm probably going to stop talking to him as well.

Here are the signs that i think she might like me:

- Started venting to me about her bf a couple months ago.

- about a week ago when we were all playing video games, she asked me if i liked makeup(she loves it)
- Has been messaging me A LOT more since she said she was planning on leaving her bf asking how my day was, sending memes, or things like that.

- Asked if i would ever want to travel(I'm assuming to meet her)

- Now here is the big one imo.

-  have always called her by her username that she uses in the games we play. - Last night when we were playing, she said my name in a shy sounding high pitched tone of voice that she always used with her bf before they started having problems, and asked me if there was a reason why i called her that name. 

I have always called her this since i met her and she never said anything until now. I also asked her a few months ago if she would prefer if i call her by her actual name, but she said it was fine.

779,"So this is on mobile on a throwaway account. Anyway, I recently had a baby girl (2nd girl in multiple generations on Dad’s side) and she is his 4th. All his other kids are boys and much older. My questions have to do with the oldest and their mother.

DH and their mother got divorced a few years ago. I have, in my personal experience, had few encounters with this woman and 99% have been bad. For instance, she attempted to break into my apt, caused a huge scene in front of my neighbors (after divorce), terrorized me while I was pregnant, and most recently, badmouthed me to my bf all because I met with her to discuss how I can help her kids adjust to me and their sister (Granted, I’ve been around for a few years by now). She was super nice to my face and immediately behind my back, she started giving him shit about my jewelry, my appearance, the things we talked about, how I dressed, everything you can think of. To this day, I’ve been nothing but courteous to her because she’s nothing but drama but I’ve had enough. 
Now, the oldest son has not accepted the divorce and has not accepted me or his baby sister. He is his mommy’s boy and always has been. She never enforced any rules and constantly undermined DH when he would try to teach him something and still does to this day. She has groomed all of the boys to disregard their father from the day they were born, that he is nothing but a money tree and had screamed this throughout the household on multiple occasions. This son wants nothing to do with his father unless he needs money. He will not visit, his dad must go to him or he won’t bother. 
I am certain the only reason this son might visit on Christmas is to pick to his gift and then go right back to his mother. 

My question is what do I do now? DH feels like his sons hate him because he divorced their mother who was not good to him in any way (and I see it in their every interaction). His oldest and youngest choose their mother over him even though they must know that they weren’t good for each other and the mother does nothing to foster a relationship for the kids with their dad.. she seems to encourage distance rather than helping them through. 

How can I do better to help everybody and how do I manage this woman? I’m so sick of being the adult and having to keep my mouth shut as she belittles her kids dad let alone myself. Which, she’s allowed to hate me which is fine and I know she’s said nasty things about me to the youngest... I’ve heard some of them and he’s told me himself. But don’t talk about the divorce to the kids. That in my opinion is completely wrong",17Dec2019,1

791,"Hi so I have a quick question for everyone. 

I have been with my bf for over a year now and me and him have always had an amazing and loving relationship. We both love each other dearly and both believe we are each other's soul mates. We are in a long distance relationship, but have always been very good at communicating and keeping in touch because of how much we want to be together. I've never had anyone be so in love with me, and same with me as well. You can tell by the way we look each other in the eyes, and how right it feels that we are destined for each other. 

My bf knows everything about me except for my past with two sugar daddies I had 4 years ago before I met him. (I've never lied to him about it, it's just I simply never told him about it. If he were to have asked me for some odd reason if I had ever been, I would have told him the truth.) But I honestly have never told him just because it's hard to speak about and I was scared of what he'd say.

The reason I was with these older men was NOT for any Louis Vuitton bags, shoes, or any other materialistic things. I strictly did it because I got fired from my job at the time and was reached out to by these men. I of course needed the money and it was extremely hard to find a job at the time as well. I had a huge car payment, rent, and needed to put food on my table somehow. 

Of course, being in my teen years I was vulnerable and didn't exactly know what I was doing. But at the same time I did. The only thing I kept thinking about was how I had bills and I needed money. So I did it. This period of having only two sugar daddies lasted only two months, but it was the longest two months of my life. When I was doing it, I felt so disgusted with myself that I eventually told myself after a couple months that I honestly didn't care anymore if I lost my car, that this wasn't worth the price of what I was doing. So I stopped doing it.

I've never told any man I've been with ever about this, but now that I'm finally with someone that I love and want a future with so much, I can't help but wonder if keeping this from him is the right thing. I want to be honest and be and open book to him, but I'm honestly so scared that this will hurt him or that he will judge me and leave if I told him. 

My question is: Should I absolutely tell him this about my past ? Or would it be better left unsaid? My only fear is that it would come out somehow one day from someone else and that he would lose his trust with me. What do you think I should do ? Am I overthinking this ? 

Please give honest but also KIND answers. Thank you.",17Dec2019,1

796,"So, I am coming into a small amount of money. I am stressing out as to what would be best in the long run. I am still a student, so I don't make all too much at the moment. I have a bit of debt and I have health issues.  


Here are the things I WANT to do, but have to decide which is the best to pick as there is no way to do all of them.  


The ONE thing regardless of anything else.. I will pay off the rest of my car.  


**Get a new car** (Trading in the one I have) But do I just put a down payment or do I buy one outright? This also goes with paying off debt. I NEED to do the car as this is not a reliable vehicle and the warranty has run out. In the future it will only cost me way more money to get fixed.  
**Get my teeth fixed**. Implants. (Unfortunately due to health issues my teeth are not strong and will eventually get worse than they already are) I feel this would give me back my self confidence and well, help with the obvious issue of my teeth.  
**Buy a house**. (It would be a fixer upper, which is fine. I have family willing to help. It will also be only me, so after fixed up I could rent a room out for extra income down the line.) I already have a house in mind and a location! Here in lies the problem. I would be moving across the state and further away from my parents. But I will be very close to cousins and friends, which I am not very close to here in my current location. It will def cost to fix some of it up, but I don't have to move right away or rush fixing it up. I would also already have a job in the area and could be a good area to get a job in my field in the future.  
Note: Yes, a house can cost a lot to fix up but this only needs minor fixes and most if not all would be paid for.  
**Pay off debt**.  (I wouldn't be able to pay off everything, but any credit cards I have I would like to pay in full.)  
Debt that I have\~ Car, Credit cards, School, Medical (Car is a must so at the very least this will be paid off)

801,"Hi, I'm 21 years old, and uh... This is a bit of a long story, I think.

Well, I've never been able to make a meaningful relationship for some reason,don't get me wrong, I do have friends, both male and female, but it has always been sort of a casual relationship, now that I think about it I've never have had much of a best friend to hang out constantly, I barely ever get to go out with friends because it takes forever to get something done (or convincing them to go out, as I've started to feel lately). 

On the other side I also have trouble to get a girlfriend, I have girl friends who I talk to you when it come to someone I feel attracted to I sabotage myself and I shot myself down before even giving her a chance to do so herself. And this has always been present but for the last 6 years it really got a whole lot worse. This is because I have atopic dermatitis, or eczema, which is not deathly, or fatal, not contagious but it does mess up my skin to a point where I look and feel like crap all the time and it really destroyed my whole self-esteem, back then it was awful, just awful and now I can control it, kinda, at least I can look at the mirror without wishing I could kill myself. So thanks to this I have a damaged skin and tend to overheat very easily, and my skin gets all flared up for nothing. This really made me not to bother with having a girlfriend or friends through my entire highschool and sometimes on college (I'm on my 3rd year). I should note that before the eczema I considered myself a bit attractive, not a lot but my face was ok before I got my skin all damaged, and I have a lean body, not athletic but I do work out.

The problem is that I am a bit in need of human contact, and I have noone to be with.  Its no use to get out with friends because I'm the only one trying to meet, if I'm lucky I get some responses saying it would be cool to hang out but when I propose something I get no response. I get that they maybe busy but at least say something, to be honest I'm tired of trying. And I haven't been in a relationship with someone else, so add that to my insecurities when thinking of going to flirt with someone, I just feel like I've got nothing to offer and I won't know how to do anything...

So, after all this, I've been thinking of going with an escort, frankly I'm not sure if I would go meet her to sleep with her or just make out with her to get some sort of practice, or just to hang out with her and talk or something. I have been dueling on this for quite a while and I have even contacted some of them to see if I adventure myself to do it. I actually was going to meet up with one of them today but I guess I got cold feet, I had been getting the money and preparing myself but today in the morning I just started making excuses. For six months I've been battling with myself on whether I do it or not, I don't really feel like losing my virginity or anything with an escort but I just feel like I got this feeling that won't leave, and sure, an escort won't fix anything but I can't shake off my head this idea   now that I have it in my head

I really feel kinda lost I want to see her but at the same time I know it's a mistake, but I really could do with someone around...

802,"I have a multitude of theories about my mental illness and the causes. This is just one of them -- loneliness.

I had a rough experience with a catfish, when I was 16. I suddenly noticed selfishness in people and myself, and a certain feeling towards others disappeared in me. It was a very pleasant feeling.

As it disappeared, I noticed a sort of heaviness in me. Later, I became progressively more tired with every month, then week, then day. Then, in a single day, I became extremely depressed and anxious. This lasted for 3 years.

After the first 3 years ended, I started having more symptoms. The major symptom was shoulder pains, that were associated with my heart rate. I was put on sertindole 1mg, and the shoulder pains vanished.

And now, after 8 years in total, I've had many episodes where things get better (rarely, and rarely worse). There aren't really any themes in the episodes. Sometimes it's a nostalgic video game, sometimes it's random, and sometimes they're changes in my environment (like going to the psych unit or a new psychologist, **on my own**). I feel like one of the themes COULD BE that I become reliant on people I don't know too well, and those people start mattering to me, and I feel in touch with them. Could this be it?

There's another major theory, about posture. But I'll probably discuss it later, or somewhere else, or with someone qualified, if I'm lucky to find someone who knows about physio and mental illness. lol

I just want to know:

* How does loneliness feel? Even if people are around you?
* How can I feel that people matter to me? Even when I'm so used to them, even when they're so accepting. It just feels like people like my parents have no authority over me, and they don't try.
* How can I feel more in touch with others?

P.S. Doctors haven't helped me much. I was at my GP today, and she said she didn't have answers. My psychiatrist is probably equally stumped, but I'll talk to her tomorrow \~11:00 AM, and we'll see what she has to say.",17Dec2019,1

To make sure everyone that joined the club was serious and good we had some GPA requirements. No one cared.

It started the buzz when a quant hedge fund funded us too and offered me and some of the other members internships. People in our major found out about it, and we had a lot of people apply.

Long story short most people got rejected. Now the University is coming down on me to ease up our requirements or get rid of them entirely. And said that our club should encourage the love of mathematics not for those that are already good.

My colleague and I somehow hit it off in our orientation. But things  started to go south when both of us got allocated to separate yet  equally horrible branches. Initially we both convinced ourselves to stay  strong, and not to resign.

But I could not take the 5-6 hour commute (My parents are sick I  usually have to come back, even though I rented a flat there), 10 hour  work day, and the shitty culture anymore. After one month I literally  stopped coming to office.

Now, here is the catch I signed a contract that more or less states  that I can't quit within a certain period without paying a very hefty  fine.

Fearing that I have to pay a fine, I did not submit a resignation  letter and I kept telling them I need a 6 month long leave because of  family problem. So, they start to call me more or less everyday and  threaten legal actions. I keep on deflecting and hope they let me go.  Eventually they offer me to relocate to a much better location. But I  have seen their culture and no matter how much they are paying they are  not worth it for me. I would rather do 3 dollar per hour remote jobs  than doing that crap.

One the other hand my colleague keeps asking me how is life, how is  job, and asks random things about the job. I am feeling very frustrated  with me being hypocritical about this situation.

But I am afraid if I tell him that I had quit and I had breached my  contract without serious repercussion (I hope and pray so) I think he  will quit the very next day. And in that case employers may seriously  pursue legal actions because not only did I quit, I influenced another  employee who they have been sucking dry. I could not even tell my  colleague that if negotiates hard he might be able to relocate to better  branch.",17Dec2019,1
811,"I graduated from a top tier law school a few years back. When all my classmates went into corporate law, I decided to focus on human rights work instead. I'm currently a few months into my first job since getting called. We do amazing human rights work and the office environment is great, but my pay is low $50k a year, which would be fine if I wasn't struggling to pay back $150k in student loans. 

I've figured out a budget that I can stick to that puts me on track to pay off my loans within 6 years if my salary and expenses don't increase. But I'm also 29 and will likely want to get my own place and family soon. 

I know I don't have to have it all figured out now but I keep struggling with fear over if I made a mistake not going into corporate law, if I want to continue in this area and if not what my options are, and I keep obsessing over how my salary is half that of my peers -because lawyers love to talk about money so I know how much everyone makes. 

I know it's important to consider and plan for your future but I actually find it hard to focus at work because I'm so distracted by these thoughts and feelings of anxiety and depression are starting to peak through. I have been seeing a therapist. They told me to try and tell myself to wait a year at my job before I think of these big questions but I'm finding that hard to do.

TL;DR how do I stop worrying about my future and if I made a dumb decision and my salary",17Dec2019,1
812,"So my roommate has been messaging a guy online. She just found out thats he is married with a kid on the way. Shes not into him, shes into someone on his friends list. 
He ( the married one) is trying to get her to fly down to see him and keeps implying intercourse. 
My roommate doesn't want to be the other woman, nor does she want to tell the wife because 1) she has a private account and would have to tell her indirectly. 2) She doent know her personality and her friends keep telling her its not her place to tell her.
I keep telling her to block him and ignore him. She doesn't because the guilt of the cheating husband and the hope of getting with the friend is too strong.
He also keeps messaging things that send up red flags: "" I feel like I can tell you everything""

813,"Wasn’t really sure where to post but here goes.

So, about 7 years ago I was in a close friendship group with another guy (I’m also a guy) and three girls. Purely platonic, I have a girlfriend and at the time only one of the female friends wasn’t in a relationship. 

About 2 years ago the guy friend gets with a new girl. We’re all happy for him as he’s had it rough and deserves happiness. I slowly began to notice however that she was causing issues between the females of the group. Very subtly by starting arguments and minor disagreements. Fast forward to now, and our friendship group is no more. Guy friend fell out with two of the girls as his girlfriend had a disagreement with them so he then decided to cut them out too. He is still sociable with the third girl, who is married and recently had a baby but he hasn’t met up with her in over a year. She has told me that she has tried numerous times to meet up with him but he always has some excuse. I can only assume it is due to his girlfriend that he is no longer allowed to meet her. 
I’m 99.9% sure their friendship is pretty much over due to this. Pretty sad.

He still meets up with me; however there is a catch. His girlfriend is always there. Always. We haven’t done anything together in over a year now without her being there. I invited him to a Christmas party just for my male friends and she showed up too. I invited him to a movie last night, she showed up too. I get the impression he isn’t allowed out alone without her hanging off of his arm.

Is it worth addressing this or should I just leave it as it is? I don’t think anyone will talk sense into him at this stage unfortunately",17Dec2019,1

Ive gotten into two colleges already that are pretty high up on my list, and am in a really good place with friends and family,  but I’m nottttt doing too well in school and I’m scared that weed has caused my motivation to PLUMEt. I LOOOVE smoking, and I definitely think its helped me more than its harmed me. Weed has helped especsilly with my anxiety and ADHD and I’ve just become a way calmer persone. It just scares me, because I know college is going to be hard, and then I’m eventually going to have to get a job, But im worried that weed Is making It hard to stay focused and motivated, and I want To be successful in the future. I have a lot of things I want to hopefully accomplish in the future, and don’t want weed to stop me from pursuing those goals. I know there are TOOONNS of people who smoke, and also happen to be extremely successful, but I dont want that to be my only justification for smoking so much.

817,"Background: I'm a sophomore in HS. I'm not the best looking kid in the grade but I'd say I'm like a 7/10 for looks. Still a virgin. Hooked up with a few girls. Got head one time. Never been in a serious relationship. Into partying, smoking weed etc...

This one girl I've been friends with since the 8th grade seems like she likes me but I can't quite tell. She's nice to me and all of my friends and she throws parties at her house a lot. I'd say she's an 8/10 for looks pretty hot. We have AP world history class together and we talk to each other in that class sometimes. She and her friend look in my direction a few times a class and talk a little bit after each time they look at me. (a little more background: me and her friend that's also in our class hooked up a while ago.) She snaps me pretty often, we have a streak and she talks to me outside of class but we never really hang out outside of school aside from parties and other get togethers. Blah blah blah we're friends.

What really makes me think she might want to fuck is that a while ago she was asking for help with history homework. It was a really bull shit assignment. At one point she texted me ""please I'll do anything for the answers"". I was so close to saying ""head for answers?"" but I thought it would be really scummy and awkward as fuck if she didn't like me like that and would ruin everything and just make me look like a total creep. I just sent her my work instead and she thanked me the next day. We still talk and she still snaps me. She's throwing a new years party soon so this could be the perfect opportunity to fuck, but I'm still not 100% sure what she thinks.

What do you guys think. Should I go for it and make some moves or should I just wait a little longer to see if she actually likes me.",17Dec2019,1

819,"Since I was a kid, I was on the heavier side. I weighed 135 lbs by third grade. By my junior year, I was 260. I could give you the sob story about how my family used eating as a coping tool, but bottom line is I had no self control. 

I’m about 5’3, and 125 lbs now. I can’t remember the last time I was this small. 

Initially I was excited about the weight loss, it seemed to be happening for no reason. I was working a lot and not eating much, so we all thought it must just be stress. I shed more and more weight over time to the point that I lost half my body weight.  (This started in Dec of 2017)


Well now I can’t stop it. I don’t feel hungry in the morning or at night, I usually eat once a day, but I don’t physically feel the need for more food. 

However, it’s taking an emotional and mental toll on me. I used to love my boobs, even when I was “fat” I thought they were the one thing that gave me confidence, and now that I’ve lost so much weight they have NO volume anymore. The skin is sagging off my chest, you can see my muscle, I have stretch marks and they wrinkle SO bad when I lay down. I cry every time I look in the mirror. I honestly would rather still be 260 lbs. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford a boob job, but exercise will only help so much. I don’t want to hate myself at 20, but it’s hard not to compare myself to all the girls my age with flawless, smooth skin and perky, round boobs. I look at myself and I hate what I see, it’s literally disgusting. 


How can I make a change? I don’t want to feel like this anymore.",17Dec2019,1
820,"My(18m) 12 year old sister has always had an anger management problem but in the last year it has begun to spiral out of control to the point where I’m genuinely concerned for her well being. She is very easily aggravated by anyone disagreeing with her, and she won’t take no for an answer on anything. The other day I was going to go biking with my friends and she wanted to come along and I said she couldn’t come (anytime I go out she wants to go with me and I take her fairly often but I can’t just take her everywhere that I go because some times I just want to be with my friends), she started to text me that she was going to mill herself because of how I treat her and that I should feel guilty for making her feel that way among a lot of other extremely toxic stuff. A couple days after that she couldn’t find an outfit for a Christmas party while in target and began to make a scene yelling at my mom that she needed to take her to another target, and hitting and kicking the walls and floor of the car while they were driving away. My mom told her that she would take her the next day and she kept exclaiming that my mom was lying and that she wouldn’t.  She never apologizes for any of this and always believes she’s in the right, even if you ask her for an apology after the fact she’ll just get angry again and tell you that it’s your fault. We come from a pretty healthy family, our parents are together and have always been good to us and each other. There is however a pattern of anger issues on my dad’s side of the family, and my dad has gotten angrier and more easily irritable in the last couple of years but it isn’t anything that would warrant my sister’s behavior. Apart from this she’s very athletic and intelligent and she can be really sweet and affectionate at times. She has a very hard exterior but she’s very sensitive. I don’t think anything is going badly at school because she usually tells me anything bad that happens there, and I know she can stand up for herself (perhaps a bit too much at times. I genuinely care about my sister and try to spend as much time with her as I can, and I think we’re extremely closer than most siblings, especially considering our age cap.

822,"Sorry in advanced for the lengthy text.

So I have an odd living situation. I live with my older brother (23) and my younger sister (20).

I am currently not working a lot so I am home more than my siblings. I have really bad anxiety so its hard to find a job with my qualifications.

We don't really live in a ""nice"" house but I like to keep it clean so it's not as embarrassing when people come over. I clean up after myself (as in wash my own dishes, don't leave my personal belongings all over the house), cook dinner for everyone at least twice a week (more if I have the time), do **Everyone's** laundry, take trash off to the landfill, and vacuum the **entire** house, all without being asked to.

All I ask of them is that they wash their dishes and don't trash the shared spaces of the house. But **everyday** I have to pick up their dirty wet laundry from the bathroom floor, and socks and shoes from the living room as well as their dirty dishes, some with food still on them. 

Am a a jerk for asking them to clean up after themselves? Cause that's how they treat me when I ask.

I know I'm not working as much as them so I'm home more, so I'm able to do a lot more cleaning. And I don't mind doing things like dinner, trash runs, and laundry cause I understand they don't have the time. But does common sense, especially at their age, not tell them that they should be picking up after themselves?

I've told them multiple times that I am not their maid and am done cleaning up after them so they need to do it themselves, but I always cave cause I get paranoid that someone might stop by unexpectedly and associate the mess with me. I also don't want to have to deal with bugs and smells.

What should I do cause I've done everything I can think of? All I get in return is ""I'll do it later/tomorrow"" (they never do), ""Shut up, you're not my mom"".",17Dec2019,1
824,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. So I've been married for about 7 years now, and have been with my partner for 10 years overall. I love my wife, we always have good time together. We are both mid 30s with decent jobs in a big city in the US. Before I met my wife, I used to live in a very conservative country, where having sex before marriage is looked down at and could be even punishable by law. So my wife was pretty much the first woman I've had sex with. 

That's not the case for her though, since she lived most of her life in the US. She is pretty open about her past and her previous relationships which I tremendously respect. However I always feel like I'm missing something. I haven't had a full youth like my wife or my friends around me. I always have the feeling that because of where I used to live and the very conservative bring up I had, I haven't really matured sexually like my wife or normal people of my age. For them, settling down is a goal after years of experimenting and messing around. For me it's quite the opposite, my 20s were lost in street protesting, dull platonic relationships, boring jobs, before realizing the futility of all that and giving up completely by moving to different world. 

Now I feel like all that is coming at a price, and the price is that I cannot really be content with what I have now. I know is the best for me rationally, but emotionally I feel something totally different. To be completely honest, I want to cheat on my wife, I want to mess around, and I want to do all the stuff that I've missed. However, I don't want to lose what I have now, it's like I'm trying to live my 20s and 30s in parallel and not consecutively. 

I'm pretty sure I'm now the only person who feels this way at this point in their life, I just want to know if it's unfair to my wife that I hold these thoughts and not sharing them with her. Or should I just end everything and start a new life like Nora in A Doll's House ?",17Dec2019,1

So I was sitting in a large and empty ground at about midnight, some guy comes on a bicycles, stops and sits close to me, tried talking about why was I there sitting alone while placing his hands on me, I said nothing, his expressions were normal but he made his grip stronger and was moving towards my pen\*s area, I got scared and uncomfortable and moved without showing it that I am scared.

835,"Throwaway. (16M) I don’t have too many friends, and I really don’t do too well with the ladies. So it was a surprise when a senior girl asked me to prom. We had known each other mutually and we were kind of friendly to each other, but never really that close of friends and the eve to say hi to her, I get a sort of half-assed greeting back. Anyways, over the summer, she texted me out of the blue asking me to go with her to MY junior prom. Idiotic me was caught by surprise and immediately accepted, thinking this would be my only chance to go to prom with anyone. She said it would be fun, that she’d hang out with me and our friends. I was really surprised since she had in no way hinted in taking me to prom. 

Anyways, fast forward to December and the fact that I have a date to prom has become somewhat of a joke, not malicious or anything, but still. So when I was hanging out with a couple of people I met over the summer, who I’ve become t trust and like very much, my prom came up in conversation and I told them who I was going with. The three of them told me about how the senior girl is kind of a backstabbed and a “bitch” and tbh, I get a weird vibe from her. One of the girls that I work with even said that she’d go to prom with me.

837,"My brother is dating this girl who’s married to another guy and has a 7 year old daughter with her husband. She does not take care of the daughter she has at all and spent 90% of her daughters life in rehab in Florida where she met my brother who was also in rehab. After they dated for a few months he got her pregnant and they miscarried. They decided to try for another baby and had one in August. Neither of the parents work, have any sort of income, any assets, or any motivation to do better for their child. I don’t understand why they wanted a child but my theory is that my brothers girl friend is using him because she lives for free in my grandparents house (who are millionaires and allow them to live without working) and the baby would force my grandparents to continue to house her for free since they moved back to Philadelphia. 

While pregnant (after she was out of rehab) she was using heroin again. The baby was born addicted and spent the first 2 1/2 months of his life in the hospital experiencing withdraw. Child services was called and the mother was forced to go into rehab and my brother entered himself in too for using with her. She told my mother that “the doctor told her she had to keep using heroin or the baby would die from withdraw in her uterus” I know that no doctor would ever say that to a pregnant women and she is a compulsive liar who only cares about herself. Now both parents are in rehab. 

My mother has been left with the child and there is nobody else to take care of the child. My father doesn’t want him in his house due to the strong stance he took against allowing my brother and his girlfriend live together and not pursue careers. My father was against every choice my brother took because he knew this would happen and didnt want to be left with the responsibility of a child. I was on my fathers side throughout the whole debate and pushed for my brother to put his baby up for adoption, which he refused. 

On Friday I was asked by my mother to adopt the baby and I don’t know what to do. I found myself in love with the baby after the first time I met him and pray for him all the time, and I never prayed before he was born. I am 23 years old and graduated college 7 months ago. I have huge student debt and began working 4 months ago with a salary of 49,000 but I haven’t been saving any money and just putting huge payments down on my loans so I’m afraid I won’t be able to support myself and the child. I’ve never taken care of a baby or even baby sat anybody’s kid for more than an hour. I have no experience but I may be the child’s only hope and I know my mother will help as much as possible. 

I feel obligated to take this baby. When I was about 12 my mother and father temporarily left due to drugs and my older brother was left to take care of us. I spent a few days in foster care and I’ve never been so scared in my life. I’ve heard stories about Foster care and I’m afraid to let that baby be entered into the system. My brothers childhood was ended early because he had to step up and take care of my and my other sibling at 18 and I sometimes blame myself and that pressure put into him as the reason he eventually turned to drugs and got addicted and lost most of his life to drugs. 

I feel like I owe him to take in his child like he did for me but I have a boyfriend who only knows the drug addict and bad side of my brother. We’ve been dating since we were 16 and were now 23 but he has made it clear if I adopt the baby he’s breaking up with me and our relationship is done. He thinks I’m being ridiculous even considering taking the child and I don’t want to lose him. If I were to take the child I’d need him more than ever before. 

But I can’t let this kid go. I can’t stop thinking about him all day, every day. He’s been put at such a disadvantage and I always told myself I would adopt or foster a child in need, like I was at 12, and give them the life I wished I had at that age and now I feel as though this baby was born just as I got a career and could possible take him. I feel like I owe my older brother for what he did for me as a child and I really love his baby. I’m just so afraid I won’t be able to financially support myself and the kid at 23 with no savings and losing my boyfriend for a reason like this would destroy me. 

Any advice would help. I refuse to let child services take this baby into the foster care system and I know my brother and his girlfriend will destroy this kids life if they get him back. My mother and father are too old to have a newborn and there is no other family who can take him. I feel like I don’t have a choice because I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if something bad happened to this baby that I feel I could’ve prevented if I took him in. I want to travel and be young but I feel selfish because my older brother gave that up for me.

So anyway he took off to Australia not long after my son was born (we had separated during my pregnancy) he has not wanted to participate in my sons life, which is entirely his choice the door is always open if he would like to, but I digress, I never made a point to chase child support and being in another country added to that complexity so I have left it alone. 

So that made me a single mum, and wanting the best for my little one I decided to get a degree in social work...loaning the money. Two years into the degree I failed a paper that I could not afford to fail and subsequently was booted. I jumped straight into full time work, not wanting to stay on assistanace any longer than required. Day care costs drilled me but, being stubborn I wanted to set a good example to my son about working hard. After a year i got offered a new job and handed in my resignation, 3 months into this my dad (who I am very close to) was in a major accident and lost his right leg above the knee. As my job was part time I threw in the towel to take care of him (he is all good now by the way! Super proud of him, back to work after two months and still kicking my ass at the gym daily) once the major part of that was over a great job fell into my lap and I took it.

Now I am in my dream job, but I have accumulated alot of debt over the years, during the harder times. I have learnt my lessons from loaning money etc. But it does not change my situation now which is drowning in it.

How can I get out? And get out fast? It is a constant worry, it keeps me up at night. I'm working all possible hours, have a strict, tight food budget, have changed to the cheapest power company and internet (yes I do have to have it as part of my job I am also doing a distance learning course as professional development), we have zero unnecessary costs, I dont drink or smoke, we op shop for anything we need, my car is economical and very cheap to run (we don't have adequate public transport where o am). I cannot think of what else I can do? I cant pick up more work as I am already pushing it as it is and it then becomes a problem of working a second job and 1)never seeing my child and 2) putting 80% of the second wage into childcare costs. I have tried online and call center jobs from home but they dont seem to boost the income as most are commission jobs. What else can I do? I am proactive and like outside the box ideas!

844,"So my mum was friends with a lady for a very long time and suddenly in 2008 we stopped speaking for about 11 years. This was because the lady was paranoid and thought my mother was going out with her cheating husband so she cut us off.

 This was all very untrue as she admitted 5 months ago when my mother saw her at a wedding. She apologised to my mother and extended an olive branch. My mum has since visited her in her house twice since that time but now she wants to spend christmas together.

We think she wants to spend christmas together and then leave her kids (16&amp;18) at ours whilst she goes to work (she’s a nurse).

We are very reserved people and only like to spend christmas day with just us. What can we say to her ?

My mums having a hard time with this bc she hates letting people down, i don’t care too much bc i’ll never stress about something i don’t want to happen like this.

My mum wants me to call/text her to say that i have been planning a chetimas surprise for my mum where im taking her away for 2 nights for a mother and daughters spa break (a lie).

847,"I’ve been working at this establishment for about 8 or 9 months now because at the time I had just gotten released from my job for getting angry at my manager and cussing them out(bad idea on my part but my new workplace understood why I lashed out). I resorted to this place as a last minute type deal because I really needed a job and the money. I’m planning on resigning soon because I barely get paid above minimum wage and they make me work 35 hours a week plus with school (I’m a Junior in High School) and will not give me less than one day off a week or raise my pay from $8/hr.

Recently, this girl was hired and I didn’t really pay attention to her. I kept going on my job. She started to talk to me and all I did was communicate back like a coworker would. During break, she would play with my hair and say things that made me uncomfortable, such as “Oh, I might wanna keep you hehe”. I told my girlfriend the next day for advice and all she told me to do was ignore her.
My coworker asked for my phone number, and since I do not even have a functioning phone, I gave her my old phone number just so she would stop asking. First time I told her no because I don’t want to talk to her outside of work. She persisted and asked me for weeks for my number. I finally gave it to her (again, doesn’t work).

My supervisor found out about the way she was talking and treating to me and got really aggravated with how I’m supposedly “cheating” on my girlfriend. My girlfriend occasionally comes in to chat with my supervisor as her mother is good friends with my SV and my SV used to babysit my girlfriend. My girlfriend does not mind me talking to this girl and hasn’t gotten mad at me even if I’ve told her about the girl (her reasoning being that she trusts me c:). 

Again, I tell my coworker about my girlfriend and her response was a giggle. Told my coworker I’ve been with my girlfriend for a 2 and a half years and even showed my coworker some rings that my GF might like because I’m planning to propose to her next year. Coworker persists to try to touch me weirdly and if I’m cleaning/doing my job, she will push me into corners and not let me through and I have to use brute force to push her out of my way. Is there any way that I can get her to stop for once? I do not like her in any way and she is really stopping me from doing my job at times, which gets really annoying.


TL;DR: Coworker will not stop flirting with me and even stops me from doing my job to talk to her. Told coworker I have a girlfriend and that I am uncomfortable with her motives.",17Dec2019,1

850,"So this happened this morning. My friends and I finished our last exams last night so we were just hanging out in one of my friends dorm room for a little while before we left to go home. then one of my friends pulled out some weed and offered to me but I declined. someone smelled it from outside and reported it so the campus police showed up. we were very respectful and cooperative so they let us go with just a conduct referral and no criminal charges. they searched the room too and didn’t find anything other than the device he was using to smoke it and the already smoked burned weed. they said that my parents won’t find out unless I tell them, but i’m 99% sure the university will send a letter home after my hearing for the conduct referral. 

now here is where it gets a little more interesting. my friend who was smoking is on probation and could have gotten suspended or even worse for this, so I took some of the blame and told the cops that I smoked some of it too. so the letter they send home will state that I was smoking weed too even though I wasn’t. 

i’m not sure if I should get ahead of this and tell them what happened when I get home or if I should wait it out until they ask me about it, which will likely be when i’m back at school so I wouldn’t have to face them in person. I also don’t know if my parents will believe me because I do understand that it may be hard to believe that I wasn’t smoking.

i’m also worried about what my punishment will be. I really don’t think it will be that bad since we were cooperative and the police were really chill and will probably write the reports in our favors and not make us look like total delinquents. also this is my first conduct referral. i’m hoping my max punishment is probation.

851,"First time posting in this sub, and mobile yadda yadda.
This is gonna be a little long, and I’m sorry. 
I haven’t worked in a few months due to being ill. Lucky for me, I’ve always been big on saving, and have been able to float for about 5-6 months now. 
I was fine until a friend of mine who doesn’t drive asked me to pick them up from work one week. I said yes, because what’s a week? They work less than 10 minutes from my home. I faithfully picked them up that week, expecting nothing in return. Now I regret it. This friend now has the expectation that I pick them up after ALL of their shifts, and has only given me money for gas once. This has been going on for months now. Yes, my car gets great mileage, and this shouldn’t really be a problem, but now anytime they want to go anywhere, somehow it’s up to me.
They’ll call me whenever and ask to go to this place and that, no matter how far. That kills my gas. I told them I’m at the end of my savings and can’t afford to take them all over the place, as I’d like to make my gas last. Plus now that I’m better, I’m applying for jobs and doing interviews. I need gas in my car to get to them.  They claimed to understand, but the demands just keep coming. 
I find it hard to tell them no, because they’ve been there for me during this really difficult year, and played a huge role in my medical treatment. But I get so mad when I say I’m not driving and they kind of guilt me into picking them up, and taking them here and there.  Even when the roads have been icy, and they know I’m a new driver. Then they got mad at me for not wanting to drive my car through a drive thru in our area that is notorious for destroying the underside of your car due to crumbling asphalt. They asked to go the other night after work. First it was “can we go to this store” I reluctantly said yes, then was asked to go to the bad drive thru. I said no. Period. They pestered me, trying to convince me and then had an attitude when I stood my ground, and drove right past it. Called me an asshole. I took them home. Now today, I’m being asked to stop at yet another store after picking them up from work.

How do I tell them I will no longer be providing rides without gas money or respect? I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but I’m not a chauffeur, and I feel like they are so insensitive to my financial situation.",17Dec2019,1

853," I am a graduate mentor (supervisor) for six interns. (I'm not that much older than them, I'm 22 and they're 18-21) For an end of the semester fun event, we decided to plan a secret santa gift exchange. A website randomly assigned us to give a gift to another person. Last sunday, 5/7 of us met up. The 2 others flaked last minute but said they would give their gifts at this workshop we were all supposed to go to two days later.

Out of the 5, I was the only one who did not a gift and I was pretty sad, but I figured I'd get the gift on Tuesday

Well, on Monday night, my grandpa died, so I was too distraught to go to the Tuesday workshop. I let my interns know. I wasn't going to make it due to a family emergency.

Well, now it's been a week and I haven't heard anything from the other two interns. I figured I would've heard something from at least one of them by now. I know that if I was hypothetically buying a gift for my supervisor, I'd be scrambling to get them a gift. I don't know which one of them was supposed to get me the gift. **I am pretty annoyed that I didn't get anything since all of us spent money to make this a fun event. I'm wondering if it would be unprofessional of me to call them out since I am in a position of power over them.** The internship isn't over until May, so I will definitely be seeing them again",17Dec2019,1

856,"I (25f) work at an Italian restaurant/winter resort in the North of England (I'm Brazilian). I moved here a year ago with my husband (32m) who's originally from here. Things have been going pretty well and I like the new job for the most part. There's another Brazilian at the place which is cool and he's actually been the one passing ""messages"" from our Italian boss (38m) to me. They're good friends it seems. About a week ago or so, he came up to me and said ""Roberto (not his real name) is crazy to go out with you"". To which I replied ""I'm married, and I thought he was too? His wife works at reception doesn't she?, ""Yeah but... Is that a problem? Each to their own""... I just looked at him again and said ""well, im happily married"". After he said that a lot of things started clicking, you see my boss has been reaaaally trying to make non work related conversation for weeks now, randomly speaking to me in Portuguese (he asks Brazilian chef how to). Another thing is, usually at the end of a Saturday night shift, he gives the staff a free drink if it's been a busy/stressful night, which we think is nice. But as of two weeks ago or so, he's been giving me quite a few drinks, wine, gin, vodka and all sorts. If I turn it down, he insists or simply gets me a different drink to see if I'll like it better. He also has a habit of brushing off any mistakes I make and the rest of staff has picked up on it. Last night a female coworker came up to me asking if the drinks I've been getting from him are being taken out of my wage. I was surprised by the question because I assumed everyone got free drinks (plural, they only get one apparently) from him on Saturday nights. I told her ""no? I thought he gave everyone booze?"", She looked confused and said ""oh"". He walked past me not long after that and said I made you a drink upstairs (last night, a Monday) I went up a few minutes later and he came after me, when I got there the room was empty except for us two and I realized he had a drink next to mine. Fortunately the female coworker came up as well and I immediately started chatting to her then followed her down so he wouldn't have chance to say/do anything innapropriate. Not long after THAT he told me to try his gin from his glass, I said no thank you, he insisted. Worth noting hes also very touchy. While all this is going on Brazilian guy keeps telling me ""he's not bothered you're married"", ""he's been trying to impress you with Portuguese for weeks"", ""I won't tell anyone if you go out with him"".

I told my husband everything. He thinks I need to go to HR, as it's harassment AND he's pressuring me to drink on the job. Thing is, he hasn't ACTUALLY done anything that constitutes sexual harassment, or has he? Husband and I have recently bought a house and both our incomes are necessary for the time being. At least until I found a new job, but I can't just quit. I have two fears:

1- Going to HR without proof means my word against his, most likely I'd just get fired.

2- If I DONT say anything, and more employees catch on that he's showing me favouritism, they might start thinking something is happening. People don't need all the info to start gossip.

Is this just a sleazy guy with a crush or is this really crossing boundaries as my husband seems to think?",17Dec2019,1
857,"In the midst of all these storms, it's bothering me that homeless people are on the streets battling the rain and wind. I'm wondering what the best options to help them are. There are three ways I've considered - I'll lay them out and explain the pros and cons as I see them but massively appreciate advice on direction...

1. Raising money for a local homeless shelter - I kinda wanna do this but I still see so many homeless people on the streets who maybe aren't getting the benefits of this. Plus salaries etc.

2. Buying a product such as a sleeping bag for a vast majority of the population - again wanna do this but is it realistic given the scale? I live in a small city. Also, are sleeping bags even useful if most have them or extra weight?

3. Focusing on one homeless person and raising money to change their life - what are the logistics being this. Will it get massively complicated? If I can't raise enough will it essentially be wasted?

Drew had done some weird stuff when lydia was at his house before, like he randomly  masturbated while they were sitting on his couch. She has a boyfriend and didnt interact with drew when he did this.  I told her that was weird but she just brushed it off. Well fast forward to now. It's been a bout a week or two since then. Drew has been asking lydia for nudes almost every night, he TOOK her hand and put it on his balls even after she took it off and said stop he wouldnt stop. Shes really uncomfortable around him now because they used to be close but now hes been acting creepy. Carly comes into this because her and drew were at work and they had to go somewhere in the back to get something, when they went back there drew told carly to grab his d*ck and she said no and that she has a boyfriend. He kept insisting and said he wanted to grab her butt, she told him no. He then grabbed her butt and she told him to stop but then he stuck his hands down her pants. Of course shes really uncomfortable with him now too but lydia and carly dont know if they should file a report or not. Obviously they need to tell someone but their question is, since some of the stuff happened at work could they report him and get him fired. Their main concern is that they all go to school and have classes together. How can they report him and make it so they dont see him at school or work (without getting a schedule change). I told lydia that I would ask reddit for help because someone might know how the laws  would work (keep in mind drew is a minor). Also if it makes any difference we live in maryland so idk if state laws are different for that stuff but what do they do to make sure they dont have to see him. I told lydia that if she needs a ride to work not to go with drew and that I could take her. So I'm hoping that helps some but idk how much I can do. I hope that was a clear explanation. Please help.

862,"I am 31. I had a poor and abusive childhood. I was badly bullied in school. I had suicidal thoughts from age 10. Survived suicide ate 15. Had several more attempts. Raped by ""friends"" age 16 and 17. 

Fled my abusive family age 18. Tried college, tried several jobs, tried so much. But never survived any of it longer than a few months or up to about one year. I always end up being bullied, being labeled ""lazy and stupid"", always end up being the one to be treated as the lowling and being told by bosses or teachers that they regret getting me in, because I am a liar and deceived them, essentially making them think I'm a decent human but end up being too stupid. 

While I really tried, always. While people always said I was lazy, I actually worked so hard until I burnt out really bad. 

I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which does explain why everything was so hard and burning-out for me even though for others it looked like I didn't do enough. It also explains the loads of misunderstandings and just me not understand what's wrong until it is too late.

I am 31 now. I had surgery in my lower spine twice now. I have Hashimoto's which makes me fatigued and less robust than I used to be. I am not as functional as I should be. Not as functional as bosses want me to be.

I don't know what to do now. I always dreamed of being an artist, but I'm riddled with doubt and I'm losing any hope. I just don't know what to do with myself. It feels so horrible I wish I could throw all the art supplies out and never see any of this again. I am unable to post pictures online, I'm that ashamed of my shit. 

Recently I was asked if I want to work in a different country (where they speak English, and even tho English is not my native language I'm okay with it), and even though the computer job there really sounds tempting, I would have to leave everything behind and basically do a big jump without knowing if I will survive, if I will be able to sustain a life there, if I will end up burning out and being bullied again. If I end up too weak to even work 8 hours every day. Because I probably am too weak... If I end up fucking it all up again because I never achieved anything in my sorry life. 

To be honest, I am suicidal. Not severely, I'm not going to do anything, but the thoughts are there. It's just, I'm fed up with myself, with being the loser I am, with managing and battling my health problems and sometimes severe chronic pain, and poverty with surviving with bare minimum and being unable to do anything about it. With having dreams and pursuing them and then failing over and over again. 

Please tell me your thoughts, advice, experiences, anything. Thank you.",17Dec2019,1

I dealt with suicidal ideation starting at age 6 or 7 and it’s only gotten worse since. 
Both parents were mostly absent, and when they were around I had very little to no real relationship with them. We saw each other, sure, but we didn’t have positive interactions. We spoke only when my grades were bad enough that the school would call, or when I got caught and needed to be punished. 
When I was punished it was never a reasonable one. My father was a big fan of denying food and telling me I’d be homeless for the rest of my life (over elementary school math difficulties) which left me with extreme stress responses to school that I only recently learned how to cope with properly. My mother preferred screaming, hitting, and telling me to stop acting stupid and if I was smart I wouldn’t have this problem. 
I was with someone my own age, my first real partner, for three years who beat and raped me the entire time, plus loads of psychological abuse on top. 
I’ve dealt with transphobia and homophobia from everyone in my life, never had anyone have a truly healthy relationship with me with the exception of one friend who now is no longer needing my support. 
I can’t hold down a job, I started one Saturday and I’ve had multiple panic attacks per day since, and I can’t even work up the nerve to call them and quit.

Single. Class. And his best friend who threatened to beat me to death after we broke up? Just transferred back to our school. And has been doing the same thing.
I’m starting to think my father was right. I’m never gonna get a good job or go anywhere in life, I’m too broken to function and I don’t wanna go on disability. My family would be so disappointed and I’d never hear the end of how much of a worthless quitter I am for it. 
TLDR: I’ve only had about 6 good months all together out of my 18 years that I haven’t wanted nothing more than to go to sleep and never wake up again, and I’m slipping back, relying on drugs to function, and I want to commit suicide before I have to go through any worse.",17Dec2019,1

871,"Just to add some context, I'm currently working at a Walmart. I'm on the team Cap 2: the 2nd shift shelf stockers. Our team has struggled to complete our daily tasks due to unreliability of the individuals on the team, and we are understaffed. If we continue to struggle there will be repercussions that may result in mass firings or firing of our current supervisors who are legitimately good leaders who give it their all. 

The problem arises with certain members of the team. Some of them smoke marijuana which in my state is illegal. I know that management knows about this and i suspect that they don't fire them because we are understaffed. My teammates  are breaking the law and i want to get police involved because of this. 

I hesitate to get police involved because as i said earlier, if we continue to struggle there will be repercussions, and with fewer people on the team we will be weaker. This could result in the loss of jobs of those who were not directly breaking the law. I'm torn as to what i should do.

Hi guys, sorry for any formatting issues as I'm on mobile.

Back in August I(20F) had figured out my boyfriend's(23M) phone password and decided to snoop because I had been feeling like something was off. I confronted him a few times but he just made me feel crazy for thinking there was someone else. When I checked his phone, I found multiple texts from different dates between him and his ex saying he missed her and couldn't get over her.

My boyfriend and I dated back in 2016 until 2018 and got back together last May. This ex was an egirl, they had never met in person and primarily talked on discord. He had revealed to me that they had done sexual stuff over video before once too. He always put her off as just an egirl and that I shouldn't worry about her. Before I found out he was still sending romantic-ish texts to her, we had a big fight where I was a crying mess on the floor at 2am and he promised he wasn't talking to her anymore so I believed him, and thought I was just being psycho thinking that he still talked to her. He left his laptop open and I saw he had searched her on Spotify, so that night when he was asleep. I went on his phone and found all the texts between them even after the big fight where he watched me break into a million tiny pieces over her. During this fight I'll admit I was a bit unhinged and the fight between the two of us got physical, I was yelling at him and hitting/scratching him. We somehow decided to continue this relationship.

After that fight, he changed his phone password and fast forward to now, he freaks out when I touch his phone or laptop, he logged into my laptop once and when I tried to use my laptop he took it from me and wouldn't give it back and almost broke it until he was logged out. He'll literally hold me down to get his phone back and will get really mad if I try to look over his shoulder. He says that he isn't doing anything and I have to trust him and that I'm not allowed to see any of his stuff. If I ask to use his phone (reminder that I don't know the password) for even just a flashlight, he'll freak out and come up with every excuse he can for me not to use it. I let him use my phone and laptop freely and have told him my passwords, so it's not a matter of him trying to return the favour. When I ask nicely to go through his phone he gets angry to the point that he wants to break up because ""I don't trust him"" I want to trust him but it's hard when he hides everything from me. I don't want his phone password even but maybe if he could just show me what he has sometimes so I know there's nothing going on. 

I know the obvious answer is ""leave him"" because we're both unhinged, but the rest of our relationship outside of this phone/laptop thing is really good. Most of the time we're really happy and lovey-dovey, we both miss each other often and everything just feels good and normal until it gets to that part. I really want breaking up to be a last resort, because I do love him very much, but I'm having a hard time being at peace with what he did in August and how he acts over his phone and laptop. So please if you have any advice, help me out.

Thanks a bunch",17Dec2019,1

879,"I've been together with my gf for a year and my gf can be quite jealous sometimes about girls that are friends of mine (so non romantically involved). I always reassure her that she doesn't need to stress about it, as i never meet with them separately and most of the time i'm just spending time with my gf or with my male friends. We're the kind of couple that knows each others romantic past or so I thought... I told her everything but she tends to keep her past vague about some people of her past. For me it's totally normal if you've loved other people before but if you say things like :' i never loved anyone before you' or the stories change over time then I'd tend to think she didn't tell me everything. Now i found out more info about two guys she's been lying about (one she loved apparantly and kept in contact with him and saying things like 'i miss you' and actually stopped getting in touch with him when we were official &amp; one she told me was just a friend but was actually more) and she gets triggered if I asked a single thing about them. She thinks i'm accusing her of cheating, which I'm not but I don't think it's fair that I had to tell everything of my past and she lied about it. Since we started dating, i was and am her only man in her life but it bugs me that she doesn't feel comfortable to tell me the truth, because i'm not going to leave her. Should i tell her that I do know more so I know she's lying or should i just drop it since everything she was vague about or lied about happened before she even knew me and she just want to forget everything before me?",17Dec2019,1

But all of the pictures of you in provocative clothing on social media, all the sociopathic wankers you’ve dated in the past, all of the moronic, braindead motherfuckers you matched with on tinder just because of the way they look, your apathy when it comes to punishing men who have treated you like shit, the attention you give to guys on social media when you like them and then pretending like you were never attracted to them in the first place.

It’s indicative of female psychology. I don’t want your phone. I don’t want to live like that. Fuck women and their stupid bullshit. “

By the way, I removed any slightly provocative pictures (they were just in T-shirt’s and jeans but a bit of cleavage showed so I got rid of all of them). I also deleted all my social media for him, cut myself off from men entirely and only have him in my life. 
Our relationship is amazing almost all of the time but every time he hears my phone off, I have to show him the notification even though he says he “doesn’t care” because otherwise he’ll think it’s a guy sending me sexual messages. 

To clarify - I have never cheated on him, I no longer talk to any guys, I’ve cut myself off from everyone and I’ve done everything possible to show him that I can be trusted. 

I’ve been there and stopped him from two suicide attempts. I constantly put aside my own numerous mental health issues just to help him and even at the expense of my happiness, I’ll ensure he’s okay at all times.

The day comes around - keeping in mind that it is midweek and we all talked about this since Saturday - and less than an hour before we are ment to exchange gifts I get a message from Casey. She said she forgot about secret Santa and that she was meant to be mime. I was quiet upset especially seeing as she didn't even go to the effort to get me something really small and tell me she'd give me the real present later. 

She then never showed up to the exchange messaging the group chat that she was sick. Everyone felt super bad for her but as it turned out she was drinking only a few hours later. She promised me she would give me my gift during our exams (we had two weeks off college before this) and that she was so sorry.

Last week I was messaging a girl I used to mess around with, it honestly started as just a little catch up. Things got a little heated and she came on to me pretty hard (she had just broken up with her bf, i kinda knew she really liked me way before her ex) and things got a little out of control. Some dirty texts and risqué snapchats were sent, but before it got too crazy she fell asleep cus she was pretty drunk.

After i nutted (of course) it really hit me that this was the first time I had cheated on my gf. I had cheated on my only other ex gf because she was legitimately crazy and my ex even knows about all that. But this was different. 

I was hit with a lot of regret, more than I've ever felt before. I genuinely felt heart ache for doing such a stupid thing. I stayed up most of the night crying and smoking joints and before i slept i told the girl that we couldn't talk anymore unless my gf and I break up one day.

I really feel like shit, it's been a few days and my gf still doesn't know a thing. I'm torn between telling her everything and getting this all off my chest or just bottling it up and hiding it from her to spare the pain.

Since then I've realised how much I really love her, I've thought about our future and how much I can't wait to spend my life with her. But I really am afraid that I will cheat again in the future and hurt her even more. I don't want to be a bad guy. I don't want to hurt the girl I love.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I would appreciate any advice you guys can give.

897,"I'm going to try and keep this as simple as possible:

I am an account manager. I make sure projects are coded and go out on time. I send dates to a copywriter, and they basically just write some text by the date given. Generally speaking, this is a very simple process.

Well, we just got a new client like two months ago, and I'm working with a new copywriter (new to me; he's been at the company a while now, though both probably around the same age). He *seems* like the kind of person that would be easy to get along with.

Problem is, in the 10 months we've been working together, he's not gotten copy (read: text) to me on time except once, and he wrote on the wrong subject. Apparently, everyone has the same problems working with him, so it doesn't *seem* to be personal.

Problem is, with this *new* client we have... it is *SUPER* important they do well. These people are the kinds of people who can really open doors to all kinds of new opportunities and connections for the company. And today, they sent us an email, asking what exactly is wrong, that they thought we were going to be more consistent, and wondering if it's a problem on *their* end.

I've continued to let management know about the issue, and today, I let my direct boss (the Vice President of the company) know about the email. He said it was ultimately the writer's responsibility to get his stuff done, and he would be held accountable if he doesn't do what he's supposed to do.

My problem is that, in an industry that is *very much* forged on personal connections, *I* wind up looking incompetent. The client has no idea what's going on, and obviously I'm not going to throw someone else under the bus, because that would just make the *company* (and myself) look even worse.

But in a way, it sort of feels like the company is kind of *waiting* for this guy to fail, and I have to think, that *also* makes the company look *incredibly* weak.

I dunno. I'm really torn if I should try and press this issue more? The company knows about the problem, and so I don't see them blaming me for the eventual failure of this client... but they're also basically *guaranteeing* this client's program with us fails, which makes *everyone* look incompetent.

My teachers and my school guidance counsellor said I would definitely get a conditional offer from Manchester university as I was only 1 grade off the typical offer. However, I was skeptical and I wanted to be 100% certain that I would get an offer. 

So I went to my physics teacher and asked them to reconsider my predicted grade. To my surprise, there had been an error as students who were 1 mark off the next grade should have been predicted 1 grade up. They told me that my grade would be changed.

2 months later, my grade hadn’t been changed and so I asked them about it at my progression meeting. They told me that there was no point moving my grade up as they were “100% sure” I would get an offer with AAA.

My break-up was 3 weeks ago and I'm still not over her.  Feel like I might never be able to.
But this morning I installed Tinder just because my friends begged me to. I don't blame them. Everyone wants me to socialize and go out again but I just can't convince myself in doing so. So I meet with that woman I met through tinder today, she was all passionate about the stories she had to tell and the stuff she was looking forward to. But I was just silent the whole evening, just drinking beer and listening to her. 

Where I fucked up,
I leaned over and kissed her. Which she liked a lot. We kissed a few times and I'm pretty sure that everyone who saw us must have thought that we must have been in love. But after I dropped her home and refused her invite to stay at her place, I found myself drinking again. As I wrote earlier, at my favorite bar.

I just can't get my ex out of my head. She has been dating someone else ever since our break-up and I have absolutely no contact with her.

She is amazing and very supportive, but I feel like an asshole ignoring her.

I can't get myself over the fact that we are ever getting back together with my ex again.  And I feel like a massive asshole in ignoring and being a mess towards people who are interested in me.

906,"So basically my (20f) boyfriend  (20m) is a tradesman, a tiler, who’s been in his industry for going on 6 years in the new year. We’ve been together for 4 years so I was there when he was just starting out as casual/part time when we were younger. He will work anywhere between 50-70 hours a week, and has been doing so since we graduated. He also is very passionate and into going to the gym which he will try to do 5-6 days a week after work for about an hour and a half so usually he’ll leave the house at 6am and not be back until 7-8pm on weekdays.

Over time he’s just gotten progressively grumpier,  exhausted, drained and just not happy overall. I’ve watched his personality just completely vanish and his will to do anything other than sit on the couch and watch TV in his spare time disappear. He’s not interested in having any form of conversation with me or help around the house (which I understand and am happy to pick up the slack with) but it really just is no way to live and it’s not great for maintaining our relationship either. He works for his brother in his 3 man business and acts like dropping his hours is absolutely out of the question whenever I pose it as a possibility. His best friend, the third man in the business is only in his 2nd year of his apprenticeship and his girlfriend (my best friend) is already noticing the same cracks forming. It’s obvious that they literally cannot handle this type of work load and I feel like if he keeps overworking himself he’ll just end up losing it and start wanting to kill himself- which he blurts out sometimes.

907,"So my friends got married 3 years ago and they live at one of their parents home. I have been telling them that I want to move out of my parents house and get my own place. Well, 2 days ago they called me and told me they were getting ready to start building their house. They shared with me the floor plans they were looking at and everything. Well they want to me to move in and pay rent. Now, I live in Texas so I know I can find an apartment at 800 -1000 bucks. The thing is that I can pay 800 for a whole apartment, my own kitchen, room and restroom. I don't know if it's a good idea for me to pay about 800 a month for a room at a married couples house. Don't get me wrong we are close and all!

908,"A little back story... I (f22) lived with a girl who lied about rent money and possibly pocketed the money I gave her to write a check to our landlord and we ended up getting sued. My bank account was garnished and hers was not (she conveniently changed banks at the time and avoided any repercussions). My bank account was overdrafted by $2,500 and I moved back home with a month left of college to go. Commute was 2hours to class and my mom has been paying for everything considering my situation. 

Now that I have graduated, a former supervisor from an internship I did over the summer got a new job at this well-known ad agency that I had dreamed of working at and they opened a position that she thought I would be great for. She had been raving about me to her boss and connected me with the right people and I have an interview this week!!! Keep in mind it is so hard to get a job at this agency and I will never get this opportunity again. This job, however, is in the city I went to school in and I had just moved back home due to the financial situation above.

My mom had bailed me out of that situation and I am so grateful, but she does not want me to go back to that city for that job. She thinks I should just try to find a job in the city we are in. Some friends are telling me that I will never get this chance again and having this agency on my resume will open so many doors for my career. I don’t know what to do if I get the job since I don’t have any money (I am currently using my moms credit card) and no place to live in this city.

912,"Sorry in advance if my storytelling is bad, it’s my first time writing long text posts like this.

At the moment, I’m 17 and my younger brother is 12. We’ve shared a room since he was 5 years old, and we’re in a family of 8. He’s got a learning disability, so he’s slow to pick up on certain things, and he also has poor communication skills. I’m not proud of the way I used to treat him, and while it wasn’t anything physically abusive, and even though we have a healthy relationship now, it feels unforgivable to me. 

While I was growing up, I was always annoyed that our tiny room was super messy, or that there was way too much noise, so I would always push the blame onto my younger brother for whatever issue there was. He was also very spontaneous and loud as a kid (even now a bit, but I don’t mind too much), so I would try to lecture him and tell him to “just be normal”. I find it odd that I’d say these things, considering that it completely goes against all of my beliefs (I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression, so I understand how it feels to be told these things). There was one time when I was 12 (he was 7) where I was super fed up with him being noisy and making strange sounds, so I repeatedly asked him to say “From now on I will listen to OP’s rules” while I captured it on an audio recording. 
Another haunting memory I have that’s embarrassingly recent (I was 14) is when I got super pissed about the room and his behavior. It kinda built up over a long period of time since I’m always stuck in a room with the kid, so I gave him a long lecture about how he should act like a good kid and try to be more independent. I think what I meant by “independent” was that he asks for help pretty frequently on small tasks, and I was super frustrated since I always had to be the one to help him. Anyways, I took it super far and was borderline yelling at one point, and I made him cry for the first time in awhile. I feel horrible about it. Not even his younger sister would cry at that age. The poor kid just wanted to play roblox with his friends, but instead he was being told by his rude older brother to fix something he can’t prevent in the first place. 
I also want to mention that our mother is slightly manipulative, exclusively to the two of us since we don’t get the best grades or do very good at sports in comparison to our siblings. I was a gifted kid who had a lot ahead of him, but my parents would push me really hard once I got to middle school, and it made me feel really bad about myself. In combination with other strange targeted behavior from them and my peers at school, I’d like to imagine that I took this bottled up anger out on my younger brother. 
At the time I’m writing this, I’ve grown a lot. I can say I’ve become more of an older brother. My brother and I hang out a lot and play games together and send funny stuff to each other. We do all kinds of cool brother stuff, and he’s turned out to be a great kid. My older siblings are a bit mean to him and make fun of him for liking video games like TF2, HL, and roblox, but I always make sure to let him know that those games are great and he shouldn’t let them decide for him. But, I’m worried that what I did when I was younger may have had unwanted psychological effects on him. I was looking at some of his old schoolwork from when he was little, and I saw some art project that said “OP is the coolest in the world!” with a stick figure drawing of me on a skateboard. When I think about that in conjunction with how I treated him, my heart aches. Should I apologize somehow? Given his communication skills, I don’t know if he’d be able to grasp the weight of what I’m saying, but maybe he’ll understand my apology later in life?

Tldr; I used to take out bottled up anger on my younger brother and lectured him for things he can’t help, such as his learning disability or poor communication skills. We’re tight now and have a healthy relationship, but I was wondering how I could possibly apologize or mend my mistakes.",17Dec2019,1

This person means an extraordinary amount to me, and I really value their friendship. We spend a lot of time together since we do the same major, and she has helped me through a lot of issues that I have had. However, she never comes to me with any problems and I don't think she wants to open up to me about anything. I'll often notice that things are off, but she'll go to other people instead of me.

Also, I've observed that some of the time I'll notice her online on messaging apps, but she won't respond to messages that I sent hours ago on the same apps. I've never confronted her about this because I understand that she has her reasons and I don't want to cause any stress for her, but it often makes me feel unwanted and ignored when this happens, especially when I know she's talking to our mutual friends instead. It's gotten to the point where I'll actually feel angry when I open the app to see that my message has been left on delivered for 4 hours but she was messaging someone else ten minutes ago. 

How should I deal with this? I don't want to make her feel like I don't want her to talk to other people, and my worst fear is messing up what we have.

So, my partner's family built a 5 apartment building. One for each one of the next generation. One is my partner, the other one is my partner's brother, and the rest are for my partners cousins.
It was a terrible idea (as you might already thought).
The 3 of the cousins moved first. They have been around for 2 years. A year ago me and my partner moved in. My partner's brother didn't yet.

My partner's family got absolutly destroyed in discussions of money and properties because of this damn building.
So, when we moved in, the 3 of them (cousins) decided to make our lives a living hell. First, they texted us for every single thing they didn't agree. Silly things like where do we park or whatever. Really annoying with no real purpose.
Then, it started to scale. They started theatening us. Things like if we don't go live elsewhere there is going to be trouble or so.
A time after, I decided to make a barbacue in the buildings common grill (on the roof) for my birthday. It all went fine until one of them came and started screaming at us and our guests. It was really awkard and we asked her politely to leave. An hour later she came back and started hitting my partner.
After that, we decided to go to the police and file a complaint. They took it (after a lot of paperwork and studies), but justice system in my country (Argentina) is really neglecting and we know it won't go nowhere.

So, a few months later (with the same level of theats in between) we announced that we were going to use the grill this weekend. One of them told us that if we wanted to use it we are going to have to fight for it.

I have really no more ideas to deal with this in a non-violent way.

Recently my girlfriend broke news to me that she believes she was raped after a night out. She went to a house party and blacked out and awoke naked in a stranger's bed.

She told me this and I immediately did not believe her, I asked her to leave my house and broke up with her. I then downloaded a dating app out of sheer anger that I assumed she slept with someone else and pinned the blame on being raped. We talked and worked things out but I forgot about the dating app and she discovered this. Things haven't gone well so far and now it doesn't look like we will continue to be together. 

A bit of context as to why I thought she was lying was that she lied to me about where she was that night she lied that she was home and wasnt at the party. A year ago she drunkenly kissed another boy as to which I forgave her for. Trust was still being rebuilt with her and as soon as I heard she woke up in a bed naked I blanked all possibilities that she was forced upon and jumped to a conclusion that I should never have jumped to. 

I have hated myself every single day for the past 3 weeks and cry constantly. I hate myself for my actions and I deserve every single thing that is thrown at me.

**Before I type any of this out, I'd like to say that my explaining is the worst so please do ask questions about things if I don't make sense. That's an issue I face. Thanks for understanding :D**

So some context:

For over the years I've been wanting to be an Animator, Actress, Writer/Author or ICT technician. The reasons for this is of movies and TV shows I have watched over the years. This animation interest started around 5 years ago, when I was 11. (I'm 16 now). When I was in school, I had chosen Art, ICT and Design and Technology to study as my main subjects in GCSE. I thought they'd help me with my future goals. Which they are. I'm not discussing what I got in my GCSE's but needless to say I got into College.

I'm currently studying Art and Design in college so I could persue my interest in animation, but a reacent problem has been is that I've started to want to become an actress. No idea why, maybe because of my recent interest in marvel and being a fan of Thomas Sanders haha. Anyway, I've been wanting to study this, but right now I'm halfway in my course and I don't want to drop out now. I'm also scared of going down this acting path because I didn't take Performing Arts/Drama in my old school, so if I went to uni, I doubt I'd be accepted since I don't have any background with that stuff. 

My friend has told me that she wants to help me achieve my goal of becoming an actress, but the problem is that I fade between of wanting to become an animator and an actress at the same time. It's a little annoying. I'm also scared of my art skills, that they may not be good enough, I've been wanting to do hand drawn animation, but it doesn't seem good enough, I give up really easily with it. I've been trying to learn to animate, turn characters, perspective. It's really frustrating. 

I honestly don't know what to do. If anyone has been in the situation, please let me know how you got through it and what you think I should do. I don't know what steps to take to become an actress.

926,"First of all, sorry if bad english, I'm from Uzbekistan.

I only made this account to talk about this issue. I'm not gonna talk about anything else.

I got married with my wife (let's call her Talia) nearly 15 years ago. We had a kid who I'll name Bill. I always worked hard for my family, doing extra hours to earn enough money so my wife and kid could have enough. As time passed, my sexual life with my wife went down and down, up to a point when we stopped having sex. At first it was a bit frustating, but I always loved Talia and so I thought that, as long as she was happy, everything would be fine.

Our little boy grew and grew, becoming a big guy (he's 6'6 with 14 years). We never saw him flirting with any girls, and even thought he could be gay. Let me explain that last thing:

I don't really have a problem with that, my parents educated me not judge people for those thing; but my wife was raised at a more conservative home. For me it wouldn't be a problem having a gay son, but Talia wasn't happy with the idea.

So one day, my wife decided to talk with Bill. I came home of work and see that they were happy, chit chatting about everything and nothing. That night the dinner was really good, and they were clearly joyful. At that point i suspected nothing.

Days kept passing, and I saw Talia and Bill getting better at each other. But one day I came home earlier and saw my son masturbating with my wife's panties. I said nothing, but later that night I spoke to Talia, and she didn't seem too mad about it. A few days later, my son started getting more and more angry with me; if I did something he wouldn't like, he got really upset. If I didn't let him money, he'd hit me. But the worst part was seeing my wife cheering him anytime he behaved like that.

At those days, Talia started showing me porn videos of couples having cuckhold sex, or real families having incest sex, and asking me my opinion. I didn't feel good with the idea, and made my wife to know it. But she kept showing me those videos day after day, after I told her I didn't want to know anything about it. After that, my family spent some days together out of the house without me, ""going to sport training"" or just ""buying"". I didn't want to suspect nothing, but one night it all ended exploding on my face.

I came to my house only to find my wife naked and my son at her side. They had decided they were about to cuck me, and Bill had sex with Talia in front of me. I said nothing (was speechles) but it was literally hell for me. Since then, they have sex everyday in front of me, getting angry if I try to get out of the room and throwing stuff at me.

Honestly, I'm getting more and more tired of this situation. Now I work and earn money for a family that doesn't treat me with respect, and I'm starting to hate them. I'm thinking about getting the divorce, I can't stand working near 10 hours each day only to find my son fucking my wife.",17Dec2019,1

I am gay and my family has always been incredibly homophobic but as long, but as I didn’t talk about anything to do with myself, we got along smoothly.  Things changed four years ago I met a girl, a year later were engaged and then married a year after that.  In this time, I had taken a break from my homophobic family and worked on my mental state.  Realizing that they were toxic and controlling, and that for my relationship I needed some space and therapy.  We had twins 9 months ago and although it has been incredibly awkward and difficult, we have been working rebuilding a relations since they have been born.

I’m not comfortable lying but we came to an agreement that they will tell the older kids and the younger ones we will answer any questions honestly as they come.

929,"I sincerely had no idea in which subreddit to post this, but what I know is that I really need advice. 

Anyway, this is probably going to be a long story.

I'm a girl and I have always had a really big passion for science, so when I first got into social media I used it mainly in order to discuss ''sciency'' stuff I couldn't discuss with my parents. 

So, I was following this guys account, we will call him Bob.

Bob had an account commited to science, he was an adolescent, and as far as I know he hadn't posted almost anything personal.

While I was following Bob, way before we started talking, he suddently disappeared, maybe for a year, or maybe for half a year, but what I remember is that his account went inactive for a really long period of time. 

Then, he suddently returned, and thats when I learned that meanwhile, he had been diagnosed with Aspergers and attempted suicide twice, but now, as he claimed, he had never been happier before. (He basically posted a really long text on his story explaining to his followers why he had been inactive).

Of course I didnt start talking to him solely because I felt sorry, I don't remember exactly how it all started, but it surely wasn't immediatly after his ''confession'', this talking steadily escalated into a friendship and we started using Whats app to communicate. Lately we had been communicating almost daily and besides a small ''explaining'' of his autism, he never mentioned anything regarding his mental health.

Yesterday, even tho we were talking fine the day before, he sent me a suicide note/message, telling me that by the time I will be reading this he will already have killed himself or be about to, he told me that our talking was one of the things that sparked some joy in his life -and some other stuff which there's no need to mention- . 

By the time I was reading this message, already half an hour had passed, but I couldn't stand the feeling of doing nothing to save him, I felt that since he had achieved happiness before theres was this chance he could do it again and furthermore, on personal level I really cared and thought that he deserved to live, even though it had been clear he didn't want to.

I contacted cyber security and told them everything I knew about him, screenshoted the message he sent me and shared some important personal information I knew about him.

I can't stop thinking about this, I'm devastated, I feel like his suicide attempt has impacted the way I view life and  everything. Yesterday, after contacting cs I had to go on an English class, thinking I was ok and I wouldn't start crying (again), and it hit me in the middle of the lesson. How do I get over this? I still don't know whether he is alive or dead and I can't stop reading the last message he sent me. He told me that if he never sends me again he is dead, but he could still be in hospital (?). Or maybe, if I had seen the message earlier I could have stopped him? In no case do I blame myself, but these questions are torturing me and I can't stop thinking them again and again.

I know there's worse in life, I know people commit suicide all the time and I know I couldn't have done much to stop this, but this was a real shock for me and knowing that I'm most probably the only person he confessed his suicide to makes me want to cry my eyes out.",17Dec2019,1
931,"This might seem a little petty and I know Ive gone on tangents on this sub before but I really just need someone to talk too.  I dont really like the idea of spouting out my problems on the internet but I have no where else to turn too. Ive never trusted anyone enough to say this so I guess reddit is the place to be? 

Im 18 years old and graduated highschool last spring, and ever since freshman year Ive been in a rut. I was born with a genetic heart mutation which led me to be tested and operated on every so often through my childhood. I never thought much of it since it was a part of my life ever since the very start. However when puberty hit I had existential realizations every day which led me to become delusional about the things I loved. For instance, I was always a huge fan of sports and Ive been actively engaged in skiing (which gets fairly competitive) but Ive always had a limited capability due to my condition, I always wanted to be better and work hard to archive a goal but things beyond my control are the deciding factor when it comes to sports. I had to watch every single one of my team mates surpass me with just as much effort as I gave to try and keep up with them. The sport I used to love that helped me forget about my daily problems but it ended up  just fuelling my depression, telling myself that Im not good enough or no one cares how hard I try so why does it matter?

On the other hand highschool was a mess for me as I never felt like I fit in, I was too afraid to be myself and that resulted in me being very anti-social, increasing the paranoia and delusion of people being against me. This just helped pile on the negative thoughts that came along with the sports. So in grade 10 was when I realized I was really sad deep inside and that made a big change for me since I had to put in effort to my education and sports while having no goals or ambitions to work for. Then grade 11 came along and I had to undergo my biggest heart surgery yet which fucked up my whole life. I was suicidal for most of the year and I ended up turning to drugs for a way to escape my daily struggles. Although it was the right choice at the time to get high instead of hanging myself, I still regret intoxicating myself that often because it once again made me so delusional that I lost track of my purpose. Because of this my grades dropped my goals in sports plummeted and my friends couldn't understand where I was coming from. I never felt so alone. Grade 12 came along and I stayed sober most of the year, sports were the same, I had missed so much school in grade 11 that trying to catch up was a brutal anxiety cloud following me around. I then had a stroke in the middle of the year and for some reason it didn't faze me at all, everyone was worried for me but it seemed like nothing to me since I had already been through a lot.

Anyways, after gradutaion I decided to take a gap year to focus on upgrading classes, work and skiing. None of that happened, Im almost 5 months into my gap year and Ive done nothing, I dropped out of upgrading thinking I could focus on sports more but that hasn't done shit. To  make things better my dad was diagnosed with cancer over the summer and although I love him and care about him its hard to emotionally support him when Im in dire need of it myself. Im still ranked the slowest in Canadan in my sport, im not having fun competing anymore, I wasted money for an upgrading class i ended up dropping, i sit at home and play games, listen to music and drown myself in solitude to forget about the pain and negative thoughts. I try talking to girls but none of them seem to stick around for long enough for it to matter so i end up just getting hurt every time. I regret all the things ive done since grade 10. My friends have all moved on to better things, getting a prestigious education and boast about it when im sitting here on my ass wallowing about how shitty my life is. I want to get up and change my everything but it sounds a lot easier said than done, I dont need a reality check, ive had plenty, i just need some motivation to do something with my life because i keep telling myself im fine and im doing to be ok but in all honestly i keep digging myself in a pit of darkness and negative thoughts.

I only have one friend i can trust but since hes left for uni we never talk anymore and rarely see each other, were disconnected and i have no one to turn too for comfort or advice. At this point Im wondering where will I go, I live every day spontaneously waiting for something else to happen, I think this plays a part in my condition since im was always used to a medical emergency occurring every year. Ive lost every feeling, I dont know how to love anymore, I only find happiness when Im alone daydreaming about what my life would be without this sack of horse shit I carry along with me. Im not as sad as I once was but its a struggle to get up every day. I know it sounds like a lot of self pitty and im very grateful for the things I have but the problem is that the things i want i cant seem to get. Im not smart enough for a prestigious education and because of my problems in high school I have to pay the price now. Because of my physical health I cant turn to sports. I try and talk to people about this but no one seems to understand the struggle i go through every day, they just say it will workout eventually and lifes full o ups and downs, but ive been down for a good four years now... I fill this empty hole in my heart with meaningless friendships, relationships and memes. Where do I go? I feel like i have nothing left to look forward too as i keep losing what i try to obtain.

However, I'm 19, I'm a virgin and I've never had a serious relationship. Girls just don't like me I think, as I never get girls coming up to me asking me for my snapchat, number etc. Now, I'm not a misogynist but I do have a distaste for girls, mainly because of their behavior and how they have changed many aspects of dating and stuff like that. I guess I also don't like them because they clearly don't like me (because I'm still a virgin) so then I feel like I have to dislike them. 

It's a loop, a cycle and I'm just losing out. It's depressing. So how do I fix my mindset and become a better, healthier person?

938,"So i found this out saturday night, got home from work and was told to sit down and that she had something for me. two positive pregnancy tests are shoved into my hand.  No part of me was filled with joy or excitement, just pure dread and fear.  I do not want this right now at all, maybe in a few years sure and with her of course but not right now.  i just finished my third semester of college and she just finished her first.  she's even said that all she can think is that this is bad and it's the worst timing possible.  I love my girlfriend and honestly i couldnt think of a better partner or potential mother for children but i'm so fucking scared and frustrated about this.

she has made it abundantly clear that abortion is not on the table.  i'm trying to be positive but i just feel sick when i think about it.  i'm going to sound like an asshole but i feel like i have no choice in this matter that is going to affect me for the whole rest of my life.  she's had 3 previous abortions when she was in active addiction (we're both in recovery she has 3 years i have 2.5) and said that she couldn't get pregnant so she stopped taking her birth control (she said that we had a conversation about it but i don't remember ever discussing it).  

I own up to busting in her but i feel that at this point she has complete control over my life.

I'm trying to find acceptance and positivity in this situation but i do not want this right now at all, this is not what i want to do with my life in this moment. friends are telling me i'll find gratitude once the kid is here but i'm worried i won't feel that at all. i don't want my life to get harder than it needs to be right now and i'm really starting to resent my girlfriend for making a decision that doesn't just affect her.  i feel that i'm thinking logically and long term right now because neither of us are very financially established for this and that she's living in the world of emotions.

939,"I’m 20 years old (F), and for as long as I can remember, my mom has been there, whether I asked for her to be or not. She has always tried to make decisions for me, decide who I should and shouldn’t be friends with, and on top of that- she always has to protect me and feed me things like advice because she fucked up her life when she was young. 

Just to offer up some examples- my father is an alcoholic and despite hating her life while she was with him, she chose to stay for us kids (older brother, 28). Now that we’re older, she keeps reliving this cycle and we both tell her it’s time to leave and that staying was not worth it for us. To which she responds with how she only did it for us, because she loves us, and how rude and disrespectful we are as children for someone who “did everything for us and sacrificed everything just for us”. 

To make matters worse- I moved 2,800 miles away for college only to have her AND my father move 5 miles down the road. And she then started calling me 10 times a day (no joke) telling me how much she misses me and all of this. This just confirmed my feelings of how co-dependent she really is. This situation also frustrates me because not only did she bring all of her baggage over here, but she brought all of the problems with her from home, so it’s like nothing changed for me. 

Recently, my parents ended up getting divorced, which I thought would help fix almost if not all of the issues. But instead, nothing changed. She is still massively involved in his life for some reason, and uses me as a tool to get to him and find things out, and even has the audacity to ask me to ask him to pay for things. The tipping point was today, when she asked if I could use my dads credit card for the vet bill. I said no, and she then proceeded to text both my dad and I in a group chat, saying that he needs to pick up some responsibility. After living through this manipulation and control that I face on an almost every day basis, I’m done. And of course I’ve said this in the past, but I’m really done. It’s almost 2020, I’m almost 21, and I’m not willing to have this ruin me anymore. I’m ready to start moving forward with relationships with people, and I feel unprepared and not ready because I don’t have boundaries in one of the most important areas of my life. 

I know I should’ve done this a long time ago, but i honestly just have been manipulated into thinking that if I don’t talk to my mom, or show my love, that something bad was going to happen. I guess I’m scared of her. I know I shouldn’t answer her phone call, but she has shown up to my house or gone to all of these extreme measures just so I can. I have been to therapy for her, but we have never gone together as she feels there are no issues. Where do I go from here? I know I have nothing to be scared of, but I just am so lost on how to even begin... 

TLDR; controlling mother has infiltrated every aspect of my life, from telling me who my friends should be to even moving 2,800 miles to be close to me while I go to college. After many hardships, like her showing up to my house if I don’t call her back or asking for money from my father who she just divorced, I am wanting to create boundaries, but trying to do that with someone who doesn’t see an issue.

She comes from an abusive family and generally has low confidence already. Now with being somewhat close to being overweight, she says she's ashamed and thinks she's ugly. She has explicitly said she'd never find someone else ugly but she does think that about herself and it really pains me to see her do that.

945,"Hi,

I'd like to enroll in an MA programme in my country (or abroad, doesn't really matter as long as the quality is good enough) and the programme I'm aiming for is so specific that only three universities offer it. One of them sets a minimum GPA requirement of 2.5/4.0 and while another one has no requirement at all, the third one is a private university, which means I'll either have to pay the tuition fee or find a scholarship. 

So, the best one in terms of quality of education seems to be the one with the minimum requirement.  The problem is my GPA is 2.40 ... I got all the other official test scores for a master's admission. But it's been 3 years since I graduated, so I'm looking for ways to enter that programme and aiming high I'm pretty confident I'll be able to pass it with high scores. 

I'm also determined not to do the same mistakes I'd done in the past and really work through the studies.

953,"We have had this cat, Mr. Pringles, for about 6 years now. We’d estimate him at no older than 10 years old. He is one of six indoor pets. We have four dogs and one other cat. The other cat, Charlie, has never had an issue with using the litter box properly. Pringles loves to snuggle, nap, and piss on everything. Laundry, dog beds, open suitcases, anything left out for him to squat on. 

My mother’s theory is that Pringles is an asshole and nothing and no one can stop him from this bad bathroom habit.

My father’s theory is that if Pringles was an only child and didn’t have to jump over a baby gate (have to block it off to keep the dogs out, but both cats can jump over easily) to get to the litter boxes, he would not pee everywhere. 

Does anyone have any experience with getting their cats not to pee outside the litter box? Would Mr. Pringles be happier as an only kitty?

955," 

First of all, thank you! if you actually read all this.

So there was this guy (who I have now like for a pathetically long time) who within the first few months of meeting him had given me two nicknames and roasted me like he did with his friends who he had known for years. Anyways I asked for his phone number, but genuinely not cause I was into him, but because I considered us possibly? friends. He made up some thinly veiled excuse, and I was like okay he's not interested in me. Then there was some rumor that he was interested in some girl, and I already overheard him say that he wasn't interested in her but then he directly calls my name and says ""I'm not interested in her anymore"" when I didn't even ask. When he got a girlfriend he didn't talk to me for a week or two which I was okay with but then the day after he broke up with her he becomes extremely talkative with me again. I initially didn't know why until some started to talk about it in class and he hushed them while staring right at me. Then after 6 or so months of knowing him he also shared little things with me and always sat next to me. (In fact he once told a girl to get up and move to the back of the class so he could sit in the seat next to mine.) And even if he was far away he would always say ""bless you"" and pick up something I dropped.

The next year he ""rAnDomLy"" added one of my close camp friends on IG (who literally lives in another state) and according to my friend all they did was talk about me. He got another girlfriend blah blah this year but nothing really eventful happened.

Next year he gets ANOTHER girlfriend (3rd or 4th one at this point in time). We're definitely not as close this year and we barely have any classes together but every time I was late or absent, he would show up to my next class and either stick his head in or wave to me. And even once when there was this guy talking to me (not flirtatiously or anything everyone knew the dude had a gf) he ran over and third-wheeled the conversation. I never considered him a friend that much cause despite how much we talked he always had a strong negative reaction to me getting his social media/contact. Which would make me back off, but the more I backed off the more he would talk to me and the more he would press on. I tried not talking to him for two months to try and get over him but then he ""accidentally"" bumped into me and he had a conversation with me in the hallway for 5 minutes and then held the door open for me until I came back from the bathroom.

Anyways it's been 4 years since, I've only seen him 2-3 times and all I did was avoid making eye contact, but for some reason I can't stop thinking about them. He constantly told me how smart/talented I was, and was always very concerned about me. I never ""went for it"" because A. he's literally always in a relationship (he's been in 7 in the 7 years I've known him) and B. I've always though he was so far out my league.

I'd appreciate any advice, Thanks in advance!",17Dec2019,1
956,"Take a screenshot, save this post.  I warned the intelligence community in the United States before flight 370 disappeared. One of many cover-ups by LE in the United States


If the World wants to know what happened to flight 370, they need to investigate the United States of America ,  specifically the State of Hawaii. 

 In 2012/13(?)  My local law enforcement tried to have my wife deported as retaliation. I previously gave intel that resulted in this same police station, taking out a methamphetamine importers house. I reported it to Homeland Security of the United States. Homeland Security told me they don't care, if my wife gets deported.

In 2012/13 (?) I reported a fake FBI agent to Homeland Security 

In 2012/13 (?)  Homeland Security threatened to file an harassment complaint with the local police department if I continued to give intel to him.

In 2013 (?) I was accused of knowing Edward Snowden by Homeland Security 

In 2013  I warned law enforcement of a suspicious person, shortly before a state harbor master died under suspicious circumstances. This man’s death was publicly classified a suicide by our criminal intelligence. Police never took a written statement from me.

2014, I  warned law enforcement about 2 weeks before flight 370 disappeared.

2015/16 (?) I informed law enforcement of a person who threatened to shoot me with a stolen firearm. Law enforcement did nothing. This stolen firearm belonged to the United States Government.  

2019 I informed LE i was going public, nobody told me, I can’t. 


I’ve had other communications with LE.

I’m now going public, because Homeland Security and my local law enforcement covered up this intel (and more), while basically calling me a liar. Wether they paid a financial reward to a fictitious person, I don’t know.

 I do know, I was never paid a financial reward, nor did I sign a non-disclosure agreement.

I won’t be answering any questions publicly. I will cooperate when asked by the right person.
I’ve also left a digital trail in the wild that is easily findable

**The update:**

I would first like to say thank you to those who commented yesterday and eased my self-doubt and feelings about myself.  I realized after reading the comments that I am not being the shittiest person ever, and I am being treated unfairly.

This will be long, I'm sorry.

Anyways, I went home after work yesterday and discussed things with my boyfriend and it was nice to vent and discuss the what-ifs.  I ended up falling asleep early because I worked for 12.5 hours yesterday and was extremely tired.  I have no doubts about moving still.

I went to work as usual this morning when my mom texted me and said we need to discuss things when I get home. We ended up talking over text because I am at work and never know how late I'm going to be.  This is how it went:

**My mom:** We had a commitment when we bought this place to stay for a few years.  You are bailing and it's not even a year.  I don't want to live with strangers its not fair to me or your best friend.  I can't sell with no equity.  So either I file a bankruptcy and foreclose which will effect your credit for years or you're going to have to pay your share until I can do it on my own.  I don't think your best friend will stay she is deeply hurt.  

**Me:** The only other option is that I end my relationship and stay then.

**My mom:** Why would you end it?

**Me:** I don't see how long distance for 5 years is going to work, because I will not have money to do visits. (Note: my boyfriend's job is a 5 year contract)

**My mom:** It's not for 5 years it's for a year and a half.  You can pay your part but you're going to lose your best friend.  You made a commitment when we bought this place we said we would be in it for a few years then we would discuss buying each other out or staying.  It hasn't even been a year.  I can't pay your part so if I fall behind I will go under and that will effect you too.  If your best friend leaves I'm okay with living with one stranger but I'm not okay if you leave too and I have to live with two strangers.  I wouldn't do that to you either.  I will try to find someone for one room but I'm not living with two people I don't know. 

**Me:** I have given plenty of notice about my plans are and have viable solutions.  I own half of the house so I should be able to rent out my room.  I don't want you to have to sell the house and renting out my room is a viable option. I am trying to get my affairs in order before I leave and I'm trying to do it in the nicest way possible, and I don't think it's fair that you are making this extremely difficult for me because you don't want to have a roommate.  If I died, you would have to get a roommate. I'm not dying, but I am trying to live my life and do something about the fact that I am completely stuck financially and educationally.  I am not going to be able to pay my student loans when the time comes, even if they are adjusted to my income.  Yes, I am moving back home mostly for my boyfriend, but I think you are both forgetting that he moved here for me with nothing.  You both know he is great and treats me well and that I am extremely happy with him, until you found out I was willing to move to make it work.  Yes, we haven't been dating long, but I've been friends with him for 10 years.  Both of you wanted to live with guys who you didn't know and were dating for less time than us.  I don't think it's fair to throw that in my face, when I was supportive of both of you for doing the same exact thing.  I don't want to have a strained relationship with you, but forcing me to stay here or making my life harder when I move isn't going to do any good.  I also understand that I am hurting my relationship with my best friend and you because I made a commitment, but once again if the situation was reversed I would be supportive because that is what people you love do.  

**My mom:** I'm not trying to punish you, I'm trying to get you to honor your commitment.  I would never leave you guys.  I can't sell that's the biggest problem, we owe more than it's worth right now.  Your best friend gave up everything to come out here with you and now you are leaving.  She will most likely leave too.  We bought this place for you guys.  I do not want to live with two strangers.  I wouldn't do that to you.  I can live with one stranger but not two.  Your best friend is so hurt right now she might leave too.  I want you to postpone moving for 3 years until I can handle the mortgage by myself and your best friend can establish more of a life out here.  Your best friend is probably leaving in the next month because you hurt her so bad.  Maybe just stay another year?

**Me:** I don't understand why renting our the rooms is bad.  The only option that will make you and my best friend happy is if I stay here, and my relationship will probably end.

**My mom:**  I don't want your relationship to end, but I am not going to live with two roommates I don't know.  

**Me:** I don't understand your logic.  

**My** **mom:** I'm trying to compromise by giving you a year.  Would you be okay if your best friend and I left and you had to live with strangers?

**Me:** Yeah that would be okay with me if you were improving your lives or trying to be with someone you love.

**My mom:** Then you can find replacements.  I took money out so you guys could have a place for your dogs.  All I'm asking for is more time.  If you can't give me that or find someone to take your place then I'm going bankrupt and your credit will be hurt for 10 years.  I don't know what to do.  I guess both of you can go.  I'll figure it out.  Go enjoy your life and hopefully your best friend will find happiness too.  I'm done finding a solution for this.  I can do it for 2 years I'll just work two full time jobs.  Just make sure everything that is yours is gone and you fix the window and screen (idk why she said this).  I'm sorry this ended the way it did.

I really don't know how to please everyone and I just feel like I've tried everything to make it work and I'm not getting anywhere.

I tried explaining to my friends, which in turn explained to her, why I am avoiding her. Now I get a email which seems super insincere saying she's sorry, but it was only one or two sentences. Like I know you don't wanna write a essay, but at least look like you care. 

Anyhow I'm not sure what I should respond with. I'm afraid that if I tell her I don't wanna be friends anymore that she'll talk more crap about me to my friends and paint me as the one to be shamed. But I don't want to be friends with her again either.

968,"Hello

I joined a company 6 months ago and  2 of the main people in the office have handed in their notice . Shortly after they handed in their notice I was given a lot of their work as they said “I am more experienced “ than others in the office . My workload has almost doubled . Others in the office have been given smaller tasks but nothing that is as time consuming as I have been given .
Through one of the new tasks I’ve been given I discovered that the other two people in the office (same job titles) are paid a significant amount more than myself . They have been with the company no more than two years . From one side I was happy with the salary I negotiated as it was more than my previous job (I was denied a slightly higher salary at interview stage and we met in the middle) but from the other side I believe I have the most experience in the office and have been told that in appraisals . So I don’t understand why I am not paid the same as the others. I don’t know if they can legally pay me less for the same job? I also have had no financial incentive for the extra tasks I have been given (which I wasn’t too bothered about as I am learning new things and gaining experience) but now I am feeling resentful that I am not paid fairly and I am not sure whether to speak to my boss’s replacement (who just started and has a lot to deal with) or just get on with it?

986,"Long story short...I’ve (28F) been working in the journalism industry for about six years, mostly newspaper. I’ve been picked up by AP and have six awards for my storytelling. I also have a background in radio and communications. Anyway, my newspaper cut some people for budget, including me. So I decided to give TV a shot. 

Since September 2018, I’ve been working at a local tv news station as a producer. We went through a lot, it’s a revolving door here. We got a new boss and things aren’t going well.

I applied to be executive producer last winter and my boss told me despite my experience, education, and integrity, my personality wasn’t a fit. Instead, he promoted my coworker who has a degree in sports medicine and went to school in Ohio. Side note - he favors a lot of people in Ohio and has been hiring out of there. We’re in the west coast. 

Funny thing is one of our executive producers applied to be his assistant and she was told the same thing: despite experience, she wasn’t selected because of her personality. 

My boss hasn’t really hired within since then. I’ve tried for the same position again, got turned down again. I just applied to be a multimedia journalist and I got turned down again because he thinks I can’t handle video editing. I could learn in a week. I showed him my demo reel and he said a lot of positive things about it. He said he wants to help me get into that direction but I just don’t believe him; he said that to me last time and no matter how much I do, nothing progresses. 

I feel like I’m at a complete dead-end and I’m beginning to grow tired of my career...I’m good at producing but it’s not what I want to do. 

He also has a habit of stringing people along - he promised another co worker she could have the reporter position when it opens, but now he’s hiring outside of the company. 

Apparently I’m not the only one that feels this way from what I’ve heard. 

I’m stuck in a Sinclair contract for two more years and would like to leave since this isn’t for me.

Should I stick around for the paycheck and not worry about opportunities since there are none in this company? Or should I move forward and quit?

987,"This may be a bit long, but I want to give a bit of a back story..

So 1 year ago, I decided to move states to be with my partner, it was a sudden move and did shock my family.
My partner is a Wedding Videographer, so due to the nature of his work(being booked out a year or more in advance), it wasn’t a possibility for him to move states at the time. 

This year I joined my partners business as a Wedding Photographer, I absolutely love my job and find it extremely rewarding, and I love the fact that I get to spend a fair bit of time with my partner now. 

I have felt this extreme sense of guilt from moving away from my family(mainly my mum), she didn’t say goodbye to me the day I left, she was too much of a mess and was too emotional. 

She keeps saying how much she misses me etc, I haven’t really had this from other family members, they were supportive towards the move. 
So anyway, I’ve been thinking lately about the possibility of me and my partner moving states in the next year to be closer to family, my partner is totally supportive of the move and says that he is happy to do it. 
The only dilemma is that we would need to have booked a full years work before we move to ensure we have income, and we would still need to live 2 hours away from my family, we would need to live near the major city as that is where we would be booking most of our work. 
I’m finding it hard to make a decision as to whether to move or not, because if we don’t book enough, we’d have to get another job as well, which we both are certain we don’t want to do(and our work can be quiet demanding at times). 

I also don’t know if it is worth moving states for family. Growing up I wouldn’t say that my family was close. My mum is quiet narcissistic and has taken no real interest in my life, she only acts interested if I mention going out partying or drinking alcohol. In all honesty my mum is the main reason I’m considering moving back. I have visited my mum twice this year and she has taken no interest in what I am doing. She just talks about herself and drinking all the time, she hasn’t asked one thing about how I’ve been going(my partner has noticed this about her as well). It’s almost like she doesn’t care about me, but she just tries to keep guilting me? 

I’m also considering going back to school to study film , and I’d feel like I’m putting that on hold, as the degree that I want to do is not offered at the University near where my family lives(they live in a more rural area). 
I absolutely love where I live now, and there’s so many opportunities, and our business is sort of on the line here if we don’t manage to successfully book the next year. 

I’m kind of at a cross roads here, I just don’t know what to do. There’s a lot more to the story, but I figured I’d say the main parts. My main concern is that I’d move back and my mum would just make no effort to see me. I’ve tried calling her on the phone a few times this year and she just says that her favourite tv show is on and can’t talk. So I eventually gave up, it just feels like a mind fuck. 

I’m considering just asking if she’ll accept a compromise, like if I come to visit her a few times a year, I honestly don’t know if she’s drive to see me if I lived 2 hours away. 

I know family is important and I’m trying to meet her in the middle, but she just has put no effort in. 
She is my mum at the end of the day and does have good qualities, but I can’t help but feeling manipulated, her actions have not been implying that she misses me.",17Dec2019,1

995," 

So essentially, I'm moving. I have several friends at my current school, but it took me 6 months to make them initially. When I move away I wanted to do online school since it was easier, I didn't have to get up early, didn't have to worry about social aspects, etc. The problem is that apparently I'm not able to enroll in an online school until march or so. I thought I might as well wait until then, but nope. Apparently I have to be enrolled in a school before I can get into an online school. This means I have to go to the new school until I can enroll online. I was planning on finding a job asap, then saving up for later, but now I have to end up going back to school. With the area I'm going to be living in though, I'm relatively far from school, so if I did get a weekday job, I would end up with only about an hour of free time a day, which would kill me. I'm asking to see if anyone has any idea how I can get around this. Whether it be getting into online school early, or waiting until March while being out of school legally. It's already the second semester, so if I enroll in another school I'll be missing a lot.

Apparently my mom says we can't just enroll in the school late in the year and just go for like 2 days, as it's illegal, so please if anyone knows a way around this tell me.",17Dec2019,1
996,"[TL;DR my coworker doesn't trust my abilities at work and, after confiding in her a year ago about recovering from a panic disorder, she will often bring up my anxiety unprompted and try reading my mood/ use it against me during her lectures.]


A few days ago my senior coworker and I were dealing with a rush of customers in the store. This coworker has a habit of getting pretty worked up and resorts to micromanaging the entire opporation even for something as totally inconsiquential as how specifically we should toss unwanted recepts.

I was getting a bit fed up about the way she was tailing me and I asked her to please calm down.

""It's okay. We both got this."" I said in an encouraging tone.

At which point she stopped pestering me for a bit. When the crowd died down however she pulled me aside and started lecturing me.

""Don't ever tell me to calm down again. I have been working this job for five years and I was basically forced to take on the role of manager and train other employees far too early. That's just how I run the show now so you have to stop taking it so personally.""

me: ""I understand... I just want you to know that you can trust me to do my job.""

""I hope you realize that (employee x) has worked here far longer than you have. You can't do what she can do and I still have to train you on so much."" 

It's worth noting that I'm the ""newest"" regular employee there as of six months ago but I've been working there over the rushes for the past two years already. I'm trained enough to be able to train my own batch of new hires as I have done before.

Despite this fact, and being trusted by the other employees in the store (including employee X), she will follow my every move and try training me on things I've long since made habitual.

Even today she commented that she didn't want to go to the bathroom for fear of leaving me alone. There was NOTHING I was untrained about that needed supervision and if the store got busy in those three minutes all I had to do was call another coworker over from another part of the store to hop on a register. It was not a big deal.

The worst part is, while she was lecturing me, she started bringing up my anxiety and pointing it out as the reason I take everything personally.

""I know you get anxious and I know you are so sensitive about how other people act around you but you can't take it so personally. This is a work environment.""

This is really hurtful because about a year ago I confided in her about my anxiety after I had a panic attack at work. Since then I've been working hard to get better. At this point, after not having an attack in ten months, I just want to go to work and forget about my anxiety. I want to show myself I can do my job well.

It therefore doesn't help when she brings it up unpompted. If anything I find that to be far less professional and a breach of trust. I was just really caught off guard by her pointing out my anxiety.
(plus by bringing up something so personal she is the one who made it personal)

 I know I can't hope to vouche for myself but I'm really a pretty chill person now. In fact I have a tendancy to *under*react to precieved slights. 

Despite this If I do even the most innocent thing like rub my eye out of boredom she'll stare at me with wide-eyed concern. When I look back at her and ask her why she's staring, she'll respond,""I thought you were crying.""

or if I seem to be in any mood other than super happy she'll lean in and ask what's wrong and if I need a moment. She acts like she can read my mind at every moment, and it's frustrating when she is so entirely off-base.

 another example is when one of our coworkers came to work feeling bad about something. she seemed upset but I didn't for a second think she was mad at me. a long time ago I might have questioned it but I've since gotten good at separating myself from other people. 
suddenly my coworker comes up to me and says,

""Oh btw, so-and-so isn't mad at you. She's upset about [explains situation].""

O... kay? I didn't show any indecation that it bothered me so what is her deal bring it up like that?

My other coworkers see how she treats me too and agrees that she's totally out of line. They say she has a superiority complex and none of them like working with her because of it.

I've tried talking to her about it but she often just steam rolls the converstaion with what I've already mentioned here.
(i.e. stop taking it personally, I'm basically a manager so shut it.)

I'm so frustrated. I just have no idea how to handle this situation. Should I try harder to confront her? Should I write her a note? Should I bring HR into it? should I just ignore it?",17Dec2019,1

1000,"I've never had anyone break into any house I've lived in nor have I ever lived in a bad part of town, I've always lived in a peaceful middle class area. 


I guess it started when I was in middle school, I was watching TV and suddenly an overwhelming sense of dread washed over me. I went to the kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife I could find, and sat watching a window. My mom came down and found the knife and I know I freaked her out. To this day I'm not sure what happened, I've never felt that level of fear since. 


I don't dream often, but whenever I do, it's almost always the exact same recurring nightmare of someone trying to break into my house. They're outside and they're close to getting in. I always wake up in fear before they do, but it is a recurring nightmare that's been going on for years. 

I bought a house a couple of years ago and wouldn't leave it except for runs to the grocery store until the security system was installed. Even though I didn't have anything of value in the house until my stuff got moved over. 

I never leave the security system unarmed even when I'm in the house except for when I'm leaving or returning. 

Tonight (and why I'm writing this post) my doorbell rang and I looked outside and nobody was there. I looked around from inside my door, security system still armed and went to the back door to make sure nobody was in my back yard. After that I told my Alexa to run a routine I made for emergency situations which cuts off all my lights and the TV. I retreated to my bedroom, grabbed my handgun and watched outside my window and on my camera that's in my living room. After a few minutes I put the gun away and checked each room of the house (including my closet which is impossible for someone to get to without me knowing). 




I'm not sure why I have this paranoia but does anyone have any advice on how to overcome it, or how to stop my recurring nightmare?",17Dec2019,1

What I'm saying is, are there studies or information to a more systematic approach to growth?

Also, 'taking it easy' won't cut it, I've tried but I can't help it, I'm always immeresed in life and the continuous seek of growth. So might as well try to find some data on a more detailed step-by-step growth guide.

We chat on discord a lot and occasionally play games together when there's something we're both interested in. We've become good friends and talk often. We've never met in person, but we voice chat and have become close. Sometime earlier this year she lost her job, and moved in with a friend. She's been in a really bad place, has health issues, and has struggled to find work. She asked me for money a few months ago. I sent her ~$900 to help her out. She has casually brought up if she could move in with me a few times, but I've always said I don't think it was a good idea.

It's seriously a tough situation, I really enjoy being friends with her / playing games and want that to continue. I care about her. She confessed to me that she was suicidal recently. That she has tried to kill herself but couldn't carry it out or failed at doing so. I've researched what to say to someone who is suicidal and I am trying my best :( asking open ended questions and trying to be there to listen to her.

1026,"TLDR at the end. This post is loaded with my mental health issues and shortcomings but the BPD and mental health subs I posted in have not received much attention so I am posting here seeking any and all advice possible. 

I am now in the first serious relationship I’ve been in where I disclosed to my SO I have Borderline Personality Disorder and also the first where I even knew I had it. This has been good for me because with my knowledge of splitting and triggers leading up to splitting, I have much more of a grip on handling hardships than I did in previous relationships. 

So, things have been alright. I work full time as a receptionist while attending college full time after my 40 hour work week. It is a lot on my plate, but I have been managing time decently. Or so I thought. 

I’m usually with my SO 24/7 but since I was trying to be the “laid back cool gf” version of myself - I let him have the weekend to himself to watch football and have quality guy time, while I went to stay at my buddies place. (He is a gay male with unfortunate drug addiction issues and one of my very best friends.) 

I thought I would use this time away from my boyfriend to study at my friends house. He gave me an adderall to focus on my studies, and I thought this was a good idea. What ended up happening was the anxiety of taking a methamphetamine forced me to consume various Benzos just to feel level. I am not proud of this. I was still so anxious that even though I was wired from just a sliver of this adderall that I could not bring myself to even open up my laptop and do any work. I was so filled with dread and anxiety and still am. I missed deadlines for finals even though up until this week I had maintained straight A’s. Instead of doing my hw, I had some sort of manic episode and emailed a former friend (who I pushed away with my BPD episodes) - and completely over shared and humiliated myself. I also spent all night masturbating and engaging in all around really weird behavior once I was left alone. 

To make matters worse, because I was so anxious and couldn’t sleep, when I finally drifted off - I could not hear my alarm clock in the morning and woke up three hours late to work. This made me suffer an extremely debilitating panic attack. I sent wall texts to every manager in my department and went to the ER to get a doctors note out of desperation not to be fired. I am so humiliated this has happened to me. 

As I said above I don’t have healthcare so I was unable to obtain any kind of anxiety medication. I also don’t want to be dependent on xanax again, but they seem to be the only medicine that works for me when I’m in this state. The doctor wrote me a note saying I had a GI bug and could be back to work tomorrow. I begged him to give me one more day off as I knew my gastrointestinal issues were anxiety induced and would not wear off by tomorrow. They implied if I made the visit about my mental health they would have to admit me and cannot take me out of work for just having anxiety attacks. 

I am now at my boyfriends waiting for him to get home and feel extremely numb. I cannot bring myself to open up my laptop even though I have past due assignments that need to be completed immediately. I can tell I am dissociating and no longer feel the desire to work or attend school or put effort into life at all. I feel like a zombie. 

At the end of the day I know drugs, stimulants especially, are not helping my BPD. I am really depressed now and don’t want to do anything. I feel like a complete failure. I have no motivation. I can’t go back to work tomorrow. 

TLDR; I self sabotaged by taking drugs to help me survive finals week which ended up destroying my finals week and could possibly have lost me my job and the stable mental health I had been sustaining up until now.

Please don’t judge too harshly, advice needed.",17Dec2019,1

She dropped a few hints that she was interested in me, with the biggest one being a text where she said ""Talking to you makes me want to be better. I think that's a good quality in a relationship"". So I took that as a sign that she wanted to be in a relationship. 

Anyway, Saturday night I took her out on our first ""date"" even though we've hung out plenty of times before. It was awesome and we both really enjoyed ourselves. Come Sunday I'm sitting next to her in church and I lay my hand on the seat as a sort of invitation to hold hands. After a few minutes she picked up a song book and acted really invested in it. The rest of church, she kind of gave me the cold shoulder. 

I realized what happened that night and texted her asking if I made her feel uncomfortable. She replied that she did feel a bit uncomfortable and I apologized. She said it's ok and it just felt a bit quick after only one date and I said it's fine and I agree. 

Anyway, it's only been two days since then but I just feel really off, like this could effect our relationship together and she might not want to go out again because of it. We have class tonight and I'm not really sure what to say to her. What I feel like I should do is act like it was no big deal for me and let it pass so things between us can go back to normal. Or would it be better to directly address this with her tonight?

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Dec2019,1

1030,"My uncle and his kid (age 13) moved into my dads house with him. The kid hasn’t been in school for months because his father just doesn’t care and always says he’ll get around to enrolling him but never does.

Yesterday, my dad talks to my uncle about it and convinced him to finally enroll his kid in our local public school. This plan lasted all of 20 minutes until he asked his kid if that’s what he wants. Of course he said he’d rather stay home and play video games all day. He’s 13. His father thinks he knows what’s best for him and agreed that they’ll just figure it out later and maybe consider online school.

The thing is...the kid is a delinquent. He got suspended from his last public school several times, got caught selling weed, got caught stealing, I caught him blatantly picking on my cats with a water gun, he has the worst speech impediment imaginable and now his education came to a halt at 7th grade because his father is incompetent.

I called DCFS and apparently education neglect no longer falls under their umbrella. I don’t know what to do. Any advice?",17Dec2019,1
1031,"Lately it’s been almost impossible for me to do even simple things. All I’ve been doing the past week is sitting on the couch/my bed and doing nothing. I hate it, it feels like my life is pointless and I’m bored out of my mind. I’ve been having trouble even brushing my teeth, hair, and showering and stuff. Even eating meals feels like a huge task. I haven’t been able to exercise, do any of the hobbies I used to enjoy, or even leave the house much. 

I just want to be able to be motivated enough to get these things done, as well as chores and stuff. Just to preference I am diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue syndrome, which I know is a part of it but it seems even worse than normal. It’s not like I want to sit around all day, it’s the complete opposite. 

I’d like to be able to exercise normally, eat regularly, socialize, take care of my pets, do my chores, create art, read, write, go outside, get ready in the mornings, etc. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Dec2019,1
1032,"Some facts about current job:
* Decent job with big name
* Really decent salary. A bit higher than average for this position at the market.
* My best friend referred me for this job
* Almost 1 year atm
* Big changes coming soon. New project, raise, potentially raise to higher position. But in salary max +15-20%
* Soon annual bonus (max 60-70% monthly salary)
* Last month was a total nightmare. I'm so bored. I'm doing my best to find motivation just to work. But big changes is the only hope.
* I feel I have big potential to grow in this company.

Recently I was offered for interview for a job with:
* Fesh technologies, fresh projects. 
* 2X my current salary, which is insane. 
* Crazy annual bonuses of 6x month salary.

I'm thinking about changing job, but I feel like I would betray my friend. I'm pretty asocial and changing job will be a bit stressful. Also, I'm currently trying to save some money to buy apartment. Please, help me to decide. What you think? Would you change job?",17Dec2019,1
1033,"I’m a guy and 5’4 and all the stuff I’ve looked at online say you stop growing mostly at 16 and will only grow an inch or two after 16, I don’t want to be short so any advice helps because vitamins and milk are doing nothing",17Dec2019,1
1034,"Ok so I'll try and keep it short, I've liked this girl for about 3 1/2 years, we've dated before but things ended and we stayed friends and it's not weird like most ex girlfriend/boyfriend things are, we laugh and talk about random stuff we're actually friends and it's all good I've basically just accepted the fact that I'll probably always like her for as long as I know her. I have a girlfriend right now and she's super sweet and funny and kind and just all the good stuff that you'd want in a person. I'm attracted to her and I love her, I know that for sure but I also know that I've been attracted to and maybe loved this other girl for 3 1/2 years so I'm like :0 I don't think I love her or I at least suppress any feelings I have for her to the point I don't think about it to much. I'm in high school and I feel like I'm fairly mature but this is one of thoes things that I can't tell anyone to ask advice and Im not sure if this is normal? or should I do something? or change something? I feel very guilty about it sometimes and sometimes I just tell myself it's a constant thing in my life and there's nothing I can do. I've been trying to get therapy for like 3 months but my mom is an expert procrastinator and it's been epic to not have an adult to ask for guidance for the past 5 months I've been with my girlfriend about this.",17Dec2019,1
1035,"so for some background, i currently got a job screen printing garments, i’ve been here for around 2 months and at first it was going well. but lately my immediate supervisor, who is also the only screen printer other than me has been acting really irritated towards me.

every time i make a mistake she acts extremely annoyed and always tends to talk to me in a condescending tone as if im incompetent, any time i ask her for help i feel like im being a pest to her, i thinks shes actually a really cool person and we share a lot in common, and i feel as if we could be friends. the way shes has been treating me lately though has really been affecting me and my work ethic.

ive been tending to overthink absolutely everything i do due to the fact that im worried shes going to get pissed at me if i make a mistake, in turn making me make even more mistakes because i over analyze everything i do. i don’t know what to do at this point, i don’t know whether i should talk to our supervisor or have a conversation with her face to face. its really been affecting my well-being and i just wanna be treated with some common decency and respect.

i truly enjoy the job itself and i want to stay here and progress, but the way i’ve been getting treated is making me second guess my options. what would you guys suggest doing if you were in my position? all help is extremely appreciated",17Dec2019,1

1037,"I’m an adult f. My mother is the republican woman who cries while trying to convince you to vote for Trump, and posts strongly opinionated republican Facebook posts (several times) daily.  
She asked my son if I’m a liberal today. It came up because this morning my son asked me about North Korea’s “Christmas Gift”, and I read him some information. Well, one of those sources was CNN...which my mom discovered in casual conversation by asking my son where I heard this news because she hasn’t heard this. She immediately asked him if I’m a liberal because I read an article from CNN. 
Anyway, I’m tired of listening to her, and this isn’t the first time she’s pestered my son. She asked him if he was a liberal when he was only 4 years old! 
Should I tell her? Everyone on that side of my family is republican. I honestly can imagine each and everyone of them making visits/interactions into a nightmare.  At least as it is now, I can avoid the conversations by not joining in.",17Dec2019,1
1038,"So I’m taking organic chemistry I and we took a practice exam prior to the real final. The practice is optional and can actually replace the final grade if you did better on it than the real final. I was sitting next to a person i don’t really know, friendly with them... starts conversation here and there but no means of being friends or even have their number. I’ve sat next to them before during an exam, and really only ever talked because of the fact we’re both taking the same classes and what we want to do with our major.

A professor in the department who isn’t my organic chem professor or the one who proctored our exam emailed me saying we both are under the suspicion of cheating on an all multiple choice 60 question exam, due to the identical nature of the exam. This was a huge shock to me only because i finished the exam earlier than the person next to me and even knew the person i handed my exam to (one of the proctors, a tutor who knows I’m a good student). I sat in the front also in front of the proctors and took a whole 1 and 45 on the test which is a total of 2 hours. I didn’t cheat but i also don’t think the person next to me would either, theyre a very smart student based on what I’ve heard from the conversations we have and are doing fairly well in school... so I’m very confused on what to do because I’ve had an incident where i had an academic dishonesty problem where two semesters ago a person and i switched exams accidentally but didn’t realize so the real grade wasn’t actually put into the system, thus making it seem suspicious but in all honesty it was a huge mistake that i didn’t even intentionally mean to happen. I was given a warning and it’s not on my transcript but i think i can be seen if I’m accused for another academic dishonesty.... which i think i might be because of this new issue but i shouldn’t be. What do i do? Please help... im having really bad anxiety and still have tests to take for finals the next following days.

I am meeting with the professor tomorrow to talk about what the situation entails but i really don’t know what else to say except that I’m not guilty. I’m just nervous it’ll affect my grade if we both state not guilty and they take this action further with the provost even though i didn’t commit the act, I’m still involved with an academic dishonesty situation.",17Dec2019,1
1039,"So yeah, there is a girl in my class - I was sitting on a row and she was just on the row in front of me, there was also an overdue assignment and I didn’t do it.. hell, i didn’t know which one, anyways this girl just turns around and shows me which one it is and even tells me to type my number so she can send the solution on What’s App (the university is pretty strict about copying assignments and talking in class) . I did the assignment and gave it to the T.A and that’s that. Ever since I had her number we barely even have eye contact or chat. Most of our chats are “how’s the rest of the subjects” or “good luck on your next exam” - today I saw her looking at me more than once in class  - I was also passing by her other class (one we aren’t together in) and I wasn’t looking at anyone but I noticed someone looking at me. You guessed it. It was her. I don’t like this girl, and I don’t hate her so I figured it was time to make a move. I texted her for 10 mins normally (what’s good, how’s your GPA, blah blah blah) then I asked her “What was she doing next weekend” and she replied “ Family, why” I didn’t reply instantly - I replied 4 minutes later I think, just to find out that she blocked me hahahaha.
I honestly don’t care about her, but I do care about the reason of why she would block me, the way I see it : is that either she was shy or during those 4 minutes anxiety got her or something - maybe she doesn’t chat to boys - hahahaha I’m pretty confident but that was rare and never happened to me before, at least not before I make my move. 
Long post I know, but thanks for reading!",17Dec2019,1
1040,"My boyfriend is currently jobless, with no money, because he spends a majority of it on weed for him and his friends .. he just recently got off probation for selling weed and now that he’s off, and got off easy, he’s all about smoking. I can’t stand it, i think it smells gross, and trust me when i say he’s only smoking it to fit in with his friends. and I mean the kid literally reeks .. his clothes, his bed, his room, i can’t leave his house without smelling like i just smoked .. we’re supposed to be saving for an apartment .. and he’s spending every cent on marijuana &amp; there’s nothing making up for it, cuz again he doesn’t have a job, i don’t know how to convince him to stop, he knows i don’t like it, i’ve voiced my opinion on it, but he doesn’t care. It bothers me a lot but i dont wanna be controlling and tell him to stop, if it’s something he wants to do, but it’s also something i can’t stand and don’t really want to live with.. How do i get him to see things how i see them?",17Dec2019,1
1041,"This guy is... Really confusing. I told him I liked him a while ago, he turned me down twice. Fine, I didn't push it any further because I wanna respect his wishes. But we spend almost all of our free time together just us. We're a couple without the sex. He's my rock and I'm his. All my friends say we act like a couple and we even cuddle a lot of the time. I'm trying my hardest to respect his wishes and put my feelings to the side but it's so hard. I'm only happy when I'm with him and depressed if not. I think I'm in love with him or very emotionally attached. 

I wish feelings didn't exist because I want to stay best friend with him because I have so much fun with him. It seems unfair that he treats me as a girlfriend though. 

I always feel like he has feelings for me too from every single signal he gives but I've learned to not listen to any of them. I'm extremely anxious about the whole situation and now he wants me to live with him next year (in separate rooms ofc but not like we haven't slept in the same bed before) 

I'm just so unsure what to do about this I've never met anyone as confusing as him. I don't know. Any advice?",17Dec2019,1
1042,So there is this girl I like a lot and we have been talking over call a lot more recently. Like yesterday we had a 7 hour phone call. So I really like her but I don’t have the guts to ask her out. What should I do?,17Dec2019,1
1043,I (17 f) am almost always spending time alone (which I don’t necessarily mind because I’m introverted). But I’ve found when I do need that social gratification I just go online and talk to slightly older men ( between ages 18-25). I develop friendships with them but they usually end after 1-3 months and then I find a new one. It’s almost like a necessity for me to have someone to talk to.,17Dec2019,1
