2,"Firstly, for context I'm in the UK and I'm using a throw away account because obvious reasons.

I was with my ex till a few months ago, we've had a somewhat rocky relationship that slowly deteriorated for a few reasons but in part because she's become increasingly paranoid. We have a six year old daughter and because of that (combined with the fact, were both struggling financially) we decided to carry on living together.

We've had a rough 3-4 years, we've found out that my father (who I was a carer for) was a pedophile, we've had a miscarriage, her father and step father were both accused of being pedophiles (although I don't know how true it is since her step-father is dead and she cut contact with her father after he was accused although I don't believe she was abused by either.) and my estranged (psychologically abusive) mother died under suspicious circumstances which led to a long coroners court case.

Each event seemed to weaken my ex's mental health and increase her social isolation, social anxiety and paranoia.

recently she has said she now suspects I've sexually abused my daughter because a couple of times after I've looked after her she's apparently had sore private parts and because of this she'll make sure I'm never alone with my daughter again. She says she's fine with supervised contact because she only suspects and isn't completely sure.

Once I heard this I talked about moving out joint custody because frankly I don't want to be around this level of crazy. She basically told me know and that she would put her suspicions to the court/mediator if I tried for anything more that supervised contact.

For better or worse I don't think she's lying or being intentionally malicious with her suspicion I think she's just well and truly lost grip on reality.

At this point I'm at a loss for what to do. 

If I stay living with my ex I'm going to be watched like a hawk for any ""evidence"" by my delusional ex who at this point I loathe to be in the same room as.

If I leave and fight for custody I'm going to struggle to pay for rent and food never mind legal bills as my name gets falsely dragged though the mud and I can't stand the thought of how traumatic it will be for my daughter to go through that. All with no guarantee that I'll end up with anything more than supervised contact anyway.

Of course that still leaves the third option of leaving and not fighting my ex on this and only having supervised visits with my daughter (either overseen by my ex or preferably a neutral 3rd party) which would mean her growing up with me barely in her life (an option I cannot stand).

At this point I feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle. What the hell do I do? Is there an option I'm not seeing? Every option I can see, either leaves me trapped, my daughter dealing with a situation that is massively unfair on her or both.

Honestly at this point I'm just lost, I don't have anyone I feel I can trust to talk to about this. The only person I feel like I could normally trust with serious issues is my aunt but since this is a child abuse accusation I'm afraid that if I tell anyone the stigma of a false claim will haunt me for the rest of my life.",23Nov2019,1
4,"So I have a friend (lets call him David). David likes to mock people, also if it is for his benefit. I just had a night out with him and honestly, I am not sure if I can deal with him. I've got 3 years where I have to be in the same class as him, and I honestly dont know if I can take it. He's problematic, likes to talk smack and never really listens to anyones opinion. I almost feel like he is manipulating people to get his way. We share the same sense of humor and we've been friends for almost 7-8 years now, which makes it difficult to just ""ditch"" him. It's gotten worse as time passed and I honestly dont know what to do in this situation. 

I obvously have other friends and I feel like they all are much more positive and more reliable. I've heard people talk alot of negative stuff about him, which I totally understand and is also something that I have dealt with several times. 

He has threatened to meet up at my house at like 1 AM, when everyone is sleeping. I honestly don't know what to do from here. 

This might sound as if I am going on a rant because I am a little tipsy, but this is something I have dealt with for a while now and I just need to talk to someone about it - potentially some advice.",23Nov2019,1
5,"So me and my bffs are a trio. But recently they have been hanging out at each others houses because they live in the same neighborhood but I live across some major roads meaning its dangerous to go over there without a car (none of us can drive yet). And I have told them how much it bothers me that they hangout without me there but they're both like ""well we hangout with you without the other one"" and yes that has happened but not as often as they are without me. I mean it's to the point that they hung out with some other friends on Halloween without me because ""you werent in the group chat (they all have iPhones and I have samsung) and we forgot"".

They try to make an effort to include me, like we have a big dance and they basically forced me to go to the dinner they were planning before hand. But it still really stings that they keep ""forgetting""",23Nov2019,1
6,"Hey just like a few opinions on this recent development - I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 months now - I love everything about her in every way, inside and out - that being said...she’s recently decided that she would like get lip filler 1ml - I know that I love her for the inside and the outside of what she looks like shouldn’t change my opinion which it won’t - but I love the way she is with her naturally beautiful lips and when I go to kiss her after her having this treatment it won’t feel like her lips?

8,"Hey guys, new to posting stuff, also on mobile so soz if formatting and general speech is sub-par. So this one goes back to about a year ago (although it could’ve been earlier), so brace yourselves! 

Since I moved to a new area, I’ve always been really close to this one group of people. I would consider them my best friends from about year 8 to 10, and we had our issues as all friends do, but we always stuck together. That was, until about a year ago.

One member of the group (let’s call him jake) had moved to a different school, so obviously contact lessened but the group still remained intact and strong as ever. When I turned 15 years old, however, after I had a (seemingly) chill night with said group, where we went to the cinema and then took to sparring in the yard (I was a newly-started boxer and wanted to prove my skills, and they were all happy to prove me wrong). Over the next few months I started to notice that Jake had stopped responding to my texts and our meet-ups as a group pretty much stopped happening. For about a year I was confused as to what I’d done wrong, however eventually I came to realise that it was me being too cocky with my boxing (not surprising). So the months went on since then, and I noted that Jake and the others would meet up without extending me an invitation, even though all our problems were apparently solved, I felt like I had been exiled from my group of friends, and am lucky enough to have an amazing gf who’s been there with me through all of this. 

They all now barely send me any messages and try to keep our chats brief, and even at school they have all these inside jokes I’m unaware of and I just feel really left out…

Another note is that these aren’t my only friends per se, but they are the ones who’ve been there through thick and thin and now suddenly vanished

My question is should I confront them on it and try to fix it or are the friendships beyond saving, or is there some unknown third option that will solve everything…

Thanks to everyone who read this far and any advice would be very much appreciated :)",23Nov2019,1
9,"Hi guys sorry if this is not the right sub.

I (22F) recently completed an over-the-phone health information interview for life insurance. I’m totally healthy, no alcohol use, no drugs or anything. The agent asked about any doctor’s appointments and prescribed medicines over the past few years. In 2018 I had a minor infection that I took antibiotics for. It cleared up after the medicine and hadn’t been an issue since. I told this to the agent on the phone. The problem is, I TOTALLY forgot that I actually went back to that doctor a couple months later for a follow up and did a second round of antibiotics. 

My dad says it’s not a big deal and I don’t have to do anything, but I’m panicking a little. The agent took down the name and contact info of the doctor I went to so what if they follow up with the doctor and think I lied? Am I going to get in trouble? Will this mess with my insurance?

10,"I just got my permit and I am just now learning how to drive. I am 22 years old. I put off learning how to drive for a while due to anxiety. But I am trying to get over my fear and learn because not being able to drive is a huge burden.

I live in America and most people drive Automatics. I am taking private driving lessons at a driving school. The lessons are 45 minutes long. I just finished my third lesson. We've been driving through empty parking lots, in residential neighborhoods, and on the road. We have been practicing right turns, left turns, etc.

I'm still not very confident behind the wheel and I make a couple of mistakes here and there. However, my instructor tells me I am doing pretty good.

He told me most of his students need 6-8 lessons to be test ready. I don't feel no where near test ready and I feel like I need a lot more than 6-8 lessons.

11,"So backstory we got together in February 2018 now I had a few worrying issues when we first got together due to me getting cheated on in my previous relationship. But he was super understanding and helped me get through it. Things were going great until September 2018 when I found out he’d been smoking weed daily and hadn’t told me at all. 
Now it wasn’t the fact he’d smoked weed that upset me it was how I never knew because when I first met him he was against it so I was a bit shocked at the sudden change and finally understood why he had no money all the time. However I got over this and things were going good again.
Then I changed my birth control pill and it made me a complete bitch basically and unfortunately he had to deal with it the most due to him seeing me a lot. This led to us going on a break because he couldn’t deal with it. However the break only lasted about 3 or 4 days. 
I ended up changing birth control pills again so the moodiness went and things went great until a few weeks after our one year anniversary in February 2019 when I found out through a friend that my boyfriend had been doing md for over a month and hadn’t told me. Again I was shocked because he used to be against stuff like this. I was really upset that he’d hidden things again so when I called him and confronted him I got mad because he’d hidden something from me and he put the phone down on me and then got mad at me. I forgave him however things got really rough after this I was constantly stressed whenever he’d go out in case he hid something again and he got annoyed of me struggling to trust him. This led to him breaking up with me however he then said the next day he regretted breaking up and wanted to give it another go. 
I managed to get over my trust issues and things were going great again but a lot of my friends weren’t keen on him after this happened and neither was my family. 
Fast forward to leading up to me ending things we went out with my family for my  birthday meal in September and the whole time he was on his phone. I got mad at him once we got home and then he got mad at me saying I shouldn’t get mad at him for anything because we should talk about the problem rather than getting mad. I kept feeling like I could never discuss anything with him because he was quite cocky and would always flip it and make it my fault. 
And then the final straw for me was when I saw on snapchat that he decided to drive around the streets despite him having no driving licence and had only had 4 driving lessons. I got mad because he could’ve killed someone or even himself and then he lied to me saying he had only drove on quiet roads however on the Snapchat I could clearly see the road and it’s known as a very busy road in my town.
We didn’t speak for a whole day because of this and he never even apologised until I said to him that he’d not apologised. So I felt like he was too immature for me and ended things.

He came round my house the day after I broke up with him and it was horrible he wouldn’t stop crying and was begging for another chance. I explained how I felt like I could never talk to him about stuff and he said to me he’d change and work on things but I told him it was too late. 

It’s been a month now since we broke up and I still can’t stop thinking about him. Part of me thinks if we both communicated better maybe we would still be together. I really don’t know what to do. I know he still has feelings for me he told me the other day when he messaged me that he’d still love to have another chance. But I can’t decide what to do all my friends and family think I need to move on but I feel like i won’t find anyone that will love me as much as he did.",23Nov2019,1
12,"So, I'm dating an actor, and I've been to a bunch of his shows where he has a love interest, kisses them, hugs them. Whatever, it doesn't make me jealous and I understand it's just acting. About three months ago, he had a depressive episode, and started avoiding me for about two weeks, and admitted to gaining an interest on this other actor. He never cheated on me, but he was romantically interested in her, and would constantly avoid me to go talk to her or go out of his way to be in her company. We've talked it out, and he said he's over it. 

However, recently he has gotten a role that requires him to do a LOT of kissing, and even a (fake) sex scene. This honestly makes me uncomfortable, and a bit insecure that he could either catch feelings or he is seeing it as him living out his fantasy with her. I don't want to tell him not to do the role, but it just has me very uneasy. Should I tell him I'm very uncomfortable and feel insecure about it? I dont want to ruin this show, but I don't know if I have the mentality to know, and potentially watch it multiple times (I'm in the crew). I dont know if I should say anything just to let him know or.... please help",23Nov2019,1

14,So I met this girl last year and we somehow got together to study. We studied for one exam for a few months but I just realized it isn't productive to study with her. Now whenever we do a test she sits next to me so we can be the same group and she sends me messages to send her my zipped file(we study programming) and she doesn't even change anything. So in the last one I just sent her some parts of the code. She doesn't even know how to type that and where. I felt so awful after that last exam I wanted to slap her. All I can think about is the next exam and how she'll just sit next to me and do the same. It's not good for me just to think about how I'll avoid it. What do I do?,23Nov2019,1
15,"Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still picked on, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job while with my parents (my peers had successful beginnings to their careers at this point, and I was so ashamed of myself). I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible).

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area(not as big as NYC or la, but still crowded), so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic.",23Nov2019,1
16,I just want to go in a efficient way. I don't wish to explain my situation as to not bother anyone. Thank you for your time.,23Nov2019,1
17,"Heads up, this post is going to be very long. I don't know why I'm posting this but it's probably because I feel a bit down about myself at this current moment and would love some advice! Plus I'm new to Reddit so forgive me if I don't know the rules of posting.

I'm a 21 year old Male college student who does not have the greatest of self confidence. At times I feel like I'm two different people. On one hand I can be an extremely chatty, confident person who has no problem talking to women and being what I believe is the best version of myself. On the other hand, I can be a sad, self loathing man who constantly believes that nothing in life is going right and blame my problems on other people who I believe are better than me.

I write this because of something that happened last night. I was at my friends house party before we were meant to be going clubbing and I got chatting to a girl who is 21. This girl is friend's with another girl in our friend group (although I do not know the girls in this group as well as my other male friends). I was talking to her for a good bit at the house and was enjoying chatting to her. This girl was incredibly gorgeous and I thought to myself that I was slightly going out of my league. I held her hand for a little bit and thought to myself that I was going to get with her but the minute we stepped outside the house my confidence began to hit rock bottom. I became very nervous because I started planting the seeds of self-doubt  in my head, believing that getting with her was going to be a race. 

We ended up going to a pub and I tried to get her by herself as she was with all of her friends and I was by myself as none of my friends were in the pub. I saw her talking to other men and this started to make me anxious. I asked her out for a cigarette (not my intention as I don't smoke) but when we got outside I just lost the confidence that I had back in the house. I started to believe that she wasn't interested so my genius brain told me it would be a good idea to try one of her friends as she had been giving me some looks. Of course the friend was not interested and I ended up leaving the pub feeling incredibly embarrassed. I felt awful because I didn't want these girls thinking I was some sort of player because that is the furthest from the type of person that I am and they are all a lovely group of people.

This incident of course opened up the Pandora's box that has been opened many times for me when situations like this happen. I started telling myself how stupid I was because I couldn't get with a girl who I thought was really good looking. I'm pretty sure she knows that I tried her friend (I don't actually have confirmation but of course the friend would have told her because that's what friends do) I should mention I also got her Snapchat off her and I gave her a text. I apologised about acting like a fool but I didn't mention me trying her friend in case she didn't know (very wrong of me to assume that because I'm just insulting her intelligence and she's not stupid). She said I didn't do anything stupid and she was the one who was drunk and we were just making light of last night. I left it there and just engaged in some casual conversation with her but she has been slow responding (an obvious red flag) I am not interested in a relationship with her but for some reason I still feel the need to to text her because some small part of me believes that I might have a chance with her if I just text her. 

But this whole incident only makes me start to self loathe and go back into a dark place. I start telling myself that I'm an idiot who can't get girls. 
I get depressed about my general history with girls. I've been with a good few girls but I've only ever had one relationship which wasn't serious. One girl who I was with I felt very strongly about but she didn't feel the same and this hurt me. I'm upset because I really wanted to go off with this girl from the house party but because it didn't happen I somehow tell myself that I'm a failure and a loser. I've been in college for a year and a bit and I haven't gotten with that many girls as I don't go out much. My brother has only been in college for a few months and I know he goes off with more women. This pisses me off because it only highlights how much of a sad, jealous person I am. I know this way of thinking is wrong but I want to be able to handle these types of situations and the aftermath of them better. 

I'm posting this because I would love some advice from anybody, because when I go through things like these I start to go to those dark thoughts where I basically think like an incel. I hate myself for even saying that I think like an incel because I am not and I believe anyone who is an incel is a truly disgusting individual. Would love to hear from any guys about this. Sorry for the long post!

19,"I would just like to say I have never been in a relationship before and my social skills are just above that of a biscuit, so you might want to take what I say with a pinch of salt. 

About half a year ago I met some people casually online and you could say we are now pretty good friends, messaging each other daily. I guess I started to catch feelings for one of these people and from what I could tell (which isn't worth much mind you because I can't read people for shid) it felt like it was somewhat mutual (does putting x's and o's after messages, and wanting to arrange meets mean anything?). I didn't want to push it because I thought it would be overbearing on them considering we had only met once.

Skip forward a bit and they made it abundantly clear that they found themselves someone. I had to tell them how I felt because it was eating away at me and I had to know their intentions and clear the air. When I told them they said that they 'did like me before but thought it wouldn't happen so told themselves to move on' which now sounds to me like a really awful way of saying 'no I don't' because subconsciously that gives me the idea that there's some sort of a chance. My first reaction to this was to just leave the whole situation because although I 'want to be friends',  feelings can be hard to fight when they're right there in front of you.

The trouble is I am honestly a really lonely person and I have put myself in a situation where I have literally nobody to talk to for at least another half a year. This small group of people seems to be my only social outlook for the time being and I don't want to leave it all behind and have to face the abyss of nothingness. I haven't been able to stay within the limits of being 'friends' and I say things like 'you're cute' that I really regret, because it's like I'm giving off all the signals that I'm still trying and I feel stupid and a cuck for doing it when they bring up their relationship.

I really don't want to be cynical about it as well but they send messages with 'xxxxx' and 'bby' and it just seems like sometimes they're leading me on and playing a bit of a game. They have said how they have photos of me on their phone, and I have dumb photos of them which we poke fun at each other about, but is that not weird to have pictures of another guy on your phone if you're in a relationship?

Which is worse; sticking around, and looking like an idiot and feeling like shit when I overstep the line, or removing everything and move on but really fuck myself up from loneliness and isolation?",23Nov2019,1
20,"Hi, 

Interviewed with a new company, and everything has been great. Now they're asking for references and they know a director at my first internship. I interned under the director's department, but didn't have much interaction, however, they thought well of me. My issue is my internship manager may not give me a raving review. 

Backstory:
1. this was my first internship/professional work experience in a non-diverse organization. I worked with men &amp; women, but all of the same ethnicity which I think was a contributing factor to the lack of understanding when I made a mistake (this could be something as simple as a typo and it would get looked at with a magnifying glass as a sign of me being incompetent.

2. This was also the company's first internship and so expectations weren't clear but their was clear improvement as the internship progress (exactly what an internship should do, amongst other KPIs). 

3. I wasn't exposed to ""professional etiquette"" through peers or people in my network, I learned it all on my own. By professional etiquette I mean asking for clarification on projects, asking and giving feedback, etc. I learned it all on the job, and wasn't good at this when I was a part of my first internship. 

I have other references I know will give me good reviews, but I also feel it's expected for me to give my mentor from my first internship as a reference. I would really appreciate any advice/constructive feedback. 

I'm not perfect and try to learn from my mistakes.

I just end up writing my thoughts down in my notes app but I'd like someone else to read them so I guess I'm here cuz I don't know where else to go.

I've never been a heavy drinker but I've only spent two nights out of the past ten sober. I feel fine when I'm hanging around people but when I'm alone all I can do is think about her.

So every night I hit up some people and ask if they wanna go drink and ofc we're all in college so I can always find a few. We hit the bar grab some drinks, watch whatever the hell they got on tv and joke around and I feel fine. But then I wake up the next morning and it hits me like a truck all over again.

I know I have to face this sober someday but I just don't know how. I just sit here and random memories keep coming back to me. All I can think is what if I don't find anyone better for me again? Or worse what if I do and I just fuck it up again. I don't know whats wrong with me, I don't know why I can't get them to stay.

I don't know how she went from having me meet her family, then that night telling me ""I like you so much it scares me"" to ""we should breakup we're in different places in our lives"" in two fucking days. I don't know what to do",23Nov2019,1
26,"My school is having a cancer fundraiser where you can pay 5 dollars to get a haircut or a shaved head, and our math teacher is the one pushing it the most. To get you haircut you have to go up in the middle of the assembly with the whole school watching while it gets cut. I had the worst panic attack of my life while just asked a question in front of my bio class when i didn't know the answer, so i would never be able to handle going in front of over 3000 people and sitting there still for 5 minutes. Plus all of my friends who i do fencing(swordfighting sport) with would ask me why i got a haircut and i can't really handle that many people asking me questions, I'm very attached to my long hair, i look weird with short hair, and the thought of cutting my hair that short gives me a panic attack. But my teacher keeps telling everyone they need to do it, and she also specifically singled me out in front of my whole class and said my hair was perfect for it and that i need to do it. I feel like if i don't do it that would be so selfish, because other people need it. What should i do, this whole situation made me start bawling an hour ago and i still haven't stopped.",23Nov2019,1

28,"I've moved 4-5 times within the past two years (2018 &amp; 19) and I've jumped from home school to public 3 or 4 times, I'm too retarded to keep track apparently.

I made a small group of temporary friends at the first school, then swapped to home school, the I had one temp ""friend"" and had an opportunity to have my first relationship but my dumbass fucked everything up as usual, they either hate me or dont remember me, dont blame them, which is another reason why I see no point in going to public school any more.

29,"I have extreme generalized anxiety disorder anyways, but it's heightened when I'm away from my partner. I feel scared and anxious about everything to the point of full on panic attacks. I can't stay in my house overnight if he isnt with me. Im scared being in the house without him even if he just runs to the store. When I'm at work or away from him I'm scared something is going to happen to one of us and the other one will never find out. It sounds so unrealistic but seemingly insignificant things lead to so much anxiety for me. Its hard for me to express that this is a real anxiety thing instead of just me being clingy. I trust him completely so the anxiety doesn't stem from anything like that. I generally don't know what to do because it's extremely unhealthy for me to be so dependent on him and unrealistic for us to be together 24/7. How do I get over this anxiety?",23Nov2019,1
31,"I was wondering if anyone can suggest what I can do as a college freshman (undeclared major) to push towards a career in fraud prevention? What bachelor degrees are typically required? What certificates? What can I do to get on hand training now? What can I expect? What are some great resources for information on the field and what environments could I expect to be working EX: public/private sectors?

I have had an internship with Dairy Queen HeadQuarters this past summer with their Marketing team prior to my start at college and I really do like strategic communication/Marketing as a whole but I just am a little intimidated by everything. I know I should be taking everything slowly but I think I am guaranteed an internship with the same organization that helped me get the internship but for an ad agency this summer which is why I feel cemented in Marketing as a whole. 

I am currently just finishing my generals at a community college and then transferring to a Private school in my city for my junior/senior years if not sooner, I have some PSEO classes for microecon, Management and intro to business but otherwise nothing that would prevent me from choosing a differerent major, I am just looking for similar experiences or some direction/information for fraud examiners since it sounds like a very cool career path with forensic accounting etc!

Sorry for all of the questions, currently pushing for a degree in Marketing Management/Minor in Data Analytics but I am really interested in Investigative careers and just want information from professionals like you all! Thanks again my friends sorry again for the bombardment.",23Nov2019,1
32,So I 34M joined Alcoholics anonymous recently.  I started going to get a handle on my drinking which I've been getting better at.  Well I made the classic mistake of hooking up with a 22F who is also in AA.  We had a short fling and I caught feelings.  She has had a change of heart and just wants to remain friends.  How do I continue going to AA meetings knowing she will be there and I have feelings for her while she no longer does for me?,23Nov2019,1
33,"For starters, I’m 20 about to be 21 and in my third year of college. Ive been in a slump for three semesters and every semester I start out hopeful and slowly stop going to class and fail my courses. My parents pay for my university and I know I’m disappointing them each time I fail a course. I haven’t told them and I’ve been keeping it under the radar by saving as much money as I can each semester by either dropping or enrolling in less hours. I’m tired of living this lie and I want to turn my shit around before admitting to my parents what I’m going through. 


I don’t go to class because of anxiety and doubts about the future. I’ve tried majoring in biology and computer science and neither pique my interest, but I’m not in the position to major in something that doesn’t make me money. I am pretty much an investment for my parents. They sacrificed everything for me and I feel like a failure as of late. If I don’t become independent and self sufficient I know they’ll be disappointed but supportive. That’s the worst. I don’t deserve support for messing up so badly.


That’s why I want to turn my shit around. I enroll for the spring in a few weeks, but I don’t know what direction I want to go with my education. I have no idea what career I want and I have no idea what I want to major in. Some careers sound interesting like software engineering, or medicine, law. And some majors sound interesting like psychology, philosophy. But I feel like I can’t major in those things because you don’t “make money” with those degrees. I find that i can withstand courses that aren’t interesting as long as most of the courses are interesting and make me want to learn them. For instance, I found in computer science that a lot of the courses are boring and don’t necessarily help me with being a software engineer. However, I do really like coding and learning from actually DOING something related to the career. I feel stuck. Like there’s no right choice. I want to major in something interesting but also reliable if I don’t get into the career I want right away. I want to keep my options open and not feel bottlenecked into biology —&gt; med school —-&gt; doctor. Or computer science—-&gt; maybe masters—-&gt; software engineering. Because I’m not even sure if those careers are what I want, so I don’t want to major in something that has a clear direction towards a career I’m not even certain about if that makes sense. 


At this point I just want to graduate with a respectable degree ASAP and save my parents money. Help me reddit? Do I just tell them? Do I try one last attempt at redemption? I’m lost and don’t know what to do.",23Nov2019,1

I’ve known Caroline(27F) for two years. She used to be an addict and in and out of rehab for years. She used to do heroin and drink every day of the week. She works part time and has a trust fund to support her she’s 27 years old. She started smoking weed again at first I didn’t comment but during the summer she quit her job because it was too stressful and doing nothing but smoking. I tried to show my concern then but she shifted blame saying I’m cheap about gas money and don’t know what I’m talking about. That was around my birthday and she ignored me on my birthday. 




Caroline told me she'd not going to AA anymore because it's a ”Christian cult” I just said something like talk to other people about it and see their opinion and she got all defensive and was like ”i don't need others opinions only me and my therapist make that call I've been hundreds of meetings I don't relate I'm not a real alcholic” 

I was just trying to say maybe try different meetings or see what other people think but I didn't disagree like ”oh no you need to go to meetings” because I know that's not always the answer. It's hard to know what to say because sometimes I feel crazy like ”am I being rude” because she says I'm blunt but I feel I try to be sensitive to other people 


now she's all mad and ignoring me. she drank back in July and was like ”that wasn't a relaspe”And saying stuff like she's not a real alcoholic because she didn't black out.


Idk do I sound like I was being too judgemental idk how to handle that? Why is she so mad at me? Am I being too blunt?

tl;Dr: My friend with addiction problems told me she's not going to AA anymore. I tried to discuss other options and I'm concerned cause she's been smoking weed and drank in July. She got angry at what I said and is now ignoring me.",23Nov2019,1
37,"Honestly I’m just going to cut to the chase. I have a decent amount of friends, I love them and I like being with them. But I feel like I’m everyone’s second choice or no ones go to. 

I am rarely asked to hang out by people, if I want to hang out with someone I have to go to them , and at times it’s tiring to always have to make the plans, why can’t someone else make them and invite me first for once. 
I haven’t hung out with my friends outside of school for three weeks now. 
Maybe I’m just insecure or maybe there just busy but I feel like I’m everyone’s second choice. 

Me and my friends were also planning a hang out for this upcoming Saturday, idk if we are still doing it. 
But the reason I’m making this post is because one of my friends made plans after we had agreed to hang out together. 
She apologized saying it went over her head but it hurts. 
It hurts knowing that hanging out with me was that insignificant. 

She’s not the only one who was gonna come but based on my luck there all gonna bail on me. 

I just wish I had one person that would choose me first. A person that’s my go to and I’m there go to. I’m so tired of being second choice. 

It makes me feel so lonely. 

I don’t know how to cope with these feelings though. I don’t want to tell my friends because I don’t think they’ll understand. I think they might just get mad at me.",23Nov2019,1

All of our emails that previously linked to the signed lease now only show a 404 error page. We've still been paying rent and occasionally get emails from the new company about the property, but there is no proof that we actually are renting it. One roommate moved out, and remaining roommate and I are in the middle of having someone move in to take over her portion of the lease. However, getting utilities switched over to our name is very difficult and they want several hundred dollers as a deposit because we have no proof that we live here/have already been paying utilities.
Can they just show up and evict us? Is there any way to prove to the utility companies that we've been paying bills for a year and a half so we shouldn't have to pay another deposit? What should we do in this situation?

Hey Reddit, this is my first post! since this is one of the few times something has been on my mind that I am hesitant to consult with, with those I know IRL, I figured I’d give it a shot.

So recently I started dating an unbelievably incredible guy that I’ve been crushing on since I was in highschool (I’m 21f now.) A bit about him, He is cheerful, obsessed with animals and children, intelligent, considerate, humble, reserved, has an amazing sense of humour and is impressively more self aware and mature than some men even twice his senior. To most people who know him he has been described as having the ‘X factor’ he has so many positive qualities and effortless charm that in the past well known or famous people he’s been able to meet immediately want to befriend him, as if HE were the celebrity. He is that guy that you barely know that will drive out to the middle of nowhere at 3am if you are having car problems when there’s no one else to call. He’s the guy that makes sure everyone that visits his place is fed and comfortable and has a safe way to get home. He’s the kind of guy who would rather coolly tell me how he happily accepts and expects me to receive male attention when other men flirt with me because I’m jaw-dropping beautiful rather than allow himself to display any feelings of jealousy or ever take his insecurities out on me or a third party. He has always been a natural leader and effortlessly popular throughout his life because he’s been naturally gifted with the ability to balance emotional intelligence &amp; kindness without stifling his image of being detached and ‘cool.’ He isn’t perfect by any means, but his ability to see people for what they are and still demonstrate warmth and generosity to everyone he meets is what I admire and respect him for most. He is the definition of the words integrity and humility, but he somehow manages to create lasting friendships with every personality type because he always makes a point of respecting people’s differences and looking for the best qualities in everyone. My boyfriend is the first person who’s told me he loves me and that he will continue to, despite whether or not I share his feelings. He is to me what most would call a soulmate. 

If I could describe my SO in one sentence it would be that he is somebody that makes everybody feel like somebody.

Alright now that you have a better idea of him, that he’s not your cliche drug abusing, narcissistic POS boyfriend I can confess the less than perfect traits he has.

When my SO was a young child, his father committed suicide, since he hates pity I’m one of the few people in his life who know that this is how he died. His father looks a lot like him and suffered from a cocaine addiction. I was too shocked and uncomfortable to inquire if it was an OD or due to the negative mental side effects of cocaine use, but that’s what I know thus far. 

This gives me extreme anxiety because my boyfriend enjoys experimenting with a lot of substances, he has never stolen, become violent or done anything especially heinous to acquire it but having an addictive personality, he tends to binge whatever substance he has.

When we were younger he had to attend sessions for anger management and has always been a fan of abusing substances. I’ve heard it’s common for children to also become addicted to the same drug as a parent or religiously avoid it altogether. I’ve noticed this pattern often and have seen it play out with his other siblings who refuse to touch substances due to the trauma. 

A year ago I had a girlfriend of mine try cocaine for the first time and died because it was tainted with fentanyl, her mother OD’d when she was a kid from fentanyl and the morbid poeticism has always kind of spooked me a bit, I think this awful event is what triggers my anxieties with my boyfriend. Nowadays sources are pretty unreliable and i can’t see this being a sustainable habit for very long.

I really don’t want him to look back in the future and consider me an enabler or bad influence. I have never cared about someone more and recognize that he isn’t a bad person but he is a damaged one that isn’t the type to ever admit he isn’t doing ok. Does anyone have tips of what I can do to put my worries into perspective for him in the hope he may actually listen ?

If you actually took the time to read thanks lol

46,"My first class is PE. I always put my wallet and phone in my locker so that’s never a concern, but I never open the main compartment of my backpack. When I came back from PE today, I saw that my backpack’s main compartment was wide open.

First I thought I might have opened it and forgotten, but then one of the teachers came into our locker row and told us that two people’s wallets in our row were stolen.

I checked my backpack and all of my books were there, but I never thought about my pencil pouch. When I got to my next class I realized it wasn’t there and thought that I might have left it at home or left it in another class the day before.

I checked all of my classrooms and asked all the teachers and none of them had seen the pouch. I got home and looked everywhere and it’s not anywhere. My parents helped and clearly it’s not at home.

Obviously, someone in the locker room took it, and they were probably in the same row. It’s not particularly valuable - around 5 Pilot G2 pens, a mechanical pencil, an eraser, and a little ruler with a piano on it. I don’t want it back for the money, but the pouch itself and the ruler were gifts from my aunt when I was a little girl. I have been using them for nearly 10 years now. It’s much more of a sentimental value than a monetary one.

There are around 15 people in my locker row, and I know most of them. If I asked around they would probably lie about it, so how would I get my stuff back without searching through their backpacks?",23Nov2019,1
47,"Please I'm only here because I feel like everyone doesn't want to give advice on what i should do to help rid myself of these problems.

 Okay, I'm just going to say it.

I'm pretty sure i'm slowly descending into madness. And My Anxiety, Depression, and social problems isn't helping it.

Okay, so. I asked my friends this, ""Does everyone else plans Murder sprees in there head. And Just Murder."" THey all answered with the same response. ""Yea everybody has those every once in a while."" But i was to afraid of saying that these Plans are always in my head. (I have no intention to act upon them i swear, but they just always show up.) The next day i'm on the bus to the 9th grade campus of my high school (yes, My school has 1 campus for the 9th graders made in 2004, the year i was born. And another one for the rest of the grades.) And a student got on, I'm sitting down in my seat. And he just starts hitting the back of my neck. I told him to stop, but he never did, he just told me to make him stop. So i went back to my seat. 

All i could think about was how good it would feel to just stomp on his head repeatedly.  I know these thoughts are wrong. And I should never act upon those. So Insted of doing that, I screamed My heart out, eyes wide, And shaking. I couldn't stop screaming. They all just stopped and starred at me. When I stopped. The student stopped hitting me on the neck. I was breathing heavily and everyone just continued, in silence the entire ride to school. Naturally the Bus driver reported this to the Principal. And I missed an entire class just talking to the counselor. All I said was that i had no relocation of what happened.  He let me go, and just concluded that it was a cry for attention. I was made fun of during school for what happened on the bus. 

now you could say I should just go to the counselor and say whats going on. But if you are at least smart, you would understand that that counselor is just dumb. How would that be a cry for attention If i said I had no memory of what happened on the bus. After School I just walked home insted of the bus.  

I could go to a psychiatrist, But my family is Poor. We can't afford another one ( my brother has one although there is nothing wrong with him, he's just fucking lazy). Please the above was just an explanation of my situation and my evidence of insanity.

53,"So here is what I’m faced with. I’m 30, and waited too long to do either of my two options, which realistically only leaves me time to do 1 option while I’m young but still wanting to start a family soonish. So my choice is joining the military (Canada) for a 4 year contract or getting 2 jobs to save up for a year to then move and live in Germany for a year or 2. 

Option 1, specifically would be joining the navy and I’d be stationed either in Victoria or Halifax for 4 years.

Pros:
-joining the military seems like an amazing challenge which can lead to a lifetime of experience and friendships 
-ability to travel while getting paid
-guaranteed income for 4+ years, including some tax free income 
-4 weeks holiday per year plus most stat holidays off. 

Cons:
-Victoria is an hour flight from home, halifax is on the complete other side of the country
-because I want to start a family soonish, this would delay, as I’d want to find a girl willing to move back to my home city. 
-income is low for the first 4 years (would substantially increase if I continued) 
-risk of failing any of my numerous training periods
-would lose my chance to live in Germany for that year or two 

At the end of the 4 year contract, I could either renew for another contract, or leave the military and move back home and possibly take over my uncles business which makes enough money (but I couldn’t take it over if I did more than 4 years in the navy) 

Option 2, work two jobs for about a year and save up enough cash to live in Germany for 1-2 years 

Pros:
-ability to perfect my german skills
-see friends/family throughout Germany and Czech Republic 
-fully emerge in the German culture 
-have the option to fly home as wanted for visits.
-Visas to get to Germany for long stays are easy for Canadians under 35 years old 

Cons: 

-away from family for long periods of time (similar to navy) 
-would return home having spent all that saved up money (but I still have my house and savings in Canada) 
-miss my chance to work in the navy (living abroad would mean a 6-12 month security screening after the fact which would put me at 34 before even getting in which is too long to delay family) 

After returning from Germany I would most likely take over my uncles business. 

So as you can see two completely different choices. Germany does allow 3 month visits which I could do after I’m done in the navy but I feel that’s not long enough to feel like I’ve “lived” there. 

Both would give me great stories and experiences. And every day I feel like my gut is changing it’s mind.

54,so today we had a big test in my 6th period and instead of asking for help i instead looked up the answers on my phone under my desk and the teacher caught me. i felt so humiliated because everyone in class heard me and my teacher talking plus she kinda called me out. the teacher also hated me for whatever reason that i don’t even know .. i feel so stupid and scared to go back on monday and face her. even the ppl in that class were bringing it up to me after school so i laughed it off but really i felt so guilty. it’s really unlike me to cheat tbh but ik what i did was wrong and it was a mistake but i don’t know if i can even go to that class and see what i got on it. am i over reacting? probably.,23Nov2019,1
55,"I moved ca 6hrs from home to go to college for computer science. I figured i could handle it but ive turned into an alcoholic. Drinking and smoking nearly every day. Failing pretty hard at everything except intro to programming which im decent at already before i came. 

I was doing really well before i went there. Going to the gym and lost a bunch of weight. Best ive felt in years. Even studying programming on my own eventhough ive no passion for it. Just a pay check. So ive no real passion to ""grind"" through it. Its not my passion i just dont wanna work retail or construction i guess. Or i want to make my parents feel like im not such a fucking failure. 

I felt socially isolated since i did high school online, moved in with my grandma far away and barely kept in touch with friends from school. Apart from the occasional happy birthday text. I think this was due to some weird social anxiety low self esteem thing ive since gotten better at. But still ive this overwhelming dread that i now just numb my mind with alcohol and downers.

Theres a college also in the town i grew up and i could reconnect with my old friends. But i already took 2 ""gap years"". One when i dropped out of high school half a year into it and then another when my exams werent good enough for uni. 

I dont fucking know if thats the right move but i know im not happy here either. I figured the anxiety was just the first month or so till i got used to new surroundings but its been 3 months i still feel like trash. 

2 of my best friends are also here and i dont think they quite know about the drinking. They just think im being a dramatic pussy. I feel like i have this passive nihilist deathwish since i was 15 im 21 now. Never saw a doctor or anything just shut myself off. They keep trying to get me to go out and socialize which i do but its really hard to talk to people when youre mentally in such a shit state so i drink to much hoping eventually i can just talk without making an ironic ""i wanna die and am stupid"" joke every 5 mins. But it doesnt work and i usually black out. 


Idk if i should quit and work on myself for another few months or tough it out hoping it gets better. Alcoholism runs in the family too so im slightly worried. My dad dropped out cause of drinking nd my grandfathers are/were both daily drinkers. Idk if can stop. 


Or maybe i had this fucked up plan from the start where i was just gonna fail because i didnt want to go in the first place? Idk i had a pretty decent sense of self before but that shit is shattered now. Im not sure what im doing and what i should do next. 

Well that shit went long if you bothered to read any of it give me advice i guess",23Nov2019,1
56,"A couple years ago, I (18M) went to a new years eve party for some people I knew from highschool. It's important to note that I've been diagnosed with severe social anxiety, and I very much struggle connecting with people. I tend to get panic attacks (I got one today after someone honked at me while I was walking across the road) and so in a party setting I end up drinking a lot to loosen myself up; to reduce the anxiety. I usually don't go to parties, but one of the only people I really talked to at the time was going (we'll call her Jess), and I've been texting her nearly every day for years, but almost never see them in person, on account of how inept I am in social situations. Truth be told, for the better part of highschool I had a crush on her, and I've told her how I felt, but she wanted to just stay friends. I was fine with this and respected it, because I had so few real friends that I was lucky just to have someone I could talk honestly with. I thought this party would be a good way for me to talk in person to them and practice socializing normally with a group of people I've (sort of) known for the past 4-5 years.



Of course, I had too much to drink, but was having a good time talking to people I've known, but don't usually talk to. I was slurring my words and tripping over myself, very visibly intoxicated. I saw two girls from a different highschool that I had never seen before arrive, which was a little strange considering this was a low key thing with only people from our school. Regardless, it was new years eve, the clock was ticking and it was getting close to midnight, where it's generally expected that you kiss someone, and this party was no exception. This sort of thing scares me so much that even though I was completely hammered, I could still feel a panic attack coming on. I went to the corner of the room where it was more secluded so that I could talk myself down, to try to control my emotions. I've had plenty of experience with this and so I was starting to feel better, but then I saw Jess sitting on some guy aggresively making out with him.



I'm not going to lie and say that I wasn't upset -- I was. I knew that I shouldn't be upset but when you basically talk to only one person every day for years, you tend to get overly attached to them, and it really stings when you realize that the relationship is, and will always be, one sided. I'm the kind of person that avoids confrontation at all costs, so I couldn't even think about going over there to talk to her, I just stood in the corner, drunk, panicked, and sad. That's when the girls from the other highschool came over to talk to me, seeing how sad and lonely I was. They talked to me about it for a bit, saying things like ""she doesn't deserve you"", etc.; the cookie cutter advice. I appreciated it nonetheless, and talked to them for a bit about themselves and soon found it getting to the time where my mom was wanting to pick me up. One of the girls I was talking to offered to drive me back home, so I texted my mom to not bother -- I found a ride.



I'll reiterate, I was visibly drunk, slurring my words and tripping over myself, when the girl that had offered me a ride started to drive me home. It was just her and I in the car, which looking back is strange considering she came to the party with her friend, and since she was driving, she didn't have anything to drink. I had told her when I got in the car where I lived, so I assumed that she would drive me there. We soon got to a quiet country road, and she pulled over. I was so drunk that it took a while for me to realize that we had actually pulled over to a spot completely alone. I told her that I thought she was going to drive me home, and she said that she was. There was silence for a while, and I realized that she wanted to have sex with me, but didn't want to make the first move. I'm now assuming it's because she thinks that if she doesn't make the first move, then she can freely have sex with a drunk guy, without feeling guilty. I can't remember much of what happened, I know that it took a while for me to make a move, because I really didn't want to. I felt like it was expected of me to do it, and doing otherwise would be extremely confrontational and anxiety inducing -- two things I've spent my whole life avoiding. I remember putting my hand on her leg, and then her taking it from there.



I remember that I couldn't finish, and so she stopped after a while and drove me home. I really don't know how to feel about this, I've never told anybody about it because I'm embarrased that I couldn't finish and it didn't feel like assault, but I know that I wouldn't have had sex with her if I had been sober.



I know this is a really long post, I just felt like I should get it all out there since this experience has been bothering me more and more recently. It's important to note also that since I was so drunk I couldn't remember the exact details of some things, but I made sure that everything I said is an accurate depiction of what I remember.",23Nov2019,1

59,"Ok first off, there’s this girl who seems perfect for me and I’m thinking of asking her on a date but there’s some MAJOR factors at play. One of them is that she’s had multiple abortions. apparently her ex wanted a kid and she would go off and get an abortion  after she found out she was pregnant and I was told by a person that she’s and I quote “sweet but crazy”. 

All of these things I’ve heard are from one person and that was the sister of her ex. In my eyes the situation is just totally messed up to be honest BUT this happened like 3 years ago.

It just sucks finally finding someone who seems to be a great match and actually finds me interesting and not just attractive. 

My main question is what would you guys do in my situation? I try my best to look at as a “that was a long time ago and people can change kind of scenario” but at the same time her past really haunts me. 

Any advice will be very appreciated. Thanks in advance.",23Nov2019,1

65,"About a year ago, my best friend left her husband for her first love. It was a pretty big shock to everyone. It turns out that she had been seeing the guy for about six months before she finally came to her husband and said she wanted a divorce. I am her best friend, and I had no idea. She hid it well. I think part of the reason why she didn’t tell me is because she knows that I don’t tolerate infidelity very well. I divorced my own husband three years ago because I found out he was having multiple affairs; so she knows that I probably would not have been very supportive of her actions. As the months have gone by, we have drifted apart. She’s pretty busy with the boyfriend, which is fine, I get it. “Honeymoon phase.” We’re still friends, but we don’t see each other very often anymore; maybe once a month if that, and only in social settings. She lives maybe a mile away from me. I tried to maintain our close relationship, but she is starting her new life, and I get that.
  I’ve also always been good friends with her husband. (Well, ex now.) There has never been anything remotely inappropriate between the two of us. We have always treated each other like siblings, to be honest. For about six months after they split up, I didn’t hear from him very often. I would check in every once in a while to see how he was doing, but he would keep his answers short. I respected his privacy, and left it at that. I figured if he wanted to talk about anything, he would.
 Well, after a while I started hearing from him a little more often, and here in the last month, he has spoken to me nearly every day. He told me that the reason why he didn’t talk to me very much in the beginning was because he didn’t know how close I still was with his ex-wife, and he was trying to let her know as little as possible about the going-ons  in his life. 
 Here comes the advice part.
I’ve developed a crush on him, and I am 99% sure that the feelings are mutual. Neither one of us have come out and admitted it to each other, and there are a lot of details that I don’t want to include in here because it would give identities away, but I feel pretty confident in saying that he likes me back.

This is a can of worms that should not be opened, right? Technically, I’m still friends with his ex-wife. We’re not as close as we were, but we still have our friendship history there. Plus, we live in a very tiny town where everyone knows everyone… I do worry that people would think that we had something going on all this time, and that is absolutely not the case here.",23Nov2019,1

69,"I have a neighbor who is suffering from a mental health issue, I’m not sure what it is, but the actions he displays seem like schizophrenia, although I don’t know and I do not want to ask. Any way, in the last few months he’s been coming in and out of our fenced yard and putting odd objects around. The past year he would scream and yell at people who he can see, when no one is there, in our yard. He used to carry around a large machete but two months ago my grandma found it laying by the tree in our backyard - almost like a sacrifice, she said it was lain perfectly with the grass around it stomped down and rocks in a circle around the machete - so he’s beginning to scare my mom. He’s begun to do more disgusting and plain weird things - like he has buckets of his piss and his shit around his RV that’s parked in his mother’s driveway (the house to our right, we share a large fence). 

Okay, so recently, in the last month he’s become quieter but even more creepy and kinda scary. He has a small car that’s packed to the brim with garbage that he sits in and shoots up heroin, and dozes off; he has started to park in front of our driveway entrance, causing my mom to yell and call police on him, and so far the police have only towed his car away, but his mom got it out for him and it’s parked in front of their house, extremely close to the lip of our driveway entrance, and my mom has taken to honking at him whenever she leaves, since he’s passed out in his car. Now in the last two or three weeks, he’s begun dropping large piles of powdered laundry soap around our yard and in our mailbox. We didn’t think it was him, we didn’t know what it was or how whatever the white powdered stuff was, it was all around the perimeter of our house and porch, so we were thinking it was debris from maybe styrofoam or something (not thinking it was him was mainly because his neighborhood antics and yelling up and down the street have stopped and he was getting high in his car now) but then my mom and our other neighbor caught him with a large box of powdered laundry soap dumping piles up and down the block. After the soap thing, we started to lock our driveway gate so he couldn’t get into our yard. 

This morning, I went out to get our mail and found big chunks of glass inside. It was under the mail and I cut my finger. I didn’t know what to think until I saw him shuffling down the block and went and told my mom. The only thing my granma wants to do is talk to his mother (my grandma owns the house we’re living in) and my mom wants to buy a security camera so the police will take her claims seriously, she started take pictures of the buckets and the piles of soap, still police say they can’t force him to move or force him to a mental hospital (I don’t know if that’s total bull about taking him to a hospital). We don’t know if he has done this to other neighbors besides us and our two neighbors to the left of us - they too found the soap and even a bucket of his pee in their yard - and we’re all at a loss of what to do.

We live in a very low income area, a lot of gang activity and lots of drug use, and the police don’t seem to care what goes down around here. I don’t blame them, the assholes, the mentally ill and drug addicts around here are scary and I wouldn’t come down here if I was a cop either. Also, I was wondering, actually my mom was wondering if the soap and glass thing was some sort of black magic or voodoo ritual going on? I think maybe he hears voices and does this stuff to stop them, but I’m not an expert - I suffer from bipolar disorder and kinda get the whole ritual thing to stop the thoughts.

Anyway, any sort of advice or tips would be so very much appreciated, I’m sort of the go-to person to look things up for my mom and granma and I don’t know what to do besides getting cameras or calling police.",23Nov2019,1

one event was not that long ago I hung out with some mutual friends late at night. One person in the group doesn't speak to him and are not in the best terms,  we were out until 11 pm which my friends doesn't like being out that long so we knew he wouldn't enjoy himself but the area we were out is the opposite side of his town so we didn't want to go back and forth. I ended up posting a picture of the group with the caption ""we are getting the band back together"" and he commented but didn't like, which I don't care for likes but all he commented was ""oh"" to later say on twitter ""lol band"". I would also like to mention that before that day I hung out with him 3 days in a row, one of those I ditched classes to be with him. 

Following that, we made plans to go see the new Frozen movie, that's all we have been talking about and we agreed to go si it together, he tweeted ""going to watch the new frozen show alone"" so when i saw it i knew what he was doing and i didn't really want to go along with it so i ended up making plans with an old friend. The next day he messaged on the group chat if the original group was still going to go see it to which i told him that i made plans to see it with someone else. I was going to mention his tweet, as a pretty petty move but i didn't want to start anything. An hour we tweeted on how 19 almost 20-year-olds who don't have licenses (which I a 19 almost 20 in two months don't have a license) are lazy and the only things we do is go to school half of the time. Yes I don't have a job either and only go to school but I go Mon - Thursdays from 11 to 4, I currently have two 5 page reacher papers so individual classes and math quizzes and exams to study for.  He himself isn't going to college, hasn't experienced what a college class and work is like and only works 2-3 days a week. 

I don't know what to do or say cause i really don't appreciate him saying things about me when they aren't the truth or don't make complete sense. He tweets them cause he knows ill see them and i don't know  I just think its weird to confront someone about something they tweeted cause im not attached to social media like that.

I just want to live as nonbinary but I’m scared I’ll be judged, especially because I’ve obviously already had one name change, and I would like to perhaps consider another because the one I currently use is quite masculine.

I want to switch to using the Dell monitor as my primary monitor and the laptop display as my secondary monitor, and instead of using the laptop keyboard, using the the Logitech one instead. My reason for this specific monitor is because I’ve used it before and had a good experience and the reviews are good, and my reason for this keyboard specifically is I already have a Logitech mouse so I won’t have to install multiple RGB control softwares, and I like the silver.

It wasnt very thick at all so I wiped it with my hand so it wouldnt drip anywhere.

90,"I(25f) work at a college bookstore as a cashier and recently I've realized that some of the guys I see regularly are hitting on me. Thing is I just don't know who to handle it.

I'm a pretty shy person and I've been working on some pretty severe social anxiety over the past few years. I'm kind of overweight and spent a huge part of my life as a tomboy. because of this I've remained pretty unnoticed by men.

I'm also not without trauma. I had some pretty close friends reveal to me that they hated my guts all along and were just using me. They were older abults and it mirrored the abandoment I felt from my parents. Despite me understanding that they were just bad people, I've basically resigned myself to thinking I'm just not lovable because that whole situation. Since then I've kept my distance from people to keep myself safe.

That is until recently. In the past year or so I matured enough and started working retail. I'm really good at my job now and have grown friendlier to people. I've also changed my style such that I'm now more feminine, and even started waring a little makeup which is something I wouldn't have been caught dead doing. (Like I once wore red lipstick and started having a panic attack from how visible I felt.)

I guess directly because of that I noticed that men seem to be more friendly to me. I have two regulars who are both really sweet and I can tell they're giving off some pretty heavy vibes. I just feel so foreign to it all. 

I keep recoiling at the thought of becoming closer with them and I don't know what I'd do if I jump into a relationship I'm not ready for. I fear that the more they find out about me the more they'll realize what a horrible mistake they made... Fuck, this is making me sad...

My therapist says she thinks I'm ready to take that leap, and part of me wants to. I'm just not sure where to start without messing it all up.

Any advice is welcome.",23Nov2019,1

92,"I go to a school with special needs students, And that’s cool. This student who is way taller than me. (The size of a fully grown man) (And I’m a young teenage girl who as much as I try to, cannot look very threatening) asked me at the beginning of the year something, I don’t know what because I was late for class, asked him to repeat it again, And I still couldn’t hear it. So, I just nodded. 

Then I was just outside with a group of my friends, and then he came up to me and my friend group and asked our names, so we started listing our names, Then he pointed to me, then said “No, Her name” I lied about my name because I was really uncomfortable, because there was just another thing that happened with another student making threats to me (mostly about sexual things) and calling me grossly sexual names.

So that was kinda weird, I avoided him in the hallway (because I really didn’t want to answer any questions about myself) (if that sounds like a jerk move, just let me know because i might just have the wrong attitude) and I kinda just forgot about it, but still tried to avoid him. 

Until like a month later when he randomly said “hey lady” and sat next to me, And touched my back (maybe it was accidental, idk) I tried to kinda move away but slowly so he wouldn’t notice. I have a bunch (like 50-100) stickers from bands and comic books on my binder and laptop, so he said “wow, you have good taste.” And then repeated it again. 

I don’t wanna be a jerk, and if I am being too paranoid or mean, Please tell me if I am. I would like to tell him to stop, But I don’t know how to do that without hurting his feelings, Plus he’s special needs and I don’t wanna be a jerk for something he can’t control. and I can’t tell a teacher because then I’ll look like a jerk, and I don’t have a ton of evidence.

96,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

So I was stupid and got caught stealing with my friends at Walmart today. Luckily I got off relatively easy, only being banned from the mall and Walmarts for one year. The worst thing is that my best friend in earth, and the best friend I’ve ever had, was also stealing with me. I stole the higher value, but we (along with 3 more) got caught. All of our parents came to pick us up, and the yelling and the true looks of disappointment I got from not only my dad but his parents made it so much more worse.

I am also on the basketball team where my best friend’s dad is the coach and I will be seeing him every Friday. My best friend also comes over to my house nearly everyday and we hang out at least once per weekend. 

I really value our friendship and he’s the best friend I’ve ever had and I don’t want his parents to be extremely disappointed and never wanting their son to see me again, but I would understand their thoughts.

My parents aren’t poor, but they don’t have a lot of money to just throw around. They bought 2 plane tickets to come see us for 2 weeks without really looking into where they’d be staying and I’m pretty sure they assumed they could stay in our den. They’ve always been the open door type and anybody is always welcome to stay at their (4 bedroom) house for an extended period of time without any notice. They’re the kind of people that will do anything they can to help out their friends and family. 

My feelings are that sometimes family is inconvenient and it’s something you just deal with for those you love. My parents are sweet people, but are stressful to live with in confined quarters (they stayed a week with us a couple years ago and it was AHHHHHH). My wife wants me to tell them they can only stay with us for a few nights, but I’m having a difficult time doing this since it would cost them a ton to get a hotel for ~10 days and they’re here to see us.

99," Pretty much just the title, i am unable to get any women to have interest in me and after i graduate my friends are moving across the country so after this next year i don't think ill have anyone in my life. my friends are going to have great degrees and they are in awesome relationships and honestly i'm so proud of them because of how far they have come since our freshman year. However all this has made me realize how alone i'm going to be for the foreseeable future after graduation.

on top of that i absolutely can not get women to want to go out on dates with me or be involved remotely romantically. Im not a neckbeard/niceguy, i bathe, i can socialize, i get social ques, and honestly when i talk to women they seem to enjoy themselves, but i cant find anyone who finds me appealing. my friends are always telling me im an attractive guy and that im going to find somebofy but at this point its just bullshit. i have worked so hard this year since February to lose weight and i have lost 80 pounds, i am almost at a healthy weight and i dont feel acomplished at all. i feel defeated when i look at my progress because its likewhat does it really honestly matter? what does it matter if im almost at a healthy weight because it hasnt helped me in the slightest, i cant feel proud of it because now instead of a fat ugly dude im just a skinnier ugly dude. i had barely any nice clothes so at the beginning of this semester i spent every dime i had buying new clothes but again its not like it has had any big effect. despite swiping right on literally every single person i see on tinder and bumble i havent had a single match in almost two months.

im just at the point where i have zero motivation anymore, It has become so hard to get out of bed and pretend i give a fuck about anything anymore. the only things that drive me at this point are smoking weed and going back to my bed. i know that is cringey but the only thing that makes me stable enough to do things that i need to do is if i am high. for the first time in my life i just have no hope  for the future, it feels like nobody wants me and i cant blame them.

100,"The backstory: I'm a mid-twenties female living with three other mid-to-upper twenties females. I moved into the house after the three others had lived in it together for about six months. One of the roommates is a best friend of mine, and the other two I only knew through her. Nonetheless, myself, my best friend, and one of the other roommates have formed a very close ""trio"" and are very involved in each others' social, personal, etc. lives. For a myriad of minor reasons, the fourth roommate doesn't ""click"" with us as well.

The situation: Unfortunately, the two roommates that I am close to have a habit of talking about the other roommate behind her back. While that fourth roommate does have a few annoying characteristics, she is not not a terrible person, and the two other roommates do not think she is ""that"" bad either yet still she is talked about/complained about/etc. more often than I am comfortable with. Thus far, I've done a decent job of staying out of it because I 1) don't find that fourth roommate to be that annoying, 2) don't want her to be hurt by the fact that she is being talked about, and 3) don't want to condone the habit of talking about others behind their back. I am ashamed to say (and dwelling on it hence this post) that during a night of several drinks, the three of us closer friends got on a tangent about the fourth roommate and I disclosed the many, but all very minor character traits of her's that annoy me. Honestly, the conversation was pretty cut throat and it really bothers me to have not only been a part of it, but that I got very animated and very passionate about it. The degree in which I expressed my annoyance towards said fourth roommate is not an accurate reflection of my feelings towards her. Additionally, it makes me very uncomfortable that the other two roommates have a tendency to talk about others behind their back, and I do not want to be a part of it.

The advice needed: At this point, I cannot take back what I said. I also do not want the fourth roommate to know that she was the subject of our brutal conversation and only isolate her further. The other two roommates have not shown any signs of remorse for behaving this way. I am unsure of what to do next - whether the situation is best left as is and used as a learning lesson in the future or if it is something that I need to approach the other two roommates about.

103,"Warning: this is long because there is a lot of background info. 

Background info: 
Last school year, I (19F) lived with (separate rooms connected by a bathroom) someone who we’ll call Kelly (19F). I realized I was bi in high school but I was in the closet at this time (important later). When I first met her she seemed very sweet and nice. We would hang out a lot, eat together a lot, go shopping, etc. After a month or so of hanging out with her, I realized I was starting to have romantic feelings for her. I decided to try to ignore my feelings because Kelly is very straight and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship over my unrequited feelings for her. We still continued to hang out a lot and I tried to let my feelings for her die out. 
Around the middle of March, Kelly found out that I had feelings for her and confronted me about it. I was honest and told her about my feelings and that I knew she didn’t feel the same way and apologized for any discomfort I could’ve caused her. She set up some new boundaries which I was completely fine with and I thought we were ok. Turns out I was wrong and she had a breakdown because she thought that if I liked her she must be unattractive to guys. At her request, we stopped talking but since we had mutual friends (and admittedly I was still concerned about her), I found out that she was calling me a creep and eventually she decided she and her mom were going to call my parents to tell them everything which would out me. They ended up deciding not to call but they filed a false safety report to our dorm and filed a report to the university behavioral intervention team. The later of the two ended up accidentally called my home phone after my cell and home phone numbers were swapped. After my mom heard the voicemail they left, I was forced to come out to my parents to calm them down. I am nearly 100% certain that Kelly swapped the numbers on purpose but I don’t have proof so I had to let that go. That made me realize Kelly was toxic for me and I cut her out and stopped trying to fix our friendship.

Now to my present dilemma: 
I am an officer in a club where we get lots of bonding time with our members. Through this club I met a freshman who I’ll call Amelia. Amelia is a fairly outing person and we also went to an LGBTQ+ university group meeting where I found out she is pan. I recently found out that Amelia is in the same university theater group as Kelly. To be clear, I have no problem with the theater group. I’m just worried that Kelly might try to hurt Amelia because she’s pan or out Amelia like she did with me. Kelly is one of those people who seems completely trustworthy until the moment she betrays you. I don’t know if Amelia is completely out of the closet or not and honestly it’s none of my business so I’m not going to ask. Do I warn Amelia about Kelly? Am I being too biased? Would I be overstepping by warning Amelia? Also if I should warn Amelia, how do I tell her?",23Nov2019,1

109,"For some reason this got deleted by mods but im just posting this on my other account, just copy pasted,

Last night, I broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years.
It's a little complicated since there's alot of drama going on with her friends and stress she's having and stress I've been having with my anxiety but I'll try to make it as simple as possible.
She told me about how one of her friends was being manipulative, she had already complained about this friend before, and I was just getting so sick of him being a comeplete dick to everyone around him, so I told her that, and I said that ""I wish he'd drop dead."" Yeahh...it seems really shitty now but I was tired and annoyed of him, and I know that's no excuse! But we usually joke around like that with dark jokes but I think I failed badly.
She said she wanted to stop talking about him and didn't talk to me for a few hours until she came back and she seemed....tense, and angry, and I asked her if she was alright...and...she really burst a bubble of truth in my face.
She said she didn't want to sound like a dick, but that I was always...complaining about my problems, and making her more stressed, and she told me that she was feeling overwhelmed on her homecoming dance, with family and friend stress on her shoulders, but she still tried to have fun, but that she had later spend the night comforting me because I wanted to rant and apparently she cried and left and...never told me that.

I might steer off here for a second but I should add a bit of my backround, I have anxiety issues, I get anxiety attacks when even the littlelest things happen, it's not fun. And I can't really take any medication because my mom says that when she used to take anxiety and depression pills it would just make her worse and she refuses to get me any. And she says she's gonna book an appointment with my therapist, but I've only visited him like three times and the last time it was like 5-6 months ago.
I like to rant, if it isn't obvious now...and sometimes my anxiety gets horrendously bad, and sometimes, I get suicidal thoughts...but I don't want to think it's anything mayor, I know both of my parents had depression and suicidal thoughts, and my dad took his life two years ago when Hurricand Maria happened, and I'm...scared that I'll be diagnosed with it.

Getting back on track here, when she said that I complain and rant alot and that it was making her stressed it felt horrible, I wanted to help her, not make her worse, and I felt like the only way to really do that was by breaking up with her, we said we could still be friends though, and I'm glad, she's an incredible person.

But I'm worried that I might do what I did to her to other people, make crude jokes that come off wrong, and just rant and rant and rant to the point that they're stressed and it's because of me, I don't want to lose my friends...they're all such incredible people, but now I feel toxic, and like I should distance myself from everyone around me and bottle everything up, my main goal in life is to just have everyone around me happy, and I thought I was doing it well with my girlfriend, but I was wrong...and now I could be wrong about everything.

I even decided to skip school today, I'm not missing anything important, we were actually just going to sit on a big classroom floor and just watch movies all day. I felt like if I went, I would've burst out crying like a bitch and make everyone stop what they're doing and calm me down and say it's okay when really it would just make it worse.

I cried just this week once already!! Over a CLIPBOARD!! I HAVE LIKE A HUNDRED CLIPBOARDS!!!

I feel like nobody deserves to have me, the most depressing dead weight you would ever see, and have to struggle with that ontop of their own problems.

Iwith what my ex-girlfriend said to me, I'm scared, that I could be hurting more that I'm helping, and I don't want that! I just want everyone to be happy, and if distancing myself from them and botting stuff up will allow them to do that, I don't care.
I dont know what to do with my tendencies...how should i take care of it?? What should i do?

I won't bother with a proofread, but TL;DR:
broke up with girlfriend, tells me I rant too much and stressing her out, I worry that I might be making everyone else around me stressed too, I start to look into my imcomplete feelings and realize I might have a problem, I don't want to think about it, might bottle my feelings up and distance myself from everyone if it would make them happy.

110,"Sorry for the long  post but please bear with me. 

It is somewhat of a difficult decision for me I've taken to remain unmarried but If seen from my perspective, I believe I am making the right choice. I come off as a selfish bastard for taking such a huge decision but I have no choice. It is I believe better for all the parties involved.

For background, let me tell you why I have come to choose what I want.

I understand life is a tricky situation to live for every one, I'm no exception to the hard times my fate, my life threw at me either. This goes for everything, personal,  professional &amp; my love life.

I'm 26, soon to be 27 in 2 months. As much as its difficult to admit, the truth is I've never been able to get into a relationship. Since being in HS until now, all I've gotten from girls is nothing but a flat out NO. It has happened a so many times that it's completely messed me up mentally. From my school friends to my college friends, every single on of them has at some point gotten to enjoy this phase of being with someone but me on the other hand have always envied. It's a human nature in the end &amp; I've always felt jealous of people in relationships.  All this whole while, when people my age were experiencing life, I was just looking at them have a something that I only dreamed of, tried for &amp; got shot down at. 

The messed up part is for the lack of better words, I'm so messed up that along with my personal life which is already a mess but my professional life is huge mess as well. I'm a well educated individual with 2 master's degrees but unfortunately, I've never been able to hold on to a job for more then 3 months &amp; always have been fired. Being 27, my collective working experience is less than 2 years holding 8 jobs in total. 
A bummer I know &amp; even worse is the thing to deal with being a professional failure along with failure in my personal &amp; love life. 

The thing is, my parents are expecting me to get married,  have kids &amp; settle down. My dilemma is, I'm incapable of being loved back. For someone who's only knowing is to love &amp; never be reciprocated scares the hell out of me. I've never known how to deal with being like or loved or someone putting an effort to keep me, be with me which puts me in a difficult emotional spot. A part of me does want to get married, settle down but on the other hand, I am aware that i might spoil the life of whichever girl will marry me. My disappointments have been honest &amp; my scars are real &amp; I dont expect them to heal. It's not that I've commitment issues. In reality,  I've never seen myself as a womanizer. I've always wanted &amp; would have been loyal to the girl I wanted to be with, keep all the promises I would've made her but I never got to be that man.

My fear is that these emotional scares will haunt me forever &amp; it will influence the girl's life as well whether I like it or not. I am already drowning but I have the ability to save someone from drowning &amp; going down with me which is exactly what I'm tryingt do. I don't know if my decision is right for me or not but I'm sure as hell it is for the girl who'll not be my other half. 

My parents fail to understand my predicament but my one &amp; only effort is to save everyone else &amp; I have the power to do so.

My reality is hard to digest, even for me. I'm disgusted that I have to take such a life altering decision but in the end, it's better to ruin yourself than risking ruining everyone else's lives who matter the most to me for my selfish gain.

Please advise me how should I convince my parents that my decision will only save them &amp; not cause anybody harm.",23Nov2019,1

Anyways, in the past, if I liked a guy, he rarely liked me back. There was one guy I had a crush on, we went on a date which went fine. Then later I found out he was a jerk and we never went past that 1 date.

Now  I've met this guy who is really interested in me. Not sure why. He's very nice, but I'm not that physically attracted to him. I went on a few dates with him, and we had fun together. He flirted well, and the dates were fun, so I agreed to date him. Now I'm wondering if that was a good idea.

I don't have much relationship experience, so I'm really not sure what to do. If I keep dating him, could I develop feelings for him?  before, I was
  attracted to the other guy already, so I've never been in a situation where someone likes me, but I'm on the fence.

I don't want to mistreat his feelings and lead him on. I already told him I wasn't sure about my feelings so ""Let's just take it slowly.""

I guess my question is, is it possible to become attracted as time goes on? Or am I setting myself up for failure here? Am I my something wrong? I feel like everyone else got all their mistakes out in high school, and I'm over here bumbling along...",23Nov2019,1

My problem with list-making isn't about simple organization and it is slowly debilitating my everyday functioning. I have no money for therapy and was wondering if anyone had experience with this, in any form. I just don't want to feel alone and crazy anymore. 

I write *everything* down. If I make one error in what I'm writing down (from spelling, to order of thoughts, placement on the paper, or just a thought of ""oh, that letter looks weird"") I will start again. And again, and again, and again. I do not erase, I will rip the paper out of the book and start again. 

In the past four days, I have created **261 iPhone notes** about daily tasks, gone through **an entire journal** for my exercise plan, and created **hundreds and hundreds** of google documents detailing future living expenses (for jobs I don't have or want). None of these tasks I have even completed, though I truly believe when I get it down correctly, I will complete them. All of my notes and documents are typically very repetitive/almost identical, but I never really quite get them right. 

I have had some level of this habit for at least the past 2-3 years now, although it only started getting this bad about 5 months ago. I am not sure if I'm scared of failure, forgetfulness, being unprepared, or all three. Perhaps this is just my way of dealing with stress. Perhaps I'm obsessed with planning. I have no idea, but I am scared of my own mind. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders as a tween/teen. Perhaps this is just another manifestation of the anxiety?

116,"Where to start? It's been a rough day, got into work (music retail) this morning, did the usual morning cleaning duties, turned everything in my department on, then my manager came out and said we had to have a meeting in his office.

I read up until the personal attacks about my physical appearance, and walked out.

I don't know if it's something I can't see, but I haven't seen that I've been condescending to anyone. Frustrated? Yes.

118,"I’ve been hearing a lot of stories of people doing well and killing it, and my life which either stays the same or gets worse really depresses me. Gets girlfriend, gets married, gets new high paying job.

My friends even made a casual comment about how my life sucks. I took it as a joke but it really hurt. Nothing ever goes my way so I thought I’d have some support from someone but I get absolutely no support from anyone. They either comment on how bad it is, ask me what’s wrong with me in a patronizing you don’t know what you are doing kind of way, and then go about their day.  

I’m currently in school and I have to pay my way because financial aid doesn’t give anywhere close to enough money,  I often have to delay going for a semester or two just to save enough money. It’s hard to work where I work and be happy. It’s retail. I don’t even know if what I’m doing is going to pay off. Everyone else’s path seems to prove that it won’t.

GPA is 3.5 but its allot better for my junior/senior year and my major gpa is much better. I’m essentially relying on my getting into some graduate program in data science or applied maths but I’m really worried about what will happen if I don’t get in anywhere. I worked at a summer camp every summer so I don’t have any work or internship  experience anywhere. I’m just so worried that I’ll end up doing some menial low wage job and wanna die.

125,"So, I have been friends with this person for nearly 10 years, and her family has become like my second family. I have recently discovered via facebook, that her mother is going to a potentially harmful alternative medicine center almost weekly. Now, before I decided to go forward, I did my homework. I researched the aforementioned institution and discovered that the CEO does not have a medical degree from an accredited university. Moreover, I looked into the procedures that they do at this location and for further information it is known as ""Nutritional IV Therapy."" Now, I do not claim to have any medical background, but I do have a high understanding of science and given the amount of research I put in, I can conclusively say that this institution is offering entirely fake treatments. One of the ""treatments"" they offer is known as Ozone Therapy, to which, recently the FDA has prohibited the use of ozone as a medical treatment as well as has issued a statement stating there is ""no proof of safety and effectiveness."" It has issued further statements saying that ""Ozone is a toxic gas."" This company is still currently practicing and injecting this poisonous chemical into humans. Now, I have no proof that this is the exact treatment that she is receiving, but even then, I looked at all of the other ""treatments"" offered by this clinic and have found similar results. Not to the extent of ozone therapy, but similar in regards that they either do not do anything and it is a waste of money, to they could have harmful side affects. I am concerned for my friend's mother, as I care for her deeply and would hate to see something happen to her that is the result of this egregious and predatory company. I don't know how I would go about casually bringing this up to either my friend or her mother. I don't think that it is my place to tell her what she can and can not do with her body but at the same time I can foresee something terrible happening because of what she is doing and if anything did happen, I would feel a certain degree of responsibility because I did nothing to stop it.

127,"Hey! I’ll keep this as short and accurate as possible. So I used an online app to meet a guy and we now communicate on a different platform. This person is great! They are funny, smart, share similar interests, and completely understand me. What’s even better is I’m not the type of person to “put out” on dates I guess, so I want to have the conversation and get to know the person over and over again. This is because I like the person more than the “adult acts” that can happen. We are getting pretty close, but kind you we met only recently. In fact, we FaceTimed through the night and this person seems really excited to meet in person and go on a date we planned. In fact we chose to start as friends and move up, but if it doesn’t clock we can always be friends. So we made plans on a set day and he looks forward to them and he’s excited, maybe too excited, to meet me. He’s not a catfish, or a creep, but this excitement is the one drawback I have. What I mean by this is that, even though we have plans for a set day, he keeps asking if there’s some stuff we can do sooner. He says it’s okay if we can’t, but he’s really interested in getting to know me. I don’t know what to think because I don’t want to think anything wrong, but I feel like it’s being a little rushed. I’m afraid of saying that and hurting his feelings because I think he is genuinely expressing interest and I don’t want to cut that off. It isn’t for anything lusty because he’s not looking for that so I was hoping someone here might help make sense of it. They’re really great, but are things moving too fast? I kinda feel like that, but is it just me or is this normally how fast dating is? Also, this is my first date/relationship because I haven’t been with anyone nor have tried. If you need any clarifications to help answer please feel free to ask. I believe the best in people, but could use some clarification on how eager he is to meet.

This isn't just a normal porn video either, someone filmed him masturbating over the bathroom stall without his consent.

So I am faced with a dilemma. Should I tell him, or should I not? Would you want to be told if you were in a porn video online without knowing, or would you prefer that no one ever told you (especially if your identity was not discernible from the video)? If I should tell him, should I wait for the semester to be over (he is in college) or not (to not stress him out right before finals)?

Video has a significant number of views. Friend in question was over 18 years old when the video was filmed.

So i honestly haven’t told anyone this but my ex boyfriend. This is a big deal for me but I am in a better state of mind nowadays and would love opinions/ advice towards this. 

So, when I was around 8 years old my cousin who is 7 years older then me sexually abused me for years. He would take me in a closet when we were playing “hide and seek” and make me do stuff to him. 

Honestly, it was such a regular thing and I was so young that I didn’t realize how fucked up it was. Overtime is stopped do to family issues and not seeing each other as often.

No he is currently 29, he has 3 young daughters 6, 3 month old twins. When I see he it’s like nothing we’ve happened, I know it was a long time ago but I can’t help but think that his oldest daughter is turning 7 in January and he could do something to her.

Honestly I’m just all over the place, I haven’t told anyone about this and I don’t know what to do. 

My family is already so messed duo and I don’t wanna cause anymore problems but at the same time I don’t want anything happening to this sweet innocent girl. 


Years have gone by, and I have dealt with a lot of stuff; maybe it’s irrelevant now and he could be a better person but.. I can picture it so vividly him making me do stuff to him.

Fuck it just is overwhelming.


Should I tell his fiancée, my parents, my therapist or should I just keep it to myself and give him the benefit of the doubt: considering he was a honey teenager.

Sure it’s hurt me but at this point I’m already too broken to care, I just worry about those 3 little girls knowing what their father did to his 7 year old cousin.

139," I'm a high school student currently in my sophomore year. I have been considering seeing if I can transfer to another high school.

Basically, the year before I went into high school, they completely changed up where many people were meant to be districted to. Therefore, due to that, I went to a completely different high school than all of my friends. I have been really lonely in my school now, as I am that kid that sits alone at lunch and is the one who is put into a random group by a teacher for projects, which has basically made my social life absolute garbage.

Other than that, I also figured out that the other high school that I want to switch to is closer to where I live, and it has classes for computer science that my current high school doesn't offer (I want to major in computer science in college). If I do this, I also believe that there will not be any bus provided to take me to school, and I have somebody who is willing to drive me. I do not want to do this in the middle of the school year, as it would be very difficult, and If I do try to transfer, I want to do it during the summer.

I'm also an honor roll student with absolutely no disciplinary action or anything of the sort on my record.

143,"Hey guys, right now it’s 3am and I don’t have anyone who’s up right now to talk to about this so I thought I’d post it here

Me and my boyfriend were together for 2 years.

My boyfriend broke up with me suddenly the day before yesterday, he has been going through some depression for a couple of weeks so we’d agreed two weeks ago that he could have some space - we’d still be romantic with each other but there was no pressure to see me while he was focusing on getting better, and if he didn’t feel like talking and just wanted time by himself that was fine and he could just let me know when he felt like that and I would let him be.

It was all going okay until the day before yesterday when he hadn’t talked to me all day so I messaged him to ask what was going on and if he wanted space that’s okay but to just communicate that to me so I didn’t feel completely shut out, and so it led to me asking him if he still wanted me / wanted to get back together at some point or if that had changed and he said he didn’t think he wanted me.

He had apparently decided it was over for good and was going to tell me the next day (?), and this was all on Facebook messenger. I asked him to talk to me about this in person, or to call me and talk to me but he was refusing.

All of this led to him deleting me and unfollowing me on everything and he has not talked to me since he did this. I sent him one big message a couple of hours later explaining how hurt I was by how abrupt and sudden this all was considering he had been fine with me two day’s ago and he said he still loved me and wanted to get back to normal when he was feeling more like himself. He read it and didn’t reply.

So basically it is all over in the blink of an eye. I want to comfort myself and say this isn’t really him talking and he’ll regret rushing and ending it so cruelly and fast but it just seems like he doesn’t care anymore and doesn’t really like me despite telling me he loved me two days ago.

I don’t know how to deal with this situation and I feel really sad.

I am not going to message him again unless he reaches out to me but if sucks so badly and I was wondering if anybody has an outsider opinion of this whole situation and any advice on dealing with a abrupt breakup.

We broke up in January 2018 for two months after being together since May 2017 and then got back together (we have been together since) - a little bit in the same way, I.e it was a bit of a rushed decision But he did say it to me both over text and person that time, and when we got back together he told me he regretted it after a week and wondered what on Earth he had done.

The last time we saw each other was 2 weeks ago and he said he felt happy and in love when he was physically with me and he thought his depression was clouding his view of me and us (we almost broke up but he came to talk to me in person and that’s when we decided he just needed space, but now he has fully broken up with me) so I don’t know if it his depression talking and pushing me away so hurtfully or if it is just him :( it is also essay deadline time in our uni coming up and he deals with stress quite badly so putting this on top of depression could be a factor?

He told me, when he was breaking up with me, he didn’t enjoy talking to me or seeing me and he didn’t see a future with me and this hurt a lot because 2 days before he was saying a completely different story :(

148,"Throwaway as I'm quite positive my brother has Reddit. Going to try to keep this as vague as I can.

My brother (late 20s) has always had a bit of a chip on his shoulder and racist/misogynistic/homophobic leanings, but recently it's reached a whole new level. We live in Canada, and recently a well-known TV host (Don Cherry) here was fired for his comments about immigrants. This sent my brother, a lifelong hockey player and fan, off the deep end. It is all he will talk about. He is convinced that PM Trudeau fired him, that Trudeau legalized marijuana to numb our minds from what he's doing to ruin our country, that people hate him (my brother) because he's white, that the Canada he knows and loves is disappearing. He says there are white people who are traitors and they're ruining Canada. He thinks I'm one of them, because I'm a teacher, and I'm teaching the kids to hate white people (I teach the super controversial subject of math.)

I have tried listening to him, talking through his beliefs with him, sharing articles and books with him, and at least giving him the basic dignity of a ""mm"" whenever he says something along these lines. I've tried changing the subject. One night when he was going on about women and false accusations of rape, I tried to get him to empathize by telling him about my own past sexual assaults and reasons I never said anything about them. He gave me a hug and offered to kill the guy, but that's it.

What's turned me to ask for advice is one final last ditch effort. Last night he was talking about guns and a ""war"" that was coming. He said people could answer to his gun. He doesn't own a gun or have a permit, but he suggested he ""had ways"" to get one. I am terrified. I don't know what to do, and neither does my entire family. We suspect he has some kind of mental illness but he refuses to get treatment because that would be Trudeau brainwashing him. He's an adult, we can't force him to go. We are at a loss and he just seems to be getting worse. Any ideas, anything at all, would be appreciated.",23Nov2019,1
149,"Hi, I (20F) am pretty sure my dad has Aspergers. I’m not asking for a diagnosis! I just want to hear if anyone can relate or share any thoughts on this 

His parents are boomers who didn’t want to believe anything could be “wrong” with their child, so they say he is just “nerdy” since he is extremely intelligent, probably genius level.   
Very high ranking in academia, books published, doctorate degree, etc. He very well could just be a total crazy genius rather than austistic, but I’ve had too many experiences with him just acting incorrectly for me to think that. 

Neglect. Early in my childhood I knew something wasn’t right. My dad does not understand the concept of caring for other people. This isn’t to say that he is mean, but that he is genuinely in another universe. My parents split when I was 6, and I remember when I would stay with him, my brother(6 year age difference) and I would be left on the other side of the house to fend for ourselves the whole day. Sometimes going without food. When I would ask my dad to spend time with us, he would say he is busy working on studies, or literally not respond. Sometimes in a total trance, being extremely shaken that I interrupted his thoughts. 

Then I started to notice how my dad doesn’t take affection. If you try to kiss him, he will present his forehead to you to kiss. He doesn’t say I love you, he just says a mumbled “Mmph” and shakes his head in acknowledgement. 

He does not talk to me in college unless I call first or he needs some kind of information from me (idk, insurance or something paperwork related). He only really interacts with my life online, reading the articles I post about art history and such. He doesn’t know that much about me, only what I’ve shared online, he doesn’t ask about me and I don’t feel inclined to share because when I do, I get silence. 

He also wears relatively the same thing every day, refuses to travel out of our hometown, etc. 

When I told my mom about this, she agreed and said she never wanted to tell me because of how she didn’t want her divorcing him to influence my life at all. She divorced him after 13 years of marriage because it finally added up in her head that my dad genuinely doesn’t know how to care about others. She felt single. The shy guy now turned into the neglecting husband. 


Anyways... anyone can relate?",23Nov2019,1
150," **So I've just started a new job at a fitness center. One of my main goals is supposed to be building relationships with members. One problem, I have Asperger's and I'm horrible at making conversation past basic small-talk. Any advice?**",23Nov2019,1
151,"So I got offered a job which pays me 65K and was ecstatic. I've been gunning for this field for years and it's very competitive, I networked enough, put in extra effort and did enough research to put myself in this position. I went through a long interview process to get this position and impressed the VP enough. The issues? I just got promoted at my current company and I stretched the date on my resume plus another place I volunteered at may seem invalid.

&amp;#x200B;

1) My current manager is really nice but freaks out over small things. She freaked out over things like when I suggest that I can speed up our tasks with computer coding and when I asked for a raise. I don't blame her for turning me down but she went from smiling to tearing down my work. I had to be the rational one in the meeting saying I see your point of view. I was under a contract and she made me permanent less than a month ago. I took it and out of respect for her wasn't applying out. I figured I'd wait a few months or try an internal promotion. Then a few days after the promotion, I get an email asking me to come in for an interview for a position I applied to months ago. I figure I'd just go expecting to flop. I kept passing interviews though until I eventually got offered the position. I only make 35K here and my family thinks I'm underpaid for the amount of extra work I do. I never did extra work for the money, it was so I could showcase initiative for a position like the one I got offered. The job has raises so I could be making 80K within 2 years, 100K within 4. Also I'm poor and support two retired parents. I haven't dated or partied recently because I really have to save and we live in a small condo meant for 2 people, not the three of us. I barely see my friends as a result. My mom almost cried tears of joy when I got offered the job. This job is perfect in so many ways but I'm just scared of my manager lashing out calling me a snake and hypocrite even though any sane person would take the money and worst case I'd only have to deal with it for a couple of weeks before I leave. I've done everything she asked and then some.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I lied about the way things ended at the company I worked at before my current one. I have a great relationship with everyone there. I didn't lie about the tasks, and I guarantee people there would vouch for my work ethic. The problem was I was under contract there and my contract ran out. I was offered a permanent position there but I didn't take it which at the time was silly. I just didn't know what I wanted and was worried I'd become lazy and stagnant at that job making 30K because I was friends with everyone there and not nearly as driven as I am now. I extended the end date of my last job by 3 months so it's a month before I started at the current job. I never mentioned it was a contract in the interview. I also mentioned a website I wrote for before I started working. That was the truth, I did write for the site and my friend was the creator of it. The problem is the site has been taken down because my friend started working in politics and I focused on career. I told them during the interview about the latter but not that it got taken down. I still have the pieces I wrote saved on my laptop but I don't know if that means anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really struggling with both of these. My fear is I hand in resignation to my job to take this position and then a month or two in or even before employment I get called out and now I have no job. My manager out of spite may not want me back as I know that she's done the same to someone else that used to work there and wanted to come back. I know I'm not innocent here and I feel guilty though the handful of people I talked to don't think it warrants the offer being rescinded. They don't even think I should worry about it. I have the required education and extra courses which are typically very tough to pass and the main mandatory credentials which is why the salary is as cushy as it is. It just sucks knowing that stretching the truth about my last employment could cost me when they do a verification check and that I'll have to face my manager head on. Especially after how hard I worked to put in the time, to know I might not get the job sucks. Especially to see how happy my mom was to this, I'd hope this isn't the case. I know I'm qualified for this but man it'd suck to lose over something that I don't really think would affect whether I can do the job. I'm just panicking here.",23Nov2019,1

157,"So, I have a friend group of about 5 people, and I get a king with most of them okay. There’s one person who I genuinely don’t like tho. He’s immature, annoying, irresponsible, and just plain rude. I don’t like being around him, and he always causes problems. 

Everyone else in the group likes him alright, and invited him to things.
We have a group chat with all of us in it, and that’s the main way we communicate. I often ask people if they want to get together/do something fun, and he is often the only one who responds. 
Then, I’m forced to hangout with him because he’s the only one who wants to a lot of the time.

Now the group thinks we’re super close because we always hang out (along with the guy), but in reality I can’t stand him.

She has extreme highs/lows and is constantly talking shit about me to the kids and my husband. We rent, split everything 50/50. What would you do? We've already expressed our concerns but she doesn't care what we think. Would calling the cops be stupid in this situation? We live in California if that helps any. There's more details but this is the gist of it.

Anyway, I applied for HELLA jobs. I had 7 interview this week. I got 4 job offers. One as a barista at some bakery but I declined it because they wanted me to train in Philadelphia at 6am-12 even though I told them I’m scheduled for 12am at my current job. N she seemed really stressed that I couldn’t work on days that I have classes. The 2nd offer as a detailer, that’s out the window cuz ima fail that drug test. Kinda irrelevant but there’s this other job at Verizon who said he would get in touch for 2nd for intense interview w the manager but it wasn’t that convincing that I got the job, seems like the the kind of thing they always say. The one that I didn’t get the offer was because they couldn’t work w my school schedule.

So my options so far....

1) Back to Starbucks. I’ve worked at Starbucks before and really enjoyed it. I would definitely work there again. They seemed really excited to have me on their team. But it’s a 35min drive.

2) Target. I would be working w this one company that works w Target to get their tech sales up. It’s commission and only 13minutes away. I’m scared that they might drug test tho.

160,"So I'm part of the debate team at my school, and I absolutely love it. I only joined this year, but I feel like I've been there for ages. The team is amazing, the community is so welcoming, and I've made a bunch of new friends because of all the tournaments that I've gone to. It's one of my favorite things to do, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. 

However, I'm also part of band at school, something I've been doing since I was really young. This year, our school started a marching band, and a bunch of people in my band signed up for it. I wanted to, but it required a huge time commitment (three hour practices four days a week) and I just didn't have the space in my schedule for it. So I ended up signing up for the debate team instead, as mentioned above.

Next year, however, I genuinely want to do marching band because I love the band community and playing my instrument is super fun. But if I did that, I wouldn't be able to join debate for the full year and go to all of the tournaments (and next year there will be a lot more tournaments open to me because I'll be on the varsity team).

So, I need advice. Debate team or marching band?",23Nov2019,1
161,"I have a friend who always comes to me to emotionally dump on me online. Never in person. My problem is that you can't just ""listen"" over a texting without coming off as dry. You can't lend a shoulder. You can’t hug and reassure.

I genuinely wish I could help, but I've always been awful with words, and the topics poured on me are the types of things that are excruciatingly hard to respond to over text.

168,"Today was a pretty standard day for my coworker and I. Got to work around 7, worked together as per usual and got some stuff done and then went to lunch around noon. As we’re standing in line at the restaurant waiting to place our orders, my coworker goes into his pocket and grabs his phone. As he’s pulling his phone out of his pocket, a small folded up little blue package falls out from behind his phone. I watch it fall to the ground and notice that once it hits the ground I can see through the fold that it’s a medicine-looking wrapper and all I can read is “Subo-“ in italics. I almost immediately realize/ think that it’s Suboxine. I pick it up and say “Hey dude you dropped this I think.” He pauses for a second and doesn’t really know what to say, and says something like “Oh what? Nah that’s just a wrapper that was on the ground.” And then puts it in his pocket. For the remainder of the time we were in line he literally cannot stop fiddling with his phone and acting strangely. I got to the table a couple moments after him and another coworker sat down and I came into a conversation about me picking garbage up and saving the earth or something, he was making a joke out of it I guess. I said “Oh I just thought it was some Sudafed all I saw was SU-“ (earlier this week he was asking me if I could get him some Sudafed because his license is expired, which I have no doubt is true because he has allergies and I know for a fact his license is actually expired from something prior, so nothing shady there) 
So, a little backstory here. I work in a blue collar field and most of the guys have an interesting past to say the least and they’re normally not very secretive about it. But this coworker and I work in tandem with each other, we have the same job and we’re partners. It’s been that way for about a year, 10-12 hour days 5-6 days a week. So, I know him pretty well and we’re pretty open with each other about personal things. I’ve never made him out to be a heroin addict, or a prescription pill head. But he does use a lot of OTC stuff for pain relief for stuff like headaches, joint pain and heartburn. We’re both relatively young, +-30, and he has a wife and a few kids. 
So, my question to you guys is, do you think I should bring it up? Should I tell him I know that it was Suboxine? Ask him what’s up maybe? Or just ignore it?",23Nov2019,1

This is how close minded they are - think think they are not racist because my mom's sister is married to a non-white man. The two are unrelated to the problem and they refuse to see this. They think if they go as far as saying hello to a non-white person, then they are good and diverse.

182,"I'm gonna try to make this short but basically: I'm incredibly lonely and it's affecting my life.

I'm a 17 year old girl and all I want is a boyfriend. Scratch that. I don't just want a boyfriend. I want to find my ""soulmate"" and be with him already. Obviously that's unrealistic, but you get what I mean. It's not like I just want a boyfriend just to have one. I am a huge hopeless romantic. I care only about finding the guy I'm supposed to be with, not dating for fun or whatever. Anyways, I have 0 experience when it comes to romance or dating or sex. I haven't had my first kiss, I've never flirted, I've never had a guy even compliment me. I have the same amount of experience that I did when I came out of the womb and that is no exaggeration. I'm also kinda a big tomboy, I guess. I have boy short hair and I more often than not get mistaken for a boy when I'm out in public. 

Meanwhile, all my girl friends are getting in relationships or at least are talking to guys. I always expected to be the last of my friends to experience this stuff but I didn't expect it to hurt this much. I am so happy for all my friends. I love hearing about their exciting news and I love seeing my friends happy. But at the same time, whenever they talk about their boy stuff, I can't help but feel incredibly jealous. It makes me instantly depressed to hear about their stories. I try to stay positive. I don't turn the conversation on me and how lonely I am. I am always happy for them. But inside, a big part of me wants them to stop talking before I start crying. It's happening more frequently too. As we get older, they are experiencing more, therefore I have to sit through more and more stories. One of these days I'm going to start crying in front of them. Tomorrow I'm going to hang out with two of my closest girl friends and I'm honestly dreading it because the entire time we will be talking about boy stuff. I know I will end up feeling really lonely and sad.

The bad thing is, that I don't really have any other issues in my life. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm a really stress free person. I am super grateful to have an easy life. The only thing that is causing me stress at the moment is university applications but even that isn't that bad. And it's only temporary. I feel like I'm super comfortable with myself. I'm confident, I'm not really insecure, I'm happy with who I am. My friends and even I always say that you should sort out yourself before dating anyone. But guess what? I am sorted out. The only thing that's missing in my life is romance and this sort of experience.

Like I mentioned earlier, it doesn't help that I'm a tomboy. I'm pretty sure everyone at school assumed that I'm a lesbian. Which would be fine except that means all the boys think I'm a lesbian. And this isn't just me being insecure. I've had multiple people ask me if I'm gay and I've also had multiple girls have crushes on me or ask me if I'm gay. It's really flattering, but only to a certain point. I know I'll have to work a little harder when it comes to guys because of my unconventional looks. I know I won't have as many guys attracted to me as my friends because I look pretty boyish. I know this and I'm fine. But it still sucks. I know that I won't be alone forever, deep down. I know that when I go to university, things will open up for me. But in the meantime, I feel so incredibly lonely. It's almost like a physical pain. It just really hurts because I like myself. I love who I am. So why doesn't anyone else love who I am?",23Nov2019,1

185,"*using fake names 

So I’ve been working at my current job for 2.5 years now. There’s this girl (Molly) who started when I did. We were always really friendly, although she often worked days while I worked nights so we never really hung out outside of work. About a year after working there these two other girls started working there (Jas and Jenna). Not long after they’d started I was working with Jas one night when she told me she’d broken up with her boyfriend the night before. We bonded over the fact that so had I and decided to go out drinking that night. 

As the weeks went on myself, Jas and Jenna became close, as we all had similar interests and were finally single and free (beach, festivals, design etc). I work in hospitality so there’s lots of socialising. For a few months we’d go out almost every weekend and then go to the beach the next day or do little photo shoot kind of things. Eventually I ended up being the third wheel and stopped getting invited. Jenna ended up moving overseas, and Jas went on a holiday. 

In the mean time Molly and I became closer, and I went to her birthday and also ran into her at a festival and had a dance and we’d run into each other other nights out and hang out. We’d talk to each other about boys we were seeing etc and talk about film cameras etc. I considered her a good friend, but just hadn’t had a chance to really hang out outside of work apart from those encounters. 

Well since Jas got back from her holiday about this time last year, Jas and Molly have been inseparable. They post pics of them at the beach or on fun adventures constantly. Usually I try not to get jealous because I know it’s just a highlight reel but it was a little frustrating because they know it’s something I’d enjoy and I hadn’t exactly been having the best time dealing with my break up and the drama that came from that. I’ve spent most of this year putting it down to the fact that maybe I’m dwelling too much or feeling too sorry for myself, which I’m still working on although I’ve come so far. I also try to remind myself that them being good friends and me not being invited might just be how things have gone naturally in their worlds. Like sometimes people just don’t fit into their puzzle. If that’s how it is then that’s how it is, I shouldn’t try to force my way in. 

But for the past half a year or so when I’ve had shifts with them it’s felt like high school or something. Like when everyone’s standing in a group and you can’t get a word in, or they turn their backs to you. Or when I’m walking around just trying to do my job and they’re constantly whispering and giggling to on another. It’s made going to work really shit but id mentally prepare myself before and throughout my shift telling myself that “I’m just overthinking, and they’re allowed to be best friends. Just don’t worry about it.” I didn’t mention anything to anyone at work because if it got around I knew it would make me look like I was just creating drama or being insecure (especially since I had lots surrounding my break up). So I kept it to myself. 

Well Molly’s birthday came around and I wasn’t invited. Everyone else (apart from Jas obviously) was just as confused as I was. Even people who I didn’t think were as close to Molly as I was were invited. Like people I thought were just work mates that she was friendly with. I was pretty upset, but also kind of relieved that now I could be sure I wasn’t just making it up and validated because other people could see it too. I’ve been trying to figure out why still, and it’s gone back and forth between damaging thoughts about myself but then trying to console myself by thinking “oh it’s probably because I haven’t been at work much” since I do uni. “Don’t overthink it.”  Although I’ve had several people say to me “oh I thought you guys were good friends?” 

Well a few weeks has past and Molly has a new job.  She made a group chat to have goodbye drinks and invited me. I was kind of surprised but just figured that maybe she either felt like she HAD to, or maybe in regards to her birthday we just weren’t as close as I’d thought. Life goes on sort of thing. I wasn’t going to go because I still felt sort of weird, didn’t want to end up being left out and also I’m kinda poor at the moment anyway. But one of the new girls (Sarah) convinced me to go. I thought why not, Sarah seems to be pretty close with Molly and Jas, and maybe if I go it could be an opportunity to clear the air or even just properly catch up? Idk. I thought it would be fun just to at least go out with the other people I work with. 

Well last night Molly messaged the group chat saying that she’s got something on during the day, and that we can all meet out tonight at 11. I thought that was kind of weird and pointless. I was leaving work at the time and then one of the other new girls (Brianna) mentioned that Molly messaged her individually saying that she should come over to hers earlier for drinks before they go out. So I’m almost certain she’s messaged most of the group except for me to come to hers before 11. Even all the new people who’ve only been there a few weeks.

And now I’m wondering where to go from here. 
To make things worse. She hasn’t even really left my work. She’s got a new job, but she’s still on the books at my work so she will be doing a shift with me next weekend. And she’ll be back every few weeks or so. And Jas still works here.",23Nov2019,1
186,"Basically, I’m dealing with a lot of shit. 

1. My procrastination is getting out of hand. Wtf do I do to stop. I know procrastination is a normal thing but I’m at a point where I can’t fucking focus on my homework. I always need to be on a FaceTime call with someone in order to do hw.

2. I feel like an ugly piece of shit. That’s honestly kinda it.

3. I just went through a breakup and it was really bad. I was so dependent on him. How do I move on for good? I definitely don’t wanna get back with him but I still think about him from time to time.

4. This has to do with my breakup but I feel like no one really loves me or wants the best for me. I have a few good friends who I hang out with regularly and I feel comfortable being myself around, but I don’t know if anyone truly wants the best for me. I know my parents do but that’s different

188,"Alright, so this is going to get a little complex so I'll try to make is as understandable as possible. So 15 years ago, my dad got into a car crash and died from the injuries. My mom became a widow for 15 years until she started to date again this year. I was perfectly fine with this and encouraged her to start. She began to start dating guys from her work and would go on dates with them, I thought that was perfectly normal, until she suddenly brings about 2 different guys home each week. One day I was in my room doing homework and my mom's room is right next to mine and we have thin walls, so I hear one of the guys and my mom having sex and I get really disgusted. First of all, who the hell fucks someone when their family is home and literally moaning right next to my room.

I didn't say anything since I was just shocked about it. A few months pass, she finds a new guy, lets call him Howard; Howard is a spoiled man-child who gets everything from his rich dad and in his 40's. My mom has been dating Howard for about 5 months and suddenly, my mom tells me that he has been cheating on her with his ex girlfriend of 5 years. She was first angry at him and did break up with him, but after a week, she goes right back to him. I try to tell her that she should just break up with him since usually cheaters will always cheat again, but she says that she will give him one more chance.

She knows that I don't like this guy, but proceeds to bring Howard home almost once a week. The only thing they do is have sex right next to my room and drink wine. I even banged on the walls TWICE and screamed at them to shut the fuck up, but literally every week, she does the same exact thing. 

What do I do? I tried talking to her, but she just throws away any opinion I have away.",23Nov2019,1
189,"So a little while ago my dad decided to start a small garden in the basement I didn’t question it because he’s always had a green thumb. So I was eating dinner today and for the first time I just decided to ask what plants is he growing. He gives me a vague answer, then my little sister leaves the table. And he starts talking to me about how I’m smart and how certain drugs can cure diseases and stuff like that and then he told me that he’s not only growing it but smoking it too. He also told me that before he started smoking it he was addicted to this pill that my uncle gave him to help with some digestive issues. My mom walks in and pretty much sums up the conversation by saying in a joking way “so ya your dads a pot head”.

I have no clue how to react to this. He said that he came clean because he thought I was on to him, but I had no clue. My dad is convinced that it’s helping him with his digestive issues and back pain.  

Also keep in mind that I live in Canada so it’s legal here.
One time my dad had to go pick something up from a store and next to it was a weed growing shop or something like that I can’t really remember. And I remember making a comment about it and my dad seemed annoyed by it and said that it can cure stuff. But as far as I’m concerned he doesn’t have a prescription. 

I have no clue what to do about this I’m only a teenager so maybe I’m not seeing the whole picture idk.

I feel like that is an important factor in our relationship to me- I want more quality time. He doesn’t hangout with me on weekends at all because he stays home with his dad(they are very close). Two weeks ago he almost broke up with me because he thinks I deserve better and he told me he is having some mental health issues. I didn’t want to end things.

191,"Securing the internship I currently have lined up was a long and arduous process that I don't feel like getting into. To make a long story short, I have an internship lined up that I need to accept by Monday (it's currently Friday night).

I just lined out what my course schedule for the rest of my undergrad would look like, and I honestly prefer the schedule that I would have without co-op (co-op changes my sequence of study terms from winter-fall-winter to fall-winter-winter, which locks me out of a sequence of prereq courses that I'm interested in) I'm not sure what to do; this internship I have lined up would be a great experience but I don't want to screw with the courses I really wanna take. Alternatively, these courses seem super interesting but I don't wanna give up the experience of co-op.

192,"Before finding my current job, I had been searching for work for months. I was ecstatic to get the call saying I was hired, and I have given it my all. The hiring manager originally said that it would be a mid morning/evening schedule. I was then told that the only available shift was early mornings (going in at 2 or 4am), but it came with a quote “considerable pay raise”. I was reluctant,  but agreed because I very much needed the work and money and was so sick of job hunting. I should mention, i work at a bakery. It is very detailed and complicated work. They gave me 2 days of training, and 1 day working along side another baker before they scheduled me full time for 2am shifts where I am completely alone. I am in over my head, and unbelievably stressed. I am the first one there and find myself so panicked and tired and under-trained that I make mistakes. I then get blamed for being behind, and it’s kind of humiliating. I have also never received the pay raise that was promised with the position. I don’t know what to do. I am exhausted, I don’t have time to sleep during the day after work.  I have to open again tomorrow. I’m depressed and discouraged and I don’t know what to do. Part of me says fuck them, and part of me knows I should keep my head down and work through it. But i can’t help but to feel taken advantage of. I’m angry and so very frustrated.",23Nov2019,1

194,"**Let me lay some background information first:** In a year or so I'll be starting at an American medical school. My mother is disabled with a degenerative disease and cannot work, has frequent doctors appointments, and needs help with most daily tasks. As a medical student, I am not able to work and I am required, more or less, to put all my living expenses on loan (in expectation I'll pay them off when I get the big doctor dollars $$$). At the moment my mom lives with her father in an unsafe environment that will exacerbate her condition meanwhile the medical school I'm going to attend is slightly over an hour away and has specialized programs and physicians for her program. She has a boyfriend that steals her money and myself/him generally disagree and completely hate each other. My mother also has two dogs and a cat.

**Now for the dilemma:** I want to take the best care of her and realize that at some point in my adult life (20yo right now), I will have to become her sole caretaker. How could I possibly balance the expectations of medical school/physician and caring for a disabled parent? How could I afford an apartment when no apartments accept Section 8, refuse pets, and are way to expensive? I don't want to be walked all over by her boyfriend to be forced to put their living expenses on my student loans. I can't bear to see her living in conditions that I fully know will decrease her life satisfaction and expectancy. I realize medicare would cover the cost of an in-home aid to check on her throughout the day but I don't think I could balance trying to ace my exams/ clinicals if I'm taking care of her. I have three siblings and they all refuse to help out. My only other option would be to have her wait until I finished residency at 28 years old but I think that's way too long. Similarly, I don't have the funds to place her in an assisted living complex.

I'm currently living in student housing at college with three roommates. Our dorms are set more like apartments, so we all have separate bedrooms and then a living room and kitchen.

200,"It may be difficult for me to portray my exact emotions on here but until I can see my therapist on wednesday, I just want to ask for some advice to help sort out my thoughts a little bit. I'm done oversharing with my friends I feel like they get so annoyed hahaha.

In October I said I was done with dating for a little while. I deleted my profiles off the apps and decided to go into the holidays single. Well, as fate would have it, I went to a party like two weeks after where I met someone I really like. We've been out a few times now, have a lot in common and she's so easy to talk to, our dates have just been us talking for hours.

I'm not concerned whether or not she likes me, she said it (albeit offhandedly) the last date we were on. She talked a lot about how I'm different from the guys she usually goes out with. I know I like her more than she likes me, but that's just how I operate, I've been like that with all of my past relationships. 

Now I feel like I have something to lose, though. I never meet people I actually like, I'm usually just kinda meh on all of them and go out a couple times before I call it quits. So I don't want to lose this. 

Because of that, I'm now getting anxious over what ""normal"" is at this stage. My past relationships are not good frames of reference for a couple reasons I won't get into, but regardless, I don't remember what ""normal"" is when I actually like her.

For instance, she hasn't texted me all day today. Is that okay? Is that normal?

Would it be normal if I texted her tomorrow, something sweet? Or would it be crowding or smothering her?

If I don't text her this weekend, and she doesn't text me, is it a bad sign? I do know she's a very busy person and she has a lot of things this weekend.

I think I'm honestly good at not behaving in a needy or clingy way. I understand space and what it means. But that doesn't mean I don't get anxious. I'm worried I might not say or do the right thing or worse, say or do the wrong thing.

So can anyone help me? Help me to understand what normal is for this stage? I just don't want to stumble around and mess something up.

Thanks!",23Nov2019,1

(was basically calling us both fat for previous arguments). 

after this happened, i was so hurt and upset and then proceeded to ask my friend what's wrong with me and our mutual friend told her and then she went on to say a lot of hurtful things along the lines of ""we were never friends, I was just being nice to her"" (despite her actually calling me her best friend, hanging out with me 24/7, etc). that hurt and naturally i did vent to her ex boyfriend because he is my best friend too and he is always there for me. mind you i never mentioned her to him during the span of our friendship bc she couldn't stand him and wanted her life to be private from his but i was at a very low point and had no one else.

eventually she told one of our mutual friends that she never felt comfortable being friends with me after the breakup because of the fact im STILL friends with her ex-boyfriend. it just sucks bc i feel like 2 years of my life was wasted and hers, she doesn't seem to give a single shit, her apologies were not genuine (she lied about certain things and I had to call her out) but now I just can't seem to stop thinking about it and it's bothering me a lot.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a year and a half, other than a small week long break in the summer we’ve been inseparable. Let’s call my ex josh. But Josh has been struggling with himself, he’s suffered from depression pretty hard in the last few months. And as sad as it is it has taken our toll on our relationship. We decided to take a break in the summer to work on ourselves but ended up getting back together a week later. With the promise that we were ready, and happy. And everything has been fine until recently. 

About a month ago I found out my mom (44f) has breast cancer.  This news was absolutely devastating to me. Considering I recently live alone I haven’t really had anyone to really be there for me, and I’ve been trying so hard to be strong for my mom. 

But my mom is getting surgery in 2 days. A double mastectomy. And Josh out of nowhere says he wants to break-up, with the same reason as last time (work on ourselves, decide what we want, etc.) and he also is mentioning serving an LDS mission. This news hit me hard, especially considering the proximity to the mission. And I’ve been a complete mess. I really just don’t know where to turn, as I need someone to help me through this. And I don’t want to talk to a counselor really. I’m so grateful for Josh to be able to better himself, and grow. But I’m so scared of losing him. 

I’ve had a series of nightmares for weeks where I first lose josh then my mom. And they are coming true. 

I really hope Josh decides what he wants and comes back soon. But I’m nervous he’s going to break up with me again. And I told him he can’t come back to me unless he is ready to fully commit. 

I’m struggling with how to interact with my mom about all of this because I’m so scared of adding extra stress to her life.

218,"**Backstory**: She was my best and only friend. We met on school and then she migrated to Australia about 6 years ago. We were always on good terms and we were always communicating. She was my best friend and only friend with whom I could be me. I knew she was bi sexual and she had discovered it way before. It was about a month back that she asked me to date her. I was hesitant but wanted to try it out. The point here to be noted is only way we communicated was social media and dating wasn't different. After me sending her few nudes that she asked, she said she might be fully gay and needs to break up. I said it was okay, and slid out slowly. I don't know what to do right now.

But the problem is, is that we're housemates and he saw me cleaning and swiped spaghetti sticks from the table onto my hair and he and his friends won't stop looking at me.

226,"I'm a 15-year-old girl, I go to a public school, normal stuff.

I've always been a very emotional kid. In elementary school I was prone to crying outbursts, and I would often get upset over little details. Even now, I'm known as the ""crying girl"" at my school. I often miss classes because I'm crying in the bathroom, and all of my teachers have had me randomly breakdown in their classes multiple times. I know its not the fault of anyone around me because quite frankly, I'm one of the few kids that looks forward to coming to school each day. I love all my classes and teachers, I have the best friends in the world, and I'm lucky to have a family that supports me and takes care of me. 

Despite this, I as stated earlier, I am prone to emotional outbursts. It's usually crying, but in some cases, it's been a little different. Anyways, no matter how hard I try, I just can't stop myself from crying. My parents are aware of what's going on, but as of right now we're unsure whether or not to try and see a doctor, or whatever, but at the moment nothing is going on. I've started to notice my crying sessions have become a lot more frequent, and I really don't know if it's just hormones or something involving my mental health. This is where I turn to Reddit. I've done some research already, and I know I'm not bipolar and I don't have depression, so if there's something wrong with me, I want to know. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, and it's possible this is just normal, but I don't think so. 

So if anyone on this subreddit has had a similar experience, or if anyone's a phycologist, I really just want to know if there's something wrong with me.

228,"I feel so dead and afraid to post this. I'm a single male and in my 30's. Please don't take any of this offensive. I'm terribly sorry if I offend anyone. 

Brief background. Growing up and coming from a Christian household. I'm probably going in too deep about this and setting myself up for embarassment. 

So here is the problem. I'll look at it from two ways: what they say, what I say. To the best of my ability, I've been taking advice from superiors. They guide me on what to do and what not to do. But everything for me (at least what I believe) has gotten complicated.

I've already had this conversation before on reddit. To jog memory (and again, I apologize to any who take this offensive. I can't stress this enough, I had unprotected sex (Yes. It still deeply bothers me).

I've seeked professional help in terms of worries and how I was feeling. Fast foward a bit, been reading a study bible with secondary sources. But I've been beating myself up more and more about what I've done. Yes. I've had problems before sexual intercourse such as pornography and masturbation. Apologize in advance if I start to make this a bible lesson. Some of the things I've seen and watched in pornography may seem sexually immoral. I don't want to point fingers at certain industries saying it's their fault when I picked up the porn. 

I understand people make mistakes and second chances may come. I've been reading about lack of companionship/aloness and marriage between husband and wife. I feel very very guilty and don't know if I am looking at things very legalistic. 

While I've read that, ""Eros is not dirty and comes from pure hands and a clean heart from a holy God,"" a verse from Hebrews 13 makes it seem otherwise (marriage should be kept pure in bed). 

What also concerns me is a document I've read from the West Ministers Confession of Faith concerning marriage and divorce. One section reads, ""Adultery or fornification commited after a contract, being detected before marriage, giveth ocassion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract.""

According to that, I'm screwed. I could very well be left and trampled on by a partner. Yes. There may be laws out there (like the husband and wife cannot testify against each other in a court of law), but laws can only do so much if there is no integrity. In the bible 1 Kings ch 21 makes a clear example of that (the story of the vineyard). 

I'm in a rut. I am trying to look at things through scripture and could very well miss everything. Can some help guide my train of thought? Any advice?",23Nov2019,1

235,"Okay so, this is a mix of a rant and a friendly ask for advice,

People always say, ""don't invest your time into a girl that isn't equally as invested in you"", but for me once I start catching feelings for a girl (in my case I've had for about a year and a half now) I just can't seem to get her out of my head. She goes to the same school as me and I can't even try to avoid her so it' so hard to ""block"" her out. I hate how people say ""just forget about her"" or ""move on and talk to more people"", but it's a lot easier said than done. I'm in a rigorous academic program so I don't have time to meet new females, so I'm constantly around my close circle of friends, where the girl I have feelings for is also. Honestly, I don't know how to stop thinking about her, I feel like she's the perfect one for me and I know she doesn't NEARLY think about me the same amount I do for her. 

Anyone have any advice for just forgetting and moving on because honestly thinking about her and liking her has made me miserable because I know I won't ever be with her.

238,"I apologize in advance for the cringe and weird post if you don’t believe me I don’t blame you I’m still trying to figure it out myself.

I live with my grandparents and my 3 cousins Mike(M19), Julie(F21), and Logan(M18) of course these aren’t their real names. I work a 9-9 shift so whenever I’m home people are either asleep, at school, or out and about. I get home and I usually check with Logan and Mike to see if their awake before I call it a night myself. I walked in to find only Logan asleep and Mike no where to be found yet his phone was on the charger so he was home. No one was showering so I assumed Mike went to the backyard to smoke. Julie is notorious for falling asleep with the TV on so it’s a force of habit to always shut if off for her unless she’s awake. However, I walked in on Mike at the end of the bed sucking Julie’s(who’s sleeping) feet..I know I’m just as confused as you are. It took me about 3 seconds to process what was happening until I whispered to get Mike’s attention. He got her toes out his mouth and looked at me like I wasn’t supposed to be in her room. He quickly walked out while also escorting me out as well. Mike said goodnight and went straight to his room. I wanted to say something right there and then but I don’t know what to say, telling my grandparents is pointless since Spanish is there first language and we all tend not to bother them with anything in general.

242,"I just found out that I am 4 weeks pregnant and due 8/1/20.

A little back story: I am in a committed relationship. My boyfriend is successful and works very hard, comes from an amazing, loving, and supportive family. 

I have a different family background. My mother is born and raised Guyanese, living in the US. Back in 97 she was dating my dad who was  living in Guyana. She got pregnant with me, they married, and dad migrated. Parents fight often (I’m numb to it now after so long), and are separated but we all live together. I remember being 6 years old and mum tell me she’s getting a divorce &amp; saying horrible and vicious things about my dad and victimising herself. My dad has never said anything bad about her to me. Arguments are mostly one sided. 

They have dealt with infidelity. My father was seeing a woman out of town, mom found out, played the victim and had me hate my father for years. I found out that she was actually having an affair long before he did, and even introduced us to the guy and his daughters several times and encouraged me to befriend the girls. Bizarre. So my family has their issues. Not the most loving or supportive home. 

I was born in the US and have lived here my entire life. About two years ago, while in my second year of school, I was extremely depressed and attempted suicide by taking insulin. I went to Guyana to visit and ended up reconnecting to my culture and creating a new identity. For the first time in my life I felt like I was at home. I was finally at peace. I experienced true happiness and the feeling of being complete. Since then, I have been slowly moving my life to Guyana. I became a dual citizen and planned to move there after graduation. However, I was dismissed from my University for missing a semester (due to my suicide attempt and serious depression). I have been gaining work experience in the mean time and have applied to start back on campus in January, graduating in the fall. 

While in Guyana, I fell in love. My boyfriend is wonderful. He loves me, supports me, and is everything that I could ask for and more. We accept each other wholeheartedly and I truly believe we are soul mates. We have spoken about marriage, but wanted to wait until after I graduated. My father adores him, my mother rejects him and goes out of her way to be rude to him. When I ask why, she says she “said hello what more do I want” from her. She refuses to meet his family and even to be in the same room as him. It upsets her when other people praise him or engage with him. He still goes out of his way to greet her, try and hug her, and hold conversation. She’s gone as far as to say that she is disgusted by my relationship, and by the fact that I go to Guyana often.

Back to pregnancy - I was planning on getting an IUD inserted this month, but I felt a bit off. I took a few pregnancy tests. Low and behold… I am pregnant. I went to the doctor today to confirm it. I immediately told my SO and he is very supportive (and excited). He would love to have a child, but he doesn’t want me to be pressured because I am 22 and he does not want to hinder my life in any way. He even suggested that even if I don’t want a baby, I can sign everything over to him and he will raise it in Guyana (lol). 

He works very hard, so the financial support for the baby is there. He is living in Guyana though. I do fear, however, that my mother will remove me from her health insurance here when she finds out and continue to isolate me throughout pregnancy. I currently live at home with my family because it is so close to campus (even though I am not in school at the moment). I model freelance and make ok money, but I don’t have a full time job with benefits. My parents have supported me (health insurance, shelter, food), but I feel this will end when it is revealed I am pregnant. I really wanted to finish school and marry before having a baby, but I can’t imagine terminating this pregnancy just because of my mother. I have always dreamed of being a mum, and seeing how supportive my SO is really makes me want to continue my pregnancy. 

My main reasoning for termination would be the emotional abuse I would endure from my mum. She puts me down constantly, makes me feel worthless, doesn’t support my living in Guyana, and complains that she hates being a mother and no longer wants to be one. I can only imagine how things will be during the pregnancy. This breaks my heart. My SO and I believe that this is a blessing, although the situation is not ideal. We have all of the love in the world to give and I do not want to terminate my pregnancy solely because I will have no support from my mother. I just feel so stuck at the moment. I wonder if I am making the right decision or if I should seriously consider termination. Between school, where will we live, where will I spend my pregnancy, and if my mother discontinues my health insurance.

Any advice helps.",23Nov2019,1
243,"Ok, baseline is I got a girlfriend. Not a karma whore, just want it to get it out there first of all. Ok, now to the confusing part (for me anyway). Ok, I kissed her a couple days back and that kiss felt different. Everything just melted away when I felt her lips on mine. It felt like all my problems melted away while we were kissing. It felt like everything was fine for those couple seconds. When I pulled away I didn’t want it to end kind of thing. From that moment on I felt a nervous/somewhat good feeling everytime I think of her. And ever since that moment I really just wanna make out with her. I know it sounds weird but it’s how I feel. I can’t figure it out so that’s why I’m here.",23Nov2019,1
244," Be warned, this will be a long post. This is mostly just to help me clear my mind and maybe get some advice, but I doubt that many people care. I'm making this on a throwaway because this is kind of embarrassing, and I'll being saying a few things that sound like bragging- but I promise you I'm not, I just want to get the full picture out there. I'm telling this online, because while I have quite a few friends I trust, I have trust issues when it comes to this kind of stuff. Even my parents don't know.

So, I'm currently 15 years old (sophomore) and I have a big crush on this girl I've known for a couple years. I think she likes me too, but I'm not 100% positive. I feel kind of stupid making this post, but oh well. Anyways, these past couple of years, I've glowed up a little. I still have a couple of ugly features, like my nose (pretty big) and my weight (6'0"", 175 pounds, although I'm in the process of losing weight). A girl I face-timed even said I was an 8/10, and that has stuck with me for awhile, even though I'm pretty sure she was exaggerating. I still have yet to hit my growth-spurt, and I'm not fully done with puberty I believe.

So, now the girl. We've known each other since we started high school and she's in about half my classes. She's really pretty and kind, which is why part of my brain thinks it's too good to be true that she likes me. I see her looking at me a lot, and when I glance at her, she looks away. She also started a few things between us like saying ""hi (insert name)"" to each other everytime we look at each other, even if we just said ""hi"" two minutes ago, and much more. I know that kind of sounds stupid and it sounds like she's just being friendly, and maybe she just is, but it feels *different* for some reason. I look forward everyday to being in class sitting next to her, and I get happy when she starts a conversation with me, all that kind of stuff.

I'm a pretty charismatic and likable guy, and my self-esteem has gone up pretty high over the past two months thanks to newfound ""popularity."" It's not really that, but I notice a lot people know me and I don't know them, as well as extremely popular kids starting to like me as a friend. I'll have random people walk by and say ""hi (name)"" and I'll no idea who they are. I've also had many people friend me on SnapChat these past couple months out of nowhere, and I don't know why all this is happening. Whatever the reason, my self-esteem and happiness are at an all-time high. I bring this up, because despite me being in a great place right now, I'm still extremely insecure about small things and still have bad anxiety about things in general.

I think part of the reason I'm so worried about asking her on a date, is because I asked out another girl out to the dance in **7th grade**, more than 3 years ago, and she rejected me. I was really ugly and not as likable as I was now, and I know that. But something about that embarrassment, awkwardness, and ridicule that came from that kind of turned off the idea of asking people out.

I feel like she would say yes, but I just don't want to take that risk. What if she says no? That would be devastating for me. Even if I were to become a 10/10 6'8"" model, I would still feel the effects of that rejection. I know it sounds dramatic, but that's just me.

I also think some people are starting to catch on that I like her. Mostly after I got a ride home from her and my friend founder her on my ""best friends"" list on SnapChat. I need to make a decision soon. A friend of mine even asked if I liked her during lunch. I shrugged it off and said I like her as a friend, but not as a girlfriend-type thing. I couldn't tell if he believed it or not, but whatever.

I'm aware this post made it sound like I'm bragging, and I'm sorry for coming off that way. I mostly made this post for myself and to talk to an empty void- I just needed to talk to something. I really like this girl, and I know a lot of people's advice when it comes to this kind of stuff is ""tell her how you feel,"" and such, but I just can't do that. There's still that thing in my brain that's preventing me from doing it. If the few of you somehow read all this, thanks. I really mean it.",23Nov2019,1
245,"I'm a 16 year old junior in high school and recently over the past few months I've been not going to school as much and just staying home to play video games. I used to always want to go but not to learn but because high schools diplomas is necessary for a decent job. So my step dad who has been with me for about 10 years now. He's done a lot of stupid things and is constantly cheating on my mom(she's aware of it) and our living situation is what it is now because of the mistakes he's made and my mom's unwillingness to take control. Anyhow recently I got a hold of my dad's credit card and been spending it like crazy this month. Today my mom called me while I was sleeping  saying that he claims to have lost 5k in the bank. I did some calculating and only found that I around 600-800 without over drawing(I know it isn't right). My dad started an investigation and made a police report and I may be going to jail for unauthorized purchases. My step dad after messing up for so many things and basically not being a father figure(in my eyes) decided that he'll pay back my dad so that I don't end up in jail. Where did the rest of his money go I'm not even sure but he's probably been getting ripped off by someone long before I got his card.

Another instance is where in my household we have xfinity WiFi and my older brother pays for it(he's in a marine base currently) Whenever we are nearing the data limit I begin pausing people which in short no longer gives then access to the WiFi. The problem with that is within my house there are these connection blockers so the 4g within the house is shit and people can't make calls. My older brother told me to pause people when we begin nearing our data limit as it charges him more for every 100 we go over. I got home from school and my little brother begins to tell my mom how I paused his phone and laptop. I began arguing with the two telling them how it's important we don't make my older brother pay more then what he already is. My step dad comes home after picking up his kids from work and immediately begins yelling at me for pausing his devices as well saying that I don't pay bills in this house and how I have no respect for him. ( I honestly don't) I told him that my brother said not to go over the data limit and then we both began yelling so I said fuck it and went to my grandma house. I get there and my mom already called her to give her side of the story and now my Grandma and Auntie are lecturing me. The oldest brother who is one of the main peace makers of the family gets home from work and tells me I can come back. I return and we have a whole conversation but the thing that stood out the most was how the step dad is always friendly to strangers but yells like a female when he's home.

247,"So my brother got his school results today and to no one's surprise, he failed to go to the last year of high school by 1%, which is next year. So he's been screaming and crying *lightly*. My parents are teachers at the school so of course, it's a bit embarrassing. We tried to help him by sending him to tuition and extra classes and I wanted to help him for the past year but he refused so I let it go. 

Now the thing is, I know that by writing a letter to the school, he can actually go up next year. The thing is that my parents and I are not sure if it's the best decision for him to go up. He's been making empty promises and we've all warned him about this outcome for the past few months and he's taken it lightly. 

But if we let him stay for the same year, of course first, we can afford it but his school fees and his tuition fees is quite high . Second, we don't know if he'll get laughed at for retaining a year. Third, we feel like it'll be a good lesson for him but we're not sure.

251,"Ok sooooo let’s start off at the beginning. All the way back to 2011. That is when my dad started having affairs(as far as I know). It was a common thing with this girl all the way up to 2015, 2016. He did it regularly and I assume lied to my mom. Then near the end of last summer looking through my dads old iPhone I found texts with girls names I had never heard of, even some with hearts. After looking at the texts I took pictures of the texts and left it at that. I though my that since he stopped I wouldn’t have any reason to do anything but if he started again I could use them. Fast forward to this Thursday, the day that he left for his business trip, I looked at his phone and on a messaging I had never seen before I saw a text saying, “lets have fun the the casino this weekend.” I didn’t believe it at first but I looked at his most recent old phone. It had a password but after a few tries I got it. Luckily it was still connected to all the accounts and I didn’t have much trouble. After looking through a bunch of texts with a bunch of different woman. I took photos of every single one and put the phone back where I found it.

253,"the first tattoo i got was very small and cute and not very noticeable, so that wasn't a big deal. but i decided, on a whim, to get a pretty big tattoo of fry from futurama above my wrist. i, personally, love it. but im not sure how to tell my boyfriend. he definitely is not a fan of tattoos in general, and i did tell him i was gonna get another one a while back, but the one i told him i was gonna get was pretty and meaningful and stuff (i decided against it last minute to go with fry).

 should i send him a picture? should i just hint at it? wait till i see him in person? wait until he discovers it himself? im super nervous.

256,"Hello everyone. I’m a 19 year old 5’5 black male from America and I never had a girlfriend before but I’ve had one date and two hookups with two different girls. I was 17 when I went on my first date ever with a girl, we exchanged nudes before our date which made it more awkward to be honest. Turns out she didn’t like me after our date so I took it the wrong up and said things to her an incel would say but I later apologized. A year after my 1st date, in the summer of 2018 I lost my virginity by hooking up with a girl who was visiting from out of town at a hotel. A week or two later, I hooked up with a girl I’ve been talking to on an dating app. Even though had sex with girls I still don’t know how to really talk to them, I’d like advice on how to talk to girls and things like that.",23Nov2019,1
257,I just I don’t know.. I just feel empty but then other times I’m happy. I have homicidal and suicidal thoughts but I’ve never hurt anyone else in a way that would scar or maim them at least. Myself well that’s a different story. I never really mention my homicidal thoughts to my therapist cause I have no intention on acting on them and I don’t want to be sent to a psych ward again. But I just I feel like a see saw of emotions.. but it’s mostly anger. A lot of anger honestly. From being irritable to almost choking my significant other during a well... sexual moment but I got too excited by it and held for a lot longer than I should’ve. They said it scared them but I don’t think I’m a monster I don’t think I’m anything. Though I will admit I felt some type of guilt towards what I did to them but I want to do it again honestly. It’s a rush I can’t get from anything else besides I suppose sex. I don’t have any goals I actually want to achieve. I’m getting a job but just cause I like material things. As for college I’ve considered going back but the last time I tried to do it my brain just I don’t know I couldn’t handle all the classes. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me.. I just want to know why I’m like this? Psychatrist’s have given me several diagnoses but also recanted them. The only one they have taken off is major depressive disorder and PTSD. (As for what they recanted autism spectrum disorder and bipolar but they didn’t even tell me which one I know there’s more than one type) Whenever I do go to the hospital I just fake being better to get out. It feels like a jail to come I can’t do anything I actually enjoy there plus the patients they never tend to like me even though I don’t say anything. I guess I just seem weak or annoying to them. I do best to try and not socialize at times cause I just feel as if everyone I meet is a snake. I’ve told people stuff in confidence only to find out from someone else that they told them. I’m sorry I wrote so much I just don’t know how to fix myself I feel like I’m just a broken version of what I should be.,23Nov2019,1
258,"I'll keep it short, I've been in a fantastic relationship for a fair while we were friends for 10years before we got together and I was good friends with her brother the same amount of time. 

Recently he has begun putting me down a lot, never in a serious way and always through the guise of 'a joke' he's always laughing when he says this stuff. 

For example, I said something cliche and he laughs and says 'your a simpleton aren't you, always with the platitudes'.

If there is ever a childish chance to compare me to a 'bitch' or to make fun of how skinny I am he'll take it.

I'm unsure where it's come from and I would like some help setting boundaries and doing something to make sure it stops in the future. I miss our dynamic.

I'm unsure whether to go down the confrontation route and talk to him about it, or to reduce my time spent there. I have overcome an anger problem and now actively try to avoid violence and confrontation.

Maybe there is a way I'm unsure of.

I do retort back where possible but sometimes it's just like a blatant 'you suck haha' so there isn't anything witty to play on. 

He has a history of self harm and being emotionally unstable so i feel like if I made jabs about his personal stuff that it would seriously upset him. Although he doesn't seem to care about mine.

Any advice men of reddit?

259,"My sister has autism and ran away without telling anybody. Now, every police station is telling me I can't do anything because she's a legal adult.

My sister is 21 years old and she is high on the spectrum of autism. She went to work on Thursday 11/21 and her manager told my mother she left at 6:00 PM. After that, she didn't return home. I opened her Uber account that was still logged into the family computer and the last trip she used an Uber for was to get to an inn nearby. I went to the inn where they said she didn't check out a room although the front desk lady recognized her face and told me she left the place with a man that was her boyfriend, which in the past she told us she stopped seeing this person after we didn't approve of the relationship. The age gap was wide and the man had children, and also the manager would tell my mother that he seemed to be up to no good.

The next day, we contacted the police to file a missing persons report. She had work the next day but didn't show up. After we called the police and they come to ask me questions, I checked my laptop to see if she had any other accounts with the password remembered which is where I found my mother's credit card was used in Savannah, Georgia. We live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for reference. I was taken to a police station where they found more information about the man she left with. The police were able to call the man that also was with my sister where she said she was unhappy with her family and left.

This is unlike her at all, she has never said anything about wanting to run away or seemed angry at her family. My family are all worried because this man seemed to have complete control of my sister and is manipulative, telling her that she is an adult and ready to make these decisions when she has autism and has a bad time making judgments. The police station officers told me if she consents to being with this person, then there is nothing we can do. I also contacted the police in Savannah, Georgia where they also said as long as she's an adult and consents, there isn't much we can do. Again, she has severe autism and she has taken my mother's credit card and moved away with a person we believe is a threat to her. Is there anything I can do for my sister to come home?  


EDIT: We also found some of our money missing that we keep for a bad day. She works very extreme amounts of hours at her job and she should making a lot of money but over the weeks, she keeps telling us she has no money in her account. When I tried to log on to her Gmail account, it gave me an error message that she changed her password 21 days ago which tells me she may have planned this. Her planning skills are awful, so I can only believe her boyfriend planned this out with her for a long time.",23Nov2019,1
260,"So, for starters, this is a LONG story. Second, I'm a 22 female.

Ever since I was born, I have lived with my grandparents. I didn't know my father and my mother, who I didn't know was my mother until I was 5, was A) 18 when she had me, B) was not the most motherly person in the world, which I will explain, and C) she went into the service back in 2001. 

I loved my grandparents very much and I do believe I had a wonderful childhood the best that I could. They never really let me outside as a child because we had drug dealers living across the street, child molesters down the street, a possible cult somewhere in the neighborhood, and just bad people altogether, I remember the police a lot coming to our neighborhood at least once a week. So, I didn't have friends until elementary school, but it wasn't until my second time in kindergarten. I didn't talk to people outside my close family until I was 6.

Like I  had said, I didn't know my mother was my mother until I was 5, and to me, I was excited, but I didn't realize what that would mean. It was at this time the abuse started, except I didn't know it was abuse. I only saw her maybe once every 3-5 years. In those times, when I was 5, this was around the time I found out she was my mother, she gently took ahold of my face in her hands and told me I looked like my father until she started digging her nails into my face. When I was 7, she came home and to wake me up in the morning, she would pull me out of bed by my hair and onto the floor before getting in my face and yelling ""Good Morning"" in a cheerful voice. When I was 12, she put me in a chokehold until I saw spots and hit the floor. My grandfather heard me hit the floor and came in to see what was going on. The reason why she put me in that chokehold was to ""teach me how to defend myself"". 

When she got out of the service 8 years later, we found out that she's bipolar.

By this time, I'm in Junior High. She wanted me to go live with her, but I said I didn't want to leave my home. I don't remember having much contact with her after that.

Freshman year, my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and it hit me hard. The end of my Sophomore year is when he passed away and it felt like my whole world died with him. He was the only person I ever saw as my dad. He was the only father figure I had and we were very close. My mother wouldn't let me say goodbye when he died.

Fast forward to Senior year. I'm 18 and she now wants to tell me how to run my life.

Backing up a little too after my grandfather passed, my grandmother's brother moved in. Back to Senior year, my grandmother was in the hospital and he had molested me. He never raped me because I got out of the situation before it could get far. I contacted bother my mother and my aunt, her sister, about the situation after I barricaded my door for the night. My aunt helped me, but my mother told me to be quiet and not to tell anyone because my grandmother needed him more than I needed to be safe.

I did tell the police the next day in the principal's office after my band director walked me up there after I told him what happened. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do because there was no evidence and it was my word against his, even though the officer has known me since elementary school and my grandparents. He did leave the house though and then it was just my grandmother and I.

Fast forward to now. This past summer, my mother told me that she was upset at my lack of a love life. I do not have a boyfriend and I'm still a virgin. It's not that I'm not interested in boys, I am, there's just one that I like, but he's taken and I'm still trying to get over that fact (or hope they break up and I get a chance).

She compares me to my half brother all the time saying he has a healthy love life and I need to get on it. She's tried hooking me up with guys in their 30s. I'm 22, let me find someone closer to my age or someone I'm interested in.

Second, we both, my brother and I, had car accidents. He hit someone head-on and was life-flighted to the hospital. I hit black ice and launched myself into a guardrail, but I walked away. My mother came in to see him after they hadn't talked to each other for almost 10 years. For me, she told me how I was an idiot and I needed to get over it. Now, I don't care she didn't freak out as she did with my brother, but it just upset me when I thought back to the times I was in the hospital or had surgery. 

When I was about 5 or 6, I had my tonsils taken out and a week later, I started coughing up blood. My grandmother called her and told her and my mother literally asked, "" Well, do you need me to come back?"" You shouldn't have to ask for permission to come back, you should want to come back. In my Junior year, I had my wisdom teeth taken out over winter break. She came in for it, but after it was done and I was resting up after it. She and my grandmother gotten into an argument and she left even after I begged her to stay.

This past Christmas, my grandmother and I went to send it to my aunt and her family. My mother lives less than an hour away from her. The week we were there, we saw her three times. When she came and got us, and twice while we were at my aunt's. Both visits, she picked fights, upset my grandmother to the point she, my grandma, was saying she, herself, wishes she was dead, in front the two youngest kids, at the time 4 and 8, and I ended up going upstairs and calling one of my college professors, who I go to church with and they would come and get me. I was crying on the phone with her after telling her everything that happened.

She surprised me though. I told her that I needed a mom to talk to, but my problem was my mother. She told me that she thought of me as more of a daughter than her own, she doesn't have the best relationship with her because she's like my mother. For the first time since my grandfather passed, I actually felt wanted. This is also around the time I've started seeing her for what she was and what she did to me.

So now to the reason I'm posting this. I'm in college and still living with my grandmother to help her. This past summer, I ended up finding out who my father was and started getting in contact with his family. I was taking a chemistry class and I had a lab on Monday. Well, I was meeting my great aunt and my great uncle for the first time after one of these labs. Back when my grandfather was diagnosed with the cancer, I was in therapy and I was diagnosed with severe anxiety.

I still suffer from this and because of it, I was building myself up to a panic attack about meeting them and how they were going to think of me. My chemistry teacher is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. After class, he asked me to stay back and we talked. He asked me different questions and I'm the type of person who will spew everything out. Eventually, I told him almost everything, I didn't tell him about the ""she being upset that I'm a virgin"", but he did become someone I could talk to.

This fall, I took his next level chemistry class and this was around the time I found out my mother was planning on moving back and move in with grandma and I. She was also not happy about the fact that I was talking to my father. I had told him about it, and me being the anxious person I am, I bought a lockbox to keep important things my grandfather had, mostly rare types of money and my papers, but I was saving it for my aunt's two kids, who are more like my niece and nephew. I asked him if he could hold onto the extra key because I was afraid my mother would kill me, I wouldn't put it past her. The reason why I asked him was because he lived so far and she wouldn't find him.

I didn't as we decided on a different plan. He wants me out of this situation and so he started looking for someone to help me. First, he looked for a counselor in the school I could talk to, but after arguing with his dean, he found there were no counselors in counselors school any longer. The reason why he was arguing with the dean was because this man, who I never met, wanted to know about the whole situation of what I was going through and my teacher said that was between me and him. We were able to finally find me a therapist outside of the school and I absolutely love him.

Well, recently, I hadn't realized that he and the professor I called over Christmas were worried about me and had gone to this dean about it.

I had gone into a depression after my mother's last visit. She cussed both my grandmother, her mom, and I the entire time. Her one dog, she has two, destroyed our home. After she left, she would call and harass me at work about how I need to do more for my grandmother and that I need to drop everything in my life to take care of her. My grade had dropped in chemistry and I was beginning to withdraw. 

A few weeks ago, I had gone to see the mom professor, since my chemistry teacher canceled class for that day, as she's my advisor for my classes and when I need help with one of my science classes, I go to her. That day it was about my chemistry project as I was having trouble finding a few answers to some questions and thought maybe she would have some idea or resource. After that, she had a meeting she needed to go to with one of the deans. I don't know if it was a certain meeting I will mention soon. Anyways, she left her classroom open for her students to finish up and so I stayed to keep watch of the room since it was a laboratory and me, being a former student worker of hers, knew it could not be left unattended while it was unlocked. Once she came back, we walked out and I left. This was Wednesday.

The next day, I got a message from one of my friends in security that someone had filed a complaint against me. When I asked my friend about it, he said that the head security guard said it was for stalking a professor. I was upset and me being the anxious person I am, thought I was going to be expelled or sent to jail. That night and into the next day, I emailed all the professors I associated with and they all said no, but it turns out my friend wasn't suppose to send me that notice and I had stupidly sent it to my chemistry professor. Later I get an email from this dean requesting a meeting with him and my chemistry teacher on Monday just before my class, this was Friday.

Monday rolls around, I'm stressed, stressed about the entire thing all weekend and thinking of different scenarios that could happen. I get there and this dean humiliated me in front of my teacher and his, the dean, secretary who he asked to sit in on this meeting. My mind was thinking that my teacher was the one who reported me to security. On top of all that, he tells me that my friend, whom I asked about, lost his job and that he was probably going to try and kill me as retaliation for getting him fired and they would press criminal charges against him if he tried, so if I needed to talk or have any concerns, then I could contact him. This man then preceded to give me his business card which I threw away once I got down to my car. I fought with myself about going to class or not. I do, but I'm numb the entire time. Thoughts are running through my head and one common one I felt like doing was taking an entire bottle of pills once I got home. I don't obviously, but up until Wednesday, I felt the best option was just to kill myself. Part of me was angry and wanted to hurt them, but another part was hurt itself.

My friend has not talked to me since the incident, I felt that I didn't want friends or anyone for that matter in my life, and I still felt that suicide was I best option. The one I was mad at the most was my chemistry teacher. Why didn't he just talk to me first before filing that report? We could have worked this out. I wanted to hurt him, and I did.

Every class after that meeting, I stopped participating, what little I did, to begin with, because the other two people in my class would answer the questions before I had a chance, and any time he was within earshot, I made sure to say things about how I wanted to put a bullet in my head or jump off a cliff. I wanted to hurt him and I did.

Wednesday, I finally built up the courage to talk to him about that meeting. It was then I found out he wasn't the one who turned in the report against me to security, we still don't know who did, even though I have a idea, they still won't tell us. The day it was filed was the day he canceled class and I saw the mom professor. That was the day he and my other professor went up to his office for a meeting about me, they were fighting for me since they were worried. My teacher told that dean he was worried about me. My grades were dropping and I was withdrawing from people. He told that dean he wasn't qualified as my teacher to help me in this field and that they needed someone there for students to talk to. That dean told him that if he didn't want to deal with me then he needed to call security. My teacher said that calling security wasn't the answer so the dean said either he handles me or calls security. That's when he asked, ""What if she's trying to kill herself?"" The dean said ""Call security and let them handle it.""

My teacher continues to tell me that after I left, he asked about my friend and the dean told him the same thing, ""He may come after you and then we will press criminal charges."" He told me he didn't believe my friend would do that, but he was upset I lost a friend.

We also talked about the things I had said in class recently about me wanting to kill myself. I said that I mostly said it to hurt him because I thought he filed the report against me and he said he didn't know anything about it. He argued with the dean saying I needed to have a meeting with the person who filed it not him, the one who reported the fact that it was leaked. The dean said no, he was the one who had to be in that meeting because he was the one who made him aware of the leak.

The only reason why he turned it in, and I understand now, it was a safety issue. What if my friend sent someone a list of the guards on duty and where they would be and then that person brought in a gun?

Now, onto the advice I need. That night, as my teacher and I talked, he begged me not to do anything that would hurt me. He begged me not to kill myself. I brought this person who became my friend, not just my teacher, but my friend, to tears. I broke this man. He told me how he cares for me, how he cares for all his students. He told me how he takes home my situation every night and it bothers him. He told the dean this and he told my teacher he needs to stop that and to not care. He told that dean, how can he when he sees us for 5 hours a week? He's formed a relationship with all of us. He's called his girlfriend after our meeting with the dean and after class on his way home and told her he didn't know what to do. I didn't realize how many people I actually hurt.

This past weekend, I found out my aunt doesn't want me around. She lied to me saying she had a conversation with my grandma where she said grandma told her I said some things about her husband and she said she couldn't trust me around her husband so I wasn't welcomed in her home. I talked with my grandma because I dont remember this conversation and neither does she. Her kids are the closest I have to a niece and nephew and I dont want to lose that relationship.

I told my teacher this and I could see his heart break even more. He told me that I just couldn't catch a break and that I just keep hitting dead end after dead end.

I don't know how to fix this. I don't know how to tell him and everyone else close to me I'm sorry for not caring about my life that you all apparently did. I don't know how to get them to believe that I'll try harder to care and that I won't kill myself for them. For now, it's hard for me to do that for me, but hopefully, one day I can live for me. I just don't know how to tell them I'm sorry, I'll change, and I'll fight now that I know you are behind me. I don't know how to fix what I've broken. I don't want my teacher to worry about ""Will she be in class today or am I going to get a call that she's dead?"" I've broken him to the point of tears, now I want to fix that.",23Nov2019,1

266,"Okay this is gonna be long and ugly: 




A few months ago a friend and colleague threw me and another colleague under the bus because of workplace drama. We had been friends for 4 years and I literally went from being endlessly forgiving and patient with my friend when he made fuck ups to never wanting to speak to him again. What he did was a display of his true character and I realized he would always be the kind of guy to throw you to the wolves while making it appear like he was sacrificing himself if it came down to that. It was incredibly disappointing behavior. Over the span of three days he went behind my other colleague and my back and tattle taled and embellished and lied about things being said in private to pretty much every person on the planet. It's been a while since I've felt this helpless about what narrative was floating around me as a professional and as a person. Needless to say me and my colleague ended up getting hell from some of our associates while my friend blathered in about his own role in all of this which he skewed and twisted while making himself a martyr. I was in total shock. The fallout was that my colleague and I left the work environment and found another place to rent office space which was horribly stressful but now things are a lot better and it was the best outcome.





However, my colleague is a very gentle soul and has forgiven my snake of a friend because he apologized after the fact and it looks like we will eventually roam in the same circles again professionally but I want nothing to do with that guy. I have seen right through him and I know what he is. I will never ever trust somebody like that again because he has no loyalty and he is only out for himself. 





The thing is he's really good at appearing harmless and innocent and well meaning and he is those things as well but I know now that he's only loyal as far as he can get something out of it and one would not hesitate to through you or others under the bus over and over again if it me and he can avoid temporary discomfort. I really hate using this term but I've always had a very strong suspicion that he is incredibly low IQ based on his impulsive and very often poorly thought out behavior. He has no sense of self in public, he doesn't understand social cues and even if you directly tell him to not say or do x thing in x setting he will go: ooh right - and then continue on talking loudly about whatever inappropriate thing in inappropriate settings. 





One example was when we were taking public transportation and he would loudly diss a company he was working for - there was a very big likelihood of people working in that company or associating with that company being on that train since it was heading to that place and everyone on that particular train is workers getting to and from work. I noticed people turning to glance at us while my idiot friend would loudly put the company on blast. I tried to save it by playing devils advocate and try to make him see things from the company's point of view but he didn't listen or rather didn't get it, so I pulled put my phone and wrote: maybe not mention the company's name in public?




He went: aaah. Okay.... So that ""company"" I mentioned is just a bunch of 'insert slur here'""



Like I said - zero self awareness. He's the kind of guy who will only understand that he gas fucked up when he is faced with the consequences and then he will say ANYTHING in order to get out of the situation. He NEVER takes two seconds to think about when he should say something and when he should shut up. He will just show his belly like the omega he is and when the crisis has blown over he has learned nothing and changed nothing about his behavior. I can't believe it took me four years to finally realize that this bitch is a broken record.




 He's also very easy to manipulate and somebody that narcissistic/sociopathic people gravitate towards. He has often complained about having shitty friends who use him yet when I in the past tried to give him advice, because I have once been charmed by a psychopath myself and know which signals to look out for, he doesn't seem to listen. He talks a big game about what he wanna do next time those people step on his toes but I've known him long enough to know that when they step on him next time he's gonna take it like a little bitch because he has zero spine. He's not a beta male he's an omega. 



Anyway, he started befriending a guy who gave me really bad vibes and I tried many times to tell him why this guy was bad news but my friend told me I was wrong about him and that he was just struggling with his mental health and actually a good guy. Meanwhile I can see all the signs of that psycho using my friend as a puppet by planting his absurd worldviews in my friend, giving him vapid compliments and tiling him up when he wants to. My friend has a really bad temper. He will look for drama to be outraged about and he likes to attack anyone he sees as an ""other"" behind their backs but to their face is super nice to them. In the beginning of our friendship is was like that too but had a good hard look in the mirror in 2017 and decided I didn't want to be like that anymore so I worked on myself. 





I thought I could help my friend as well. I knew that his problem was that he is an omega and that this causes him to have a lot suppressed rage so I would talk to him about those things when I thought it was appropriate. I thought that if you just really support someone who struggles with themselves and encourages the good little things they do, you could help them improve and become stronger and better people. 




I tried talking to him about his relationship with his mother and in a gentle way I told him that his anger towards her was justified because no mother has the right to monitor their adult child's life and economy 24/7. I tried to encourage this delayed teenage rebellion he never had with his mom by telling him that growing up is hard both for you and your parents. It's hard for you because you need to find your own footing in life and it is hard for your parents because they have to learn to take a step back and let you win your own battles and make your own mistakes. But it is our job as the kids to sever the childlike bond between us and our parents and establish the new ground rules as equals. I thought I was helping him but he would still answer everytime his mother called him, even if he was in the middle of a deadline. I told him so many times to just ignore it but he is a slave to other people's whims and he has no dignity or boundaries and it doesn't look like he's about to take himself seriously anytime soon. It feels like he is always running on the reptile brain function and everything is impulsive or compulsive. 




The mere thought that I will have to be within his vicinity in the future makes me cringe because I just know that he will say something fucking stupid or awkward in front of the wrong people because this idiot has learned nothing as usual. One of my friends associated with him recently and they told me he was still as unselfaware as always and still saying and doing stupid shit. I think this guy is bad news for my career and if I'm going to associate with him in public in the future I will keep him at an arms length. I know for a fact that he thinks that we will be friends again someday when things have calmed down. I don't think he has even considered the severity of his actions and I had it confirmed the last time we talked where he outright told me that he needed to apologize to me, not for my sake but for his own, despite me telling him that I didn't want to talk to him and I didn't want to hear him apologize over and over again. He was fucking yelling ""I'm sorry"" so everyone in the building could hear it while I moved all my things out of the workspace. No comprehension of where we were or what I needed. It was all about him feeling better about himself. 





My colleague who has forgiven him told me they just didn't want to hold a grudge and he was clearly sorry and knew what he had done wrong so to my colleague everything was back to normal. I didn't say anything because my colleague is currently stuck on a project with my friend so I understand why they just want to focus on the positive and I'm not gonna force my opinions onto them under these circumstances, but it made me think: would it be more beneficial for everybody if I forgave but didn't forget and would just tolerate this guy being around me in my circles every now and then or should I make sure to avoid him at all costs? 




I already pretend like he doesn't exist when we pass eachother on the street. When someone screw me over like that and is hopeless to get through to, my instinct has always been to treat them like a stranger and basically ghost them online as well as offline. They are air to me. That might sound cruel but I have lived long enough and met enough people to know that sometimes it's a waste of effort to get through to someone who hurt you. I fear that if he starts coming around and I have to make polite smalltalk for the sake of my colleague (which I will because I will do nearly anything for my colleague tbh), this slimeball will mistake my politeness as me being his friend again because he really is that stupid. And maybe it's just the pride in me but it kills me when assholes thinks I like them or that they got out of a pickle with me just because I'm in a social setting where I have to tolerate them.

269,"Sorry for the format, but for context, I am in marching band and I have it as 0 period  but it’s only until January since it’s considered a summer sport. I am also the type of person who isn’t good at starting conversations and when I like someone I tend to stare. 

A= Crush
H= Mutual friend 
T= Mutual friend 

Today was the semi-finals for the football game and our marching band performed during half time. The only ones who perform are on field show A, H, and I are NOT in field show.

Before half time the people who are not in field show help tech or front ensemble (Front ensemble play instruments like marimbas which are essentially big xylophones on wheels) H and A help with tech and I help front ensemble.



Now for the actual story...

During field show’s practice I went to where tech was to see the game better before half time. H called me over and I guess sort of introduced me to this other person while A was also there. It was awkward for a couple of seconds and A said “you are always looking at T and you never talk,” H then proceeds to say “yeah she likes T.” I get super nervous and immediately disagreed in a serious tone and we proceeded to just wait for half time to come. 

I really really really hate myself for not saying anything else. I am pretty sure A thinks that I like T and me being the horrible non sociable person didn’t say anything and I regret it so much. 

Even after the game, while we were waiting to get dismissed, I had the chance to say something multiple times but I didn’t. I played the scenario so many times in my head where I would sort of clear things up but I got anxious. We even walked next to each other on the way out and no sound would come out of my mouth.

While I was walking to the spot where I get picked up I noticed that he was walking in front of me with a friend. Of course I start to stare and when his friend leaves we made eye contact for a good couple of seconds and I continued to walk instead of talking to him. I was given the chance once again but I was to anxious. 

I honestly don’t know what he thinks I can’t really clear things up on Monday because I have thanksgiving break. Either way I can’t really  do it when break is over because I never have time to talk to him after 0 period is over because our high school is separated into 2 and the kids in my grade have to quickly pack and cross over. He is also thinking of leaving next year so I won’t see him except when we go to the next school year. However there is a small chance when we go introduce the 8th graders to one of the schools. 

P.S: I have talked to him a couple of times but when H is around and I have sort of a reason to go over and most of the time I am to shy and don’t really know how to continue the conversation.",23Nov2019,1

271,"My mother is intolerable without her anti anxiety medication, she has some undiagnosed issues that haven’t been addressed also and her health is just deteriorating rapidly. 

She has an issue with alcohol and tried to commit suicide in my early teens when I was alone with her (she’s really bad with alcohol) 

I tried to help her with her health by cooking every single one of her meals so she didn’t eat any processed foods or refined sugars but she started drinking six days after even though she was feeling much better. 

My efforts always seem futile in the end and I have no idea what I should do now. She despises the idea of therapy, she had a traumatising childhood with little support and many issues arose because of that. 

She’s in a really bad head space and almost no one wants to be around her. She’s completely irrational and defensive over very small things.

So I left my old job as a team lead for a seasonal position in a different industry. Without really getting into the details of my old job, I'll just say the seasonal minimum wage position would actually end up being more money.

I worked one half shift at the seasonal job. Then didn't hear back about getting shifted again and at the same time, got another job offer. This new offer was for the same position I held at my old job but in this new industry (basically even more money), I'd be stupid not to take it. 

I forgot to follow up with the seasonal job. And they called me a few days ago and I kept forgetting to call them back being so busy with school and training at my new team lead job. I feel embarrassed and anxious about not calling them right away to let them know I have found work else where.

273,"My (26F) brother is 16, and will be 17 in March 2020. Where I live, it is legal to move out at 17, but your parents are still legally responsible for you until 18. He has already told us he's leaving when he turns 17; he's a typical 'the world's against me, I think I know everything' teenager. So he already sort of does his own thing and because my mom is tired of dealing with his attitude and rage she just sort of let's him do whatever he wants without consequences because let's face it, even when he was 4 he ran the house. There was no controlling him. Dylan does what Dylan wants to do. So anyway as of last year he's (without my mother's knowledge) been buying juuls and those vapes with the cbd oil and smoking pot with his friends and I knew about it and haven't said anything. I mean back to the typical teenage behavior, everyone does it, and he wasn't out doing any hard drugs or keeping it a secret so I figured as long as he told me what he was doing it was fine. Weed is weed. Well he just recently got his license and he has 2 jobs and bought his self a jeep and now has all the freedom he could want. He hasn't been pulled over yet for speeding but he's admitted it to me that he does it and he sometimes races the neighbor kid to the busstop in the mornings, which is 2 blocks from our house. He's reckless. To top it off, I just caught him with weed in his car. I've told him that idc that he does it but not to bring it to the house and not to drive with it in his car. Especially since he's going to get pulled over if he keeps speeding the way he does, and now if they find weed in him he'll be in even more trouble. My question is, I know I should tell our mother. For obvious reasons. I mean he could get hurt considering idk where or who he's getting this stuff from, and he could get arrested and that would put stress and financial strain on my mother and him with his jobs and school and college scholarships and stuff. But I'm worried it'll ruin the trust he has with me and that he won't tell me anything anymore. Like what if he starts exploring harder drugs or speeds or gets a ticket or something and now he can't trust me and so no one ever finds out and won't be able to help him? I'm also worried that even if I tell my mother there's nothing really she can do.. He's leaving in 4 months. What punishment do you give to a 16 year old who thinks he has the world all figured out?

275,"I’m 17, will be turning 18 in a couple of days, and it suddenly hit me that my dad is going to be 70 this upcoming June, and my mom 60 this upcoming July. 

It’s never bothered me before that they’re much older than all my friends parents, but I think the sudden awareness that I’ll be 18 very soon made me more aware of it. I know death’s a natural part of life and it’s something everyone goes through, but my emotions are getting the best of me at the moment. 

There’s just so many things that will happen in my life that I know they won’t be able to see. And that honestly makes me so sad and terrified. 

My dad getting older gets me the most.  He had other children before me, my half siblings, and they’re much older than I am. And maybe I’m being childish, but they’ve had so many years with my dad and I’ve barely had 17 years with him. For context, my dad and mom never married. They don’t live together, I’ve always lived with my mom. I envy my half siblings, not only did they get more years with him, they actually had lives with him physically there, while I have had to make do with phone calls and very rare visits every couple months. 

I know it’s childish, and I know because of that they have ‘more’ to be upset about when it happens, but don’t I have that right too?

276,"In my student house I had my laptop on the kitchen table as I was cooking while doing university work. My flatmate accidentally spilt a lot of water over my laptop and it completely broke. Apple said it would cost £500 to fix. At the time I was really struggling my money (my dad had just been made redundant and my student loan did not even cover my rent costs). My friend however got double the student loan I did. At the time I really had the mentality that she should pay for the repairs. Now months later I am thinking was I in the wrong?

FYI this situation really affected our friendship - I heard her bitching about me (saying that she had got me a banner and some balloons for my birthday so I should be paying for the repairs). Other people would also come up to me at university and say oh I’ve heard a lot about the laptop.

Another things to note: everyone in my house always worked with their laptops at the kitchen table including this specific flatmate.",23Nov2019,1
278,"So I’ve been unemployed for awhile and Ive been going back and forth with the idea of trading in my car (has only 5k miles), since I need the money. This is a last resort since I love my car, it’s basicslly brand new, and I’d hate to give it up. Doing so just doesn’t feel right, would be a financial loss in the long run, and I’m very hesitant. 

One night I spent some time checking listings, and saved some that I liked. My situation didn’t improve so I decided to look again about a month later and I noticed this one Mustang I had interest in was still there, and they reduced the price. 

So I finally contacted the dealership about it and found out it was sold the day prior. I think it had been there total for about 2 months if I recall correctly. 

It was then a toss up between two Camaros, one here in town and one 5 hours away in Vegas. I’m very picky and there’s very few that match my criteria such as color, packages, price, mileage, etc. All the stars need to align, hence I need to go far and wide.

Here’s where things get a little bizarre. The local Camaro had been listed for 63 days as of today. I didn’t even bother to call before visiting the dealership because it serioslly couldn’t have been sold. Well, I was wrong. They sold it yesterday. 

So I thought ok, Plan C. I’ll just go for Vegas and save $1000 since that one was a better deal anyway. Well, I discover today there’s a nail in my tire. Not only that, but the tire store couldn’t even fix it and I need a new tire. 

So now I’m just wondering if I’m being sent a clear message from the universe that this isn’t meant to be. Like maybe I’ll have a job in the next month or so and I shouldn’t make this sacrifice. 

I don’t know, I need advice. This is a tough decision for me and I’m in a bit of distress so I may not be making the best decisions right now.",23Nov2019,1

There is no physical relationship, which has now gotten me to the point that I’m not even attracted to him. He’s very impatient with our kids at times which really upsets me.

280,"I met this guy who’s just started his travel around the world on Couchsurfing Hangout two weeks ago. We got quite intimate and he came to my place but didn’t stay the night. Later he asked if he could stay at mine tonight and I said yes, then he asked for a second night and I accepted that as well. 

Last night I had food for us, he asked to go buy a beer but the weather was too awful and I told him I have wine and spirits so offered that to him. He said that he doesn’t want to use up my drinks but I said that’s ok. 

Then as we were about to go to bed, he asked if he could do laundry in the morning. I was a little bit annoyed with that, feeling it’s too much, especially as he asked this immediately after I told him how the bills have been too expensive if heat/water is run on a regular basis!

I’m told I’m too soft of a person, Mrs. Nice Gal ™ sort! And yes, I found it hard to say no to him so I said ok! But he’s still sleeping and I don’t know if he’ll ask for that tomorrow but he probably will. 

Trying to put myself into his shoes I was thinking: ok, he’s started this long journey and has been traveling now for a while and probably the places he’s been staying have all been crappy and he needs this laundry anyway so why not be nice to him or let him do it. 

On the other hand I’m thinking he shouldn’t travel if he cannot afford it right? 

Then again, I think: maybe I could ask him to check the horn on my old vehicle in return and let him do his laundry. But maybe he’s not a DIY person and what not. 

TL;DR: while my couchsurfing guest seems to be quite nice, he’s asking to do his laundry at mine. I think I’ve already made him feel very comfortable but I’m not super keen on the idea and I think maybe he could use a coin launderette instead, but I also don’t know if I’m being too cruel to be thinking so and maybe I could let him do it but also ask him to do something for me in return.

282,"So I work someplace where I do my own thing and I'm not employed by the company itself, but through another company and a girl came back from being away for a few months.

So within the first few days we start talking more and more and she asked a lot of first and second date like questions and we got to know each other pretty well. She's sometimes flirty and touches me or pokes me and she tells me everything. Like work things that she's not supposed to tell others (she's a manager there), personal stuff she says only a couple people know, and she's very comfortable talking to me and telling me stuff.

She always asks me to come sit with her in her office and talk to her and asks me to stay late after work (I usually get off first) and hang out with her a bit which I've done a couple times and used the excuse that I rather do work there for my other clients than sit in traffic, which is kind of true. We talk the whole time and she's always super smiley and happy to see me when I come in. We spend a few hours talking almost everyday. And she's even asked me to come in another bigger office to hang out with her when she's training people which I didn't do. Not sure why she even wanted me to come when she's training people on the computer. But I work mostly on my laptop so I could have gone, but didn't.

She's told me about her relationships and this and that. The other day she said ""I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I'm so horny"" and she went on and on and how much she likes sex and we had the sex talk about what she likes and doesn't, craziest place she's done it, etc... She even told me that she gives the best head and she loves it, but she only does stuff in a relationship and its only been with a couple guys.

I've asked her to grab drinks a couple times and she's said we will, but she tells me she's working 60 hours a week and when things calm down we will and that when things calm down she'll ask me to hang out so often that I'll get tired of her. She's even texted me saying ""when are we going out,"" but it never happened. She even said that her friends are mad at her cuz she rarely sees them.

She also knows I have an ex that I hooked up with not too long ago and she keeps saying I need to get rid of her. I've told her when another girl comes into the picture I will 100% and I'm ready to.

I'm trying to figure out if she likes me or if she's messing with me or what the situation is. She's always super nice and will go out of her way to do something if I ask.

Is she interested? Does she just like the attention? Is she bored at work? Or what?",23Nov2019,1

This kept me from getting a job, going to therapy and even attending a one hour AA meeting. We have two children and he would refuse to wake up to watch them. The few times I left to do something, I wouldn't come home to find him asleep and two toddlers supervising themselves. It got to the point where he started sleeping somewhere else for about 8 months.

294,"I'm in my final year of high school, and will be graduating in 2020. And honestly, I'm pretty terrified about my future. Ever since my 10th grade, I've always dreamed about becoming an ethical hacker. However, after starting my 11th grade, I started thinking about many other fields, such as math, psychology and the environment. At some point of time, I also lost motivation to do anything because of lack of support for my dreams, and this was shown pretty strongly in my report card. Thankfully, after I started my final year, I slowly started putting things back on track on my own, after receiving moral support from my friends. 

Everything was going on pretty fine, until the middle of the year, when I was forced to shift back to my home country due to financial issues. Now, everything is crumbling down once again, and I'm so confused about what I want to do, but at the same time, I'm not. I've always wanted to get 5 degrees, but I don't know what I want to start with anymore. Initially, it was computer science, which I planned to use while working for the environment (working for the environment was always my top priority), but after reading a post about Bhutan becoming CO2 negative, I got this urge of wanting to help make another country CO2 negative, which is why I now want to start with environmental engineering.

After blurting this out to my family, I got instant disapproval. My mom displayed an uncaring attitude, because I shifted from BSc Computer Science (she did not approve to this) to Computer Engineering for my family's sake, and again am changing from a ""good degree"" to a ""useless degree"". My sister didn't agree, and says that I shouldn't be allowed to even step out of my home country (I want to study abroad to get experience and more opportunities). My dad got super pissed, disapproved and again went back to making my study in my home country (after spending hours convincing him to allow me) because I was ruining my life.

I have also asked my best friends about this, and one says that environmental engineering is actually a better fit for me, whereas the other always supports me for whatever I wish to do. But I need a third person's opinion, which is why I came to Reddit to ask this, after having multiple breakdowns due to fear and panic.

I am officially back to almost nothing, and have no clue about how to not get my life screwed up. I always wanted to become independent and bring a change into this world. But now, everything just seems so impossible, so much so that I almost fell into a spiral of not caring about anything anymore. My family don't support doing a UG degree abroad because ""I'm a girl"" and claim that studying in my home country is better for me. I have researched, and honestly, I felt the atmosphere was better outside and that they were doing a better job than my home country. But I am terrified that I actually might ruin my life because I might be trying to reach for something that I probably can never achieve. I feel like I'm doing way too much, and should instead just resort to a simple 9-to-5 job and have a stable life, even though I don't like the idea very much. My relationship with my family is on the verge of completely breaking down, and I still care for them, because I still believe they're trying to help me remain stable, but their lack of support is affecting me way too much.

Don't get me wrong, I still love computer science a lot, and plan to integrate it with my environmental engineering degree since I believe that its essential for sustainable development. But I'm no longer sure if i should start with it or not.

I know I sound undecided about life as a whole, but the thing is, I'm only undecided about what I want to start with.

I need advice, please help. Should I listen to my parents, or pursue environmental engineering and go abroad?

Note: Taking a gap year to figure out my life is out of question due to severe pressure I am facing in the society as well as from my family.",23Nov2019,1
295,"So I turned 15 in September, I've known this person since we were 10 or 11. We'll be calling her C.

TL;DR -  Old 'friend' of mine that I cut out of my life started messaging both me and my mum asking if she could hang out with me, to which we replied with no. Now she's showing up at my house asking to just be friends again. Don't know what to do.

To be straight forward, C was a really toxic person. I'd say the first memory I have with her, was dealing with a fight she was having with one of her friends (Who we'll call H).

I became good friends with both H and C when we were around 11, the first year or so went quite smoothly for all of us. When we were 12, H and I became closer since we shared multiple hobbies and interests. It was around this time that conflict started to occur in our little friend group. C told me so many things about H. Some of these include: H has tried to kill C, H has been to a ""mental asylum"", H bullied C...these were obviously lies.

That same year I was diagnosed with ADHD, I told both H and C, and all of a sudden.. C also had ADHD. I vividly remember going over to her house, sneaking in the kitchen with her and watching her take a bottle of vitamin C pills from their cabinet. She'd tell me that they were just in that bottle because ""her family had to keep her disorder secret"". There was an image of the pills on that bottle (bright orange), and when she grabbed one, guess what colour it was? Bright orange. She'd also exaggerate symptoms of ADHD all the time. If she saw me tapping my foot, or fiddling with something, she'd be doing the same thing but far more aggressively.

So over the past two years our friendship group just got worse, she'd start fights over the smallest things. C ended up moving to a different school which gave H and I the chance to cut her out easily. We did. Thing is C only lives around 10 minutes away from me, so sometimes when I get off at my bus stop or I'm going for a walk, I'll see her.

I got a message from her about a month ago saying, ""So I guess we won't be talking anymore huh"". I replied, telling her that if she wanted to message me she most certainly could, she had my phone number, and most of my social media accounts and I hadn't stopped her from contacting me through any of those. She blocked me.

Recently on my birthday, I got another message from her that read, "" I know you probably won’t see this today or even care.. but Happy Birthday!!😄 Hope you have an amazing day! I’m missing you heaps😕 just thought I’d wish you a happy birthday desSCMXVW!🙂📷"". I told her thank you and moved on.

A few days ago she messaged my mum 3 times, asking if I was free this weekend. My mum said no (she knew I didn't want to hang out with her). Yesterday afternoon she showed up at my front door and asked to come in, I said no. Today she did the same thing. I said no, and she started pleading, asking me to give her a chance and that she just wants to spend some time with me. I've told her multiple times that i don't want to be her friend, and that I'm doing much better now than I was with her. She refuses to listen to me.

296,"My boyfriend (21M) and I (19F) been dating for just over a year and a half and we both still live at home.

I was going to meet up with him yesterday after we both finished work. I tried calling him but it kept saying his phone was off. I told a mutual friend about this and his said the same. Then I went to my boyfriend's house and his car wasn't there but his mum's was, so I knocked on the door and his mum told me she hadn't heard anything. We talked for a bit and then his dad came home. My boyfriend should have been home about 2 hours earlier at that point. 

Me and his parents were sat watching TV and then there was a knock at the door. His parents went to answer it and they said something about being there about their son. His dad shut the living room door and all of them went into the kitchen. Then the two people went upstairs, presumably into my boyfriend's room. Shortly after they came back downstairs and went back into the kitchen to talk. When they left, my boyfriend's mum came into the living room and told me I should go home because there had been some kind of karate incident (he does karate as a hobby) and he won't be home for a while. She told me she'd get him to message me when he's home. 

I got home and I heard nothing. I got up for work this morning and still nothing. I decided to check his social medias to see if anything had been posted and I found out his Facebook had been deactivated. I still can't contact him in any way.

297,"I'm graduating from high school this May. I've spent nearly all of my time from middle to high school trying to decide on what to do after. When I tried talking to guidance councilors and career councilors, they said that I had time to decide and when I asked for advice on colleges they literally told me to google it. 

I've tried the career assessments provided by schools, I've tried independently searching for careers that interest me and I just can't find any. I'll be honest, school isn't my strong suit. I can't just sit at a desk and listen, I don't learn that way. I don't want to shell out $30,000+ dollars a year in college when I don't even know if I'll enjoy the job. I don't want to live a dissatisfied life. 

I thought about going to a trade school but I looked at the career paths that you can take and I'm not interested in any of them. I also thought about pursuing one of my passions but I don't want to force myself to do something that I love, that's just going to make it feel like a weight, not an escape.

302,"I’m a 17 year old girl, and my best friend is an 18 year old girl. I’ve known her for about 2-3 years, and I don’t know any way to put this other than she has some serious bad luck. When I met her, she was somewhat stable. Her parents were separated, both of them abusive, and she had cutting scars all over her body—but she was still living a mostly normal teenaged life. We hung out, got each other gifts, celebrated birthdays, texted everyday, and we were there for each other as all friends are. She’s the truest friend that I’ve ever had the privilege of having.

 As our friendship progressed, her life abruptly began to travel downhill. In under a year, she has attempted suicide for the umpteenth time, has been physically, verbally, and emotionally abused by both of her parents (her mother literally tried to kill her and then forced her out into the streets, which is why she is now homeless), has been sexually assaulted, has contracted an STI, has been kicked out of a shelter, has been in multiple fights, has jumped between multiple different jobs and homes, and a multitude of other things. You can imagine that as a result of all this trauma, she is also suffering from depression. 

Aside from her boyfriend, I’m the only friend she has, and so I try to be there for her as much as I can. I’ve given her clothes and all the affirmations and advice that I can think of. I care about her so much, as she is the only person that I can truly say has attempted to be there for me. She is a genuine girl with a huge heart and I’d like to think that she would give me her last if I needed it. However, being that I’m just a teenager who suffers from depression as well, It’s becoming harder and harder for me to be there for both of us, and I feel so horrible and selfish about it.

In the beginning I genuinely cared to the point that I would be bawling my eyes out at night, worried about her and hoping that she wasn’t somewhere dead. But she contacts me everyday with more bad news, and it’s reached a point where I am numb to it all... I’ve become so indifferent now that when she she texted me saying she tried to commit suicide again tonight, I didn’t even know what to say. I didn’t even feel anything, other than like a piece of shit for not feeling anything. I wanted to come up with some authentic response to let her know I cared, and I couldn’t. A few months ago I would’ve been crying until I was physically ill had I gotten that information. I just don’t know what to do anymore—all of this feels beyond me. My mind has even drifted to cutting her off a few times because her sadness and poor circumstances were taking a huge toll on me. I hate that, because I know she would never cut me off if I were in her shoes. So, that being said, what should I do about this? Any advice is appreciated, and thank you for reading.",23Nov2019,1

However yesterday did it for me. She has an extremely low tolerance and whenever we smoke , something small like one joint will have her acting like a clown. we all drank the same amount yesterday and was supposed to have fun but it turned into me baby sitting.

We got off the train and they both continued to act like complete fools. She does not listen to me at all.

310,"My girlfriend got a hormonal IUD recently and switched off of the pill. I didn’t know that if they aren’t inserted during the females period that they aren’t effective immediately so we tried having sex without a condom tonight. I did not ejaculate. My girlfriend is currently not in her fertility window, but if sperm lives for 5 days then it would live up to one day before her predicted ovulation date. She would rather not take a plan b/morning after pill because they make her nauseous for the next few days. 

My questions are:
A) Am I overreacting
B)  Is a hormonal IUD that’s not technically effective still going to be at least somewhat effective (at least at blocking whatever is in pre-ejaculation)

However I’m really struggling with this girl in my art class, it’s a small class of all girls apart from me and this girl near me in a group setting is always picking on me, it’s not even like the group is based on popularity or anything that would bring this about it’s very casual and we all get along, but she has a judgemental statement about everything I do, I say “I exercise” in conversation can’t remember what about, she goes “you exercise?!” Snidely, Im a healthy skinny guy, have no idea where it came from, she is always saying things like “omg that’s so stupid” not just to me to everyone when we’re enjoying a conversation , and its not a social status thing, I don’t like thinking it but she’s on my level in that sense, and she’s always playing social games to isolate, I mistakenly said a brash statement about how I don’t keep up with politics, when I should have been more personal and said how they make me scared and confused, anyway the social activist in our class (not mean she genuinely goes to all the rally’s) was angry and this other girl just jumped on the other girls frustration and was just saying things she clearly didn’t agree with for an opportunity to ham on me, it doesn’t make it easy to grow, but I tried to be reasonable and once she’d left I tried taking an interest in the politics and hoped the activist girl would reflect and think maybe she was too harsh and reach an unspoken middle ground , so it’s not that I’m just an idiot. the only thing that I can imagine frustrates her is my humour can be making fun of certain things, nothing personal but she likes pit bull and said he was the definition of cool so I just joked at that, which she got. She does seem like she putting on a face for the class, she talks about things like guys she has crushes on in a way that seems ingenuous and seems like she wants people to know, aswell as often coming into class with what sound like pre-rehearsed jokes, not in a weird way just like it seems she’s trying to please people who aren’t there.",23Nov2019,1

320,"First time on this sub. Sorry if this is cliche or boring, but I just need to say it somewhere and also ask. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I have been interested in this girl for some time. We've been friends for a year or so, but she already has a boyfriend so I don't want to cross a line. They have not been the best these days so the evil part of me wishes they would break up so I would have a chance, but I'm ashamed to even admit I think such a way. 

With that aside, I have been trying to keep that side of me down. I think I have been fairly successful. I treated her like I would any of my friends except for the fact that I texted her almost everyday and she texted back, and we hung out pretty often. (I dont tend to text my friends often because I feel like I know most things there is to know about them. I know they will come to me if they need support, and I will go to them if I need it.) She seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. I thought that even if we were never going to be anything more, I could say that I solidified a good comfortable friendship.

However, about two weeks ago, she stopped texting me, and when I tried to talk to her first, she was really dry. For me, it really is a drag to keep on a conversation when the person is dry. It was a bit weird because she was still down to hang out sometime soon and she did not mind calling once. It still kinda crushed me though that she seemingly turned on me so quickly.

Here are the things I need some advice on:
1. I know I should not anaylze too deeply into things a girl says or does, but I really cannot help it sometimes. On extreme days, it dictates my mood for the whole week. How should I control myself with this?
2. Is my mindset common or is there something serious I should try to fix about it?
3. What are some of the reasons that she could be acting like this? I know knowing this won't change anything but I want to know if I am missing some explanation. 
4. I tend to take things personally (i.e. think I am the one at fault when it is external factors that caused the problem). How can I go about fixing this?
5. How should I approach this situation in general? I do not want to give her up, neither as an interest or a friend.

Sorry it got long, and sorry again if it sounds immature or cliche. I had similar problems multiple times and I want to see if anyone would kindly give some advice.

To paint the picture, we all sleep in bunkbeds. We pushed them together so that you could just put one huge bed on the top bunk. This makes my 17 y.o sister and I directly next to each other.

Now her boys aren't generally allowed to sleepover, but for some reason her boyfriend is the exception to the rule (won't go into it unless I have to).

This means her and her boyfriend would sleep directly next to me. They do use a blanket to separate us, but I can still hear everything!

The first time, they full on had sex next to me in the morning. I left the room immediately. However, my youngest sister remained in the room. My mom even walked in a couple of times, but ofc didn't see anything.

The next few times, they locked me out of our room, sucked dick in the middle of night (so I couldn't leave if I wanted to), and mornings as well.

I've tried making it super obvious that I'm awake, but they keep going.

It just seems so disrespectful to me. I would not like to feel like I have to leave the room everytime they're around. Plus, I'd like to enjoy my mornings without leaving my bed as soon as my eyes open! I'm tired of hearing sucking noises and DEFINITELY not from my sister.

I’m not mad at her I mean id be awkward too but not a single fucking person there decided hey that’s inappropriate or hey I should stick up for her. No they just wanna say oh it’s fine he’s drunk he doesn’t know any better. People wonder why I don’t like being around other men because 99% of the time it ends up with them hitting on her and me being pissed because she doesn’t say anything until we’ve left or I’m not there. I’m not trying to control her in anyway shape of form she’s her own person I’m just wondering how do I get over this angry of wanting to knock this guys lights out next time I see him.,23Nov2019,1
330,"So, to preface all of this (not gonna bother with a TL;DR, because if you didn’t read it, fine by me), I am very inebriated but also in the perfect—the *only*—state of mind to express what I am asking about.

I love someone. Genuinely love, as in I want to spend every waking moment protecting her from pain and making her happy. But I made a huge mistake, my friends. We dated for a fair bit, and *I dumped her* for someone who I *thought* was better for me. There’s much more of a backstory for that part, but it’s unnecessary at this point.

Me and person #2 realized we are not compatible (differences in religion and whether or not we want biological children—I do not), and I still find myself hooked on person #1–let’s call her M.

I am *not* the person to ever have any desire to hook back up with anyone I’ve ever dated, but goddamn it...M has made me happier than I can remember being in forever, all shitty-as-fuck 21 years of my life, and I don’t know if I can push her out of my mind. I’ve tried. But she gives an empty life fulfillment, a sad life joy.

And it is here that I ask for your advice. I didn’t stumble upon this sub until I was many drinks in (thankful for autocorrect at the moment, as it has been invaluable), but nonetheless I fucking need help.

Do I explain everything to her exactly as I did to you peeps, in the hopes that we can rekindle what we had? Or do I swallow my feelings and deal with everything as I should in silence, since whatever happens is ultimately my doing?",23Nov2019,1
331,"Ok, I realized about 4 months ago that my phone is dragging me down. It is probably disrupting my sleep and it is hurting my shoulder and neck from staring at it and watching videos. Not to mention destroying my productivity. I know there are apps for parents to control kids screen time on Smartphones. Can someone recommend one that will limit my screen time to a predetermined amount, I will have a good friend and a coworker set the pin so I can't just snooze it. The catch is, I still need access to phone calls and WhatsApp if I blow my screen time for the day. I have a dual sim phone with one sim being a work number. I will eventually get a second phone eventually, but I want to try this first. If I am approaching this wrong, any suggestions would be appreciated.

336,"Hi.
I’ll start from the beginning.

I run a discord server with my best friend Dakota. She had recently gotten dumped and was kind of vulnerable, and I suppose with perfect timing, an attractive Danish boy joined the server and sent her a message.
They talked for about a week before she told me she was interested in him. I sort of felt something was a little off about him, and so I tried to advise her to be careful and take things slowly until she knows him a bit better. 
Fast forward just a few hours, and I randomly get a call from her. I answer, and I can hear she’s panicked, but she doesn’t tell me why. All she says is “look up KittyStyles.”
Once I do, I see a few things. Pedophile claims, some stuff about being a drug addict, an arrest record...and then I click for images. Sure enough, it’s that oh-so-sweet Danish boy she’s been talking to, and he’s got a past.
We do a little research together, digging deep into forums and gathering evidence to build a case. She says she’s going to take a nap because she’s overwhelmed, so I agree to put together some links and photos and whatnot while she does.
Once she wakes up, I pester her to tell him she knows and that they’re over. She does, and of course, he starts with the “it’s slander” line. He then moves on to say he had an abusive ex who spread lies, a lot of excuses.
He eventually admits to fingering his sister when she was 6 years old. He pretty much manipulates her into staying so he could “explain himself”, he ends up convincing her he’s changed since it was many years ago and despite my protests, she continues to talk to him.
I freak out, telling her to look at what she’s doing and such. She sets us up in a call, all three of us get on and we talk for 2 hours. The first ~30mins is mostly me just calling him gross. He once again admits to what he’s done, but changes his story again.
I’ll summarize a bit here; he’s told me 6 different stories for events he claims happened depending on when you ask him. He calls children online who called him a fag on twitch his “abusers”. If you tell him he did something messed up, he’ll go on a rant about how you’re a bitch for saying so because he was neglected as a child so that makes his actions okay.
My friend is very emotionally vulnerable right now and he is extremely manipulative. He’s a pathological liar and he will say and do anything to make himself look like the hero. I’ve tried sitting her down and talking to her seriously, and she just excuses his actions with the same things he told her. She told me she would never pick a man over me, and I’m afraid it’s going to come down to me having to use that if I can’t find some way to snap her out of it. He’s also double her age, I should add.",23Nov2019,1
337,"First back story, then question..
I have tried to cross post this aswell.  As i am banging my head against wall with lack of ideas.

I was/am stage 4 cancer. I prepared my lifetime material things to be handled before i passed. Which i was told i had a few months to live, looked and felt like that was true.

I sought out 2nd opinion.

Well, here i am, beating the odds. Camcer number are down.  But my credit score took a severe ding, medical bills filed wrong. I am trying to correct it now.

I had given [GIFTED] my house in Tennessee to friends up there that were in need. Since cancer center that is working a MIRCLE, and is by family in South Georgia.

Finally got approved for SSDI, yay!! So have an income now. Waited, and fought for 3 years.

I purchased (paid in full) a good used car with my ssdi back pay.  And paid what i could on my credit report.  I am waiting on itemized billing, from medical places on credit report to turn into insurance.  So that they can get paid aswell and remove ding to credit report. 

I have found a house i can afford the payments on. But with credit dinged and my savings depleted, i am having a HARD time finding a mortgage.

This house dang near perfect. 2 blocks from my sister's. Whom i am staying with now. Big enough to house myself and my niece. Since my family does not want me to stay alone again. (I still have issues with enegry to fix dinner, clean house etc. Tho its improving)

Do ya'll have ideas, opinions, etc that could help with me securing funding to purchase this house? Somewhere that will look past credit rating and long term unemployment due to me being unable to continue my job/career of 17 years.

339,"I (21F) am from Asia went alone to a public hot spring bath in Bad Wildbad for the weekend. TL;DR A man, M (47M) followed me up and down the stairs, joined me in a small pool sitting very close to me, and the touched me on my thigh and ass three times. I have already made a police report but the police say that there is nothing that can be done at this point, and I can only wait a few months and hope that the judge issues him a fine.  I'm hoping reddit can help tell me if theres any way to get my justice. 

It was my very first time in an all nude mixed gender public bath. My s/o and I had discussed whether its suitable for me to go alone, and he encouraged me to try. I first met M in the largest public bath but we didn't interact. Aftereards, I went up the stairs because I thought it led to more baths. I had covered my body partially with a towel. M walks up the stairs behind me. Maybe he followed me, maybe not. He tells me that it's a sauna. I didnt wanna go to a sauna. I walk down the stairs. I walk into a small room with a small tub. He came down and sat on my left, just a few centimetres away. He tried to make conversation but it was clear I wasnt interested. (Because it's weird af to talk to someone when you're both nude)

His right fingers grazed the side of my thigh once. I thought it may be the water and when you lose grip on the seat. I moved away and told him: ""your fingers are touching me. Stop it."" Then it happened a second time. I moved away again. Then it happened a third time, and this time there was more contact then just fingers. I felt his palm touch me near on my upper thigh, near my ass. I was so scared and uncomfortable that I rushed out and went to look for women and staff, which helped me catch him. One of the other guests came forward and said that she often saw him target and act inappropriately on younger women. 

Right now, the police are telling me that they have his details but there's nothing I can do about it. I am told to just wait a few months for the Justice to review this case and possibly just issue him a fine. I will be leaving germany by the end of January and it is very distressing to hear that nothing else can be done. I have cPTSD, which I have been living with and controlling, but this incident has left me unstable, and I really worry for the sake of my mental health.

Thank you Reddit for helping.",23Nov2019,1
340,"I'm a 17M senior. Sometimes if there's like no one else to hang around with I'll hang out with kids in like middle &amp; elementary school. Most of them are my nieces/nephews/cousins &amp; their friends because I live on the island of Molokai, Hawaii, and there are only about 700-something kids in grades K-12 over here, so everyone is either related in some way or knows each other by 2 degrees of separation.

One thing I do is go to my former K-6 elementary school, which shares its property with a county park. The park consists of a multi-purpose hall anyone can rent out, 2 outdoor basketball courts (one is regulation &amp; has lights anyone can turn on at night if needed, and the other is about 40% smaller for little kids &amp; doesn't have lights), as well as an outdoor baseball field. The school has 2 playgrounds on either side of the property up at the top of the hill in the back, and they have the right to use the county basketball courts as well. I hang out at this place a lot, and most of the time when I'm there, I end up hanging with younger elementary/middle school kids. Kids in high school only really come here if someone's hosting a party or event at the hall.

Also, I live at a condo place that has a lot of young tourists coming during the summer (from about May to August), and I show hospitality &amp; hang out with them at the pool/cabana, playing cards, swimming, talking story, setting up my PS4 &amp; small TV, etc. A lot of them are families with young kids, and I'll recommend them places to go and fun stuff to do with the kids. The ones who are staying over here long, I tell them about the park so they could potentially meet some new kids to hang out with (but fair warning, kids around here are a little territorial towards outsiders and can be kinda rough). 

I'm also the DJ for that school's Saturday-night Halloween and Christmas dance parties they do every year (been going to them since I was 6 years old). I get a lot of input for what to play from young elementary school kids, and I've gotten a mostly positive reception (except for a few individual song choices; ""intergalactic planetary"" and ""monster mash"" are no-goes with this crowd. It's a community event opened up to the public, so if any visitors form off-island that I know happen to be here that weekend, I'll usually recommend that they go, it's good fun.

Also, I worked for a summer daytime camp the school was holding for 6 weeks, basically played indoor games, did arts &amp; crafts, and played sports outside for 30 hours a week at $10.10/hour. Kids 5-12 can sign up &amp; attend, people 14 and older can work for them.

So do I need to start scaling back my involvement with young kids? Like, I've known a lot of them since I was that young and they were little toddlers. I spend most of my time with adults and kids in high school, but is it weird that I also include young elementary/middle school kids in their too.",23Nov2019,1
341,"Super long story but if you care to read, tonight some shit happened that really pissed me off. the backstory is is that I’ve been best friends with this girl for 18 years now so like we go way back and I wasn’t expecting this kind of shit from her but anyways. She had this really toxic best friend for years, and for the majority of their friendship in high school I wasn’t close to my best friend (the backstabber I’m referring to). This was because the girl she was best friends with is an absolute crazy sociopath who was a terrible influence and had a VERY bad reputation in my city that literally everyone knew of. (Would get into a lot of street fights, got my best friend aka backstabber addicted to drugs, etc). I didn’t wanna be around that and for the duration of their friendship, almost every day or every other day I’d get a text from my best friend bitching about their fight and she’d be crying and I’d spend months and years helping her throughout this friendship w the sociopath which took a lot of emotional stress on me and fucked with my mental health a lot. It was absolutely exhausting. Fast forward I was really supportive and a good friend, then I got a call from my best friend hysterically crying while she was at the hospital after she tried to commit suicide and she had called the sociopath telling her to come and she needs a friend and the sociopath goes “I’m really baked rn can’t you figure it out yourself”. Then I was the friend who went to go help her as the second option to be there for her and help her. After this my best friend cut off ties w the sociopath and ever since then they haven’t been friends. My best friend would run into her and get harassed by her or Whatever. Fast forward to now, the girl has been trying to be-friend my best friend for months now and I’ve been telling her not to and if she does, I don’t think I can emotionally handle it because this put me through a lot too. Anyways, tonight I was at my boyfriends and my ‘best friend’ was sending shady snaps and long story short I found out she was at the sociopaths house behind my back after all I’ve done for her. I flipped shit but didn’t confront yet, then I texted her saying what’s up and she said she’s sooo drunk and can’t talk rn. I’m just really hurt and I don’t have the emotional energy and want nothing to do with that other girl so I don’t want that kinda shit in my life.

Standing hours in front of the mirror and keep telling myself I am beautiful and that I love me, getting complimented by others, going to therapy and so on... So you see I am pretty desperate.

343,"Condensed version: I worked at a very powerful, multinational corporation and my contract was ended after one sick day when my manager discovered that I have bipolar disorder. I won't go into the harassment that occurred both during the contract and after leaving, though I am able to back everything up with emails I obtained under a SAR. 

The case has dragged on for almost 18 months, while I have worked full time elsewhere. It is was incredibly personal to me and I did not want to sign a gagging clause as part of a settlement, I chose to represent myself. In a technical sense, in terms of settlement figures offered, this has gone very well. However, it has been soul destroying as their legal team are incredibly vexatious, causing distress and very long delays.

As they have argued that I am 'too high functioning' to be disabled, despite having all of my medical records from birth, high school and university reports showing the impact of the illness, I will need to go to a public hearing early next year where my medical records will later be dissected and published online. I chose to waive the right to anonymity last summer as I did not want this to happen to someone else, and the company are repeat offenders for this type of discrimination. 

The problem is that I have become so depressed that I have taken a month off work and regularly think about killing myself. I could just take a settlement, though I think having to keep quiet about it long term would damage my mental health too. Significantly the company have partnered with a large mental health charity to buy good PR. 

The lawyers I've spoken to have advised me to settle, saying it's not my responsibility to fix the way the company behave. However, it goes very against my beliefs.

352,"This is gonna leave out so many factors and points but I'll give you a rough overview...

I'm m/18. I grew up with my single mother in a city til I was like 11 year old. I got bullied in primary school and in my football club that time. Those factors alone made me to a insecure person. Not only that. I moved away 4 times in my life. I never really found a firm place to build something around me. We moved away from my hometown, far away, with my mother to live with her new partner. Who was an on/off alcoholic. We had several brawlings, police inserts until our landlord decided to kick us out of our department. We lived there for 3 1/2 years. She also broke up with him after that, finally. 

I went to school there as well. After living with my grandmother for a few months temporarily, we finally found a apartment. I decided not to switch school again for my final 2 high school years because I've had great teachers, great class and great friends (at that time) around me. Even though I had to drive like 1 1/2 hours with public transport there.

 I graduated there and decided to continue school so I can get a higher graduation to be able to go to college after 3 years (its like that in Germany). After half a year I decided this ain't for me and started looking for apprenticeship. I also started smoking weed around that time. We in early 2019 now. 

I was sitting at home the first half of this year looking for a goddamn apprenticeship. Due to weed bad trips , this included anxiety every fucking day + the fear of getting psychosis. It was hell. 

Now I have an apprenticeship and you'd think everythings fine now. It's not. Now my relationship problems are coming up.

I never had a relationship. I met a girl like 1 1/2 months ago on Reddit here and found out she was from my area as well. Wanted to met several times, she always canceled it before we wanted to met. Fine for me. She just got out of an relationship. It was too early for her. She knew what I wanted.

Found a post from her a week later in which she said she still loves her ex because of how amazing the relationship between them was in that year they were together. It hit me right up the fucking face. We then chated and I told her I don't wanna be a alternative/second choice, when her ex decides not to go back together with her. Or idek what her plan was. She knew what my intentions were.

Anyway, I removed her completely out of my life then. Told her good luck with her ex and such. It still hits though. Happend this Thursday.

On top, I decided to remove contact from my best friends. Because they aren't active, they wouldn't listen to my problems or just ignore them. They wouldn't talk about their own. 

Then found out they were meeting among themselves because they couldn't handle my constant personality changes.

That was yesterday. Removed them out of my life as well now.

I can understand certain points, but after all that shit I've been going through, I barely got any help in those years from them.

I've been dealing with depression for years, including real fucking anxiety at some point.

353,"I have some things about food that she is worried about and thinks it's not normal and I want to ask what you think? I feel like no one would take me seriously about this in therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I generally dislike all foods. I almost always feel like eating nothing and it's been like this since teen age years and I am underweight because of it. I never know what I want to eat. Nothing sounds good. I feel hungry, sometimes I am super hungry and I know I need to eat and I get frustrated all day because I don't feel like eating anything and I eat something random and I hate every moment of it so I eat too little. Sometimes in a blue moon I crave pizza, sushi, soup or extremely random specific foods like chocolate milk or tomatoes or anything. I wish I felt like this more often because in those moments I truly enjoy what I eat but after that I am done for at least 1 week I can't stand that specific food. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has become very obvious in relationships when I have to decide what to eat and I never want anything. I get why she is worried. I don't like feeling like this but I don't know what is wrong with me, if this is normal, if I can do something about it apart from force feeding? is this some sort of eating disorder? anybody felt like this?",23Nov2019,1

356,"I am a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the lab portions in some Computer Science courses. One of the lab instructors I work with has been very touchy with me. He is definitely in his mid 50s if not older (I am 24F) and I believe I saw a marriage ring on his finger (not that it matters). 

At first it was a pat on the back at the end of the lab as a “thank you for your work today”. Then I noticed that throughout the lab when he needs to pass behind me so he can get to another student’s computer he would always graze the small of my back and that’s when it started to get really uncomfortable.

I was trying to see if he does that with the other TA in the lab, so maybe I can dismiss it as a friendly, fatherly gesture and he didn’t, he never touched the other TA. I also asked my close friend who works with him in a different lab if he ever touches her and she said no.

I was going to talk to the course instructor who hired him about it since I already knew him and have a good relationship with him. However, I had a busy school week last week so I sat on it.

THEN last Thursday happened. I was helping a student out who was sitting at the last computer right next to the wall, so I was standing against the wall and talking to the student. Two computers down, a student raises his hand to ask for help and the lab instructor walks ALL THE WAY TO WHERE I AM, touches my butt and ACTUALLY says “ooppsss sorryy!!” And then walks back to the student.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 13, I transferred into a new school. I was never one of the ""pretty girls"" and I had a really awkward teen phase. I guess I was an really easy target for bullying with my big glasses, my braces, my utter lack of a sense for fashion and my shy behavior. But I got along rather well with the rest of my class for almost six months until one of the guys decided to change that. 

It started with small comments on my clothes, my way of talking or my behavior but it got out of hand really fast. He casually started to call me ""scarecrow"" as a nickname and never failed to mention how ugly I was every time I stepped into a room. This continued for some time without anybody really taking it seriously - not even I did even though it still hurt a lot - but he soon convinced all of his close friends to join in on the bullying. It didn't take long after the for the whole class and eventually the whole school to join them.

The next two years were utter hell for me. Every time I stepped into a room people sighed and announced how disappointed they were that I coming to school. Everything I said was commented on. My classmates fighted over who I had to work with in group projects. My belongings were destroyed on a weekly basis. People three years older than me came to tell me that I was the ugliest girl at school and my classmates eventually nominated me for ""Miss -name of my school-"" just to humiliate me in front of the whole school. I spend all my lunch breaks locked into a toilet stall just to avoid the constant bullying and I felt so much relieve, when I finally finished the school years at this place and was able to move on. 

Even though I'm now 25, I'm still suffering from the bullying experience I had. I was not able to trust new people for a very long time and I'm still dealing with a severe case of body dysmorphia. For years I wasn't even able to look at my naked body in a mirror without completely breaking down and enjoying Sex is almost impossible for me because of that.

I have been in therapy for over two years now and I gradually getting better. But all this suffering and the processing of what happend to me actually made me wonder about the guy who started it all over ten years ago. I started to wonder, if he's aware of the impact he had on my life and that I'm suffering every day because of what he started. 

This really made me want to confront him about it - and I don't mean scream at him or blame him for everyhing. I'd rather want to talk about what happend and WHY it happend. I want him to know, that what he did scarred me for life and that I'm still living with the memory of him every day. I also wonder, if he ever thinks about me or if I'm just the silent ugly girl in his past. 

All things considered I'm just not sure if this is a good idea. I might have an idealized version of his reaction in my head...I might get really disappointed if I actually meet him and things don't go like I expected them too. Still the urge to contact him has been so strong over the past months that I'm actually considering it. 

What do you guys think about that? Should I confront him or do you think this would be a really bad idea?",23Nov2019,1

364,"
I started University this year and met a guy several months back who I became friendly with. About a month ago we started talking more and started flirting. I wasn’t sure if he was just playing around or actually meant it because he does talk to heaps of girls and has loads of girl friends (he’s very easy to get along with). I didn’t tell any of my friends I’d started getting feelings for him, but then he told a mutual friend that he liked me but wasn’t sure if it was reciprocated and he didn’t want to ruin our friendship. We’ve been talking for a couple of weeks since, I haven’t seen him in person for a while, but he has asked to hang out one on one. The problem is I feel somewhat more apathetic towards him now and I feel really horrible because I’m not sure if it’s just because I’m busy right now or because I’ve lost feelings. I don’t know how I feel and I don’t know how to proceed. Is it fair to him to continue as we are if it turns out I don’t like him like that, I don’t want to lead him on because he’s genuinely someone I care for and don’t want to hurt. Would it be rude to stop talking to him to try and figure out how I’m feeling? Clearly I’m overthinking a lot but I’m unsure how to proceed. Thank you, any advice is appreciated.",23Nov2019,1
365,"I'm a 14 year old guy having a lot of trouble making friends. I don't know why, but people generally seem to dislike me. Whenever I look at class pictures I realise that I just can't fit in anywhere.

Back when I was 12 I was constantly getting bullied by the very people that I had previously acknowledged as friends, and due to my sub-par argument skills I just couldn't retaliate in verbal means, and when I swore at them I instead got a 1 week suspension and they didn't get any punishment. So yeah I guess this could be why I might not have friends.

I also have a lot of trouble opening up to people. I do not understand why, but I just don't want to be judged even by people I trust. Often I find that I can't find a community that can understand me, much less even match my interests.

366,"I've been sharing a three-bedroom apartment for the past 3.5 years with 2 other people. Over this time the flatmates changed a lot due to various reasons (e.g., moved in with girlfriend, moved to another country, etc.). Now, the other 2 flatmates joined this apartment after me. The newest flatmate joined six months ago, and the other one a year ago. 

With the current flatmates, the situation is not in very good terms. I didn’t have had time to build a rapport with newest flatmate besides saying hello and “how was your day?” because I was very busy with work. The situation with the other flatmate is not good at all. I discovered that he lied about his situation during the flat viewing to get into the apartment (found out after he moved in). Afterwards he started stealing food from me and making a lot of noise in the house. My other flatmate moved out because of the noise, and was replaced by the newest flatmate that joined a six months ago. 

After I found out about the food, I challenged him and he eventually admitted that he’s been stealing food. But after discussion he started manipulating the newest flatmate and telling a lot of lies about me. Also I caught the newest flatmate spying on me (listening to my door) when I brought my girlfriend home. He stopped talking to me after this. 

Now, the problem that we have in the house is with the washing machine. Two months ago, the washing machine broke and needed to be replaced. It was making a big banging noise during the spinning cycle and eventually the drum stopped spinning. I wasn’t at home when the machine broke and I wasn’t the one doing the washing when it happened but somehow they both ganged up suggesting that I was responsible because I overload the machine. We notified the landlord about the situation and he said he will send someone to fix the machine. He didn’t. The other two flatmates called the landlord and said that they will buy a 2nd hand or a new machine and subtract the cost from the rent. The landlord agreed to buy a 2nd hand machine instead of a new one. The washing machine was bought from a down-the-street shop that was selling old washing machines. This shop sold my flatmates a washing machine that had the same problem in the past but was fixed. They brought it and installed it in the house. This machine worked ok for the past 1.5 months. 

A weeke ago, when I was doing laundry, this machine starting making a strong noise and the newest flatmate stopped it. I had a pair of jeans, a shirt, two or three t-shirts, a few pairs of underwear and some socks. When it started doing the draining cycle there was a loud banging noise. I took out the pair of jeans, and started the machine again, and the banging was gone. Now the machine makes this horrible noise every time someone is doing the laundry. 

The two flatmates contacted the shop and blamed the noise on overloading the machine. The machine now obviously need to be replaced because it cannot be used due to the loud noise. The two flatmates blame me because of this problem because it happened during my wash. I’ve been using the other machine for 3 years and had no problem. I also think the last washing machine was not installed properly. I also believe that the other two flatmates have been under-loading the machine (e.g., washing only two t-shirts). What should I do in this situation? What is the best way to deal with this problem?",23Nov2019,1

370,"The short version - I work for a Bank and am strongly considering becoming a Police Officer. Something I've was set on doing when I was younger but kind of fell by the wayside.

Though it's not as straight forward as that (the long version). Firstly for some background, I'm in the IT project management world as a Business Analyst, I've been at the same company for almost 10 years, relatively speaking it's a pretty secure job with skills that are transferable outside of Banking. I'm on a fairly high salary (just over 100k annually with bonuses) and all in all its a good company to work for. With that being said I am not passionate about my job at all, it's boring as hell and I just can't get excited about almost anything. I'm just some dork in a suit who goes to meetings and spouts a bunch of corporate buzzwords and does the occasional PowerPoint presentation. I can't find meaning in the job and I just feel like I've fallen into the corporate 9-5 ratrace.

The thought of being a Police Officer is something that fills me with purpose and excitement, a job that I know I would be passionate about. And a role in the community that allows me to do meaningful work. This isn't something I'm going to jump into immediately, as I have vision problems I want to have corrected first (with laser surgery), and I am almost entitled to my long service leave (4 months paid vacation), so it would be stupid not to capitalise on that as I've earned it. This is a 2-3 year plan for me. I'll be almost mid 30's but I have a high level of fitness, I am a very active martial artist doing Jiu Jitsu , which I am confident will come in handy as well, by that time I should be a Purple or even a Brown belt, which is advanced level.

Here's the kicker though, annual salary for Police where I'm from is not great. I'd be taking a 30-40k paycut as a new officer. There's obviously room for promotions but it would take a while to get even close to what I'm on at the Bank. But right now that doesn't matter to me, I'd rather take the paycut and spend my life doing something meaningful , then take the safe option and hate my life for 8 hours a day.

Am I being immature here chasing this dream? Or is there some merit in seeking a more meaningful career?",23Nov2019,1

372,"So I started this new job Monday and I just turned 26 so i lose my insurance on the first. My job has offered me this ""HDHP"" insurance through blue Cross blue shield. For the plan they offered me, it would be about $105 a month. 

So I don't go to the doctors often, haven't been in the hospital in years, and when I do go to the doctors it's just to my nuerologist for a check up, maybe 2x a year. I don't have vision issues, so I declined that insurance. Now there's this ""deductible"" of $1500. I'm used to paying a $35 copay when I see my nuerologist and that's it. If my nuero charges $500 a visit, do I have to pay this full $500 since I didn't meet my deductible?  Do I pay 100% of my medication cost until I meet this deductible?

I go to college with a group of friends and I’m now on my second year. One of my friends I got extremely close with in the first year. I’m on the second year and I’m starting to get possessive of my friend. 

For example in the first year we had different opinions and now in the second year I noticed that when she has a different opinion, I get annoyed because of it, like there’s a part of my mind that wants the same opinion as mine, which deep down I do not want.

When my close friends hangs out with other friends, I get the urge of jealousy because of it and it’s annoying the hell our of me because I don’t mean to be jealousy, I just do. 

I also think my friend is a lot more interesting and a lot cooler than me and I feel envious and jealous of that. 

Also a another friend graded how attractive of me and my close friend and my close friend got higher than me, which made me quite upset and jealous. 

And I can not stop thinking about this friend, whenever I see this friend or get a message I get a feeling in my chest (Not a crush feeling as my friend is a gay sexuality whereas I’m not) 

All of this has really been effecting me quite badly. I’m hating myself for thinking like this and being jealous and possessive of this friend and I worry that I am no longer a good or kind person anymore because of it. 

I tried distancing myself from this friend but there’s a part of my mind that just wants to ignore her on purpose to upset her, which is something I DEFINITELY don’t want but I have that “evil” side of my mind that does and I feel like a horrible person because of it.

381,"I'm 27M and at the lowest I've ever been in my life. I'm actively trying to turn it around but I don't know if I'm headed in the right direction. Just a couple years ago I had it all going for me -- a good factory job, my own place, friends, girlfriend, money to go out and have fun. Lost it all in a matter of months due to circumstances and deeper depression stemming from them.

It's now about a year after things started going to shit and I'm in a deep hole. Lost my good job and became suddenly broke with ~$6000 credit card debt. It has since climbed to $10k just trying to survive when I had no job or money. Then my girlfriend left me and I had to move in with my dad because I couldn't pay rent.

So here I am, a grown man living at home with $10k debt that I can't possibly make payments on right now. I don't even have friends to talk to much anymore because they're all busy raising families and being successful.

I'm going to school to learn the HVAC trade right now, but I won't finish until the end of next year. That seems pretty far away right now. I got a job in the trade but I'm making pennies compared to what I used to make -- $11/hr. And I'm part time as it's the slow season and I'm going to school full time. I'm told I won't see good money in the trade for at least a couple years. I eventually want to start my own business but that's at least a few years down the road.

So in the meantime, what do I do? What do I do about the massive debt looming over my head keeping me up at night? Should I forget trade school and just settle for another factory job?

386,"My boyfriend and I moved into our home roughly 10 months ago. We very quickly met and clicked with our neighbors to the right of our house. After living here for a couple months and meeting just about everyone on the block we had yet to even see our left hand neighbor. We began to ask around, as I wanted more information before I went over and tried to introduce myself. Gathered the facts that she is an elderly woman in a wheelchair, who lives by herself. She also seemed to keep odd hours (which at the time we did as well) so BF and I made the decision to wait until we saw her out on her porch to introduce our selves. That opportunity did not present itself until a week from yesterday. She called me over through the thin wood line that separates our front yards. BF and I introduce ourselves and have a very nice conversation for roughly forty-five minutes. We were in the middle of packing our vehicle for a weekend trip, so we exchanged phone numbers and excused ourselves to finish loading up. Have not heard a word from her, nor has she been on her porch in the week since we’ve been back. Well last night that changed. Quickly. 

We have a pot belly stove in our garage, that we have had checked by our local fire station, that we use regularly. With it being Friday (as well as my younger siblings birthday) we got home at roughly 10. Our neighborhood is notorious for being quiet and family oriented during week nights, and everyone cuts loose on the weekends. You’re hard pressed to not find a barbecue going at one house or another all weekend. We have done the same the entire time we have lived here. She has never said a peep. As BF was chopping wood last night, she opened her door and begun louder berating us for stealing her Wisteria and using it in our wood burning stove. BF (who has a grandmother with mental disorders) begins to calmly and kindly speak with her. She wants none of it. She continues to call him a thief, stealing her trees. He holds up the (very large, hence the chopping needed) log and tells her that she has nothing to worry about, that this came from the woods at his dad’s house. She calls him a liar and proceeds to tell him she paid too much for her wisteria for us to steal it. 

(Small side note. She does not seem to have wisteria in her yard whatsoever, leading me to wonder if she is confusing it with an old home of hers)

Before BF can reply, she slammed the door. We were worried for her mental sake, but decided it best to let it go. Less than thirty minutes later she opens the door once more to yell at us for stealing her water. The only thing I can think about that one is that she saw our house (which is attached to our spigot on the front of our home) and came to the conclusion that it was coming from her home? She slams the door before we can even respond.  Last time of the night was when BF was trying his best to quietly pick up pieces of wood to keep our stove going. She opened the door and told him that him and his wife (I guess that’s me) we’re going to be punished by God for stealing from her. She then proceeds to tell him that she has a gun, she knows how to use it, and that she’s not afraid to. We’re almost positive she does NOT have a weapon, but BF is extremely protective and proceeded to put out our stove, and call it a night inside the house. 

We thought it was over. 

Waking up this morning, I have these texts which were sent at 3:38AM.... long after we were already in bed, and the stove put out. 


“You have delibrrtly destroyed Sister is trees on my property. You need to go to Church because by not respecting my property you are stealing”

“I refuse to just sit still and not do something about this. If your nut is in my yard I will call the authorities. Do not continue to destroy my Wisteris trees. Buy your own wood. You have no regard for someone else's property. God sees all your evilness and knows all. Go to Church and change”

Please. Please give me advice. I welcome it all. I hate the thought of her being so angry with us over something her mind has made her think.

390,"A little background: this has happened before in the past with the same ex friend except no one was around and I was black out drunk.

Since I had no proof I just let it slide and I and that ex friend remained friends and even joked about it.

One of the people in the room half asleep yelled at us to shut up, and then he let go of me and let me leave the room. 

I didn't talk about it for a month because I just didn't want to believe it happened, until one of the people who were there that night brought it up. We ended up confronting him, and we told the rest of out friend group. The guy just denied everything, with equally no proof. However he is popular, and now everyone except a select few are on his side, and believe I falsely accused him of rape twice, even though, that's hardly as extreme as what happened.  

It feels like the world is against me, and I simply don't know what to do anymore. Should I go to the police? And even then do I have enough proof? My heart has simply sunk through my body, and no one else seems to offer unbiased solutions.",23Nov2019,1

Recently, my dad brought up the idea of moving in with him at 16 (I’m 13 as of posting this) for A-levels. (Pretty much the UK version of American high school). His point was pretty much that if there was better education opportunities in his area, than it’d be beneficial for me to move in.

I myself also have mental issues and saw that being with her or talking to her (even over text) brought such great relieve, but now I can’t do that for 10 weeks. I opted for weed and alcohol binging instead, but I feel that might become dangerous. Her mom sometimes sends me a message asking how I am, and just talks, which is very nice, but it doesn’t solve the struggle I have (as with weed and alcohol).

Another thing is, is that I got offered to go to a clinic aswell, but that would be when she comes back, and I don’t think that’s worth it, since she was the most effective “therapy” I got in all my life...

I just want a way to speed time up, but I catched myself falling asleep at 8 AM after not being able to sleep... I want a way to cope with those 10 weeks, and also with the uncertaincies like: “Does she like it there?”, “Is she doing okay?”, “Is it helping?”.

I just don’t know what to do, so I ask you kind Reddit folks for advice I guess...

400,"I live in an apartment and my neighbor just got a dog. She leaves this dog locked up and then disappears for the weekend. When she leaves, the dog barks NONSTOP. Last Sunday, the dog barked from 5pm Sunday night until I left for work at 7:30AM Monday morning. Yes, I know the easiest thing to do here would obviously be to tell the office. But I can’t. We have 2 dogs ourselves that we didn’t tell the office about or pay for, and I’m really not trying to get hit with a double pet fee for sticking my nose in someone else’s animal drama. Background on the neighbor: One time her mail got sent to me so I took it over to her, she 100% looked strung out on drugs, snatched the mail from me, and slammed the door in my face. (I’ve thrown away any mail of hers I’ve gotten since) Once, there was a baby crying for hours and hours. Weird thing is, haven’t heard or seen the baby since. Based on the envelopes of mail I get, since she can’t seem to write down her correct address, it looks like she’s failed to pay quite a few bit of bills (didn’t read. Just a lot of “Final Notice” envelopes.) All things considered, something tells me she’s not the best pet owner. I’m really not trying to be a snowflake here but I would never forgive myself if something ended up happening to the dog due to her neglect. What can I do?

I do above average at school in everything except for Chinese. It frustrates me to no end

I'm in my 3rd year of high school &amp; I'm about to graduate in 3 years, and I'm really scared, like irrationally scared.

I don't have a future in a place where I can't even learn the language, and it's really hard for me to get motivated to learn in the first place.

I can't apply my usual trick that's gotten me through a lot of bad times, and that's really putting my mind into it &amp; getting all hyped and ready to do whatever it is, but I just can't with cantonese.

 Then I realized, how am I suppose to secure a stable future for myself when I can't meet a basic requirement for basically 99% of the jobs here?

I don't know, maybe I'm living in another world and am just paranoid, but I'm certain I don't have a future here.

I considered moving to Canada with a few of my friends once we graduate &amp; get stable jobs there since we speak really good english, and have passions in certain things that have a high demand over in Canada, but I know I won't get support from my parents &amp; siblings, it's just..

406,"Hi so this is about my friend(21M) , he’s been going through some things with his mom and his only option is to move out (for the very first time as an adult). 

He discussed things with an old boss/friend who is much older and experienced. He suggested my friend could move into a place he rents for 1050 a month. With extra bills it’d be about 1500 a month to support himself. Being 21, living by himself for the first time and alone, going to school part time and attempting to work 2 jobs doesn’t seem plausible to me. Am I wrong? I know I live at home and go to school full time so I have no real idea but I don’t want him to fail because it’s a huge step. I suggested he consider all options such as a roommate with cheaper rent. His response was “how would i find that” and i had to explain the newspaper has ads etc so he is VERY new to this and like i said i don’t want him to fail.

We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on.

I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me.

422,"First time poster, long time follower using a new account. 

Highlights of my story...

I am 33 years old, straight, male (as bland as them come)
Have two kids, a boy (3) and a girl (6)
Was married for 8 years
Still in the process of one of one very nasty divorce
No infidelity from either partner
Ex-wife, according to her divorce filings, never wanted to get married, have kids, or move to our current town. Stated that I coerced her into everything, now she wants to keep the house and other assets...
Current time separated, 9 months
Co-parenting relationship with the kids
Not in any relationship currently
Have not had sex while separated
I am not into casual sex, never have been

The conclusion, I had a very strong love for my ex and the trust and confidence I placed in the vowels of our marriage were disillusioned, and I will never enter that institution again with her or anyone. Additionally, my belief is to never have children outside of wedlock. So my reason goes, if I never marry again and that is the only relationship I would choose to have children through, then a vasectomy reasons to be the best option. 

A bit more insight. I do not feel this is a rash decision. I feel this is sound logic. I am also resolved that the two kids I have, though with a women I am no longer with, these are the only two kids I want in this world. They are my light and bring me tremendous joy and I want to provide for them everything! 

So now I ask, be brutally honest, let me know if you’ve been there, let me know how stupid I am for thinking and feeling this way or help encourage me that this decision is the right one. 

Thanks!",23Nov2019,1
426,"My whole life my mother has kept me isolated by spreading rumors to other people about me and gaslighting me. I’m 22 now and it’s come to an emergency level now. I am mentally ill (bipolar and PTSD), broke up with my boyfriend who I lived with a few months ago, and I’ve been trying to contact him and his family for help but they are all convinced I’m just spoiled and want my ex-boyfriend back. They’ve called the police on me for going over there after a scary thing happened with my mother.

The situation is complicated because I actually am mentally ill but she is twisting it to make it look like I’m crazy and manipulative rather than stressed out and confused. For example the other day she left the door open at the house so the cat (an indoor cat) could get out when I had asked her before not to do that, I freaked out and lost my shit because I was already under tons of stress and I couldn’t handle my mother purposely letting the cat out on top of all of it, so she called the police on me and said she never opened the door. Her secretary was there who I had previously gone to for support and now thinks I’m delusional.

I think I need to go to the hospital but I’m scared what she will do while I’m gone. She made me her power of attorney and I’m scared she’s going to get me in trouble for that somehow. I’m so scared because I know I need to escape from her but I don’t know how to do it while I’m in a mental illness crisis. Especially given that she is a lawyer and has power in my community.

So much of my mental illness has been caused by gaslighting that I don’t know how to trust my own perceptions anymore. But I do know that I have been gaslighted by my mother since I was a child. I’m not sure if I was gaslighted by my ex-boyfriend. I was definitely gaslighted by the boyfriend I had right before him. And I was definitely gaslighted by a therapist.

I’m so confused. I wish I had someone I could trust to guide me through this. That used to be my ex-boyfriend who helped me make sense of things but now he refuses to talk to me and threatens to call the police on me so I don’t know what to do.",23Nov2019,1

428,"I have a best friend/brother. Been friends at this point for 13 years. We've had ups and downs and always a difference of opinion but we've never thought of each other as anything less than family. But over a year ago ""our"" dad died and we both took it hard but completely differently. I made a bunch of changes in my life I felt were to better myself. 

Quit smoking cigarettes, got a real job with 40 hour work week, began eating better, met new people/friends, started thinking a lot more rather than just doing. 

Meanwhile he just stayed the same if not reverted to something worse. Now staying the same for him isn't a good thing. This friend has a lot of problems themselves that we've addressed over the years and tried to help with but it never sticks with him. He's a hoarder, doesn't bathe, refuses to get a job even though he lives off $50ish a month, and has a real bad tendency to lash out when things don't go his way. He's one of those people who will insult his friends to others to make himself seem taller. 

While I haven't just straight up abandoned this friendship, I have distanced myself from it. He obviously knows this. We went from hanging out every weekend playing video games in my basement to maybe once a month. 

Meanwhile about 3 years ago I reconnected with an old school friend. We played online games only for the most part until last yearish when we started hanging out. Since then me and the old school friend(OSF) have become best friends. I've got him a job at my place, which makes it so we see each other a lot and spend a good amount of our weekends together.

The only thing about OSF is that he's a drinker, a self admitted functioning alcoholic. 

Me ? I used to never drink. Hated it. I'd nurse a beer or have a glass of wine at a gathering to avoid the I don't drink conversation. But yea that slowly turned into more avid drinking with OSF, since March of this year I've drank more than I ever have before. I know my limits and feel I don't abuse it. 

I never drink in the week, besides one time at a staff party. And only drink beer or wine never liquor. Looking back at my calendar I've roughly been drunk one weekend or two a month since May. 

Now for the chain of events that lead to this post. Last weekend my friend/brother came over for our monthly hang out. Now I knew all night we would be playing Jedi Fallen Order, so I grabbed a cheap white wine. Figured I'd nurse the bottle for the night in my pjs while hanging out with my bud. Didn't finish the bottle or even get drunk. The night ended up being very boring. All he does is just continuously scroll as soon as soon as he gets the Wi-Fi. Conversations were very one sided, I was having better ones with BD-1. 

Jump to last night. I did get fucked up with OSF. I had a few glasses of wine and a beer. We had a pretty fun time. At one point I texted friend/brother for help finding a song, we were obviously drunk and having a good time. 

This morning I get a long text about how I'm becoming an alcoholic because I hang out with one. And I'm just kinda left confused. 

Honestly I don't know what the gauge is for being an alcoholic. Like I said I've never been much of a drinker. I enjoy a drink but have never felt the need for one and could easily pass it up. 

The last think to consider is that I'm a pretty big stoner. If you were to ask me if I abuse a substance I would probably tell you I smoke too much weed. I rip a bowl every night. But even with weed I know my limits and never smoke during the day unless I have no responsibility to worry for. Yet my friend/brother has never had concern about this habit. 

So I'm at a stand still here. Is this a friend just worried about me ? Am I becoming an alcoholic? Or is he jealous I have new friends ? Is it all of the above ?",23Nov2019,1
429,"Obligatory notice that I’m typing on mobile, very sorry for formatting :(

In May 2018 I made a check out to this technical school I was planning to take a class with. The next month, they told me they’d lost the check and could I please write another. I declined and was told him it’s ok I’ll just not take the class and put a stop payment on it. He also told me if he found the check he wouldn’t cash it. I thought that was the end of the issue. 

In October 2019 (so more than 1.5yrs later) I received a notice that the check was deposited. After calling Bank of America , I found out that stop payments are only valid for a year (they did disclose this in the original stop payment, it’s on me for not noticing). I was just wondering if there was any way I would be able to get the money back since I obviously did not take the class. I’m planning to go see the director at the technical school on Monday but I’m really nervous he won’t give the money back.

433,"We've been best friends since we met. We never went to the same school but met at camp, so our friendship was mostly through emails, IM, and texting, though we'd visit for birthdays at least, or over the summer. Near the end of high school, she moved to a different city and sorta vanished for a good three years, but I never gave up on the friendship (I think ghosting is really immature, so if you wanna end the friendship, just say it to my face). Turns out she was undiagnosed with severe mental problems at the time, so once she got medication, our conversations resumed back to normal. We've both gone through depression and suicidal ideation, so I always made a point to hear from her at least once a week so I know (and so she knows) things are okay. 

But then after college, I moved out of state for work, and... for the past year, things have been weird. We've remained friends over time and distance and living in different cities, so I didnt think this would be different. But she's more and more distant, and I am slowly realizing that the only time she ever texts back is to either vent about some struggle in her life or to share some of her accomplishments. It's all good, and I've done the same, too. But then recently I hit a real tough spot in my life and I completely shut off for almost a month, and.... she didnt even check in to say hi. Which hurt. So when I got back on my feet, I checked in again to apologize for disappearing and to let her know that I was hurting (I believe in open honesty after hiding things in a past relationship made things go horribly wrong). And she made it all about her, saying she was afraid of ruining things or making things worse. I was left comforting her to assure her that I'm not mad and things are good between us and all that. But really, it hurt even more that the one time I need a little encouragement, I'm still having to give it.

Most of the time, I'm fine with that. It's only rarely I feel like I really need a friend to come alongside me. But when I needed it, my best friend wasn't there. I don't have any other friends really, and I don't make friends easily since I'm so cerebral and introverted and don't enjoy going out.

So I guess I'm wondering if this deep and close friendship was even real, or if there's anything I'm doing wrong or need to come to terms with. I do feel like I've been a little selfish lately, internally demanding I be treated a little differently by someone who isn't in a place to give me that. I go over and above for my friends because that's how much I love people, and I don't need to expect the same in return. But I also wonder if I've just been blinding myself to the reality of the situation. Have I really never had a friend who loves me as much as I love them? You'd think a thirty-year-old would have this figured out by now, but I guess I still have a lot of learning to do.",23Nov2019,1
434,"My whole life my mother has kept me isolated by spreading rumors to other people about me and gaslighting me. I’m 22 now and it’s come to an emergency level now. I am mentally ill (bipolar and PTSD), broke up with my boyfriend who I lived with a few months ago, and I’ve been trying to contact him and his family for help but they are all convinced I’m just spoiled and want my ex-boyfriend back. They’ve called the police on me for going over there after a scary thing happened with my mother.

The situation is complicated because I actually am mentally ill but she is twisting it to make it look like I’m crazy and manipulative rather than stressed out and confused. For example the other day she left the door open at the house so the cat (an indoor cat) could get out when I had asked her before not to do that, I freaked out and lost my shit because I was already under tons of stress and I couldn’t handle my mother purposely letting the cat out on top of all of it, so she called the police on me and said she never opened the door. Her secretary was there who I had previously gone to for support and now thinks I’m delusional.

I think I need to go to the hospital but I’m scared what she will do while I’m gone. She made me her power of attorney and I’m scared she’s going to get me in trouble for that somehow. I’m so scared because I know I need to escape from her but I don’t know how to do it while I’m in a mental illness crisis. Especially given that she is a lawyer and has power in my community.

So much of my mental illness has been caused by gaslighting that I don’t know how to trust my own perceptions anymore. But I do know that I have been gaslighted by my mother since I was a child. I’m not sure if I was gaslighted by my ex-boyfriend. I was definitely gaslighted by the boyfriend I had right before him. And I was definitely gaslighted by a therapist.

I’m so confused. I wish I had someone I could trust to guide me through this. That used to be my ex-boyfriend who helped me make sense of things but now he refuses to talk to me and threatens to call the police on me so I don’t know what to do.",23Nov2019,1
435,"So Ill try and make this story fast but the background info is a little important. For perspective, I started college in the fall of 2016.

During all of my college experience, I have struggled with my mental health. After not getting it fully checked out at school I failed out of my university after my sophomore year. I enrolled in a community college in the area because I wanted to be able to transfer back to my original university. I am struggling in reenrolling to my previous university and at this point, my mental health is so bad that I don't even know if  I want to go back to college. 

I struggle with knowing that I will have a hard time getting a job and going to culinary school if I do not get my bachelor's degree, but I am so done with being in a teaching classroom and I just want to begin culinary school.

437,"Okay, so I'm a pretty private person and I don't even tell my family what I'm up to because I don't want anyone to be up in my business. Recently, I was helping my sister's boyfriend with his physics homework and my sister got a text from a person saying that she was my cousin's friend and that she was looking for my number because she had heard that I'm a math tutor. 

So it's true that I teach math, but I haven't told anyone this and I've only worked with high school students and one college students for physics. I have no idea how she could have found out.  

She texted me separately on facebook messenger and asked if I teach math. I told her I did, but that I'm not taking on any new students, because I'm busy with school and my regular day job. I then got curious and texted her later asking how she knew I tutor, which she ignored. I'm wondering if I should text my cousin directly how she found out, but I'm also not sure if that would just expose me to further questioning by family members. The fact that this girl references my cousin when she first starts talking to me makes believe that my cousin is the source. 

And before you ask, I don't tell my family things because we aren't on good terms and we never have been. They usually make me feel like shit and there's just a history of problems between us. They'll either pick on my weight, my social class, being an immigrant, or they'll just say nasty things about me behind my back.

451,"Hey Reddit,

I owned two guinea pigs for the past 5 years. Recently, one of them has passed away due to cancer and that devastated me. I have one more baby left who is already about 5-6 and I realized that I may only have a few years left with him. 

After finding out that cancer is quite common in guinea pigs, I don’t think I can own another guinea pig again as I don’t want to go through what I did one more time. 

I’m a graduating senior in College and I will most likely be living in an apartment (I live in a dorm right now) in the future. I do have mental health issues which is why the guinea pigs were very crucial, besides the fact that they are like my own babies, and they provided emotional support for me. 

I’ve been thinking about what I should do after my guinea pig passes. I’d really like to avoid small animals such as hamsters, ferrets, etc. due to their short lifespan and lack of familiarity. 

I love dogs and cats quite equally, but there are pros and cons to both which is why I’m wondering if I should even have another pet later on. 

For dogs, I love them to death. I just worry that I’ll be neglecting them while I pursue my masters degree or if I go straight to work. I feel like I won’t be able to play with them often or take them out frequently which makes me hesitant to adopt one. I was thinking about getting a dog once I have a family so that they won’t be so lonely and neglected. 

For cats, I’ve had some good experiences with them. I know there are cats that can be just as affectionate as dogs and seem to be low maintenance compared to a dog which would be ideal for me —- the only issue is that I’m allergic to cats. To some cats, the allergies are severe enough to make my eyes swell. Other cats, the allergies aren’t so bad, just sneezing a lot. I’ve been leaning more on getting a cat, my only concern is the allergies and “temperament” of a cat. 

If I were to ever get a small animal again, I’d consider getting a ferret. However I don’t know too much about them and I think their life span is about the same as guinea pigs. I don’t like the idea of having another caged animal but I’ve seen stories of people who let their ferrets roam around just like a cat or dog. 

I’m also open to not having a pet, I’m not selfish enough to neglect an animal just because I feel like I need the emotional support. 

So I’d like to ask Reddit if you guys have any advice on what I should do, or what kind of pet I should get if at all. 

Thank you.",23Nov2019,1

466,"I'm 16f and got a job at a grocery store, just over half a year ago. I don't want to say which franchise because this has nothing to do with hating the grocery store I work at. I have two managers in my department, one that is in charge of me and a few other people, and another that is in charge of the other half of my department. This is about the one that isn't completely in charge of me, but he still obviously does have some power.

  
When I first met my manager (m40\~), he gave me such a bad feeling. There was just something off. We shook hands normally, but the way he made eye contact made me feel like he was staring into my soul. I told a few friends about the weird encounter and tried to get over it. It wasn't until summer vacation that things started getting weird. We went from seeing each other once a week to almost the whole week since I was no longer in school. We began talking more and developed a great friendship. I do genuinely enjoy him being around but it just bothers me what he sometimes does. He is diagnosed with ADHD and I'm not sure if this is a result of the medication or lack of it, but I'm not a psychologist. I've had friends with ADHD in the past, but none of them are as hyper and loud.

  
He will stand side by side with me and have his entire side pressed against me and just stand there while I'm working. He won't say anything or he'll ask me about something work-related. He always wants to stand SUPER close to me when we talk. I can't remember the last conversation we had where he wasn't in my personal space. He never asks me to move when he needs something and will just reach over me to get it. None of my other coworkers ever touch me, except my own manager, who I've willingly hugged twice, but her and I have a different dynamic. His conversations with me are always funny and lighthearted. He's never made any creepy comments or asked me anything inappropriate. Since school is back, I don't see him as often. He hasn't done anything recently beside stand close to me while I've been working and asked about my week.

  
I've only told a few close friends and my sister, and they all agreed that it was a little weird. I'm not sure if it's because he has kids of his own and just doesn't know how to show his appreciation or something. I feel overreactive now that I'm typing this out, but I had been sexually and emotionally abused by my ex-boyfriend two years ago and it may just be me being paranoid that it'll happen again. The age gap is probably the most unsettling part, but I don't know if he just thinks of me like his oldest daughter who's around my age. He has a horrible family life and his wife is extremely controlling and he has little to no freedom. I'm not trying to let him use that as an excuse to be touchy, but it's probably an important detail.

470,"For context, I’m a 16 year old girl from Puerto Rico and I have a 13 year old sister with a history of mental illness. Our dad died when I was 10. 

I got in a big fight with my mom. She came to my room early in the morning asking to borrow some money. She said she had about 1.5k but had to transfer it to another account and that it wouldn’t be reflected until this Monday. I gave her the $20 I had and she went out. I half expected her to take care of the low gas on the car, but instead she went over to CVS and bought two bottles of wine for herself. I had told her though that a school club had asked me to go to Costco over the week to buy some chocolate boxes for fundraising and that they had given me $60 to do so.  About two hours later she told me to get in the car because we were going over to her boyfriend’s house and that she needed to borrow more money for gas. I told her I didn’t have any left and she told me to lend her the club’s money. I refused because it wasn’t my money and reminded her that I had already given her money and that she had chosen to buy wine rather than put gas in the car. She became LIVID. She started hitting and slapping me while calling me a bitch and demanding that I give her the money, but I didn’t budge. We were halfway to the gas station when she stopped the car and started punching me square in the face and busted my lip. I then hit her back once, a fist clashing against her shoulder. I recognize that that was a mistake, but I don’t regret it completely. It only speaks to how done I am with constantly being put in this situation and made her stop hitting me for a second. She told me to get out of the car and to leave home. I grabbed my backpack and started walking when she told me to get back in and asked if she could drop me off somewhere. I told her I needed a ride to the police station and she said that she’d take me. While we were on my way my sister texted my uncle and to,d him what was going on. My sister told my mom that he wanted to know at what police station she was dropping me off, which made her get mad at her and say that we were going home. When we got here she told me that she wouldn’t go to the station and that I should go to my room and reflect on whether or not I actually wanted to do this. 

Anyway, it seems to me like the reason she doesn’t want me to leave, especially towards a police station rather than friends or family is because of the conclusions that people would draw up about her. Honestly though, she’s had this one a long time coming. Ever since my dad died  she’s been drinking nonstop, 2-6 bottles a wine a day, and hitting my sister and I. I’m over it. I tried sucking it up, I tried talking to her and I tried getting her to go to therapy. I don’t want to and I don’t have to deal with this anymore. I want to leave. However, I also know that I can’t stay with friends because I’d feel like an uninvited guest and that I can’t stay with family because they all live in the states (other than my uncle who plays illegal poker for a loving). The only other option I see that doesn’t include moving out of the country right before senior year is to move inti a foster home with my sister, which would be bad for her mental health.

Odd post, but I feel perplexed at the moment and I genuinely don't know what I am doing wrong or rather what trait of mine is causing this disinterest about me.

To start off, my best friend gets girls so easily cause of his character(but he is also attractive, around 8.5/10) and he tells me that he never hit up a girl first.(weird flex but ok)

I have dated around 3 girls but never been lucky, not going into details about how they treated me and why but I don't get what some others are doing better. I'm not going into the whole Nice guy and douchebag dilemma because I will get mauled by the density of some redditors, and I need serious advice.

I would say I am fairly attractive(my most attractive friend thinks I am more attractive than him), honest, not dense, have emotional intelligence and intuition, I am never an asshole, or rather, it takes a lot to make me an asshole towards someone. I do not show insecurity since the first girl, calibrated my confidence to a certain degree, have good styling(not exclusively subjective), I have good hygiene, well groomed, I can be a funny guy, attentive, I am fairly tall, good built but not over shred, almost perfect weight(my ideal body). Do I lack indifference? I don't spam when chatting with a SO, give them space, but I find myself starting the conversation always. What can I improve so I can be more interesting to girls?",23Nov2019,1
473,"I met this guy through a mutual friend in August and I guess we are dating. Every guy that I have been with dumps me because I guess I have an attitude and am too insecure. I basically grew up with no parents or anyone. I always felt like a black sheep everywhere I went. My mom liked to ridicule and embarrass me all the time. I used to be good at hiding how I felt but as I have gotten older I just seem to lash out at people. 


He and I usually spend weekends together. He always ask if I want to go places with him and I always say no. He gets annoyed and tells me I never want to do anything. Yesterday he asked if I could drive him to a buddy's house because he wanted to see if they were home. He's like if he's home you should come in and hang with us and we can play pool. He went there and I guess the guy was home because he motioned with his hand for me to come inside and I backed out of the driveway and left. When we do hangout we usually just sit on the couch and watch movies and usually have sex. 


I don't like meeting people and I am not really a social person. I just like to be alone. He says he is getting sick of my attitude and wishes I was happy.",23Nov2019,1

476,"Alt account because I need impartial opinions and my post history on my main account makes me easily identifiable to people I know personally.

So I (Female, 18) met a guy (20) on Tinder roughly a month and a half ago. We had a great first date, and over these past several weeks I've really started to like him. He's sarcastic and funny but also knows how to hold down a serious conversation - and I know this is corny but I've not really had a connection like that with a guy before, I can't fault him.

Some information you might need to know before I *fully* get into the story: I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I usually take medication (Prozac) for it, but these past couple of weeks I've been trying to slide myself off of the crutch and deal with them in a more permanent manner (therapy, exercise, social interactions etc. etc.) 

I've also had a bad encounter when I was fourteen that has not only affect my ability to really get raw with people, but my mental health as well, and as such it's affected a few other relationships in my life in a negative manner. The guy I've been seeing doesn't know any of this.

The problem is, is that he's in the military and currently lives only forty-five minutes from where I stay (I'm at university). He told me a couple of weeks ago that he's due to move because of a promotion. I'm so proud of him and it's awesome that he's getting rewarded for his work because I can tell he works super hard and really cares about his job, but it means that he'll be like an eight hours' drive away, which sucks.

He has a house in a city that's two and a half hours by train from me, and he usually travels there to see his family and best friends (and will continue to do so from his new place). He invited me down for a weekend before Christmas, but told me that I'd most likely meet his parents - which made me panic a little bit. It's still really early days for us both, and he ended a four and a half year relationship in June, so we're both not really ready to make it serious. 

I messaged him the other day after some deliberation and basically the conversation went like this:

**Me:** ""This *has* been fun and I've loved getting to know you, but meeting your parents is kind of a big thing and I'd kind of need a bit more clarification on where we stand currently.""

**Him:** ""I know it is. But I can't step into anything more than what we have now, which is simple and fun.""

**Me:** ""I just don't know what to do. It would be shitty for me to expect you to drive all the way up to see me (I don't drive) on weekends because it's such a long journey, so I want to be able to at least meet you halfway. I also can't expect you not to see your parents when you're in town because - like I said - that'd be shitty too. So I just don't know.""

**Him:** ""I'm sorry but I just can't offer you anything more than what I'm giving you. After my breakup I'm sure you can understand my hesitations about potentially moving onto a semi-serious status.""

**Me:** ""So what do you want to do?""

**Him:** ""I don't know if we should just quit while we're ahead.""

**Me:** ""So you want to end it?""

**Him:** ""I don't want to, but it might be for the best.""

I said 'okay' at the time and asked to see him one more time before he moves for work, but I really don't want to end it. I feel like this could be something really good, and I never wanted a promise or a commitment from him, I just wanted to know that it wasn't going to be a huge waste of time some three-four-five months down the line.

I spoke to my best friend and asked for her advice, and she said something that really stuck with me: ""Even if it doesn't work out in the future, it won't ever have been a waste of your time because you've had fun and you've enjoyed the moments you spent together."" And she's right. 

So I was thinking of proposing a new plan. I prefer the idea of overcoming my anxieties and meeting his parents over potentially having him leave my life, because I value his presence too much. But maybe we just keep things really low key and casual and then reevaluate come New Year, because he had originally told me he would think about status during Christmas, but I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable or rush him whatsoever. 

I don't know if maybe I should tell him about my negative experiences and my mental health stuff, just to further explain that I'm in no way apprehensive because of *him,* but because of other things going on. I'm no way trying to use it as an excuse, but I don't know if it might clear some things up?

At the same time, however, I don't know if I should let him go? I don't want to disregard his wants or needs, and I don't want to think selfishly. I just would rather have tried to make it work despite the distance and it turn out unfavourably rather than not have tried and for it to end now.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) Sorry for the length!!!!",23Nov2019,1
477,"I work for a large retail chain. I started there two years ago and trained in nearly every department so that I could impress my superiors. It took a LOT of work, but I finally got promoted about 6 months ago. 

I’ve never really liked it. I was good at it so for some reason I kept thinking I wanted to be a manager. Now I am a manager, and my mental health it deteriorated quickly. I’ve always had anxiety/depression, but it’s being severely irritated by this job and the people I work with. 

It’s worth mentioning that there are a handful of people I became really close with at this job (meaning I was close with them when they were managers and I wasn’t yet) and now those friendships are proving to be really toxic and bad for me. Most of the time I wish I didn’t have to see them every day because they make me feel so bad about my life and myself. 

My fiancé had a mechanical background and works at a factory. Now this factory has different depts that do different things, and he said I should apply because they pay the same thing I’m currently making. 

It’s also worth noting that my fiancé thinks that my CURRENT job is bad for me. He says it affects my overall attitude whether I’m working or not, and I know he’s right. 

I had an interview at the factory and it looks like I’ll be offered a job soon. The shifts are 12 hrs overnight, which isn’t desirable, but also doesn’t bother me that much. 

My mom offered to let me move back in with her until I find something else but she and I’s arguments are why I moved out in the first place.

480,"TLDR: I am feeling extremely low, and realizing that it’s been something I’ve dealt with many other times in the past. I’m wondering if anyone else who has felt this way before has any strategies or solutions that have been helpful? 

I wrote a journal entry today about how I’ve been feeling lately, as I just seem to be stuck in negativity and unhappiness. It’s been really weighing me down and negatively affecting my relationship as well. I’m going to post it below, and if you or anyone else you know can relate, it would mean so much to know of any strategies I could use to help me pull myself up out of this hole. I also apologize in advance for my overuse of metaphor to describe my experience.  


“I am once again in that same familiar headspace that I have so many times called home. I’ve always wanted to be in a “good place”. For some people, it seems so easy. It has never been easy for me. 

For as long as I can remember, a cloud has loomed over my head. Whether it was storming, or raining, or simply just resting above me, it has always existed. Even when I felt sun on my face, the cloud always remained and I knew it. Now it is back, and I can feel the rain pounding against my face, and I just want to be free from the storm once again. 

It’s not that I don’t know what it takes to make me Happy; I know of many things and experiences that bring me joy. It’s also not as if I have never been happy; I can pinpoint moments and whole periods of time when I basked in the sun. The issue is that, when things begin to get challenging in any way, I feel as if I get stuck in the rain. Even with knowing what it takes to get out, I find myself unmotivated to do so. This is endlessly frustrating. It leaves me looking for excuses, which I can usually find readily. It is easy to find things to blame for my unhappiness, but it is nearly impossible for me to work my way out of it.

The most troublesome part of all of this is that I sometimes seek out the storm. It might be that I feel happy, and I start to focus my energy on worrying about what could bring me down. Other times I engage in dynamics that have brought about a storm in the past, but I continue to pursue them anyways. Sometimes my problems begin as small things, but I don’t deal with them until they have cannonballs and become so overwhelming that I don’t have the energy to deal with them any longer. Other times I make problems out of nothing, and suddenly I’m in a storm of my own making.

I’ve spent a lot of time being bothered by this cloud above my head. I’ve heard people who tried to help me get out from under it by shifting the blame on to them when I’m really disappointed with myself. This only makes me feel that I deserve this cloud and all of the negativity that it brings. Sometimes I think that I sabotage healthy relationships because I don’t think I deserve their help when I will inevitably bring them pain as well. I am so sick of hurting people and myself because I feel so stuck and lacking in energy to get out from under this cloud. 

I can only imagine how many opportunities for joy and improvement I’ve squandered because I couldn’t see, or failed to even look for, the sun. I desperately want to see it again and understand how to find it, even on the darkest of days.”",23Nov2019,1

487,"I've been at my job for about 2 years now. After being here for a little over a year, I was promoted to a shift lead. I was told that I'd be my coworkers direct line of contact when on duty, and that if it was something I couldn't handle, the owner or 2 other managers would be my line of contact. At the beginning of summer, we got two new people. We were in desperate need of staff, so they were hired on immediately. The thing is, they didn't disclose that they were in a relationship prior to starting and the owner let it slide because, again, we desperately needed the staff.

Fast forward to about a week ago, I walked in on them in the back of the building. Now, my workplace is lenient about a lot of things, but I walked in on the woman with most of her breasts exposes, him feeling them up, and them making out. I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. I kind of backed away and made a comment to a another coworker in a different room about going to smoke in a rather loud manner to catch their attention. When I walked back in, she had covered up and they had separated. I didn't undergo a lot of training when moved into my shift lead position, so I wasn't quite sure how to handle it. After smoking, I called my manager to ask for her take on the situation. I explained the events as I did above and explained that it made me extremely uncomfortable. She said she found that behavior extremely inappropriate and that she'd notify the owner and get back to me.

Once my manager got back to me, she said the owner was pissed and that she'd meet with both of them the next morning. The next day I came into work, the owner made a comment along the lines of ""Weenus, you're 22 years old. You act like you've never seen boobs before."" She hasn't made any mention of what I walked in on since. She hasn't had a meeting with the other two since. I genuinely don't know if I can work in a place where my discomfort is turned into a joke. Is there any salvaging this situation or should I just start looking for a new job? There's no HR department, as it's a pretty small business.

We don’t live close by but we meet up a few times a year and communicate by text. He’s struggled with alcoholism for a long time and has always had issues with depression and self loathing but all of these things have massively escalated over the past few months. 

Recently he has been sending me masses upon masses of texts every couple of days about how much he hates himself and doesn’t want to be here any more. I have begged him to seek professional help, to call a crisis team. It is beyond me being someone to talk to and to give advice at this point, nothing I say to him helps. He’s an incredibly stubborn person who is so fixated on hating himself that nothing I say lifts it even slightly. He has recently tried to kill himself and still refuses to get emergency help. 

I also suffer with mental health issues and if I find something too emotionally difficult I involuntarily withdraw and bury my head in the sand. It’s a terrible defence mechanism, I know, but it’s something I almost have no control over.

492," A little backstory: 

I’m 27 about to turn 28 and currently live in Phoenix, Arizona. I realized I wanted to be a filmmaker when I was a sophomore in high school, making skits with a few of my friends on our drama teacher’s camcorder. Eventually, I decided to get a degree in film. I couldn’t afford the tuition of film schools in California or New York, so I went with ASU. This wasn’t a terrilble prospect to me because then I’d at least be going to college with a handful of poeple I knew from my hometown. This is a key thing to note; friends are as important as family to me. Fast-forward four years. I’ve graduated with a degree in film and freaking the fuck out. I didn’t know the first thing about working in film (something that’s horrendously missing from many a film school’s curriculum). I didn’t have any money and was at the tail end of a dying relationship. I was depressed. My now ex-girlfriend and I were thinking about moving to LA together, but, after a few financial setbacks, my step-dad convinced me I had no way of getting to LA. So, I didn’t. I found a shitty little studio in Tempe and my ex moved (her mother was well-off and could afford to subsidize her). This was in 2015, a year after I graduated college. Since then, I’ve built a new life. I got a job as a videographer at a non-profit where I feel appreciated, got medicated for my depression, developed strong friendships with a few film people, and even made a few short films in the last four years. At the beginning of 2019, I met a wonderful woman and we’ve had a great relationship the past 9 months. However, right around the time we met, my film friends and I started talking about making the move to LA.; one is even applying to a prestigious Masters program there. And here is my dilmma:

My girlfriend is amazing. She’s smart, sweet, and hilarious. She’s in an MBA program and has a promising future. We’re very much in love. Yes, we have our problems, but we’re very communicative and, for the most part, we’re very good at resolving our conflicts. The one conflict we have yet to resolve is the issue of moving to LA. She’s currently in an internship at a HUGE tech company and it’s likely she’ll be able to get a job right out of school with a great salary. I’m so fucking proud of her. The problem is that this job she may be offered would be in Portland, which is decidedly not LA. We’ve talked about her moving to LA with me and she’s been looking at her employment opportunities there, but, realistically, sending blind correspondence to hiring managers in a town she’s never lived in bears much less fruit than the connections she’s made in her internship. I’ve been candid with her, telling her she needs to do what will be best for her. After all, she was on this course before meeting me and who am I to fuck that up? We had a talk last weekend where she flat-out asked: if she moved to Portland, would I come with her? I said no, but I’m not completely sure about it. I’d love to live in Portland much more than LA. I think the life we could make together up there would be wonderful. But, I wouldn’t be able to pursue my own goals. And more, I’d be moving away from the friends who are important to me. I’d feel like I was backing out or welching on an agreement. I want to be a professional screenwriter and there’s not really - as far as I know - a film industry in Portland. I’ve considered - and my girlfriend has supported - the idea of being a novelist instead (something I can easily do in Portland), but that’s not really the path I’ve been forging the last 10+ years. 

So, Reddit, I’m at the point where I need some perspective. As far as I can figure, I have four options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. We both move to LA. PROS: I will have the opportunity to go after my dream, but she will have given up an extremely lucrative opportunity. I’ll be where my friends are and we’ll be pursuing the same or similar goals. CONS: There’s a chance she could grow to regret me. The cost of living in LA is high and there’s no guarantee of success. LA is a risky move.
2. We go our separate ways and break up. Same LA pros and cons apply. CONS: I will have given up a good relationship. 
3. We both move to Portland. PROS: She’ll have a well-paying job, affording me the flexibility to pursue a writing career. I’d love living in Portland. CONS: I will be away from my friends and I will be once again giving up the opportunity to move to LA and take my shot at working in film. There’s the possibility I will grow to resent her. 
4. We both go our separate ways, but try to maintain a long-distance relationship. PROS: We will both be going after what we want and won’t have to endure the pain of breaking up, nor the strain of resenting one another. CONS: Long-distance is not preferable to me. I’ve done it before and it has never worked.

I hope I’ve included all pertinent details and that it’s not too confusing. What do you folks have for me? 

TL;DR I want to move to LA to be a screenwriter. My girlfriend wants to move to Portland. What do I do???",23Nov2019,1
493,"The first paragraph is background to my situation, and the second is where I ask the advice I need. 

I’m 18 years old, and recently (two days ago) I went to church and noticed his car was there at an unusual time. I went to walk inside the church, but the door was deliberately locked from the outside. I went back to my car to wait for him, and I checked my family tracking app and it had shown that he was inside. About 30 minutes later, he comes out of the church with a younger female (20-24) and comes to my car and is quite surprised, quiet, and something simply felt off about him. He asked me why I was there and I told him to get cash so I can go her my hair cut and he said “alright, can you drive this girl to the metro station?” I had decided to not ask any questions or confront, and I pretended like I had no idea what was going on. I told him that was fine, but after that, he told me to not tell her I was his son. I did not have to chance to see if his wedding ring was on or off. I pretended I was totally okay with it, and he proceeded to tell the girl I will drive her to the metro station, and he is especially careful to not mention that I am his son to her. She gets in the car, and an initial whiff of liquor strikes me, and it slowly subsided after a minute or two. After this, he goes into the church to grab cash, puts it in an envelope, and walks towards my car while wiping his lips, he comes to my window and says “here you go, ____,” calling me by my first name (which he never does). I then start to put the envelope in my middle console, and I see him make the “shushing” sign with his fingers towards the girl from my peripheral vision. This was a dead giveaway for me. As I’m driving the girl to the metro station, I am surprised as to how young she is, that she can relate to my music tastes, TikToks, and even college stress. She also told me very weird stories about how she’s into white men (she was African American with a thick African accent), also adding stories about a nursing internship she has where she “cleans old men’s balls and they get hard and talk highly of her.” My fathers cover-up? He is a psychotherapy intern and has required counseling sessions with people of various ages. This was a “counseling session.” Who picks up a college students from the metro station, brings her to a secluded room inside the church, and then proceeds to have a 2 1/2 hour long “therapy session” that requires denying your son and deliberately locking the front door of the church? 

So now that the situation is out of the way, here is what I need advice on. My parents have been together all of my life, (20 years), and I have a 7yo brother and 11yo sister. I do not want to see them go through the hardships of a divorce. Neither my mom nor my dad could properly support the children with their income if they were alone, and my mom would probably get custody, leaving me to be the man of the house. My father is a well known orthodox priest, and a cheating scandal would destroy his career, he would lose his job as a priest and be publicly criticized and shamed by the orthodox community NATIONWIDE. On top of this, I’m not sure how his psychotherapy degree and certification will play out following an incident like this. What do I do??????? I currently feel like I can no longer look at my dad in the same loving way. I now look at him as another man that simply supports me, not as my father. I feel as if telling my mother would be CATASTROPHIC. Maybe she would forgive him and stay together for the kids, but knowing how emotional and loving my mother is towards him, she will NOT take this lightly. If I talk to just him, what do I say? How do I approach this? I love my father and I know how much my mother loves him. But this situation is not just an affair. It’s a career-ending, family destroying, public dilemma.",23Nov2019,1
494,"Need advice for a way to defend ourselves. It all started with peaceful protests due to the sudden price increase and it turned into heavy anti government protests. The government is extremely corrupt. government forces are probably ordered to kill and completely suppress the protests. They are shooting people from really long distances as if people are armed. so you can't gang up on someone and take they're gun. No warning shots. Local TV is a fucking joke it's actually funny how obviously fake everything on TV is. They've shut down the internet and even when it's up it's heavily censored. You can't recover the corpse of your loved ones from hospitals because they are loading the corpses on trucks and taking em elsewhere and if you ask for the corpses,(so u can bury them) either they are ''gone'' or you have to pay a lot for the damages that they have caused before getting killed. Also guns aren't normally available to people. So we're basically fucked. Is there a way we can fight the government forces or spread the news inside the country.",23Nov2019,1
495,"A week ago, I took in an old friend I haven’t seen in three years. We had a falling out because they did something very hurtful to me. I decided to look past what they did and help them out when we reunited last week. 

They are REALLY struggling lately, their family has been broken apart by divorce and addiction and mental illness, they recently were diagnosed with the same personality disorder I have, they’re suicidal, and in a rocky relationship with their partner who’s staying with us as well. They’re not even in their 20s yet. I empathized a lot with them when they first got here, I can’t imagine how hard things have been for them... However, my compassion is starting to run dry quickly as I get more frustrated with them and their partner.

When they first got here, I wasn’t hard on them about finances and keeping the apartment clean because I figured they needed to catch a break after being in and out of homeless shelters for months. Them and their partner would offer to help out around the apartment the first few days and it was somewhat helpful. But now, they’re not doing much and they’re eating and smoking tons of the food and weed that me and my partner pay for.

I’m trying to be understanding of my friend because they have the same personality disorder as me and from my personal experience, its disabled me. So I feel like I’m pretty understanding of having days to weeks of feeling down and being unable to stay productive... but their partner definitely doesn’t have an excuse. Either way, they both should be helping out more. 

I feel like I’m doing everything when my partner is at work and that’s a lot for me. Them being here has triggered me to have a manic episode, so I find myself not getting much sleep and keeping busy cleaning, getting groceries, running errands, and cooking. Despite me working hard to keep up maintenance around the house, it’s just getting messier and more disorganized as the days pass. The more comfortable they get being here, the more they’re getting into our stuff and not putting it back, they’re smoking more of our weed which is expensive and for medicinal purposes for my partner and me, and they’re eating through our whole pantry which wasn’t that big to begin with. Now they’re even making requests when I go to the grocery store, even though I’ve brought it to their attention multiple times that I’m trying to cut down on expenses because this living situation is causing our bank account to become scary low... and I highly doubt they’ll be able to pay us back.

I’m getting so stressed out and I really don’t want this to have to end with me kicking them out. We were discussing a living situation where we’d move up to a two bedroom and put them on the lease once they and their partner had an income. But now, even if they did start pulling in money, I’m worried I can’t trust them to keep up their half and that they wouldn’t be considerate of me and my partner since they’re already disregarding our feelings now. Not to mention that they’re also fighting multiple times a day with each other and then trying to drag my partner and I into their arguments which is REALLY awkward and uncomfortable...

I think I’m just in shock of how quickly things changed. All I ask is that my friend look into getting disability and their partner apply to jobs until they get one. But they don’t even do that. They’re literally just smoking all day every day and they’re smoking stuff that they didn’t even pay a cent for. I’m really surprised how comfortable they are with making my home and my stuff, their own. They also told us they were completely broke when they first got here and now I’m coming to find out that they actually have money in savings but they don’t want to spend any of it. And then they turn around and order themselves food the other night and pay $100 for a piercing... Am I being selfish here or is it right to think that this money should’ve been going to me and my partner?

Sorry, this has been a long explanation. I’m just very lost as to what I should do. I’ve been trying to subtly confront them about things here and there the past couple days. I don’t know if they don’t care or what, but things haven’t changed. How do I get serious about confronting them without sounding hostile or not understanding of their situation? I really want to be able to work things out, but even if we do, I’m scared I’m not going to be able to trust them to keep up their half of things. I just really don’t want it to come to them having to be homeless again :(

I don’t like complaining, but we really have made a lot of sacrifices for them to stay here. We now don’t have money to get a Christmas tree, go Black Friday shopping, do a holiday trip, go on dates, or get our family presents for Christmas. This is our first holiday season as a married couple too. I know what we’re doing for them is a lot more important than holiday festivities, but it’s still disappointing and hard to let go of when I’ve been looking forward to this time of year. I just want them to really realize fully how much we’re giving up for them to be here and be more understanding of the fact that our income is not enough for four fully grown adults. How do I word this kindly but also seriously with them?

Thank you so much for hearing out my frustrations, any advice is very much appreciated!",23Nov2019,1
496,"I may sound like a dick saying this, and maybe I am...but I want to end my relationship with this friend, but would feel awful about it.

We met in college and have remained friends since, 6 years later...except 2 years ago, she had to move back to her home country so we just remain in contact on Whatsapp now. She's very liberal and understanding, but also can be a bit depressing, and rightfully so because of some life experiences she's been through.

But when I went to her for a advice a week back and asked if I could call her, she said the connection is bad/spotty. Which I don't even believe because she continued to give me advice over text. About a situation that she encouraged me to get into in the first place, and which ended badly for me. I'm a bit angry at her in all honesty for providing that advice, I know it was me at the end of the day that went through with it but she encouraged me. 

Anyway, she's a bit depressing, we only communicate through text, and doubt we'll ever see each other in person ever again. I don't know what the point of this ""relationship"" is, and I want to end it, but don't know how.",23Nov2019,1
497,"My parents are really cheap and pretend we are poor all the time as an excuse to save money. They have decent jobs, and still act poor. 

So I didn’t have a phone till I bought one myself in 8th grade. I had no data and just used WiFi while everyone around me had data and I got kinda jealous. My sister was also jealous and said she wanted to get data, but my parents refused to pay for it. So they told my sister she had to pay for it herself. And it was 60 dollars a month, and my sister was 14, with no job. So yeah, my sister went with it. Not to mention my parents bought the worst and most expensive plan possible, she didn’t get good data and got 2 gb a month. 

So where I am now, my parents announced they are going to switch to cricket and my dad kept complaining about me needing a phone. He said I needed to get a flip phone cheap mobile plan and I refused because it would be embarrassing to carry around a flip phone. 

But the day they were going to get new phone for cricket came and I had no choice but to get a new phone there because my old phone was acting up bad. So now I’m paying 25 dollars a month at 15 with no job.

When I tell my dad that I don’t think it’s fair and data is a need since we go places often and I could get lost he just says “get a job”. I’m not old enough to get a job and he wants me to work at my grandfathers. I don’t want to work at my grandfathers. He’s a car mechanic and I know nothing about that stuff.

So we keep trying to hang out at the movies or go somewhere that we can have a fun time (with TONS of other people around!), but my friend's mom is just fucking insane. I've met her twice, once I went to an R-rated movie with my friend, his parents, and his 10 MONTH OLD LITTLE BROTHER. So right off the start, this lady is pretty sketchy. She didnt shake my hand or return any kind of greeting after I gave her a nice smile and introduced myself. The second time I met her, my sister came with me to pick him up to go to the beach. He used to be friends with my ex boyfriend, but they had a fight and didnt talk anymore after that, including up to this point. She walked outside, made my sister roll down her window, and asked me if I was the guy's ex girlfriend, to which I said yes. She went off on a tangent on how he's such a shitty guy, and I was sitting there awkwardly nodding my head. She also REEKED of alcohol. Now, we've been trying to hang out more lately, especially since we have two classes together so we can help each other out with homework.

Also since he’s never had a dog, he doesn’t understand the responsibility of what comes with having a dog, despite me telling him. I have had a couple of dogs in the past so I do know the responsibilities and that’s one of the reasons I would tell him we are not ready, because I did not want to take on that much responsibility at this point in time.This last time i felt guilty for always saying no, so out of guilt I said he could get one. We’ve barely had her for 2 days but I’m so upset with the decision and how much responsibility was thrown on me out of no where that I’m not even happy being at his apartment anymore.

505,"Hello! I'm new here and decided to make an account because I'm between a rock and a hard place atm.

Just a little background:
Family of 6, not including Dad

My parents got divorced a decade ago and my dad left us the house, completely paid off. Fast forward to 10 months ago, we basically got evicted for not being able to pay the property taxes, which are $20K a year and had to sell our house for $250k (100k less than the actual value). So we bought a 3 bedroom house for $150k and and put $100k aside in case we needed it. Well it turns out we surely did because in 10 months we have spent most of that (a larger chunk was 40k which was for all of the property taxes we never paid and had accumulated throughout the years and other smaller fees but that's besides the point) and we wont have any savings by next year.

I (22M) recently graduated from college in May and started working a few months ago in a job making around 60k a year. I give my mom 500 dollars as rent every month so that she can spend it on groceries and other things. Now this is often times more than 500, the other day I gave my mom my entire check because she has health issues  in her knees and cant wait at the Medicaid office to get insurance, everytime something goes wrong so I just cover her on that end, I am currently trying to put her on my company insurance. Our expenses for everything per month are just shy $2,000.

Now, this is what I am troubled with.
I have 4 other siblings, let's name them A(24M), B (20F), C (18M), D (17M). We all live together with my mom and each person's situation is different.

A: Is on and off in college and makes every excuse in the book not to get a job. Claims he cant get kicked out, which the police reaffirmed us that we cant one night when we had an argument.

B: Works at a grocery store but only pays $80/month, which is her portion of the car insurance policy we have.

C: Is a sophomore in college who actually has a 4.0 so far and wants to be a doctor but claims if he starts working his grades will go down. He works during the summer as a lifeguard and contributed $200/month at the time but that's pretty much it, he stops once college starts over again. All he pays now is the internet bill ($60).

D: Senior in high school, has a lot of credits so he gets to go home at 12pm. He literally does not do anything from 12 to when he sleeps. He sits in the house on his phone and works out, that's it. His excuse is that no one else is helping why should I? And quite frankly thats what all of my siblings say: ""well he isn't working or she isn't paying why should I?""

It just gets frustrating because I cleaned the floors at mcdonalds when I was in high school and kept that going until I graduated and got a real job. I graduated with a 3.934GPA so you would think that'd be a testament to C but none of them feel the need to patch the holes on this sinking ship. In our old house the lights would go off one day and then the electricity, etc. It blows my mind that they dont really care atm but want to cry when we dont have food in the fridge.

I talked to my mom about all of this and I suggested I make them pay rent, 200-250 each. She didnt like the idea because she doesnt want to kick them out on the street. By the way there is no arguing with her, she is not going to kick anyone out on the street (we come from a tight knit culture and community). I'm fine with living at home because I want to save for a house that my fiance and I can live in down the line. But back to the point, my mom shutting down the idea of kicking someone out if they dont pay rent just defeats any hopes of me making this work. So I ask Reddit, how can I start charging my siblings rent without kicking them out?

BTW: Our household monthly income is about $1,200 right now because my mom gets benefits and other things.

TL;DR: Siblings dont want to work, we are going to be evicted again, and soon.",23Nov2019,1
506,"Let me begin by introducing myself, I am a 17 year old male who is in his senior year of high school. I am very ahead academically wise--- I have a 4.29 GPA on a 4.33 scale --- and I don't do anything else on my free time except work and play video games when I get a chance.

There are many things I will address including the treatment I get from my parents, how that has affected me, and what I plan to do to get away from my toxic parents. Let me clarify that I am not suicidal or anything like that, I am just a teen stuck in a toxic household. I am sure there are many stories like this on reddit, but I think my story is a bit different so please take the time to listen.

One of the most significant things that I hate that my parents do is that they never let me hang out with my friends. There is no reason for my parents to assume that my friends are bad or anything like that. They just don't want me to hang out with people because they don't see it as something important in life. For example, Tuesday my best friend is hosting a friendsgiving (Thanksgiving) dinner and my dad won't let me go. My dad will always tell me that when I'm married I won't have time to hang out with my friends, therefore, it doesn't matter now. Stupid mindset, I know. My parents will always say I don't have any common sense, but they lack the common sense to realize that by sheltering me, they made me this way. I am not an outcast at school either, I'm referred to as very funny and outgoing by my peers. People find it odd that I never hang out with people outside of school, but that's about it. I seem relatively normal to them. I could count on one hand all of the times I have hung out with my friends outside of school. That's throughout my whole life. This makes me feel very alone and sometimes depressed.

Another thing my parents do that I hate is that they manipulate me. For example, yesterday I asked if I could go to a basketball game with my bestfriend and my mom told me that there's no reason for her to let me go because I don't care about her. She said this because the day prior I had a NHS induction I had to go to and she had to drive me there (she hates having to take me places) and she told me to tell her if she had to pick me up or if I wqs going to get a ride home/walk home. I knew she hates having to drive me to/from places so I just got a ride from a friend. There was nothing she had to do but get me if she had to, so not getting a text didn't affect her at all. It's not like she would have had to change clothes or anything like that. Anyhow, she used that to try to guilt me into feeling bad for her when in reality I didn't ask for a ride from her because I know she doesn't want to give me a ride. I did what I thought would be the best answer but she had to make it about herself. On the topic of her giving me rides, she got mad at me because she has to give me a ride to a place an hour away to have an interview for my nomination to the military academies (my childhood dream). Most parents would br excited for their child and do it happily, but not mine. 

My parents also don't care about me enough to teach me how to drive. I have gotten my permit twice, and I completed driving school over a year ago. I have been driving once for about an hour months ago when my parents have had my whole life to drive me around including the past summers where my dad did nothing but play playstation. My mom won't take me driving at all, and my dad will eventually (apparently) but he's waiting for my sister to get her license first. This is stupid because I just have to do incar then my driving test. So I walk to work, school, etc. because they hate driving me around and I don't have a license. Also, my grandpa gave me a car which my dad had me detail (including the engine bay) then he turned around and sold the car and pocketed the money for his Vegas trip.

I'll get called a lot of rude and hurtful names by them too. I've been pushed into walls and what not, but nothing too serious. I would say it's more emotional abuse than anything else. I am a strong minded person but after 17 years of dealing with this I'm breaking.

My parents push me to do good in school but never give me any recognition for my academic achievements. I have to shove it down their throats just for them to say, ""nice."" My dad always hates how I'm involved in community organizations where I volunteer because he wants me to do stuff for him not the community. My dad would hate when I would ask to go to football games because he thought they were pointless. He is always right, and will never admit when he is wrong which he kind gave to me. I sometimes act the same to my friends and I hate it. I know I do it and I want to stop but it's hard. My parents expect so much from me but don't want to help me at all. 

I cannot spend ANY of the money I made too because they said so. I can only spend it on things I need that they don't want to spend it on like college applications and sending my test scores, transcripts, etc. They want to control my life in every detail. 

I want to go to a college an hour away and live on campus so I don't have to live with them anymore. During the summer between the school years I would live with my best friend at his parent's house because I don't know if I ever want to live here again. After college and medical school I want to join the military to make sure I'm far away from my family. That's a big reason I want to join one of the military academies too, I get to be far away from my family for good.

This is hard, but I know I can make it through this terrible time. My parents have the mentality that parents shouldn't be friends with their kids, more like dictators. My dad has referred himself to a dictator a lot. But at the same time they want me to be transparent with them, well I'm not going to be transparent with a dictator like I would be with a friend.

With people who won’t accept “no” as an answer, it keeps escalating to the point where I get upset and tell them to stop, and then they get offended and upset and still keep trying to push me to do something and I keep telling them no... What should I be doing? I know getting upset is the wrong answer, I just don’t know how to get that message across more.",23Nov2019,1
519,"30ish year old lady who went from drinks-heavy graduate school to the occasional glass of wine. 

I’ve had a couple “big nights out” in the last few years, usually celebrations/house parties or an impromptu post-work thing, and I’ve regretted all of them. Just on a personal level, where I like the concept of cutting loose but it’s not cute anymore. And I’m very hard on myself the morning after. 

Last night was drinks with work pals where a few turned into too many, and I realized that I need to accept responsibility when I’m drinking and be more mindful of my choices. I was having a good time, and ordering another turned into a reflex to keep the night going—a leftover habit from my grad school days. Which is a problem, since I’ve for SURE lost my tolerance and I don’t drink often enough to know where my new limit is.

I’ve told myself a few times now that it’s 2 glasses and then go home, which works great most of the time but obviously cuts an evening short. How do you manage your drinks when you don’t mind getting a little tipsy, but you’re looking to build a better approach? Is there anything you do, other than “x number of glasses then switch to water”?",23Nov2019,1

523,"I recently got a job at a famous mex fast food chain (can't name it as they track online posts) and it was all going great until this week.


Training went well and I seemed to be doing equally as well as my new colleagues and they seemed to be impressed with my food prep. I also was able to win two timed competitions for preparing the food fastest on two different teams.


However, this week as we were training for opening with orders, I was assigned with three other colleagues in my training group to be right at the back frying and cooking ingredients while everyone else got turns on 'the line'. 


I was stuck on the fryer for five hours and got one 10 min break (illegal in my country as over 5hrs gets 30 min also) whilst everyone up the front got a break and to eat the food that was prepared.


The next day one of the line members had to leave so the international representative and a trainee manager suggested that one of us take over (we had all been trained in that spot) to which my manager sort of laughed and shook her head and said she'd take the position which obv hurt us.


So that afternoon after being stuck for four hours on the fryer I felt upset and emotional (unusual for me) and had to go outside to which a manager followed and offered to 'console' me.
After voicing my concerns she basically said, ""during training we noticed you were talking and not listening and you in particular were distracted"" [so basically this is your punishment in other words]. This was not true, we talked as we were bonding and having fun but still managed to obtain all the information and complete our tasks. Also, I might have seemed distracted but I had a final assessment and major exam for law and on top of that, wild fires in my town which risked burning my family home down and my uncle's road was cut meaning he couldn't get out. All of this was weighing on my mind and I was finding it difficult to balance work/school and general stress.


I also had written down and revised everything that was taught and the ingredients on top of studying for my exam and keeping in touch with my family.


Anyway, one of the girls I worked with and is much younger, who is a bit of a delinquent and moved out of home at 16 after fighting with her parents and just walked out of school never to return, kept hanging around me and doing things like insinuating guys liked me if they were kind enough to help me bc they could see I wasn't coping out of boredom and frustration. She also asked them personal questions in an attempt to set me up which is inappropriate and embarrassing.


She also kept saying things like, ""I don't care if I get fired/this is the only place we'll ever be as the managers dont like us/ we won't get many shifts after opening as we aren't valued team members/ the other team members can tell we are put here as a punishment and look down on us""


Whilst all of this may be true, it made me feel stigmatised and upset having to hear it constantly as much as I tried to block it out. She also asked me to help her take bins out and being naive I assumed she had told the managers (she hadn't) so I got into trouble upon returning.


After my shift I got called out to speak to the owner who accused me of [since the managers had failed to label who did what] things I didn't do as well as talking too much with said girl (who kept coming and talking to me) and basically not doing my job properly and was offically warned. I didn't at the time want to mention the girls actions as I didn't know how it would reflect back on me and whether she'd be reprimanded and find out it was me. But her negativity was partly to blame for my work ethic.


However, the owner was pretty surprised that I had been put on one station all day and admitted that it would have been boring and said he'd speak to the managers.he told me to stay positive and to keep memorizing the recipes and to pretend practice making them. I'm scared about when he leaves to open his other store though.


Throughout that time, the managers had been short and nasty to me and if I needed assistance or to be shown something they acted as if it was the biggest imposition in the world and that I was stupid. 


I tried my best to keep up with orders but having a broken spirit, feeling stigmatized and being bored af didn't do much for my attitude or performance as much as I tried my best to stay positive. You could also definitely see a difference in demeanour between the workers up front and us up the back who shared the same attitude and pain.



To top it off, I received my roster which was obviously done in a discriminatory manner as I received a grand total of **3 hours** over 3 days with two RDOs prior when everyone else had at least 6 hours over two days which made them question me as to why I got so little and made me sink into a pit of shame and try to come up with excuses.



My colleagues talked about getting time on the line today and yesterday and that because of my shift length I will just be on fry or cooking ingredients which crushed me and made me cry most of the afternoon (I also have depression and it's taking a toll on my mental health)


Anyway, I'm thinking of confronting a manager today and telling them about the situation with the girl and how it affected my work ethic and also why I was 'distracted' during training. I'm so scared though as they are already against me.


I also found out that in legislation, in a workplace Act that it is considered discrimination to single an employee out and deny them the same training opportunities and shift opportunities as everyone else (which has been done as I have minimal experience on the line and haven't been allowed to learn). I don't know whether to bring that up or wait a little while to see if things improve then contact the appropriate authority.



What should I do? Is it as unfair and discriminatory as I believe? I've been too ashamed to tell friends and family as last week I was loving the job and still want to be but hate them mentioning it.
I am dreading going to work and feel ashamed and have begun drinking at night to distract myself and numb the feelings and I'm scared of becoming an alcoholic.",23Nov2019,1

Hi XX,

Umm I'm really sorry this is basically really out of nowhere and is essentially unwarranted, but basically I'm writing this because I want to tell you some stuff which I personally find really awkward saying in person. Before I continue I apologise if my writing is cringy/awkward/too rambly/too long; the closest thing I have ever written to this sort of thing is a letter from Mary Tan to her uncle about what she wants for her birthday for essay writing during an exam.

I'm writing this because I wanted to clarify some stuff and also have closure for myself. You don't have to reply or anything; my only request is that you read the whole message and not let anyone else see it (I guess that makes it two).

(actual content)

I don't know if you remember since it's kind of long ago, but do you recall telling me about giving off the ""wrong idea""?

Perhaps it is presumptuous (for lack of a better word) of me to assume what I think it means, but bluntly speaking if the ""idea"" refers to me like-liking you it is technically right and wrong at the same time; ""right"" because it's legit and ""wrong"" because I was trying to not come off that way. Basically, I wanted to show that I liked you, but not show the full extent of it.

I don't know if this is too long ago for it to be acceptable for me to bring up again, but I want to apologise again for teasing you on (insert date) and I really mean it. The reason I did it was because I thought it would be a great (obviously great) way to make it seem that I liked you only as a friend to hide the fact that I actually liked you in ""that"" way, which I know does not justify my actions at all in any way. It was cowardly of me to go about doing things like that when I could have just done it more directly. 

I figured I would do this because of two reasons: because of the (major exam next year) and because I feel that I am currently too immature for that sort of relationship due to me being terrible at managing my emotions, being socially inept and being street-not-smart in general. And also I know it sounds stupid but I'm still trying to figure out how to make friendships work out well.

(I would have written a transition sentence/paragraph here but I really don't know what to write so I guess I'll just write this ah) 

What I admire about you is that you're able to connect with different types of people, something which I have been struggling with for pretty much forever. Maybe it's your humour, or the way you make others feel more at ease, or something I can't quite pinpoint, but somehow there's something about you that brings energy to regular mundane things that happen on a daily basis like conversations and stuff, which I find quite refreshing and I'm sure many others feel that way as well. I wish I could be more specific but I'm really not quite sure how to explain this properly.

I also admire that you are able to adapt and handle situations and keep your composure when bad stuff happens. I don't know if it's trivial to you, but I saw the way you tried to comfort (classmate) when the promo results were released and I really respect that you made the effort to do so even though you were going through the same thing yourself (for context, both the recipient and the classmate had done badly and were freaking out). I know I've mentioned this before, but I'm honestly grateful for your support during the (important presentation which was graded. For context, I had a panic attack and broke down when I made a really bad mistake during the presentation). Even though I couldn't really process what anyone was saying when I was panicking, I still felt comforted by the fact that you and everyone were there throughout the whole thing. 

Also I know it's kind of random but I really enjoyed your performance on (occasion).

I think that you're fundamentally a good person, and that the people around you are fortunate to have your support. I genuinely hope that everything turns out well for you in the future.

If you're still reading: Thanks, I really appreciate it. 

Take care,

537,"Two months ago one of my best friends (lets call her Emma) who used to go to my school, moved to a different one across the city. On the first week she told me about one of her new classmates who I’ll call Jane. The two became close pretty fast. According to Emma, Jane is very kind and smart but also pretty quiet and very thin. She also said that her and I have the same interests (music, astrology, poetry) so I decided to send Jane a friend request on Facebook and thats how we started talking. With time I learned some things about Jane (which she’s told either me or Emma) such as:
-she only eats dinner
-she exercises everyday for at least 2 hours and her exercises include things like 100 planks on one go, 100 crunches, running around the neighbourhood for an extended period of time etc
-has hair falling out
-barely sleeps and usually gets up at 4:30 to write poetry
Some things Emma told me she’s noticed: 
-for the two months they’ve known each other, she’s never seen Jane eat a single thing
-Jane saying that she’s fat and needs to exercise more (especially on her thighs)
-she’s also very sensitive and emotional and can cry over anything, gets easily offended 
-has no energy at school
-has a lot of mood swings
-as I mentioned, is scarily thin to the point when you can see the bones on her wrist sticking out

But here’s the scariest part: Emma told me that Jane has said the following (when confronted about being so skinny): ‘I know I’m anorexic, I’ve been like this for a year now’. So she KNOWS she has a problem but doesn’t do anything about it.
All of this breaks my heart. Jane is an amazing person who is very intelligent and has a lot to offer. She’s shown me some of her poems and they’re truly incredible. She’s very nice to me and I really want to help her. One time I think Emma convinced her to eat lunch after school, but how can we know that she isn’t lying? Jane and I have never met in real life, so all I can do is text her to make sure she’s okay and remind her to eat from time to time but I don’t think it has an effect. Another detail is that Jane has a pretty bad relationship with her parents, especially with her mother. And according to her they know that she barely eats but don’t say anything. 

How can me and Emma help her? Emma said that she might go to the school psychologist for advice and I thought that’s a good idea. Jane’s parents are careless and I don’t think we can get her in a recovery programme (after all we don’t know for sure that shes anorexic but I think it’s safe to say that). 
This whole situation frustrates me more than anything because I can’t do anything about it. I avoid talking to Jane about her problem because I don’t wanna say anything wrong and drive her to starve herself even more but that isn’t doing anything to help her. Please give me some advice, I’m desperate.",23Nov2019,1
538,"I was flying home for Thanksgiving, and when I landed, I found out my dad had been caught drinking and driving. We were both on our way to the house where were going to spend Thanksgiving, then I heard I needed to go get him from jail. I was blindsided, nervous, and most of all, furious. This wasn't all that shocking, knowing how my dad treats alcohol.

Now I don't know what to do. He's acting like it's no big deal, but this is a major incident in a long line of alcohol-related embarrassments for him. I feel like staying with him for Thanksgiving is going to make him feel like he is facing no consequences, but it's hard to tell him that, especially when my other option is to spend the holiday with my mom (his divorced wife). That would piss him off, but part of me thinks that's what he needs. He has to understand that his relationship with alcohol is very unhealthy, and too many people have let him off the hook in his lifetime. 

Not spending Thanksgiving with his sons would be a pretty big deal for him, but I don't know how to spin that into something constructive instead of just enforcing a penalty. Would rehab even matter for a septagenarian? What can we do with/for him? His license is suspended and I don't live at home with him, so what about that?

539,"Let me clarify this is not a legal advice issue. I don’t believe I could report this, let alone prove it. I’m changing their names. This is also a throwaway. 

You should know that the best friend, lets call him John, was once gang raped by other men. However, he has tried to get me to have sex with him before thinking that it would ‘fix’ his trauma. I have always said no. The last time he said this was the last time I saw him before Sunday, well over a year ago. He attempted to call me a slut and a whore afterwards. My boyfriend told him to fuck off and I was too worried about jeopardizing the friendship to tell my boyfriend this. 

I’m not sure how I feel right now. Last Sunday I got very, very drunk around my boyfriend (just turned 21) and his friend (the friend and I are both 19). I also haven’t drank in four years, so I’m as much of a lightweight as they come. I’m someone who has problems with moderation. I also have a problem with bulimia: I had been doing well but panicked and hadn’t eaten that day. I went from completely sober to unable to recognize where I was, and who I was, in 20 minutes. 

My boyfriend had cut me off from alcohol so I wouldn’t reach that point. John laughed it off and shoved another cup of jack daniels and bambuu in my hands (around eight ounces) and i started chugging it so my boyfriend couldn’t take it. I pretty quickly fell onto my boyfriend and was just sort of lying on him. I did try to get him to have sex with me and he wouldn’t because I was drunk—and he’s very serious about that, considering my trauma history. there’s no concern he did anything. I did take my top and my bra off and was making out with him. John was on the other side of me. 

John had already attempted to get me to have sex with him. I said no. Then he tried to get my boyfriend to to pressure me and my boyfriend said no. I even said I was only interested in my boyfriend, under any circumstances. 

John is the least drunk of us- most body mass by far too. I don’t think at this point you could call him more than buzzed. He started grabbing my ass and I told him to stop that, I know my boyfriend told him to stop too. 

At this point I was fading in and out of being awake and I couldn’t hold my head up, hence me lying down. My boyfriend started getting to that point soon after. 

John kept massaging and hitting it and I was too inebriated to say anything. I would try and couldn’t speak. I know he pulled my pants and my underwear off. I could feel his hand around my vagina and I was actively trying to make myself sleep so I didn’t have to know. I don’t know when my boyfriend saw (he did at some point: John stopped), or for how long or to what extent. I don’t know if there was penetration or not. I just felt really scared.  When my boyfriend realized and started yelling at him, he got up, laughed, and said “she’s all yours”. 

After he left I think the state I was in fully hit my boyfriend and he started taking care of me and watching out for alcohol poisoning. I was really fucked up and didn’t say anything because I felt scared.",23Nov2019,1

She blew up our family Christmas last year, taking offense where there wasn't any after taking nasty verbal jabs at me (example -she's older than me and said, as we're opening Christmas gifts with my husband, our two adult sons, daughter-in-law (DIL) and future DIL - ""you list your virginity before I did"" - no context, no truth, just trying to embarrass and cut me down). She then got pissed when she gave my DIL a green purse as a gift, asked 3 times if she liked it, and finally future DIL said ""it's pretty but I much prefer blue"" (typical behavior from my sister - ""agree with me even if I'm wrong or you're being disloyal""). Sister stormed out of my house, slammed the door, and left. She came back 20 minutes later to get her gifts and throw more barbs as she stood by the back door ready to leave again as she threw more insults. DIL said ""I think you're done, leave now"". Future DIL was ready to let her have it, defending me and just done with the last year of piled up emotional junk from my sister. I asked her to not unload, don't give sister the satisfaction and ammo that she'll use forever. Sister has since given a litany of excuses for last Christmas' behavior but no change, no responsibility taken. Future DIL says sister is not invited to their upcoming wedding (she has my full support on that - it's their day and to avoid the drama is her option) and that she's not coming to Thanksgiving or Christmas if sister is here. I understand but also am loathe to cut my sister out. I'm her only living immediate family member. I have so far just avoided any communication about Thanksgiving (I'm hosting) but anticipate sister will ask about it soon. Advice please!

This is where it gets tricky: I strongly suspect that the reason the rumour has been started is to deflect from John’s crush on Janet. What I mean by this is that he mentions Janet’s name all of the time, and goes out of his way to bring Janet into meetings, even if she doesn’t strictly need to be there. John makes jokes every time I interact with Janet, and I am worried other colleagues will join in. John has a girlfriend but from what I gather, the relationship is not going too well.

So, how to manage this one? John is due to leave the company soon, but I don’t want to leave Janet feeling awkward (and believing that I do have a crush on her) as I may need an ally in future. I was thinking to schedule a meeting to clear things up with Janet before it gets out of hand, or perhaps waiting for it to blow over.

552,"I am currently a junior in high school i think i’ve been doing everything right so far, I have a 3.8 gpa, i've taken hard classes. i've taken dual credit classes and i'm planning more next year. The problem is i don't know what i want to do for a job. It would be really nice to know now so i can find a college that is good in that field and start interning or something in that field. I want a job that i get paid pretty well, like $80,000+  (not right out of college i mean after working at my job awhile i want to start making that). I don't want to work super long hours like a lawyer. I would like to have some creativity/ flexibility in my job, like a teacher can decided what they teach and how they teach. I would rather not go to college for a crazy long time but if need be i will. And lastly i’d prefer a job where i'm not sitting on my butt all the time but on the flip side not a job that i'm always on my feet. I like learning, accomplishing things, and working hard on projects.

553,"So, when I was about 2 years old, I was molested by my babysitter. He forced me to put his... you know... in my mouth. I was too young to really remember it well, but my sister was there and she remembers everything. 

Even though I don’t remember well, it still impacts me a lot emotionally. Scenes in movies/ tv shows that have to do with that makes me excessively uncomfortable and very upset. 

Now, I have no problem *doing* it when I’m emotionally ok and comfortable with it, but when my boyfriend *asks* me to do things that have to do w his dick and my mouth, it hits me out of left field and causes me to shut down. I wish it didn’t because all I want to do is make him happy, but usually when he asks I have to stop everything all together and it makes me feel terrible. 

Unfortunately, my bf is a bit.... emotionally disconnected. He claims I’m the first person who’s ever made him actually feel emotions. He’s also a bit of a pathological liar, so I’m not really sure what to think when he says things like that. But usually when I talk to him about really emotional problems from my past, his response is something along the lines of “that sucks :/“. 

We’ve been together for a few months over a year now, and I want to tell him about this so he stops asking and understands my reaction instead of getting frustrated (never directed at me, just in general), but I don’t think I could handle another “that sucks :/“ 

What do I do?",23Nov2019,1

564,"I was at an event today (I’m 28M). Went there with a friend of mine. While we were there, I saw this cute girl all by herself. My friend is a woman and I didn’t want to approach girls while we were together.

So I was like “as soon as my friend goes away, I’ll approach her”. After a while, my friend wants to go home. She asks me if I want to go with her, and I tell her “I’ll stay here for a little while and then go home”.

So off she goes. Now it’s just me and the cute girl.

I standup from the table we were sitting and go looking for her. I find her after a few minutes. While I’m going in her direction, another guy starts talking to her. I’m like “well, maybe he’s just asking something and then go away”. But no, they keep staying together. I stay there for like half an hour and they’re still together.

At that point I just go home, thinking “did I really blew my chance for a matter of seconds?”.

Mind you, I wasn’t close enough to listen what they were saying. Maybe they knew each other or something. Hard to say. I didn’t see them shaking hands or anything, which seemed weird because you would’ve expect they should introduce each other.

So yeah, I was looking forward to get to know her and maybe invite her for a drink or to eat something (broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years a few months ago, so I was happy to approach someone for once). And here I’m instead, going back home alone in the freezing cold.

567,"My life is going great, have a master's degree in computer science, a great job, a lot of great friends. I have problems keeping a long-term partner, which heavily affects my mood at the moment but that's not the focus of this post.

Objectively I should feel pretty good about myself, but I feel somehow very unsatisfied. In fact, I am only ever satisfied when I am with friends, or when I feel like I am doing something productive.

I always wanted to be among the best at something, and I'm just not. I am average or above average at whatever I do, but never exceptional. As a kid I was exceptional at some stuff and awful at others, which probably is why I feel that way nowadays.

Since I had no savings by the end of my studies, I decided to take a job immediately; I told myself I would change in two years. That time is coming up in 6 month and I don't know what I want to do.

What I \*don't\* want to do is stay an average man all my life.

What should I do to stop this? Some options I considered are:

 \* I want to try studying again in another field. But I fear that if I tried again and got the same grades (which is not enough to get into research) I would be extremely disappointed. Plus I'm 25 and I'm getting old for this.

I feel like my dream job was to be a scientist/researcher, and I didn't succeed university well enough to do that.

 \* I could just try to accept myself as ""average"" but I feel like that's just shitty and kind of giving up on life.

I'm also afraid that even if I did get what I want, I'd still feel unsatisfied.

568," Hey everyone. I'm sorry this post is super long and rambly, but I'm quite frustrated with my situation. I've tried talking to people I know about this issue, and while they sympathize, they don't offer real help. They just say ""stay positive"" or ""keep applying to more jobs"" and so on. I also don't want to burden them, so I've stopped complaining to them. Instead, I have made the decision to complain on the internet. HA! Anyway, I'll start at the very beginning of this \~journey\~.

When I was in middle school, I volunteered at a camp. I wasn't of legal working age, but I enjoyed interacting with campers and hoped to get a job there when I became old enough. The summer before I turned 16, I approached the camp director and asked if I could get a job next summer. They said no, they already had people in mind. I was a bit annoyed at the time because people always say connections are key to getting a job. Yet here I was, familiar with the camp for years and acquainted with the people who run it, and they rejected me. Then again, I suppose they found someone older, which is understandable. Plus, this was my very first job-seeking experience, and so I thought things would get better from there. I wasn't *too* worried at this point.

Let's fast forward to next summer when I was 16. In March, April, and May, I applied to many jobs. I don't remember every single one, but I'll go over the ones I did get an interview for: three camps, a farm, a cafe, a library.

**Camp 1**: My very first interview experience. Fun fact, I was actually sick that day, so in addition to my anxiety, I kept sniffling throughout the interview. I also didn't prepare very well because I didn't know what the interview would be like. Some questions were hard.

**Camp 2**: This interview went better, as I was more prepared and not sick. But alas, I was ultimately told, ""You don't have enough experience."" Well, of course I have little experience. That's why I was there: to get that experience! Don't worry, I'd be hearing this dreadful phrase many times again, so I wasn't that annoyed yet.

**Camp 3**: This was a group interview, and it went pretty badly because the other people there made me anxious and my responses were just shit. Toward the end, I remember the interviewer asking everyone's availability except mine, which really cemented how much I'd failed the interview.

**Farm**: Ah, this was an \~interesting\~ experience, let’s just put it that way. I approached the manager myself and asked if they had any job openings. They told me to come back in a month or so. In a month or so, I got the same response. By the time I came there for the third time, it was autumn. This time, I got an interview. Once again: a group interview. I think I did okay, but I was never contacted again. I was annoyed having to come there three times before even getting an interview, and then, of course, not being hired. I should have gotten the job for my persistence alone!

**Cafe**: This interview went pretty well, but in the end, I was told I just didn't have enough experience. They essentially said, ""We think your responses and personality are great, but you don't have any experience in a cafe setting."" Of course not, that's why I came there! To get a job that will provide me with experience! At this point, I was starting to get quite annoyed and defeated by this whole job-search thing.

**Library**: This library was somewhere I'd volunteered at, so I thought my chances were better because I was already acquainted with the place and some staff members knew me. I think I may have gone in too confident and didn't perform well, so I can't really blame the interviewers.

In addition to the failed interviews, I applied to tons of jobs online and got three interview requests. I didn't end up coming to the interviews because...well, my luck is just shitty. It won't make much sense unless you read it all.

**Grocery Store**: I didn't call back the day they did asking to set up an interview because I was busy. I tried calling the next day, was told the hiring manager wasn't in and to call back the next day. Did that, got the same response. They now said the manager would be in next week. I called next week, never got a response. So annoying. I was busy that *one* day and because of that, I never got to speak to that manager. WTF?

**Jewelry Store**: After having someone call me about setting up an interview, I began having some health issues and thought it'd be best not to take on the job. Needless to say, I never went in for an interview. Once again, my luck was just awful. My health had been fine the whole year, and as soon as I wanted to get a job, I became sick? Once again, WTF? 

**Another Grocery Store**: I filled out my application in March, and they never contacted me until guess when...August! That's when an opening appeared. And fittingly, I was on vacation out of the country then. My trip was about two weeks long, and I wasn't able to call them back because the phone number I provided them with was a home phone and I couldn't check voicemail until I returned. Just imagine that: I put in an application in March. They never called for months. I assumed they'd forgotten about my application completely. And the two weeks of the entire year I was out of the country, they suddenly had an opening! It was so frustrating. I was so close to getting an interview, but of course, life just didn't want that for me. 

The three experiences above made me think that the universe is against me getting a job. I know it's irrational for me to think that, but getting three interview requests and not being able to go to any of them because of the weird circumstances described above is truly a WTF moment.

This past summer, I applied to a fast food place and got an interview as summer was ending. It was very short and simple, and they thought I'd be a good fit. However, they needed someone full-time and since I was still in high school, it'd be impossible for me to work 40 hours.

And here we are now. I've been in school since September. I haven't applied to any places because I was doing college application stuff, but now things have become calmer and I'm finally ready to search again. I got my resume fixed because it hadn't been updated in a while and some of it wasn't very good. However, I’m sure that I’m about to go through the same exact things: (1) applying to a bunch of online positions that never contact me, (2) having some weird situation where I almost get an interview but something prevents me from attending it, (3) actually getting an interview and being told, ""You don't have eNoUgH eXpEriEncE,"" or (4) just being really bad at answering the interview questions. I just don't see how else things will go. I've had so many bad experiences applying to minimum-wage positions. The more time that goes by, the more I hear peers getting jobs. Yet here I am, trying so hard to get just one place to hire me, and it never happens. When I go to college, I'm sure the same thing will happen. 

I have done volunteering, but I guess that's not compelling enough to the people looking over my resume. Sadly, there's nothing else I can put on my resume because no one wants to hire me so I *can* have that initial experience. I'm also sick of hearing my parents criticize me for not being able to get a crappy job, calling me stupid and lazy and the like. At this point, I just feel lost. I don't care what job I’d do...at all. I just want to get *some* minimum-wage job so I can start gaining that ""experience"" and then hopefully get a better position. But given what's happened so far, I don't see that happening. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. If other people my age are getting jobs, clearly I can too, right? Except I haven’t. What am I missing that everyone my age has? Not to be cocky, but I don’t consider myself an idiot. I don’t think I’m smart by any means, but so many people that seem truly unremarkable and average do get jobs. Does that make me worse than them?

If you got this far, I’m pretty shocked. I doubt anyone would care enough to read my rant until the end, so thank you so much if you did. If nothing else, at least this vent has helped me to get my feelings out. If you do end up taking the time to reply and offer some advice, I am so grateful to you that it’s hard to put into words. Truly. Thanks so much for putting up with my shit. You’re a real one :)",23Nov2019,1
569,"My whole life, I have been surrounded by people who have a lot of passion for their work. They center their whole lives around creating a world where their passion and their work are the same. People I know who don't have a passion are obsessed with figuring out what it is. I have considered myself in this category for many years. If you tell people you don't have a passion, everyone tells you to keep trying until you find it and never give up.

I've had the opportunity to try a lot of different jobs and pursue various interests now, and I'm not sure there is anything that I am passionate about in the way that other people seem to be. I have hobbies and things I enjoy, but I don't think I've ever felt a true calling to anything. I encounter countless examples in television/etc of people insisting that everyone has a purpose and you owe it to yourself to find it, and something about it just... doesn't ring true? Sometimes I wonder if modern media has ruined us all by convincing us we're the stars of our own movie.

Am I sabotaging myself by pursuing a life where my job is just a job that is tolerable and allows me to survive so I can spend my free time how I want? My parents often tell me that survival jobs should just be a stepping stone while I devote my free time to furthering my ""passions"" so I can turn those into a career, even if it takes years. Honestly though, whenever I try to turn an interest into a source of income, I just end up burning out and killing my desire to do it at all.

571,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me.

576,"I have a live-in landlord and his wife also lives with us. I know they have an open relationship (I became aware of this about a month ago) and I am not really bothered because it didn’t really affect me until recently. Last week, he made a comment that he found me attractive which I just dismissed as him being a bit over friendly. 

On Wednesday this week, his wife was away and he started being overly flirty, making inappropriate comments to me and then it escalated to him being insistent that I take my clothes off/show him various parts/let him touch me and then he started saying ‘you should run away from here because I’m a dangerous man and I find you very attractive and I don’t know what I could do to you’. I also found out he had been putting shots of vodka in my drink even though I had asked him not to because it always made me too drunk. I excused myself to bed (he tried to pressure me and emotionally manipulate me to let him join me but I kept saying no!) and he said he was also going to bed but then at about 4am came into my room. I woke up and asked what he was doing and he was trying to have a conversation with me but not leaving every time I made it clear he needed to leave. 

I haven’t been back since and have been sofa surfing. One of my friends told me to inform his wife and I did this evening via phone to be met with a giggly response of ‘oh, sometimes he does this to people but don’t worry, it’s all talk’. She has obviously spoke to him and he is trying to call me to ‘apologise’ but I don’t feel safe or comfortable returning there.

My stuff is still there and there’s no way I’m going in there with a psychopath and psychopath-enabler. I don’t have any evidence for the police so there’s no point reporting it as it would be a huge headache. I am currently living on the sofa of various friends.

Anyways, I would really appreciate it if anyone give me some advice on this situation. I've tried to tell her, but I  don't think she listens to me considering the fact that I constantly keep getting reminded.",23Nov2019,1
580,"Hello all, going to be a long post but hoping for some guidance. 

I moved to Washington DC in September for a job I now love in a city where I know no one. Because the turnaround was so quick moving cross country, I found housing on facebook that was furnished and in a good location, temporarily, until the end of this year, 2019. Now, as I look for alternate housing and finding my community, I'm still looking for something more on the temporary side to save a little money, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see another posting from a cute girl, let's call her Jessica, on facebook for a **month-to-month** ***furnished lease*** which is huge for me. It's also significantly cheaper than my current rent. Commute is a little longer, but for the price it's prob worth it in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look at Jessica's post and profile and she seems chill, into similar things and social, compared to my current roommate whoo just sits in his room and plays League of Legends. We'd prob get along and honestly would consider seeing her, though that adds a whole other layer lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I notice Jessica is friends on facebook with my ex-girlfriend and her friends as they're from the same city. Does this present an obstacle? Will this be weird? How should I approach the situation? What would y'all do? Has anyone ever lived with the opposite gender? 

&amp;#x200B;

My ex and I have a weird relationship (as one does) where we're not on bad terms or good terms, just kinda ""meh"" terms. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I found a good spot to move to after my apartment lease ends but the girl is friends with my ex-girlfriend and thus may complicate things.   


Thanks for the help!",23Nov2019,1
581,"My little brother is distant and antisocial toward me and our dad. We all still live at home.

My brother never wants to spend time with us. He always seems to avoid us and give us the cold shoulder. Whenever he is with us, he hardly speaks.

My brother and I used to be close when we were younger, but he has gradually become more distant towards me through the years. I remember he used to always want to be around me, we would play video games together, and just have fun. Now it seems he hardly ever wants to be around me.

My brother growing up didn't really have any friends and didn't go out much. Me, our sister, our parents, and a couple of cousins were all he had.

My brother recently opened up and said that he has struggled with Social Anxiety all of his life and it is the reason for his lack of friendships and going out. He has been speaking to a therapist, he has been working at his first job for three months now, he is working on getting his driver's license, etc. It seems he is trying to get his life together, which I am proud of, but he is still distant.

It seems as though he is particularly uncomfortable around me and our Dad. He spends a lot of time with our mom and sister. He speaks to them frequently and is always around them. I wish he was that way towards me and our father.

I will admit my brother is different from me and our father. My brother is more sensitive/effeminate, whereas me and our father are more macho. We love sports; he hates sports. We are into traditionally manly things and he is not. Our personalities are different and we don't have a lot of commonalities.

I would love for our brother to spend more time with us and be with the men you know.

584," Hello Reddit, today is a sad day for me and it wasn't too long ago that i felt the same for wasting things , 


2 months ago if not a month ago i had a really bad day at work, and so this stranger girl out of nowhere, who i never seen her before i have no idea who she is,  she came up to me and said that she is Alone and going to a bar to have drink and she asked if i could join her , the words just ran out of mouth saying: im tired and just got off work and going home, she said it was ok and she walked away and that was that

But in my head i was thinking about it while talking to her , i was like god sent her to me she had absolutely no idea who i was or what i was doing at work , its like she knows what i've been through, and she's just there to take away all of that shit that was on my shoulder

after i got in my car and thought about it more i couldn't believe how i said no to her , like i didn't really mean it nor i was thinking straight! 

i went home real angry and disappointed in me , but there's not much i can do about it , what hurts the most is the time and the coincidence that happened, its like she knows but she didn't, i wasn't really mad about getting laid or having a drink with a girl , because i got a lot of female friends and sex isn't hard to get at least for me , but the idea of having a bad day and a total stranger comes up to you and want to cheer you up thats like

and so i couldn't forgive myself for it , and today i saw this beautiful girl , i was too nervous to ask for her number so i asked her friend to get it for me , the best thing in the world is when i got that has that paper and her name and number on it , its like winning the Olympics, i put it in my pocket and  got busy and busy and by the end of the day i lost that paper, i didn't save the number nor take a pic of that paper 

and here i am with in just 2 months in between i experienced the most painful feeling i could ever feel , losing the most important, wasting the best moments instead of living it and so on 

the sadness last for long its not one of those ""oh i missed it"" and by the next hour or day you moved on, i get angry with myself for days , disappointed, sad , broken, lost , confused, 

i need your advice, how to punish myself for it? because those are in my opinion once in a lifetime.",23Nov2019,1

586,"This month I realized how I'm having issues with masculinity. Since middle school I always hung out with girls. Since I joined Twitter back in 2017 I saw so many tweets of ""Men ain't shit"" and ""men this"" kind of bs. That's when I took notice of the sort of this battle of the sexes thing or idk and didn't leave Twitter till last spring. 


I always had hung out with girls in high school who said this type of thing and the whole ""you are the good ones""  labeled me. And being openly gay sort of attracted those types of girls to me. My parents don't help with this because they say ""you aren't a real man this and that"" growing up. 

I could go on about how things formed me to where I am now but basically. 

I want to make friends with guys. I don't want a boyfriend but I need friends that are guys. I was recently invited by some guys to hang out and it was so much fun.

587,"i (16 female) feel as though i am wasting my life. 

i go to therapy which helps a bit but not a whole lot. i have friends but i would consider them 'lunchbox friends' in that only 2 out of the 8 message me outside school about things other then school and work. i feel like i am annoying when i try to talk to them and like i'm not worth talking to.

whenever i think about my future (moving out, getting a job etc) i become extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. the anxiety becomes too much and i just think that killing myself will get rid of the anxiety. it doesn't help the fact that at school we're doing work experience and i have no idea what work experience to do as i want to be self-employed and i already have a plan but when i tell teachers, they say i should think more of myself. (my plan is to work in a shop and do my own business on the side and then quit my job when i can afford to do my business full time). my teachers think that working in a shop 'isn't credible' which is ridiculous. 

one good thing that i have noticed is that people are talking to me and approaching me more now that i have stopped making 'edgy' jokes (think Ricky Gervias style) so yeh but it's hard because 'edgy' jokes are part of my identity and now i have to cut that out.

588,"Backstory - I’m 36m and about 6 months ago a new girl started working for the same company as me. We often get given the same shift and while we get along well I have no feelings at all aside from friendship.  We’re friends but more work friends than proper friends. We have zero in common.


Anyway, more recently she’s been dropping major hints that she’s into me despite me showing no interest at all. I’m talking stuff like she keeps trying to get me to ask her out for a meal, or making a lot of physical contact, deliberate attempts to sit next to me during quiet periods. 


And then when I mentioned I was spending Christmas alone she almost angrily declared that I wasn’t and that I had to go to her place to spend Christmas Day. I obviously declined but now she’s insisting that she’s going to make me Christmas dinner and drive to my place to drop it off. She insists that it’s no trouble at all etc and that she’ll come to mine on Christmas Day and that we can just ‘chat and have a cup of tea and have some banter etc’

590,"Firstly, I’ve been working in a pharmacy for 6 years as a pharmaceutical technician. Recently I  transitioned to a pharmacy with a low income population meaning higher non-communicable disease. This past week had been the hardest for me, as patients confided to me and cried to me about what they’re going through. 

From patients getting diagnosed with cancer, to paralysis and to suicide. It’s all very tough hearing this and it is common but this week really him me hard and I feel so alone. I cry in my car because of the struggle I see and the amount of medications they’re on. 

I love my job very much, and majority of my life has revolved around it even while being a student. When I graduate I do want to get into very sensitive fields such as eating disorders and oncology. I’m usually pretty well-kept and strong about these cases. But this week has been the toughest for me. Having people open up to me is pure vulnerability and I do my best to make them feel better. Majority of my patients today have opened up to me about what’s going on in their lives, I kept it 100% professional, actively listened to them and treated them with compassion.

592,"Soo, I'll try to be as brief as possible. Not asking for medical advice as it may seem at first, just have to describe my situation.  

After getting something which I assumed was some weird flu more than 3 years ago (in my early 20s now) my health deteriorated quite severely. I'm very low functioning now mostly not because of physical difficulties but rather severe confusion/brain fog/altered state of consciousness and crushing mental fatigue accompanied by low grade fever. There are lots of other symptoms but this just makes everything beyond difficult. It feels like I'm poisoned, severely hungover, having a flu while tripping on some mud or mayonnaise - basically feeling intoxicated. It gets a lot worse with any stimulus or food intake so most of the activities like reading, talking with friends/family, cooking, walking not to mention working are sometimes bordering on impossible for me, when it's particularly bad. After trying to get medical help for these problems, doctors offered no more than antidepressants (which helped a little) and other symptom-masking drugs for the rest of the issues while not making the connections between it all. However some honestly said that something sketchy is going on but they don't know what.    

I made it my main goal to figure this all thing out as my quality of life fell below the zero point and nobody cared except me. And well, after another hit or miss experiment (taking antiprotozoa medication after my microbiome showed something very sketchy) I figured out I have chronic infection BUT this is where it gets weird. This infection is not recognized by medical community (yet) and being sort of ridiculed over the internet. Basically, authority based medical resources stated something like ""This thing is not researched therefore there is no evidence it's real therefore we won't even bother to research it"". To be honest, people who firstly presented this infection to the internet/medical community did a very bad job and heavily misrepresented it, making it all sound like some sort of made up absurdity. The worst part - it's most likely impossible to get rid of this infection completely with current methods.  

So I'm asking for advice here, what the hell am I supposed to do with my life now? I'm very low functional at my early 20s after being cheery person my whole life, overambitious in a sense - I haven't seen any friends in person in almost a year (they still sometimes call me, trying to help me with my ""depression""), I probably won't be able to hold a job but most importantly, even if I can - I can't imagine torturing myself working 9-5 in this state just for the sake of having a job. I'm lucky in a sense that parents are very understanding, not pushing me to work as they see my health problems are real - I currently live with them and they pay for everything (food, treatments etc). It slowly eats me inside, imagining being a sponger, slowly getting dementia at home while my peers are getting married, succeeding with their careers etc.  

But most importantly - after being beyond determined to figure out the root cause of my health issues for the previous years and currently being completely unable to address this root cause I just feel stuck and trapped - can't even bring the quality of life to the tolerable level currently as I tried almost every treatment/supplement/drug possible. It seemed logical at the time to leave my previous job to finally figure out my issues but now what. The situation is so absurd I can literally bet my life on this infection being real and explain the whole concept but nobody will believe me as there is still not enough evidence. It also just boggles my mind that this is a real thing which most likely affects millions of people worldwide, creating different life ruining symptoms while nobody seems to even consider researching it. My MD somewhat believed the concept I tried to explain to him as he has seen it with his eyes but obviously couldn't help. They couldn't culture the organism in the lab, however, there is a possibility  it's ""native"" to the gut as most of the human microbiome/virome/fungiome. I don't have resources to culture it on mice/human mucosal cells to prove it's real and I'm not sure how to interest somebody to do it as it all would sound absurd to most medical professionals. Also the reputation of this infection over the internet doesn't help this at all. And the irony of situation - most of my friends are prestigious medical university graduates and something tells me they also will rather assume I'm insane than consider it is real, which is understandable to be honest.  

I'm just completely lost and confused, quite literally - which direction would you go, what steps to take?",23Nov2019,1

597,"Hello everyone
So in my country the education system works like this: you go through 1st-9th grade where everything is equal for everyone, and in the end of the 9th grade you have to choose one ""area"" and in each area there are different subjects depending on what you like. But since you don't have all the subjects, this will late affect your future if you want to go to college because you can only choose certain degrees based on your ""area"", these are the areas:


-Sciences (Biology, Physics and Chemistry, Maths)

 
-Economics(Economy, Maths, Geography OR History B) 


-A word with no direct translation but you will get what it is when you see the subjects: History A, geography, Spanish


-Arts ( this one is a bit different I'll explain later)


(all the areas gave English, PE, Portuguese and filosophy) 

Right now I'm in the 11th grade, in the second year of Economics, my grades are fantastic which means that I can easily get in whatever degree based on the area I want (if, and this is important, I keep studying A Lot)

The thing is, I don't think I'm really that happy in economics, I mean  could imagine myself getting a degree on marketing and management? Yeah absolutely! Or in law to become a lawyer? Yeah I would also like that... But recently I've been feeling like it's not what I really want.

What do I really want?
I have no ideia, however I think I would love to go to arts, I would have to go back to the 10th grade and basically throw away my last year.

The thing with arts is that it depends o n the school, the school I would want to go is amazing, and it has so many subjects I would love, but idk if I would like that... I am in a pretty conservative school and changing drastically to a arts school with so many new people in a area I'm not as much comfortable (I'm good at regular school idk if I'm as good in drawing for example)... What if I regret myself and waste another year and then have to go back to the 10th grade in economics again?

Idk what should I do? The career choices aren't the best in arts and idk if I should take a risk for something I don't rly know if I like that much or not....

But I know that I love  cinema, I love photography, I would love to become a movie maker or something like that, I'm an excellent actor too, idk I feel like I have so much potential and creativity that Im wasting in a regular area... But at the same time I'm a good student with great grades wouldn't I be wasting those skills in arts? I could have a brilliant future as an economist or a lawyer.... Help me pls",23Nov2019,1

There were times where my brother hit really low. He has anxiety and had phases where he had no friends. During that times i was an emotional support to him. He wouldn’t accept it, but i know that i played an important role in his mental health. My parents were always dismissive of his issues, but I always listened to him and even gave him tons of motivation and positivity. But now i see him picking fights with me for no reason at all. I have stopped talking to him because of how disrespectful he is towards me. Today i am facing the same anxieties that he faced before, but he isn’t there for me.

604,"Hey everyone, I'm a closetted crossdresser since I was 12 but I can remember this desire of me since maybe 5 years old, I just didn't know what I was feeling at the time as I was a kid and didn't understand this was a sexual desire.
I got addicted to porn when I was 13 but only realised that wasn't normal when I turnt 15 and got into sissy porn (It's like CD porn but heavier). I was anxious, had low confidence, couldn't interact with people without they finding me weird, had an even worse attention problem than I already have, couldn't feel atracted to girls because sissy porn was the only thing that atracted me, etc. I managed to beat my addiction in my 17 years of age, I became confident, got new friends, learnt how to socialize like a normal human being, got out of depression, my attention got better in school, started picking up girls, in short all of my life got better.

162 days without porn and masturbation, I lost the streak but felt alright, no problem at all. But then I kept doing it and got into sissy porn all over again, depression, anxiety, social problems, all of it came back. These last months I was managing to hold myself for at least 30 days out of porn but never more than that, I was going emotionally really alright, no bad effects of porn, 3 days ago I watched the fucking sissy porn and masturbated 2 times in a row and now I have an extreme desire to have sex as a CD in real life, more than I already had but repressed because of my porn addiction, I'm also super into it now because I understand that this is part of me, I used to think that I developed this fetish because of porn but I didn't, It's part of my nature, it doesn't feel so wrong, heavy and dirty as it used to.

The problem now is that I have no idea on what to do, I'm scared of getting depressed and miserable again because it might lead me to porn, I'm also terribly scared of being discovered, I wanted to buy makeup but what if someone found it in my room? I also don't know if I should keep trying to stop it as I managed to do some years ago, it's too hard to stop, maybe it's not even worth it, maybe having cd experiences would be good to me and it wouldn't lead me to the ruins of porn addiction and there is this talk that repressing that part of me will lead to suffering and emotional problems and that I will never be able to separate myself 100% from CDing, the desire will always be with me and will come back someday, if I'm suposed to be outed anyway it doesn't matter if it's gonna be now or in 15 years

605,"Hi people of reddit, I need your help! BUT first some background. This summer I made some life altering decisions, as I decided no longer wished to compete as a varsity cross-country and track athlete for my university. Running had been my entire world ever since the 8th grade (nearly 8 years), however I quit because it was no longer bringing me joy/meaning, and I was frequently plagued with injuries. To keep myself busy throughout the school year, I decided that I was going to audition for a musical. I thought this was a pretty safe decision, because I really enjoyed doing musicals throughout high school and I am a pretty good singer. After the audition, I was rewarded with a semi-substantial role and I was excited to get to work.

At this same time, to keep me busy intellectually I also joined an Economics club that would meet at least once a week. The purpose of this club was for by the end of November we would be charged to make a skype presentation to a national entity about what kind of policies they should implement. (I am being vague to ensure anonymity). I too found this largely engrossing, I learned a lot and through this entire process it really firmed up in my mind that Public Policy was something that I was wanted to pursue in the long-term. Our presentation was a smash hit, winning our pool and we have been invited to the national capital to do another updated presentation in person for this national entity in February.

PROBLEM: Unfortunately, this economics trip lies within the dates of the musical and I am two 2 hour plane rides away from the nations capital so it is impossible to do both. Here lies my conundrum, no matter what I am disappointing someone by not attending one the events. On the economics side, I have three other teammates and the entire faculty of economics department whom I may disappointing. However, we do have an alternate; but, he is not particularly comfortable with the material and this would look amazing in terms of what I want to do professionally. 

On the other, hand while I am enjoying the musical. I have discovered that I am not a great actor, and have no large ambitions of really pursuing acting in the long run. Despite this, I would still be letting down the entire cast and the directors who took a chance on me. Additionally, the show does have multiple showings (12 I believe) and I would at max be missing 2 shows.

QUESTION: What should I do? I know that I committed to the musical first, however in doing so I would be missing a professional opportunity that comes once in a life time... Also the show is in another 3 months and we have done a lot of work and I will feel awful either quitting the show or asking them to have an understudy for two of those shows... However, I will feel equally awful quitting on my Economics teammates and letting down the department. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!",23Nov2019,1
606,"For the past few months I have been asking my mom to please give me my bank account info since I do not know what it is. I opened this saving account back when I was legally old enough which I think was 12 years old. All I remember is I was young, at the bank, and had to fill out a card with all of this information. For all know it wasn't a savings account. 

In order for me to get into my account I have to have that card as proof otherwise the bank will not work with me. On top of that since I was young at the time my mom was written in as the person to oversee it and could deposit or withdraw at anytime. She still can I'm assuming.

All my life she's been telling me that she has been putting the money I got in gifts into my account. I am 20 now and should just have free will to do what I want, yet the bank will not work with me. Now that I am also getting checks deposited from my jobs I am not able to see how much money I have at a time. I only really started having checks coming in since last year. I didn't think about it for a while but after I got a credit card I became more concerned about finances. 

I have not been able to check my bank account this whole time and just spend as consciously as possible. I have been so stressed about money lately I do not know what to do. I feel I cannot buy stuff without knowing how much money is available, which makes sense. And the most damming thing is she told me how much I had recently. She knows how to get into my account and will not tell me. Or she is just lying to me about knowing how much I have. Or the card I filled out is something I don't even need. I am not going to ruin my credit because I overspent and couldn't pay my bill.

A big part of my concern is that I feel she is spending my money without my knowledge. She will always tell me that money is tight (and has my whole life) but will always find a way to afford fast food, new clothes, purses, etc. I know that's a crock of shit since my dad doubled in pay essentially so I know money is not tight. But growing up was harder since we were poor but she could still find ways to get things she wanted. If she is just lying I want to know but it's going to fucking destroy me if she has been. I'm usually smarter than this, but I guess I'm too forgiving or naive that family would screw me over.

What do I do from here?",23Nov2019,1
607," So, I'm going to be getting married in about half a year. I'll be completely cut off from parental support and I'll be moving out of state with my then husband. I'm very excited about this because it will be the biggest change in my entire life. 

There are a bunch of life style changes I'd like to make after this happens, like eating habits, routines, and budgeting. I'm not very good keeping up with setting these things up now because I'm already kinda stuck in my own habits. I'm thinking moving and having a completely different life will allow me to do this overhaul. 

Am I being unrealistic here? Am i setting myself up for disappointment, or will moving away really make the difference?",23Nov2019,1
608,"Hi...I'm struggling with depression once more.
I'm simply unhappy.
I've been in this cycle for years now... Im not entirely sure when it started honestly. Maybe since I was around 13-15? Seems about the time I started having random bouts of depressive thoughts.
For the past few years it has basically devolved into a few months of distraction ending with a breakdown...keeping busy with whatever until it's no longer enough... I'm a 22 y/o uni drop out.  I've lost interest in the field I've wanted to work in since 3rd grade. Support from friends and family hasn't helped for more than 4 months, incidentally the period since my last breakdown. I've tried getting into fitness, new hobbies but no luck. Been thinking of getting professional help, yet haven't managed to actually do that for well over 2 years. 
I seem to keep falling into the same trap, wanting to get help but not managing to do that last step, being okay after getting into a new activity. The past 2 or so years these have been a multitude of things like after school activities (event organization), fitness, developing occupational skills, learning an instrument, job hunting, fitness again and work. Everything seems like a temporary fix because I just can't feel satisfied...any accomplishment feels hollow or ends up being reversed somehow.
It feels like I keep sabotaging myself no matter what I do. Like I want to be sad. 
Can someone who's managed to deal with depression share their stories on how they overcame it?

Yesterday, I overheard them talking about one woman who wouldn't pay for a $600 dollar brake job that my dad performed on her car. I asked my mom about it later that night and she told me it was complicated, that the woman in question is not financially stable, and when my mom went to the woman house to talk with her, she guilted my mom and told her she had cancer and it was wrong to make her pay full price for the brake job.  My parents need the money for mortgage, but they can't just strong-arm this lady, as they have a reputation as amicable, reasonable business owners.

617,"My girlfriend recently moved away to start her master's degree. We went to different universities for our bachelors degrees so long distance is nothing new to us. Anyways, she went out with a mixed group the other night and everybody was having a good time. One of her closer girl friends invited everyone over to their house afterwards to continue drinking. My girlfriend knew almost everyone and felt comfortable enough with the group. There was one guy that she didn't know but he came off as nice enough. At some point, my GF was told that this new guy was really interested in her. She immediately addressed the situation and said she was not interested, she already has a boyfriend. This guy was persistent though and repeatedly tried to make advances throughout the night. Eventually, things settle down and people either left or fell asleep. I don't know how many people actually stayed the night at the house, but my GF ended up asleep on the couch while this other guy ended up in the spare bedroom. At some point, my GF got up to get some water and crossed paths with the same guy. He insisted that she goes back to the bedroom with him and once again, she refuses and says she isn't interested. She returned to the couch and went back to sleep. After some time, she wakes up to find this guy laying next to her with his hand down her pants. After being denied multiple times during the night, this dude thought he could get away with taking advantage of my GF while she was sleeping. 

To say the least, I am angry and upset with this guy. I want my girlfriend to report the situation to the authorities and press charges.

Mom: Country, line dancing, great mother, lost her daughter in April this year, its our first Christmas without her. She's taking us to Disneyland in Paris. Been thinking about getting her tickets to Eurovision but it's most likely going to be too expensive. €100 per ticket I could do, but I've read they might start at €299. She spent a lot of time diamond painting, but she's lost interest in the hobby. Her drink of choice is Dropshot.

Brother: Xbox gamer (FN, FIFA, COD), has taken a lot of interest in brand clothing (Stone Island, BALR., Philipp Plein), he's also very interested in expensive parfumes. If I'm not mistaken I heard him say he likes One Million. He also likes booze, in particular any super sweet ones. Does One Million have any affordable super nice gift packages by chance? 

Dad: Musician, loves to cook. His hobby is playing the keyboard and filming. Likes beer and spicy foods. Pretty unsure how I could make a gift out of this as I give him beer with a glass and donald ducks every year...

Stepdad: Pretty simple metalhead (AC/DC, whitesnake, Iron Maiden, Metallica etc) and loves one particular beer. 

Grandpa: 82 year old man, loves birds and often goes on trips with his wife.

He hasn't driven it since the end of September, and it was some time before then.

But now, a week later, it goes all the way up to the top line on the dipstick when I check it, both when the engine is warm and cold. The color is darkish amber, not black.

624,"Basically some of my friends thought it would be fun to do some boxing. I’d never done it before and thought it would be fun if we kept it quiet and did it whilst there was a teachers meeting going on.

But one of my other friends decided to hype it up and made an instagram account for it which now has over 200 followers. They want to live stream it on Facebook.  so sounds good so far? The only problem it’s going to be at school, and I’ve realised it’s only going to take somebody talking about it too loudly or a teacher sees somebody watching it for us to get caught.

I sort of overlooked this but when talking to some people at work today they made me realise how fucking stupid this is. No.1 - the other side is refusing to wear head guards and mouth guards meaning someone could get hurt (probably not, but maybe). No.2 it’d be in school and being broadcasted to over a hundred people from inside and out of school. No.3 I’m a on a massive bursary and pay less than 50% of normal fees so I imagine it wouldn’t be hard for them to do a cost benefit analysis and kick me out.

625,"So hi everyone im kinda having a problem and need advice about my relationship between me and my boyfriend of three months almost. He asked me out first with hentai considering he was a weeb and so was i at the time, he always wore anime shirts and thats all he would wear, he never had any plain shirts or anything like that. The two and a half months were great, he showed me love and affection whenever i needed it and gave me lots of hugs and kisses, and we where both sexualy active. Everything changed like three weeks ago he never paid attention to me and wanted nothing to do with me, he got his phone taken away at the time so he keeps using that excuse whenever i ask cuz he keeps saying ""oh since i got my phone taken away i dont beat my meat twice a day or watch hentai and porn so Im not sexually active"". But i dont believe that because how can ur personality change that fast. The last few days have been horrible, I was scared to talk to him about my problems and he was cussing at me to talk and i started crying so he just talked with his friends.

(he did this thing where tuesday and thursdays are for the boys and any other day is for me so when this happened it was friday) 

I know this may seem all dumb but I really need help, all my friends want me to leave him but I dont want to because I still have hope..

He used to always compliment my body but now he says that he likes anime girls bodies more than mine. He seems to ignore me alot and Yesterday I tried giving him a hug but he elbowed me off him and got mad.

He wants me to stop being friends with my best friend since 5th grade because he thinks she will turn me lesbian but my friend is very shy,quiet and just wants to be friends with him. I asked why he doesnt give me hugs anymore and he said that he doesnt need to which he kinda does whenever i feel down. He never notices when im sad, but when I start crying on a call with him he threatens to hang up if I dont stop. All my friends say i deserve better even my ex said that but I think he can change I just know it.

Anyway, any advice..?",23Nov2019,1

628,"Hello everyone I just wanted some advice on what can be done when a teacher feels its appropriate to lay blame on a parent in a very aggressive email.

A bit of background my son moved primary schools and unfortunately this was also counties so processes are different. However he just about to get his EHCP before we had to leave I was assured that the new school would have all the evidence to get his EHCP that we had previously been waiting got 1 year. If this has not been the case I would not have moved schools until he had this EHCP.  We moved the town we moved to didn't have space in the schools and so he had to access transport. My son has a diagnosis and currently on the pathway for another. Now unsupervised transport or any time unsupervised is setting him up to fail, I was against this from the get go. If he has the EHCP this would enable him to have a one to one worker. Now I was informed of problems arising during the first month or so. I problemed solved it and I heared nothing more for 16 months... Then I get a letter telling me that transport can be removed at anytime due to his constant misbehaviour. So with this in mind I started to get worried as he needs the 1 to 1 support and we have no other way of getting him to the school. And I was unaware of this being a problem I always ask the drivers every day is there any problems... No Mrs no problems... How can I proactively deal with things if I don't even know there there was a problem? So I reached out for support and advice on what to do. 

Prior to this we had 1 appointment at the school that I could not attend and I phoned and told them I couldn't make it. Another appointment was not set up or arranged I didn't think I had to attend it. My son was then excluded for 1 day and we had a reintegration meeting during this meeting we were told that failure to attend the meeting back in July was the reason the EHCP has been delayed even though at this point we had already been waiting over 1 year.. We asked if we could now put this through ASAP as transport is a massive issue. 

I received advice and support from 1 voluntary service and the actual SENS department they advised me to undertake the EHCP on my own as they did not know why the school has delayed.  That is when I received a passive aggressive email from the school, blaming me for everything. I then responded on a very professional manor I did not get any response. We had a face to face meeting where the entire time she was goating by continuously saying that the problems where due to a lack on conversation on my behalf.  She told me I know about the problems with the transport, I said no I didn't as no one has spoken to me about them, then she back tracked and said well it would have been appropriate to discuss them at the meetings you missed. I said but surely if they were that much of a concern I needed to act on them right away. I kept my composure for most of the meeting until she said 'there are 87 other Sends children in this school not just your son, we aren't going to chase you.. Those parents are actually willing to engage. At this point I burst into tears and told her that wasn't true and that I have done and will do everything for my son. ( the school hasn't been very good at communicating with me and we are in a different village from the school and don't currently drive) the delay 16 months to be exact in sending off the emhp has been determinal to his learning. I stood up and said I can't do this I need a break, I said to my mother who was also in the meeting I don't want him to go to this school anymore. My mum said sit down and let's finish the meeting. I regained my self and carried on the meeting. Not once was I rude, personal, aggressive and I certainly did not swear. I got a letter this morning that is completely fabricated, saying I was offensive, rude and swearing and there was something else in there that I never said. I am absolutely disgusting in this teachers behaviour and I want to take this further but I want to make sure I do it the right way.

This entire situation has had a negative effect on my mental wellbeing and instead of being about the best interest of my son, it's become a a blaming game as the senco doesn't want to admit she has made a mistake and treat me like a human and apologise. My son just needs access to the support for him to be able to learn and have option to access a specialist school who will have the experience and skills to give him the best outcomes. 

Thanks for the advice.

629,"I started uni in October and met a girl in the first week, we immediately became good friends. We spent every day together (except the classes we don't share), but it's still a fresh friendship. 

Over 2 weeks ago, Friday, when we don't have any classes together, she sends me a message: ""I'm 90% sure we're breaking up today"".

It's about her boyfriend. From what she told me he seemed like an ok guy and their relationship was fine. Then a week prior she starts talking about how they're fighting and she can't tell him anything without him being pissed off. She said it's most likely because he's dealing with the fact that he's not enjoying what he's studying (also just started uni) and it's in addition very stressful, so he doesn't know what to do. 

Back to that friday, I finish classes early, but wait for some time in the city so we can catch the same train home. We talk and she seems ok, she tells me they're going out to talk that evening. She told me she's been crying all day, getting weird looks, but she laughs about it. She seems fine.

Next monday she's not in class. It's weird, because she's one of the top students in a class of 200+ people. She doesn't miss lectures often and she certainly wouldn't miss an exam. I text her, but she never responds.

Same thing next day, but I leave it.

Third day I text her again. I don't even know if she's going to her lab classes, you can't miss those more than once or you'll fail. 

This is all on WhatsApp so I can see she's online. I even send her messagess via Messenger. Nothing.

I thought I'd let her cool off, but there's a lot of shit at uni you're not supposed to miss. I was worried.

Next week I literally spammed her, getting nothing back. I know none of her friends or family and to be honest, I don't know if we're good enough friends for me to contact them.

The biggest issue is the fact I've never been completely alone. I lived with my parents and after that immediately started living with her. Also don't have a lot of friend because we were planning to move to another country together so I never felt the need to maintain a lot of friendships. And also, not to drag on the ex too much, but she was the type that got jealous whenever I started making friends or started doing relatively well for myself in our own country because it made her worry I wasn't going to go with her anymore. 

I've tried rekindling some connections since the break up but no luck so far. I always considered myself an introvert so didn't anticipate this to be this difficult but I feel very lonely. Luckily I do work in retail so that gives me social interaction but whenever I have days off like today it really sucks. Outside of the work environment I'm pretty socially awkward so making new friends is difficult. And talking with customers obviously feels different from normal social environments.

Basiclly I guess I want to either get some advice on either learning how to live alone without it feeling shitty or ways on how I can make new connections while not being the most social person ever.

641,"I am a first year Biomedical Engineering student and I am not liking it so far. I withdrew from physics because I was failing, and I am not doing the best in Calculus either. I was interested in BME because it was a combination of the two career paths I was thinking of going into, Engineering and the medical field. I am thinking of switching majors from Engineering to something related to Health Sciences. My University offers Health Sciences and I was thinking of doing that, but I've heard that a Health Science degree is a useless degree. I'm mainly interested in Physical Therapy, Radiation Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and being Physician Assistant. My idea was to get the Health Science degree and then go into Physical Therapy, or one of the others listed above, but I'm not really sure what to do. My mother works at a hospital and she is going to see if I could see what the daily duties are for some of the careers I want to do.",23Nov2019,1

644,"Pretty much what the title says. I’ve been worried about this because it only happens when we have HUGE fights (have only had two huge ones in the year and few months we’ve been together) and in all honesty it worries me that he hops on these chats with people, to him it maybe normal everyday chats but there’s girls and guys who seek out for him for sexual favours. He tells me he only checks it every 6 months BUT it has to coincidently happen after a huge fight. After the first time I did tell him to stop and how uncomfortable it made me feel but here he is doing it again. I should add that these are BDSM and “mind control” chats (I forget the actual name for it so I’ll stick with that), things that we don’t do because I’m too afraid to do them or just too darn uncomfortable (he has stated that he doesn’t need that stuff in his sex life but him still seeking it out doesn’t make me believe it).

645,"So I live with 3 guys. 2 of them are great! I get along with everyone but that’s just the nature of the person I am. I can get along with anyone and everyone. 1 has recently started to piss me off. It takes a lot to piss me off. Every night he insists sleeping to YouTube videos without using headphones so we all hear what he hears and he never pauses it when he drifts to sleep so I will WAKEUP to random ass nerdy gaming videos. He also never wakes up to his alarm! We do! It will literally go off for 20 minutes till either me or a diff roommate will throw something at him so he turns it off. He’s such a liability! He doesn’t even know how much of an asshole he’s being. Oh I forgot to mention he loves competitive gaming at 1-4am yelling at his microphone. But that’s not what was the final straw. I could handle all this.

Last night we went partying. He drank wayy too much and I of course ended up having to take care of his ass. He was blackout. Going around telling everyone how much of a lightweight I am when I drank just as much as him just slower. However unlike him I can hold my liquor and he lost his shit. Ended up throwing up in the Uber I got for us to take us home. Got slapped with a $160 fine. Not to mention the cherry on top which was him dropping dead outside our dorm lobby where my RA proceeds to call the ambulance. 

So now he owes the hospital x ridiculous amount. 
And owes me $160. He’s extremely childish. It’s so hard to believe he’s 18 but yeah now I’m fucked and don’t know what to do. He says he’s gonna pay me back but I really don’t think it will be ANYTIME soon",23Nov2019,1

But now I'm scared of myself I never thought I was such a piece of shit, I don't know how to cope with this, if my roommate weren't there I could have sexually assaulted her the pure imagination of that makes me sick I don't want to hurt anybody that I care. I'm going to visit a therapist and the appointment is in a couple of weeks but I can't function properly I can't stop thinking of killing myself (I used to be depressed and that doesn't help) that by doing that there would be one less awful person.

653,"Im currently 15 (almost 16 tho) years old, living as an illegal immigrant (have been for about four years). About two years ago, my aunt on my mother’s side found out she had breast cancer, and slowly it spread throughout her body over the last couple of months, until it got to where she is now, on her deathbed. I’m writing this out of pure desperation. I’ve recurred to all of my available options and sources for advice. 

My mom wants to see her sister before she dies, of course. Both of my parents have decided we’re moving back, since not being able to ever visit and getting stuck with shitty jobs bc of the lack of a social security number is taking a tremendous physical and emotional toll on them. It hurts me that they’ve stayed longer than they really wanted to already, because I wanted to stay so bad.

I’ve invested a ridiculous amount of energy and time into adapting to being here, learning a new language, a new culture. And I’ve found that this country is where I need to be. I’ve gotten attached, and living in Brazil at this point sounds like a godamn nightmare. I mean it literally too; I’ve had literal nightmares about having to move back, countless times. 

I’ve finally found people who are good for me for the first time in four years. I met a girl, her friends, and a man, who are all I look forward to anymore. I dealt with severe depression earlier this year, and I can’t see myself being able to make it if I leave and have to start all over again. Especially with only two more years until I’m legally an adult that can decide where she lives, this is just absolutely frustrating. 

I keep having panic attacks, and I can’t really sleep at night. I need advice as to either how to cope with this feeling, or a possibility for me to stay here. This is the worst thing I can imagine happening to me at this point in my life, and it’s happening, and every time I think of it I have a panic attack or cry or both.",23Nov2019,1

655,"I'm 18. Have been for a few months now. So, naturally, like most British young adults do, I started clubbing with friends. The first time I went, it was just to have fun. Dance while intoxicated. That was exactly what happened. The second time, I run into an old friend from school. He's like 'you're a good looking bloke. Go and find a girl you like the look of, and go and talk to her.' This changed my mindset completely, and not in a good way. Suddenly, I wanted to be that guy that was making out with girls in clubs, having one night stands etc etc. So I took his advice. Got rejected a few times, found a girl that obviously liked me, and then had my first make out session. Went  more times. Found more girls, did the same thing. Was offered sex a few times, but declined due to them being very intoxicated and me not so much. And then one day, I experience a very brutal rejection, far worse than the usual 'sorry no' or 'I have a boyfriend.' This broke me. Every time I've gone out since then, I'll be lucky to muster up the courage to talk to one woman, and then because I have become awkward and nervous it'll end in rejection, and then I'll sulk for the rest of the evening. I don't know how I went from a guy who could take multiple rejections in a night to one who sulks after one, and I really want to restore my 'just go for it and if it ends badly, it's their loss' mentality. Any advice on how I can go back to my old self, or if I even need to? Some of my friends say that my old 'fuckboy like' approach was wrong, because I put uneccessary pressure on myself to pull when my intention should be just to have a nice time. I'm at a loss, and don't know what I should do about this situation.

659,"This is the first time I’ve ever liked someone enough to ask them out and this was the first girl to show genuine interest in me.

I had a small crush on this girl in August that faded away before fall started. No big deal

End of October we became friends anyways and she added me on snap and asked for my number, that and the fact that we shared a lot in common brought me right into an even bigger crush.

I had really bad social anxiety for about 18 years of my life pretty much and a girl that I did like showed that much interest in me really took me off guard and I got almost obsessed 

I finally hinted towards asking her out and got a mixed answer, fearing the worst already I toughened up and told her how I felt to get it over with.

She isn’t into white guys it turns out and that’s not just letting me off easily because her friends have also told me about her dating preference 

I know there’s nothing that’s my fault but the fact that this was my first time really having that kind of experience is really preventing me from fully moving on.

(I don’t want to block her and not talk to her, I’m okay with being friends. I just want to stop my feelings...)

First time a girl showed interest in me, huge crush and got rejected. Want to get rid of these feelings without blocking her out of my life",23Nov2019,1
660,"I'm 37 years old. I grew up visiting two uncles in prison. One of them got out, learned from his mistakes and has been productive ever since. He's an upstanding guy.

The other one...he has been a total POS for all of his life. Since I was a kid, he has called up my grandmother a lot, wanting money from her on a regular basis. There's no telling how many tens of thousands of dollars he has conned her out of throughout her life. He called her even when she didn't have it and she would foolishly give it to him. He's the youngest of two. He was once married and had a child, but took off on his wife for another lady and has basically spent decades using women to live off from, running up their credit card bills, not paying child support (went to jail for that at one point) and such.

A long, long time ago, my mother helped that con uncle (who is her brother) get a vehicle. He refused to pay for it and it ended up getting repo'ed and he to this day owes her about $8,000 and basically acts like it was my mother's fault that he wasn't paying the bill.

At another point, my other uncle (his brother)...they were helping him out by letting him rent a room at the house they're living in. He was eating up all of their food, leaving cigarette butts everywhere and vodka bottles everywhere. They kicked him out.

Doing a search under his name...it shows that he has been listing my mother's home address/old phone number, my grandmother's PO box and such as if they were his. My grandmother is 84 years old now. They've found some cancer lumps in one of her breasts, she needs surgery and has to have so EKG procedures before they'll even consider surgery. She's worried about what Medicare/Medicaid may not pay for for the surgery and this POS uncle is still calling her up sometimes 2-3 times per week basically demanding that she send him money. This guy is in his upper 50's. He has a sob story every time he calls her and has resorted to telling my grandmother that he ""is helping the other uncle with his prostate issues"" when he calls up asking her for money now. That other uncle has nothing to do with him and quite literally would bust him in the mouth if he knew that his brother was using a lie about him to con their mother out of money.

Is there some kind of legal action or law enforcement action that can be taken against him? He has gotten to the point where he wants $200-$300 a month out of my grandmother and she won't tell him no. She has gone her whole life giving in to his demands, is 84, is living with my mom (her daughter) and basically upholding the con man son at the same time. In the past, she took the side of her son in the vehicle repo and stood against her own daughter who was giving her a place to live. She does have some mental issues...believed to be paranoid schizophrenic. We're quite furious about her youngest son always conning her. 

Is there ANYTHING at all that can be done about this youngest son? Nobody in the family wants anything to do with him and he's preying on his own elderly mother. His mother claims that he's ""scared that my mother (who he formerly conned by not paying for the vehicle) wouldn't give him any money left over"" if my grandmother passed. Of course, absolutely not, because he's a con man and she doesn't have anything to give anyone, anyway. She's broke and never saved for retirement. She barely gets about $800 a month in social security and doesn't have money to give him, but quite literally doesn't have sense enough to stop giving in to his (likely threatening) demands. When he got in jail one time locally, he wrote my grandmother a letter cussing her out and saying that she never did anything for him, demanding that she send him money and such.",23Nov2019,1

664,"So it’s been a year and a couple of months since I broke up with my ex and from time to time I get the sudden urge to confront him but I do NOT want to speak to him since I’m in a happy place with an amazing boyfriend. 

What I want to confront him about is that all the times where he emotionally and physically abused me, or sexually harassed cuz “I’m his girlfriend.” He still thinks he has done nothing wrong. I also told him I want my paintings back before we even broke up but he burnt them. I cried for a whole day when I found that out cuz they were my BEST paintings in my opinion. 

Some days I just lay in bed and think about how I would confront him for all the things he did to me and all the trouble he did to my friends. (He wanted to fight my guy best friend cuz he thought he was the one who told me to break up with him but no I was just fed up.)

So my advice is, how do I just forget about it without having to confront him. I don’t want trouble for myself and I want to finally be at peace without thinking ‘oh I couldn’t done this, but didn’t.’ It kinda makes me sad that he thinks I’m the one that did all the wrongs and he has done nothing, cuz that’s what he would say.",23Nov2019,1

667,"I know this probably seems selfish because obviously it hurts her more. But I (24F) am having such a hard time dealing with my girlfriends homophobic father.

Some background: her father is a very traditionalist man. He does not respect women at all, even saying things like “women who are raped either are lying or acted like a tease” regularly calls my girlfriend fat or worthless. He claims that his homophobia is due to religion, yet he slept with a married woman for years and never goes to church. His homophobia is so bad, he yelled at my girlfriend because I offered to clean his carpets (they are really poor and can’t afford to have them done), while he was not home, 6 hours away, visiting his new wife, and he told my girlfriend it was disrespectful to even suggest it. He literally finds it disrespectful for me to save him 200+ dollars by cleaning his carpets when he isn’t even in the state. My girlfriend is graduating in a month from college, and he said he wouldn’t go if I came, even though I wouldn’t even be sitting next to them. His homophobia is so bad, that he lets her sisters boyfriend (who has raped a girl in the past) come over for family dinners and to have a beer and hang out. But I can’t even go to her graduation and sit on opposite sides of a 1000+ person auditorium. 

She’s kind of in a bad position because he hates him too. When she was a baby, her mom met him and he adopted her. He forced her mom to get rid of everything that said she wasn’t his daughter, so my girlfriend would never know. But she still knew she was adopted, even before she found her birth certificate. Because her father treated her so much worse than her sister. But she has no mom anymore (he kicked her out when she developed schizophrenia, so now she’s homeless and we can’t find her), and her dad moved out of the state to live with his new wife, leaving her to take care of her sister without any support. Despite the abuse, he’s the only family she has, so she can’t just leave him. And he is holding her school loans over her head, because if she cuts him off, he won’t pay them. Worse. She is only not homeless because he needs her to take care of her 17 year old sister, since he left the state. She isn’t in a position where she can get her own place due to the fact that he financially supports them both. But gives all the money to her sister, who spends it all on clothes and her boyfriend. And my gf even makes too much to qualify for Medicaid because her fathers income is factored in, but her father won’t let her have coverage. So she can’t even get therapy since he says “mental illness doesn’t exist”.

I know her life is awful enough. And I know it’s selfish to feel bad for myself about it. But he treats me like dirt and talks bad about me, despite the fact that he refuses to ever meet me. I don’t know what to do though, because I want her to be happy. My family loves her and literally has made her part of mine. But I guess I just feel so angry that he treats her so poorly and acts disgusted around me. I’m not sure what to do about it or how to get my girlfriend help. She clearly can’t get psych help and she won’t be able to get a job to support herself until she’s out of school. Nor can she just stop supporting her sister. 

Are there any resources for people in this kind of situation? The state won’t give her food stamps or health care because it looks like they make a lot of money. And she can’t get out because she literally only makes 1,600$/month, most of which goes to her current expenses. Any advise helps!",23Nov2019,1
668,Help I have no idea what I want to be doing with my life. What would you do if you didn’t know,23Nov2019,1
670," 

Gonna try to explain if you don't know what discord is and as quickly as possible I don't want this post to be 4 pages long, basically its a text and voice server where you can communicate with friends, post memes, etc. I am 19M in a friend group with 4 other 19 or 20M, we became friends in high school maybe 3 years ago and we have all gone to the same college and continue to be friends. We have a discord server with all of us, plus a good number of other kids from our college and old high school, and in the discord server you have access to certain chats based on the 'roles' you have in the server. I and my friends all have the 'moderator' role which gives us max abilities I believe, but one of the roles on the discord server is 'Physics Mech' which is a class at college and they have their own private chat to talk about hw, tests, and stuff that you want to filter out if you are not in the class. I am not in the class and I don't have the role, my 4 other friends are and some other slight friends from the discord.

​

Now i don't remember what I was doing, but I was playing around with the server setting that I have access to for no good reason and I was looking through the long long list of roles that the server has, and I decided to give myself the Physics role for no reason other then I wanted to see what my profile looked like with every role turned on. When I did so I saw a locked 'Physics Mech' channel appear. Its important to know that at this point I did not know they even had a 'homework' channel but I didn't think much of it as I started scrolling through the channel and saw people discussing the class and exams and stuff I didn't care about etc. But once I got about 4 days up in the chat I noticed them talking about me, and lets just say not in a good light, they discussed how they were planning on seeing the new Joker movie at midnight and didn't want me to come, so they made sure to go to a 3am showing of Joker as I am known to attend the movie theater often. As I continued to scroll up I started seeing shit talking, and not in a joking friend to friend banter kind of way, they were saying stuff like ""I swear to god I hope OP isn't in my lab next semester, I would be inclined to partner up with him"" Followed by replies of ""Yea sounds like a semester of hell with that faggot."" They clearly don't know too much about how discord works because I saw another post saying ""OP cannot see this text channel, right guys"" Then I saw the owner of the server say ""nah he doesn't have the physics role"" They didn't realize that with moderator role I can give myself roles.

​

Worse then that, two of them are roommates and rent a house, I discover they have been meeting up at this house for various activities that I enjoy with them without me and with other friends as well. I could go on with the shit talking but honestly it just makes me depressed to do so just understand that there is plenty more evidence and that its not in a friendly way or joking manner. I honestly am still shellshocked and cannot believe what I am reading, it took me an hour to read through the entire chat and take all the text in. I removed the physics role after I was done so its extremely unlikely they will ever know I know unless I say so. But honestly, I don't have anybody close to the level of friendship I had with these 4 guys and I don't know anybody else to a friend level otherwise and it just kills me. I guess I cannot blame them for not wanting my company if they don't want it but I am still furious and just more shaken and depressed. I have been to these guys family thanksgiving and a million other events but I am that 'friend', the guy everyone secretly mocks and roasts behind my back and it devastates me because I never thought it would be me. Any advice guys, don't really know what to do right now, but for time this was 2 days ago I discovered and things have continue as normal for those 2 days but I just don't want anything to do with them anymore but I fear being alone with nobody else to laugh with anymore",23Nov2019,1

675,"I’m a 17 year old who started attending raves this year. I’ve only been to 2, both 2 months apart, and for anyone who doesn’t know, most people in raves are high on many things since it helps them get a better feel and have more fun with the music, and I did that too. The first time i took a quarter of LSD, and the 2nd time half éxtasis. After that last time i started having deep thoughts about this whole thing, since i do wanna go to some more raves and have fun, but i wanna believe i can and will stop soon after a few more. Keep in mind that I don’t feel any kind of need, not of raves nor of drugs, it’s like if i get to go cool, if I don’t well some other time, and if i get to take something great, and if not then I don’t really care. I do have fun when I’m normal , but it’s like getting high helps you get the most fun out of it, that’s why i would prefer being high in a rave, but don’t need to. When  i take something i feel free and liberated, like i would be concerned about my clothes my hair and just dancing, and then when I’m high I don’t really care about how people see me and what they might be thinking about me, if I’m embarrassed of dancing, and those kinds of things. I’ve also thought about how sad and disappointed my parents would be, since i know that what I’m doing isn’t really right. But if I assist some more, will that make it harder for me to stop? Should i try to keep a big gap between each rave? Because i do want to stop but not yet, I don’t want to be thinking about this the next time, and having fun but feeling bad. 
Also forgot to mention that i only feel like getting high in raves, i never felt like it any other place nor in my everyday life.

677,"apologies this is a repost of sorts as the first post only got 2 replies.  I am hoping for a little more advice this time

I am at a new job and some coworkers asked about my family (after they all kinda shared about theirs.  they are military veterans and family is very important with them.  faith too.)

I have lived in europe for years and haven’t visited or seen my family in that time, nor upon having returned to the usa this past summer

as the topic continued i u wittingly revealed that i haven’t seen my family in many years, just skype.  

i was able to change the topic, and it never came back around to why i don’t see my family, even for this coming thanksgiving (i am staying in town where i live and having thanksgiving with a friend’s family)

I am a very private person and don’t like sharing too much about myself.  

Problem:  i have great anxiety that my new coworkers think i am a terrible person because i don’t get together with my family.  family and church are clearly very important values for my coworkers.  

i am considering going into detail and explaining why but it’s embarrassing.  Also i don’t know how to bring the topic back up without it being extremely awkward.  

basically my family is poor and the location where i moves when i got back to the usa was chosen because i had a job lined up, my family isn’t in this state

my job overseas didn’t pay enough for me to fly home to visit the usa.  Also because of the nature of my job i only ever had 1 week off from work per year, so i could never justify to myself spending so much money to visit the usa and family for only like 4 days.  

i just never got around to it.  

on the flip side my family never flew out to see me in europe because they cannot afford it.  plus they’re busy with their pile of kids/life/etc

now that i am back in the usa i still haven’t seen my family because they live in a different state far away and neither party can afford the time or money to meet up.  (again where i currently live was chosen because of job guarantee).  

Question: what should i do, if anything?

is this something i should be embarrassed about?  my family is too poor to meet in person?

should i ignore the situation and just do my job?

thank you",23Nov2019,1

Aside from those two, I’ve had multiple interactions with women but it always seems like they just want a temp to fill in for sexual activity and dates. Hell, I’ve even got to meet parents a couple times. This year especially, it seems my sexual partners have almost doubled.

I love with my cousin who was in a long term relationship, about 10 years, with a guy that still lives with us after the break up.
They both started seeing other people, while still living in the same house and spend the night out at their respective new partners.
Problem is I feel like he is taking advantage of their situation. He hasn’t worked for the last 4 years and she is the one who pays the bills most times. He stays home during the day and goes out every night and chills with his friends. She told him to move out but keeps telling her next month and it’s already been 3 months. 
They had sex the other day, from my perspective, it seemed like he doesn’t want to move out since that will require him working. After they had sex, I was thinking they would be able to work it out but he went to his girl’s house that same night and spent the night there. 
She is at a loss because she waited 10 years for this guy to marry her and he was postponing proposing saying they weren’t ready and stuff. Of course he wasn’t, dude hasn’t held a job in 4 years.

Yes, I've stayed out later than my parents wanted me to. Yes i argue with them but i feel like that is just normal. 

Now my parents: I know they love me and I know they want the best for me but sometimes their methods of doing so are really infuriating. For example: I always have to make sure i tell my parents a few days in advance if Im hanging out with friends, My parents set a limit of 1 hour when im playing video games, and they always seem to think that I have the worst intentions in mind. Also, my mom can get mad at the most little of things and tries to insert herself into my life, gossiping about my friends and getting mad when i don't tell her more about my social and intimate life. 

I've tried talking to them yet it always seems to end with them excusing my complaints as ""me being a teenager"" or them just getting mad at me and threatening to punish me. 

My mom gets in a really cranky mood every evening (the time when I can actually talk to her) and yells at me for no reason telling me im going to fail and that they are the only ones keeping my life le together. I wish I could have a more friendly relationship with her but it just seems like it wont work out. 

The thing that really set me off was when yesterday, after school I finally, after doing nothing but hw the entire week, i was playing some destiny with my friends. I had done all my chores and completed my hw for the weekend yet she yelled at me for always playing on the computer when i hadn't been on it other than for homework the entire week. She called me an addict and she said I ""needed help"" (she does this all the time but apologizes yet does it again the next day). Am I an addict? Will I fail without my parents?

I just moved from the east
 to the Midwest for college. I was always a little bit of a loner in highschool and I really just wanted like a close group of friends. I found these two girls in my dorm and the first couple of weeks we were really hitting it off I thought we were going to become really close. And idk why, maybe because I’m a guy and they’re girls distance 
or just differences in schedules but they kinda started to move away from me and started having exactly what I wanted with other people. I had no support system I miss home, I felt super alone, and like these were the people I thought I was going to be able to talk to about this stuff but they essentially ghosted me. Anyways I got drunk at a party and texted one of the girls essential saying like I thought we were going to be really good friends and you like ghosted me for no reason and are like explicitly excluding me from your (once our) friend group and not talking to me at all and that really sucks. No response no talks no nothing just further exclusion. And recently I again came home from a party drunk (tipsy I wasn’t that drunk) and like just wanted to hang out and talked so I knocked on their door. And rather than say like sorry don’t wanna talk they locked the door. So I kept knocking because that really hurt and they just kept ignoring me. Like children. Was that a good thing to do no and I felt bad but that hurt. Anyways am I in the wrong? Now finally they want to talk what should I say?",23Nov2019,1

685,"Ok, so this is quite a long story, but it all started when this woman (I'll call her D) at my work took about 3 months or so off of work for health reasons.  When she got back I was chatting to her and just inquired if she was feeling ok, which upset her, so I apologised and everything was fine again.  A few days later I was doing a talk on my experience of having Autism at work (not a training course), and I suggested to a mutual friend of ours, a guy called A, that perhaps he should tell her about it, in case she might be interested.  

A said to D something along the lines of ""Daihaotian wants to invite you to his Autism awareness training.""  Which she took to mean that I thought she needed autism awareness training.  The next day I went out to a work event in the pub and she ignored me to the point where she smiled and said hi to the person on my left, smiled and said hi to the person on my right and just acted like I wasn't even there.

The following Monday I get called into a meeting with my manager to explain that I'd said something to upset D, which I thought was our earlier conversation asking her how she was, and that I wasn't to talk to her anymore for the time being, or even walk past her desk to see my friend A, who sits near her.

A month later, I was having lunch in our tea point and I was talking to some friends of hers when she came in and completely talked over me, pretended I wasn't there and got her friends to stop speaking to me and start speaking to her.  It then turned out that what upset her was what A had said to her, and nothing that I had said, and when her manager explained the misunderstanding she gave a response like she didn't even care about it anymore, which made me break down and spend the entire day crying at work.

Then she started repeating her behaviour of entering a room, talking to whoever I was talking to, acting like I wasn't there and getting those people to talk to her and not me.  My managers refused to do anything about it, and I got all sorts of excuses back like ""She's unwell"", ""She needs space"", ""It's a coping strategy"" and ""She doesn't have to talk to me.""

Anyway, I think someone did eventually talk to her, because she then ceased the behaviour, but still wasn't talking to me, which was fine.

However, it's a few months on and she's started smiling at me again when she sees me, getting close to me, and even started striking up conversations with me.  I thought she might have a crush, but when she was asked she just said she was treating me like any other colleague, and was just being friendly, nothing more.  The sad part about all of this is that I have quite a big crush on her, and I'm not sure if I should tell her that, and tell her how much she hurt me, or if I should just leave her be and let her talk to me whenever she wants to.

I was thinking about leaving a Christmas card for her on her desk, and the last time I saw her she suggested I organise a Karaoke night for some of my colleagues, so I decided to do that as a birthday party for myself, and I was also planning to invite her to it.  Am I completely crazy?  Is it possible she really does have a crush, and if so what do I do about it?  I'm really confused, I get very strong emotions when I see her and talk to her because on the one hand I want to hate her, but I just can't, and on the other I really like her and care for her.

My work takes place in front of computer so I have no day/night cycle. I do have a ton of free time, if I want to have any (like finishing work before quite flexible deadlines), but I'm not sure what to do with it. I live in very suburban area that has no place to go in terms of going outside. I do not own a car or license (something I regret, but I live in super anal EU country where getting one is very time-, nerve- and money costly affair. I tried, twice, and failed). It's not like I really need a car where I live, but it's sort of a status symbol.

I have no hobbies that require social interaction, and I can't think of any of such I would like.

He was super depressed and suicidal when I met him, and he still is today. After a few months of chatting, he became super clingy and would have mental breakdowns and cry if I mentioned leaving/abandoning him. He once attempted suicide, and his breaking point was me becoming close friends with another guy.

For the past 4 years, I've been too terrified to leave. I've tried to be as supportive as possible and always encouraged him to seek help for his mental health. I've stayed up most nights until 1am with anxiety, worrying about if he's going to harm himself or not.

Here's where it gets absoloutely fucked.

Last year, I told Jack I had romantic feelings for him. I have no fucking idea WHY I did that. It was so fucking disgusting of me, knowing I'm lying about my identity. I wake up every morning and feel guilty. I'm disgusted and angry with myself.

And so Jack apparently fell in love with me after that. But I realized it was super fucked and have become super distant with him this year. Last week, I decided this was too fucking unfair to him. So I admitted I didn't love him anymore. He's really really REALLY fucking sad about it.

We haven't talked since. He said he needs time to heal because he still loves me. (Jack doesn't know I'm not who I claim to be.)

I'm so fucking terrified he'll harm himself because of this ""breakup"". I thought I was doing the right thing 4 years ago, by supporting a suicidal friend. But in actuality I've made things worse for him, and it makes me so sick to my stomach every single day.

695,"tl;dr - talking to bad guy for closure after filing report and regretting it (to an extent).

alright, so first, here's some backstory.  
on march 11, 2016, a man that we'll call chavez (dumbass nickname) lured me into the living room after i'd been sent to bed early. my dad and i had been play fighting, and it escalated when i couldnt breathe so i resorted to kneeing him in the balls to get him to stop tickling me. this was before i started calling him dad and when he was merely my mom's boyfriend, so there wasn't a moral barrier saying ""hey, u shouldnt kick ur dads nuts."" u can imagine how that went. i was sent to bed early, and having been \[younger than him\] at the time, didnt take an early bedtime lightly. i was broken because i didnt wanna miss out on anything since id gotten in trouble. chavez, after living with us for a good month, had gained my trust completely and preyed on that. he promised me that if i stayed awake, we could stay up and watch movies together after everyone went to sleep. i thought ""yea! that'll show \[dad\]!"" i thought it would b hella cool and sneaky bc i was a pretty good kid living in a (then) pretty bad environment. i didn't end up staying awake, but that was okay, because he woke me up and carried me into the living room anyways. we watched bob's burgers together because that was, like, o u r show. after that, he played jay and silent bob strike back (or something along those lines), and i remember drowsily watching the beginning of sin city. well, after he carried me into the living room and we were whispering, putting on bb, he motioned for me to lie down with him. i did so and didnt think much of it bc it was a small couch. where else was i gonna lay? he was my best friend even though he was a man and i was a little girl. he began spooning me. again, i dismissed it. i filtered out all ""irrational"" thoughts ab what was going on. he told me to intertwine my legs with him. i was uncomfortable, but i trusted him, so i did. it's not like i could go tell dad what was happening and why i was feeling uncomfortable the way i was.  
i'm zoning in and out through jay and silent bob, and i don't remember much about sin city other than its hella dramatic. i fall asleep for a while, get some rest, and wake up to his hands in my underwear, feeling me up and commenting in my ear about it. i don't know if he sensed id woken up or if he'd been talking to my unconscious body the whole time, but i know that in that moment, he whispered in my ear, ""you've got a little hair down there."" he whispered that into the ear of a vulnerable ten year old as she lay there, unable to do anything ab it. this was the kind of thing id only ever heard about on the news, and id never given it much thought. i wasn't prepared when it happened because i trusted him.  
i told myself to go back to sleep, and so i did. i slept into the morning, when i woke up to him cupping my hands on his dick, massaging himself with them. i was petrified.  
i didn't want for him to know i was awake, so i gently pulled my hand up to my chest. i was then laying on his, freaking out but frozen in place.  
i made an excuse in the morning to get up and i didn't come back afterwards. i dont remember anything else about march 12, 2016, other than him molesting me as i tried to sleep.  
i dont remember whether i stayed up with him again after that. im hoping i didnt. that period of time kind of became a blur in my memory.  
fast forward a couple months later when chavez no longer lives with us. i hint towards what happened, and then finally explain it to my parents. kind of. i was ashamed, having been a \[girl younger than him\] whod been assaulted. i thought it was my fault and i was disgusted with myself.  
about a year after everything happened, i came clean to my parents about everything. i couldnt say it all at once without breaking down, though, and i havent mentioned certain details since (comment he made whispering in my ear)  
dec 01, 2018, i report it to a counselor who then calls the cops down there to take my statement.  
he's arrested on 2/26/19 and then released on a 50000 bond that weekend, i think.

cut to now.  
i hadnt talked to him since he moved out, and hadnt seen him since may 08 2018 in a waffle house parking lot. we didnt interact.  
yesterday, my closest and best friend sent me a message ab his friend's story. he sent an article, and that got me thinking about my own situation. i couldnt get it off my mind. i went on his facebook, the page of the motorcycle club he used to belong to, etc. i was working myself up and ended up having to ask my mom to call the solicitor to see if there were any updates. i then worried until i was able to pull up the records (dm for link)  
i got my mind off it. my best friend then sent a request (per my asking) under his fake facebook. he gives me access to it, and chavez messages. i respond. he reads, questions my identity, and after ive worked his anxiety up and begun to feel horrible ab it, i tell him. i tell him my full name, and he remembers. i know he does. theres no way he couldnt. he leaves me on seen, either because he's in shock or because we legally cant be in contact. im assuming a mix of both, given that we'd never spoken ab the incident.  
after it happened, he would still ask me to plant my lips on his without kissing him (i was gullible and scared and listened. i still blame myself for that to this day), still tells me that perhaps we're meant to be in a parallel universe, etc. but we NEVER discuss that night.  
and here i am, three years later, coming out of the blue and dredging up old stuff.

here's where i stand right now.  
regardless of what he's done to me, i don't want for anyone to suffer in jail, let alone prison, for a stupid mistake from years ago. i hate that he's done it to other girls allegedly (hearsay), but he seems to be doing better and i have faith that he'll be better in the future regardless. i have immense regret for wrecking his life with the reports in the first place, and u can call me stupid for caring after what he did.  
i dont know. i dont blame myself anymore, but i dont feel like it was entirely his fault. maybe he wasnt himself that night or any other time he said/did creepy things?  
i reached out last night knowing that it could jeopardize my case against him. im at peace with that, though, because even though he never responded, he read my messages. he knows ive moved on and grown into a better version of myself because of it. he knows that in a fucked up way, hes kinda helped me as a person (even though he did way, way more harm)  
i need to see him. i need to talk to him. i need for this to be over for me, and i need for him to know that i could never forgive or forget, but that ive moved on. i want to thank him for wrecking my life, but shaping it into something better.  
am i in the wrong here?  
im so sorry for the long message. this is the first time that i've captured it all at once. i can't do that with the people i know, and i couldnt even say everything when doing my interview thing to the detective. i just cant reveal those little bits of my innocence that were stripped way too early.

I then paid the £23 for the Christmas do. The non-refundable Christmas work do. That’s 4 hours wages for me, a 7th of my weekly pay that I can’t get back. 

On Friday my girlfriend, who works at the same shop I do, was told that I’m doing a 1-9pm shift on the 7th of December and not the 9-5 that I was supposed to be doing. 

This is probably because I’m not liked much by management and because so many people have asked for the same night off that they thought I could just be given the shift and be done with it. 

So how do I ask for that 9-5 back without being incredibly rude about it?",23Nov2019,1

We want to buy a home and I just can’t see that happening in Southern California. Do we just apply for jobs out of state? But, do employers hire people who haven’t moved there yet?

713,"Hello. 
I don't know how else to phrase this, but it's what the title says. I often have intrusive thoughts about hurting people I love or see as vulnerable. Generally not thoughts of physical harm, but psychological. Like saying really cruel things, or doing things specifically to hurt them.

These thoughts are absolutely unwanted and an extreme source of anxiety for me. I'm often left feeling disgusted and wanting to turn those impulses on myself. It's absolute torture. These thoughts don't align at all with my own morality, so I'm not sure why they even happen. I don't want to hurt anyone, especially anyone I see as vulnerable. 

I consider myself an extroverted person but it makes me isolate myself in fear that I will actually hurt someone or that this makes me a bad person.

I can't seek therapy at the moment so it's very draining. I don't know what to do, I don't even know how to processs what this says about me. 

It really makes me hate myself and I don't know how to cope. Any experiences like this or advice?",23Nov2019,1
714,"To break it down, I am currently taking 3 AP classes:
- Economics (micro + macro a semester each)
- Psychology
- Calculus AB
I know many see these as some of the “easiest” APs, I just wanna say these are my first APs (I took none before junior year and BSed my assignments and stuff... I had a lot of spare time...)
I’ve always had straight As and although that may be a good thing, I am more concerned about my health habits. 

Sleep concerns:
I usually have to wake up at 7am to get ready for school, which starts at 8am. I think I usually sleep at 4 or 5. Earliest 2:30am and latest 5am. I stay up really late to work on taking notes for these classes, which I think have helped me earned As. I think I developed insomnia because even on weekends (like Friday nights) I sleep at 5am... Sometimes when I study, my alarm would suddenly go off at 7am and I’d just start getting ready for school.

Studying concerns:
The funny thing is, my teachers give out paper handouts (with vocab words and questions about the material,... etc) for us to fill in definitions while we read the textbooks. But I find that they lack too many details, which often appear on the tests. Because of this, I completely disregard the handouts and always take extra notes in my Google drive, divided into many different Google docs, one for each unit. I guess I’m a slow worker, since I can take hours to finish taking notes of modules. 1 module ≈ 2hrs minimum... 1 unit ≈ 5-8 modules... At this point I don’t even know if I should keep taking extra notes or just deal with the crap handouts... The point is that I am very indecisive and worried that I’ll miss out on details and eventually points on tests... Not only do AP classes stress me, I also have other classes such as computer science, mandarin, art, english,... These all have their own individual homework (those of which I have not done in a couple weeks). I have been neglecting these classes to keep up with my APs.
I don’t even know what’s going on in AP Calc AB and definitely need a math tutor... but I barely even have time... Which leads tooooooooo....

School involvement concerns:
My clubs are always after school (3pm) and ends at 4:15
Monday - Club + Basketball practice (I go home at 6:05pm)
Tuesday - Basketball practice (starts at 4:30pm and ends at 6pm)
Wednesday - Spirit Club (this ends at 4:45pm)
Thursday - Club
Friday - Club + Basketball practice

Like I said, I also need a math tutor. On top of that, I haven’t started prepping for the SATs yet. I found an SAT course at some school and their schedule is 5-7pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays... Which kinda overlaps with my schedule... I definitely don’t think I can self-study this because I need discipline.

Conclusion (sounds more like a rant but honestly it’s 5am and I’m desperate for help so):
This has been taking over my life and my biological clock and everything. I can’t fall asleep at the right times even when I try. I’m really afraid that these habits will have a toll on my life later on down the road, yet I still work hard. All I do during my free time is literally work. I feel like I have no time and motivation to do anything. All I think about are vacations and imagine way too often about how nice it would be to just laze around and sleep all day, without stress. I don’t want to go to doctors because I don’t want to spend money for advice on living. I don’t even hangout with my friends anymore and feel like I’m distancing myself from them. I don’t know how to fix myself, any advice would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you!",23Nov2019,1

He first approached me back in September and told me ""I like your dress"", ""I like your shoes"", etc. Then he came in again last week and just leaned down beside me and whispered ""Hey"" at me, then left, which was fine. But, he came in again today while I was sorting the bookshelf. I didn't realise it was him at first because I didn't look up but I heard some growling/humming next to me, and it kept getting louder. When I looked round, he stopped making the noise and said ""I like your top"", and I said thanks and walked to the other side of the shop to sort the women's clothes. He followed me again and said he liked my jeans and my shoes so I went to stand behind the till and I saw him leave. He came in again about 5 minutes later and asked me my name, so I told him I didn't want to give out that information and helped in the back for the rest of the day.

He has never bought anything and I always feel like he's sneaking up on me because he always scares me whenever he talks to me, but I might just be really unobservant. I think he may not be neurotypical because he always uses the exact same phrase every time he talks to me (""I like your \_\_\_\_\_\_"") and because of the growling.

So I (18M) was texting a girl in my class. We chatted back and forth for 3 weeks. I really liked her &amp; I’m pretty sure she liked me back.

It was hard to get over it as I haven’t really had this happen to me before &amp; didn’t really know how to deal with it. But I think I’m grand now.

A week later &amp; I barely talked to her since. She is 2 lockers away from me at school &amp; I don’t know how to approach it.

She thinks that I still want it to work out, but I’ve accepted that it isn’t.  I still want to talk to her in class &amp; at the lockers. But I don’t want her thinking that I haven’t accepted the rejection &amp; am desperately trying to change her mind

725,"First time sharing so I’m not sure if I am in the right place. My Mom is a janitor for a city. A few months ago someone started excessively urinating all over (the tops, sides) the urinals in the men’s public restroom. Apparently some people can be less accurate but this was more than that. It was like multiple people. My Mom’s coworkers go to the building after it closes but do their work and leave before she gets there. Every night she arrives to the same mess. It’s a public building so she chalked it up to a mentally ill person. It’s really bad. The exhaust fan broke and she couldn’t stand to be in there to clean. Her boss would not get it fixed until she said that she would not go in there anymore. A few weeks ago she went into the janitor’s closet and someone had peed (more than one person) in the mop bucket she uses. The closet requires a key to get into so the thought then became it was an employee(s) doing this. When brought up to her manager he said he would have the locks changed as “anyone” could have a key. This was discussed at a weekly safety meeting. My Mom shared that the next time any excessive urinating happens the police will be called and a DNA sample sent in. Since then, all excessive urinatjng including the urinating in the public bathroom has stopped. When I pressed her more, the people who work in the public building during the day never once called to report an issue with there being urine. They have called about soap dispensers being low but never about a filthy bathroom. So the mess seems to happen after they leave but before my Mom gets there. The only people who are there in the interim are three male custodians. Since it has now stopped what can HR do about it? She’s not close with these co-workers but never thought they would stoop to this level of harassment. Any suggestions?",23Nov2019,1

728,"Hey! So, I'm (f14) and this sounds like such a dumb ""it's not a phase, mom"" type of dumb teen problem but here we go:
My dad (m32) gets way too angry at me for the smallest things. I'll contradict him in the smallest way and it turns into a full blown argument. We had to have our elderly dog put down a week ago, and it was really unexpected. They found a mass on her the night before, rushed her to the emergency vet, and said we had a few more days, about a week, with her left.  She'd been there all my life so I was obviously in tears, I was hyperventilating and my dad wouldn't stop yelling at me and telling me to calm down. I told him he obviously don't understand and I'm sorry that I'm freaking out because the animal I've had all my life is unexpectedly dying. He sends me to my room, I block the door, and just cry. He comes in about 20 minutes later, apologises, and says he overreacted. This wouldn't be a big deal, but this kind of stuff happens at VERY LEAST every week. Either I say something or he does, he starts screaming at me for no valid reason, I run to my room and cry, and he comes and says he overreacted, cries, and says he won't do it again. But he does it. He does it again every week. At least. Last night, we received my dogs ashes along with a small baggie of her fur and a paw imprint. I have anxiety (I regularly go to a therapist now) and I had a panic attack for some reason when receiving the items at home. My dad wouldn't stop trying to tell me to calm down, breathe, making me stop fidgeting my hands, and he kept trying to embrace me. Everybody with anxiety knows this just makes everything worse and stresses you out more. He probably had good intentions but wouldn't listen when I politely asked him to please stop multiple times so I mouthed to my mom (F35) in the hall behind him ""help me"", he saw, and made me go to my room. I blocked the door because I really just wanted space at the time and to be able to work this out on my own. He comes in, says some bs about how I don't know what I need and that it's his job to help me, I say that he's done his part, and I thank him, but I just need to be alone right now. He puts his hands around my throat, choking me for a good 6 seconds. He never apologises, I cry more and he ends up just distracting me with stories of his stepbrother. My dad starts breaking down and crying whenever I try to confront him about any of the things he does, and I'm starting to think he's just manipulative and doing it on purpose. He always HAS to be right when talking to my mom and I and absolutely refuses to be wrong, and throws a fit when he does. I can't talk to my mom about it because she's too shy to do anything and just tells me to stop talking bad about my father. I'm done, they stress me about so much and are good parents otherwise, providing me with treats, nesscessities, gifts on holidays, and amenities, but mentally they hurt me so much. I need advice because I honestly don't really know what to do at this point. There's good days and bad days but I just really cant let myself be treated like this anymore.

He didn’t want to go down on me after I had literally just given him a blowjob and only did it for like a minute before immediately trying to have sex. It always hurts and I always feel embarrassed asking them to slow down because they don’t understand that if I’m not turned on it hurts. I know people will say, “if you don’t feel respected then don’t hook up with them” but that’s easier said than done. Most guys in college aren’t looking to date and that’s fine but the least they could do is be respectful and make a girl feel sexy instead of an object. Also so far not a single guy lets me sleep over afterwards, even if it’s like 4 am. It’s embarrassing coming back to my roommate at 4 am and being asked why I didn’t just spend the night.

And if that is not enough, even though I'm 19 I look barely 16... I have 0 facial hair too. I am just extremely ashamed with my face... I look like a fat 16 years old... This is my first year in college, things are supposed to be great... The way I look I simply can't imagine someone falling for me, I feel like I'm going to die alone... Lately I've been very depressed because of how I look and I can't shake it off.

We've been living paycheck to paycheck basically and don't have much of anything saved. It's kind of a double edged sword because the state won't help unless you have a job, but once I have a job we'll probably be out of the range of help even though I haven't been paid yet.

739,"I am 18 and have never been in a relationship. I've never kissed anyone, held hands with anyone, nothing like that. I never even talk with guys and they never talk with me. I don't know what's wrong. 
In the last few years I blamed everything on my shyness. I'm not a social type of person, and talking to anyone except my close friends had always been a struggle, but I have worked on it and I don't think my introvert nature is a big barrier now.
I know for sure that my appearance is not the problem, cause I've been told I'm pretty and I can see it despite my low self esteem. But objectively, my beauty isn't too conventional. Maybe many guys don't like that? I get compliments mainly from women. Yet I've been asked for a number on the street, and I knew boys interested in me when I was younger. But nothing ever happened and it started to really concern me. 
Finally, a few months ago, an old friend of mine asked me out. And despite the fact that we got along quite well, I postponed the date for a really long time, lying that I have some important stuff to do etc. Instead of just agreeing, I started to think too much: whether I liked him enough, whether it's worth the effort. When we finally met up I still wasn't sure of my decision. At the beginning of the date we had fun talking, but then he got a bit too touchy for me - he sat really closely, touched my hair and knees, which made me really uncomfortable (maybe even more than it should have). I don't think I really blame him, I guess that most of 18-year-old boys are as straightforward as he is. So at the end of the day it was a big no for me. Sadly, I made the mistake of meeting him for the second time, but the atmosphere between us bothered me so I made it clear that we didn't really 'click'. 
Then I started to wonder if something was wrong with me. Am I too picky? Do I think too much? Probably yes, but then another problem comes up to my mind: I think I never ever initiated a conversation with any guy IN MY WHOLE LIFE. And no guys talk to me as well (except for literally a few in the past). In school I have a female group of friends and it has always been like that. My guy classmates never approach me. When I was younger talking to guys always made me nervous, but later on they just stopped to interest me. (This lack of interest even made me question my sexuality when I was around 15. Now I'm 90% sure I'm bi, but I'm only writing about guys because they are more problematic for me. I live in a really conservative country where finding a girlfriend is nearly impossible, so the reasons for not having one are rather obvious). 
Why am I like that? I find guys attractive and I would like to be in a relationship with someone. I daydream about meeting the right one, you know, love at the first sight, finding a passion that we share, cuddling in bed for hours. I want to be close to someone emotionally, and then physically. Sometimes I feel I expect too much, but then I come to the conclusion that not my expectations, but the complete lack of interaction is my biggest problem. 
Why am I like that? I need help cause I'm confused by myself.",23Nov2019,1

I was feeling lightheaded until I stood up and this wave of paralyzing tingles overtook my body and the next thing I knew I woke up my vision on ground level. I fainted and managed to fall on my drawer then onto the floor breaking my fan and heater. I got up feeling panic and an overwhelming sense/need to throw up.

My neighbour's cat, Teddy, is terminally ill (cancer). Unfortunately, he is living the last few days of his life (neighbour's words).

746,"I 18 y/o, live in Flint, Michigan. My family is of Swedish heritage. We usually always travel to Sweden during this time of year and stay there for a week or more. We decide to do something different this year. Mom 45 y/o is a pharmacist and finally her job allowed her to be absent from work for almost 2 weeks. We took the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas (it was long planned I can note). However, my father could not go with us because his work did not allow him.

Not to mislead you, we went to Las Vegas on Wednesday last week and came home Monday night. The first two days were fantastic, we went shopping and explored the city (it was our first time). The very problem and the reason why I write to you is for what happened between Friday and Saturday.

On Friday night, my mom and I visited a famous nightclub called Hakkasan. It was a lot of people there, very wild and loud music. My mom and I danced and had drinks. I drink a lot, it's a habit, mom does not drink, but she did it this time for my sake and because we were in Vegas. She ended up drinking too much, and I realized she was really drunk.

We split when I went to the toilet, when I came back I saw her on the dance floor. She danced with a group of guys and girls, I went to have another drink, and there I met two friends, they were friends of my parents. I had a long conversation with them. It was late and I was going to get mom and go back to the hotel, but I did not see her, I looked and asked around, but no one could help.

Normally I would have searched nonstop and also called the police, but I was tired and had been drinking very much, I was drunk and went home to the hotel, hoping she was there. When I got there I didn't see mom, I was worried (I won't hide it) but I was so drunk I just fell asleep immediately on the bed.

I woke up on Saturday (quite late) from a phone call from my mom. I answered right away, and to my surprise it was a guy at the other end of the phone. He first asked who I was and after I confirmed it he told me that I shall meet him at an address which he then sent to me.

The address was also a hotel, it was pretty close to our hotel. I walked there, when I got there I saw my mother and a guy with her, they sat in the hotel lobby. I hugged mom and asked what had happened. The guy started telling me, his name was Tyrone, an African-American guy, a few years older than me. He told me he saw mom falling there in the nightclub on Friday night, and that she was incredibly drunk, so he helped her and took her with him to his room here in the hotel and allowed her to stay in the room until someone close to her called. Tyrone said he did not let her leave because she was too drunk. I replied that I had called about twenty times and no one answered, he said he did not hear the cellphone ringing.

I couldn't help but notice three girls and one guy (also African-Americans) standing farther away and smiling at me, it felt weird. We talked clearly and then I brought my mom and we walked back to the hotel. I asked her and she said she does not remember much. She was still drunk (I wish she never drank). I don't know, but it all felt weird. This Tyrone guy also looked bad, he looked like bad news. I just did not get a good impression of him, he wore a bandana and had torn clothes on. He looked like a real thug. I did not like him and that scared me.

It just did not feel normal for me to know that my mother spent a whole day/night with a guy like that and I don't know if his intentions were good. My thoughts are not racially motivated, but the guy looked like a liar and a thug (You can judge yourself). When mom stopped being drunk and I was able to talk to her, she said that she did not know and that she did not want to talk about it. It did not make it easier when two friends of Tyrone came up to me and asked if it was my mother who was the drunk woman who spent the night with Tyrone. I nodded in the hope that they could help, instead they smiled and walked away.

It's become a rumor, and I don't know if the guy did anything or if his intentions were good. My mother was really drunk and could barely walk and talk, she had no control over herself. I ask you strangers if you have any advice for me about what I can do and how to get my mother to remember what happened (if she doesn't already know about it but says nothing). Should I just leave this behind? What do you think about the situation?",23Nov2019,1

Context: I'm a straight dude and he (might) be a gay guy. Odds are you've heard this story before. Now recently, I have been put in a group presentation project with him (Let's call him Carl cause why not) and I'm the group leader of 5 people, myself included. Each presenter has to speak for at least 4 minutes on what ever topic that we (as a group) decide to do. I didn't realize until after we got into our groups that out of the 5 college students here I was the only one who was good at presentations. Everyone else is average to decent, except Carl.

Before this we were each had to give a single presentation and Carl was the absolute worst I have ever seen. At first I thought that it was because he had an intellectual disability (can't say which one but aspergers is in the realm of possibility) but to save you a rant longer then the great wall of China, he wasn't. I did not chew his ear out yet and plan on trying to give him tips after he gets his grade next class. He is very nervous and easy to read based on body language and speech patterns.

Ideally I want to turn him down lightly but I also don't want to potentially screw up the group presentation. I'm also against dropping hints because there's a chance he won't pick them up (I suck at hinting in general) and direct confrontation would risk making him feel extremely bad and more than likely result in my team hating me despite them throwing me into the leadership position.

So I'm young ish and been confused with my sexuality lately. I was sure for a while I was straight, now that I'm older not so sure! Which is fine, everyone falls on a spectrum and all that, but some years ago I've started to think I might be a lil gay (am a girl). Recently I've started to think I might be gayer than I thought. 

Well I was out to a restaurant with my family which includes my younger sis. This was after a month long stint at post secondary school where I've been working nonstop, eating nothing and barely sleeping, so I was really only half there  Weve been trying to open up to each other more often, so we were talking just us two when my parents had their own convo going and I mentioned I might be pan based on something she said (can't remember what now..) She said something along the lines of ""why do you think that? Did you finally hook up with a chick or something?""

Half asleep and totally caught of guard I just kinda said ""wellllll"" which she took to mean a cheeky ""hell yes!"" Well she starts freaking out in the ""hey congrats, good for you, how was it?"" way, not the Westboro Baptist Church way. She too was wondering if she might be a bit gay and we talked a bit about it before. I just kinda gave vague details that were half lies but she kept probing like ""was it your friend xxxx"" who is a bff of mine and pan. 

Here's the thing: I did not really hook up with a girl. She was a friend also trying to figure herself out, we talked about it, she came over for all of ten minutes, it was weird. Not cuz it was a girl, just because like, I am not this type of person!! I don't hook up like that and I felt really awkward about it afterwards. It was something I didn't at all want to share, not even with my best friend who knows everything about me. I told my sis it was a stranger I met, and that not much happened (which is the kinda true bit).

Here's another thing: I got raped last year by a new guy staying at my dorm and I'm still really uncomfortable of being intimate with really anybody. It was a ""started out consensual bit didn't end that way"" scenario. Whereas she she'd the type to go through guys every couple of months. She knows about what happened through oddly enough a similar scenario where we were sharing and she asked if I was still a virgin, and I said no, because after that day I wasn't. Im not at all over telling her that either. 

I feel so stupid and embarrassed blurring out something to my younger freakint sister that I really didn't want to say out loud yet and was kind of a lie, while already feeling like garbage from past work and upcoming work,in a RESTAURANT with my parents nearby possibly eavesdropping. They don't know at all that I was raped and don't know anything about my sexuality questioning, we just don't have that kind of a relationship and I'd be more uncomfortable than even now of they did know. 

Now idk what to do. I don't even know if posting this is a good idea of just something else I'll regret doing. I want to text her and tell her I wasn't comfortable telling her that and that it wasn't really true, but if rather she'd just forget I ever said it. She's not all that mature either since she's barely an adult. Im back home now and can't do any work even though I have no time to waste being upset and ashamed.

Most of the time when I have a creative energy spike I just get overwhelmed by the possibilities, there's so many little ideas but if I picked one I wouldn't know how to continue, so I always wish I had some kind of system. A place for every thought, a tool for every idea. Not literally, but it's what I want in the moment. Something physical, too.

So, two problems: 1. I struggle with finding a good place to work out what I hoarded, especially regarding physical x digital and 2. I feel like I can't take a first step with my thoughts and ideas. I'm lowkey embarrassed because I studied design and the ENTIRE course was about teaching yourself how to go through the creative process, but somehow when it comes to personal projects.. everything suddenly feels delicate, and sacred (which is a problem because I need to be reckless and chaotic).

Anyway I could really need some advice/tips/stories on going through the creative process, I'd love to hear what works for you so I can find something that works for me. Thanks, ciao!",23Nov2019,1
772,"So I love to smoke. I have chronic migraines, and weed is like a miracle when it comes to pain relief. I still live with my parents and don't have a car. They're almost always home and I don't really go out much. They're super strict and crazy against it, so I'm stuck in a weird spot where I have to wait for a rare opportunity when they're both gone to get it delivered. Any ideas on a way to get some without them knowing, or good excuses to push hem both out of the house for a few hours?",23Nov2019,1
773,"Not in a death sense, but in a drifting away sense. We never had a fight, she just got really busy and we stopped being able to talk as much, it continued and now we haven't spoken in months. I miss her so much but the few times I reached out, she didn't reciprocate so I guess we're done.",23Nov2019,1
